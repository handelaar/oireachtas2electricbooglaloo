      <P>(Clare) asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state whether, in respect of the cottages now in course of construction for the County Clare Board of Health under schemes sanctioned by his Department at Sixmilebridge, Quin, Corofin and Broadford, Co. Clare, he has decided that the rates of wages paid (30/- and 32/- per week) fulfil the conditions embodied in Section 8, sub-section (3) of the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932; and, if he has so decided, will he state on what information that decision was based, and from what source the information upon which it was básed was received.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 8 of the Act of 1932 places on any interested person the onus of showing to my satisfaction that rates of wages and conditions of employment generally recognised by trade unions at the commencement of a scheme are not observed throughout the erection of the houses.  If such is shown to my satisfaction I am precluded <Col N="2" /> by the section from paying subsidy in respect of the houses.  In the cases referred to by the Deputy it has not been shown to my satisfaction that the rates of wages and conditions of labour observed under the contracts are not at least as advantageous as those generally observed by trade unions.  I have already furnished to the Deputy all the information in my possession regarding the rates of wages paid.  The contractors state that these are higher than the rates generally paid.  Against this it is stated that the county council rate for unskilled labour is higher than the rates being paid by the contractors on the housing schemes, but it has not been shown that the county council rate is that generally recognised in the areas referred to. The Deputy will appreciate that I have no power of initiation under the section.  The question of a decision on representations made does not arise until the question of the making of a payment of subsidy arises.  It is open, therefore, to any interested persons to submit any further evidence which they may consider indicates that the rates being paid by the contractors on the housing schemes are not at least as advantageous as the rates generally <Col N="3" /> recognised by trade unions.  If it is so shown to my satisfaction, I must refuse to accede to any claim for subsidy which the local authority may make.</P>

      <P>Is not the Minister aware that in similar cases in Kildysart he already decided that the county council rate of wages was the rate which would be considered applicable to these schemes.  Is he not aware that he indicated to the Board of Health on that occasion that a subsidy would not be paid unless that rate was recognised and has he not information in his Department from people who worked on these schemes that the county council rate of wages was not being paid?</P>

      <P>(Clare) asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state (a) how many schemes for the erection of labourers' cottages under the provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1931, and the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932, have been submitted to his Department for sanction by the County Clare Board of Health; (b) how many houses it was proposed to erect under each scheme submitted; (c) how many schemes has his Department sanctioned; (d) how many houses it is proposed to erect under the schemes sanctioned; (e) how many of these <Col N="4" /> houses have actually been completed; (f) how many are in course of construction; (g) how many applications were received in the first instance by the County Clare Board of Health for cottages; and (h) on what dates were contracts signed in respect of the cottages now in course of construction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Clare County Board of Health submitted two such schemes and made two Compulsory Purchase Orders to acquire sites for the purpose, viz., the Clare County Scheme Order, 1933, and the Clare County Scheme (No. 2) Order, 1933; (b) it was proposed to erect 217 houses under the first scheme and 296 houses under the second scheme; (c) both schemes have been sanctioned by me; (d) it has been decided to erect 167 houses under the first scheme and 206 houses under the second scheme; (e) 21 houses have been completed under the first scheme and one house under the second scheme; (f) 89 houses are in course of construction under the first scheme and 32 houses are in course of construction under the second scheme; (g) the Clare County Board of Health received 933 applications for cottages under these two schemes; (h) I am in communication with the Clare Board of Health regarding the dates of the contracts of the cottages now in course of erection and will furnish this information to the Deputy as early as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied, having regard to the fact that close on 1,000 applications were received at the initiation of the scheme, that the Clare Board of Health is doing all that is necessary for the speeding up of the building of the houses, seeing that only 22 houses have been erected up to the present?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied that the Clare Board of Health has used all the expedition it might have used, but, at the same time, I know that they have had considerable difficulty in getting contractors for the erection of the houses.  Local circumstances of different kinds and the scarcity of skilled men have been offered to me <Col N="5" /> as excuses for delay.  Because of the fact that the sites for the cottages are scattered over a wide area, they find it difficult to get a contractor to take a number of them.  They offered each house separately for contract and, in a number of cases, failed to get a contractor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that at a recent meeting of the Clare Board of Health the secretary to the board reported that, in cases where it was intended that cottages should be completed on a certain date, the building of them had not actually been started?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether any instruction has been issued by the Board of Works or any direction given by any responsible official of the Department to the effect that no man is to be employed who has reached the age of 65 years; and whether, if such instruction or direction has been given it applies to men with service in the employment of contractors to the Board of Works vary ing from five to 35 years; and whether, in view of the hardship such action will cause, he will consider withdrawing this instruction or direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions 8 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>The answer to the first part of both questions is in the negative.  The normal age of retirement of employees engaged on Government work is 65 years.  The cases of all workpeople employed on Government buildings, etc., under the Board of Works, who have reached the age of 60 years, are, however, reviewed periodically to ascertain whether their capacity to discharge efficiently and without risk of accident the duties of their posts has been impaired.  Workmen may be retained after the age of 65 provided their capacity is not impaired and that there are special circumstances justifying their retention.  Each case is fully and sympathetically considered on its merits.</P>
      <P>Workmen engaged through the Schedule contractors are not employees of the Commissioners of Public Works. They are paid the existing trade union rate of wages.  The practice of reviewing the cases of such men when they reach the age of 60 years does not of course interfere in any way with the contractors' freedom to retain their services on other works if he so desires, and no question of pensions or gratuities from public funds arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarSeanDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, will he say if these periodical dismissals are in keeping with the distribution of labour scheme which was mooted in that Department some time ago, and, if so, are any of these men being kept on after the age of 65?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering this matter, will the Minister bear in mind that some of these persons have been <Col N="9" /> employed for upwards of 30 years, and have no other income except the wages which they receive from their present employers?  In view of the fact that they do not get any pension or gratuity, will the Minister undertake to ensure, in respect of their employment on behalf of the Board of Works, that they will be treated in the same way as they were treated formerly, namely, that they will be kept on after 65 as they would be by contractors in the ordinary course?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That would depend on whether they could efficiently discharge their duties: whether they could, as stated in the reply, perform these duties without undue risk of accident.  In regard to the whole question generally, I may say that all the circumstances of these employees are considered very sympathetically.</P>

      <P>The Land Commission have no power to alter or set aside the terms of this Deed of Trust, under which the power of allocating turf banks is vested in the Trustees; and if they were to acquire the bog it would still be subject to the rights of the parties concerned in the Deed.  But it is not necessary that the Land Commission should take over the bog in order to bring about division.  If the parties want the bog divided it is open to them to join in a Deed authorising the Trustees to divide the bog and to convey a separate plot to each beneficiary. The Land Commission could then authorise their Inspector to give assistance in the sub-division.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise a question as to whether Motion No. 8 is in order.  It appears on the Order Paper for to-day, Tuesday, and was circulated, as far as I know, not earlier than 5.40 p.m. on Saturday evening.  I am submitting that it is not in order to ask the House to discuss and to decide the Motion to-day.  Standing Order 25 says:</P>
      <P>All motions, to be put on the Order Paper for any day, shall be in writing, signed by a Deputy, and shall reach the Clerk not later than 11 a.m. on the fourth preceding day.  Any amendments to such motions shall be in writing, signed by a Deputy, and shall reach the Clerk not later than 11 a.m. on the second preceding day; provided, that by permission of the Ceann Comhairle, motions may be made on shorter notice.</P>
      <P>A motion relating to discussion was on the Order Paper for Wednesday, 20th June, 1928, when this question was discussed, and when I submit a precedent was established.  In column 1035 of the Parliamentary Debates, of that date, the Ceann Comhairle said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Standing Order 25 says:&mdash;&lsquo;All motions to be put on the Order Paper for any day shall reach the Clerk not later than 11 a.m. on the fourth preceding day.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He said &ldquo;That was Saturday in this case.&rdquo;  So that the fourth preceding day of that Wednesday in the opinion of the Ceann Comhairle on June 20, 1928, was Saturday, and the actual motion had been already submitted in draft on Friday and submitted in final form on Saturday.  The present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, then Deputy Boland, in column 1036, said: &ldquo;the motion was late too,&rdquo; and the Ceann Comhairle replied:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No, the motion was not late; it was strictly in time.  It was received before 11 o'clock on Saturday, and was circulated on Saturday.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After some discussion about an <Col N="21" /> amendment, in column 1038, the present Minister for Finance, then Deputy MacEntee said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Tuesday was the first preceding day.  Monday was the second; Sunday was a <i>dies non,</i> and does not count, and Saturday was the third preceding day, so that the motion, in order to be in order and to be permitted to be discussed here in accordance with the ruling which you have given relative to the amendments to that motion, should have been handed in before 11 a.m. on Friday.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Subsequently the Ceann Comhairle said in column 1046:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The situation appears to me to be that if the Standing Order may be construed quite properly to include Sunday, which is a point to be decided in any event, the common practice which has been followed has proved to be for the convenience of Deputies, and it is that motions for Wednesday are circulated on Saturday, and that amendments are accepted up to Tuesday evening.  I propose to allow the motion now to be discussed on that basis.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I submit that the ruling given then was that Sunday does not count, that it is a <i>dies non,</i> and I am making no submission contrary to that.  I am submitting that this being Tuesday, yesterday (Monday) was the first preceding day; Sunday, the second; Saturday, the third; and Friday, the fourth.  The motion in order to be finally discussed should have been handed in before 11 o'clock on Friday.  Not having been handed in and circulated, it is not now in order for discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before you rule, Sir, may I submit that if the Standing Order gives you power to accept this motion at shorter notice than that normally prescribed, you should not exercise that discretion in favour of the Government at the present moment.  I am assuming that this motion was not circulated in the ordinary sense, but was handed round on Saturday to the few Deputies who happened to be in the House after it rose.  Most of the Deputies only got <Col N="22" /> it yesterday morning, and therefore assume that this motion was not handed in before 11 o'clock on Friday, and, in the normal way, would not be in order for discussion to-day.  The only question that arises, I submit, is as to whether you should exercise your discretion.  I submit that there is no reason why you should do so, or abrogate the ordinary procedure in this matter.  I understand that on Friday morning a number of matters were declared to be urgent.  I am not aware that this was one of them.  This was a subsequent discovery of the Government. If there has been any loss of time in seeking legislation, from the Dáil or from the Oireachtas, the fault is altogether with the Government. There is no necessity therefore of further interfering with the ordinary rules of the House, by this exercise of discretion against ordinary procedure, if you so chose to exercise that discretionary power that lies in you. There were a certain number of things mentioned on Friday morning as being urgent, although we found out since that some of them were not quite so urgent.  As far as I recollect, this was not one of the things mentioned.  I do not even know what is the necessity for this.  I should have something further to say about the precise form of the motion if there is to be any opportunity afforded to us of discussing the question of urgency and if it is not to be merely the plea of the Government that it is because they are the majority that the motion must be accepted.  That is the only claim they have put forward during the past few days for imposing their will on the House&mdash;not because they are a Government, responsible to the House and to the people, but because they are a majority.  Before there is a further encroachment on the ordinary rules of the House, I submit, Sir, that you should not exercise your discretion in favour of allowing this motion to-day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good, Sir. The purpose of this motion is to enable the Imposition of Duties (Confirmation of Orders) Bill, 1935, to be disposed of to-day.  The Bill proposes to confirm four Orders.  When an Order is issued I imagine it is issued under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act.  Under sub-section 2 of that Act that Order has to be confirmed by being embodied in legislation within eight months after the making of the Order.  The first of these Orders in the Bill deals with an increase in the rate of Excise duty on pig carcases.  That Order was made on the 30th November last, seven months ago.  Personally, I fail to see what the urgency is that that matter should be disposed of to-day without any chance of reasonable discussion.  The second Order deals with a Customs duty on ink.  That Order was issued on the 4th January, 1935, six months ago.  I do not know how the urgency now arises or, if the matter was in any way urgent, why the House was not given an opportunity of discussing it earlier.  The third Order deals with the Customs duty on cutlery.  That Order was issued on the 15th February, 1935.  The Government have until the 15th October next to confirm that Order.  The duty is in force at the present moment; it is continuing and will continue in force without any interference until the 15th October, and the Government have until then to introduce the necessary legislation dealing with that.  The fourth Order deals with the Excise duty on tyres. That Order was issued on the 12th April, 1935.  The Government have until the 12th December this year to get the necessary measure passed through the Dáil that will confirm that Order if they wish to confirm it.  I submit that, as regards reference Nos. 1 and 2, the Government themselves have been responsible for any urgency that arises now, and the least thing that should be allowed is a reasonable time for discussion.  With regard to the other two: in the one case the Government have until the 15th October, and <Col N="24" /> in the other case they have until the 12th December, and I am completely at a loss to understand what is the reason for the urgency in connection with this Customs duty on cutlery and the Excise duty on tyres on this particular date, the 9th July.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to submit further, Sir, that, on the question of exercising such discretion as you have, you should also take into account the extremely drastic powers of the original Act of 1932.  In fact, one of the considerations put forward at that time was that there would be consideration by the Dáil of anything done under that Act.  I submit, Sir, that this particular motion, that has been submitted, does not give any such opportunity for consideration. Further, I should like to draw attention to the circumstances and to the, at that time, unique Closure Motion that was adopted.  I think you yourself, Sir, indicated at the time that the particular kind of motion by which these things were passed on that particular occasion was without precedent. That was on the principal Act which this Act now seeks to implement.  I submit, Sir, that all these considerations are very relevant to the consideration why this motion should not be allowed to be taken to-day.</P>

      <P>This is a motion which is quite in order, and which seeks to enable the House to come to a decision as to whether or not a certain thing should be done on Tuesday, July 9th.  The precedent referred to by Deputy Risteárd Ua Maolchatha differs from this motion in at least one important point, namely, that it dealt with a question of hours, but did not specify the business for any day.</P>
      <P>If the terms of this motion and the question of notice are at variance, one or other must prevail.  Their relative importance has to be weighed.  The Chair stands on the principle of allowing the House to come to a decision on the matter contained in the motion.  I have accordingly exercised the right conferred on the Chair by Standing Order 25 and accepted the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="25" /> This decision is not based on any plea or consideration of urgency.  In reply to the further submission made by Deputy J.M. O'Sullivan as to the drastic character of the governing Act, I have only to state that the Chair does not consider the merits of legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest, Sir, with all respect, that amendments have always been in a different category from substantive motions. Secondly, I suggest that, very often you, Sir, have fixed a certain day&mdash; sometimes even Monday&mdash;for accepting amendments, but I submit that that is largely because the Government insist in going on with the business on a Tuesday, knowing that if that was insisted upon, there would be no possibility of submitting amendments.  I take it, Sir, that you rule that, so far as motions deciding the business of the House are concerned, practically no notice at all is necessary.  I am not questioning your ruling, Sir.  I only want to know whether or not that is really the force of your ruling, because I want to understand it.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy got the permission of the Chair to make a further submission.  The Chair has ruled and that ruling covers this case only; that is, that, weighing the relative importance of the question of notice and of a motion asking the House to decide what business it would do on a specified date, the Chair has exercised the privilege conferred by Standing Order No. 25, and has accepted the motion.</P>

      <P>Again, Sir, in connection with the question of accepting amendments to the motion, to which you referred, I should like to ask your permission to move an amendment the nature of which, if I have your permission, I will indicate now.  It was inconceivable to me that this order, not giving the three days' notice, would be accepted.  I did not put in an amendment in connection with it, because I did not think it was possible that that <Col N="26" /> would be done in view of the nature of the Bill.  The Bill is a two clause Bill with a schedule, and there are four items in the schedule.  The motion says in paragraph (2):</P>
      <P>The Committee Stage of the Bill shall be proceeded with immediately upon the conclusion of the Second Stage and the Question necessary to bring to a conclusion the proceedings in Committee on the Bill shall be put forthwith and successively, and shall be decided without amendment or debate.</P>
      <P>I wish for permission to move an amendment which will delete that part of the section which prevents amendment or debate on the Committee Stage, for the reason that there are four items here&mdash;a duty on pig carcases, on ink, cutlery and tyres&mdash;and unless an amendment is accepted deleting one or other of these the House is constrained to do in respect of pig carcases what it does in respect of ink, what it does in respect of cutlery, and what it does in respect of tyres.  The motion is so framed as to completely prevent the House from making use of any intelligence that it may have in dealing in a discriminative way between cutlery and ink or between tyres and pig carcases. I should like to read the amendment which I wish to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In Section 2 to delete the words &ldquo;and the Questions necessary to bring to a conclusion the proceedings in Committee on the Bill shall be put forthwith and successively, and shall be decided without amendment or debate&rdquo; and in Section 4, after the word &ldquo;Question&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;or Questions.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I desire to move that amendment, not because I object in any lesser way to the forcing of this motion by reason of the ruling that has been given, but because the House will be forced to an absolutely unintelligent and silly action if the actual terms of the motion are passed without that amendment.</P>

      <P>I should like to direct attention to one point in regard to this motion.  The essence of the motion is to conduct certain business by a certain hour.  That, in substance, is all that concerns the decision of the House.  In this particular case, when an amendment is not now accepted to a motion which is technically a day late, a number of the members of the House&mdash;and perhaps the House itself&mdash;are prejudiced by it.  Members may possibly agree with three of those items and disagree with the fourth, and they are afforded no opportunity of having that point of view stressed.  The objection is not to conducting business in a specified time; the objection is to the form in which we are forced to conduct that business&mdash;which is quite a different thing.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That in the case of the Imposition of Duties (Confirmation of Orders) Bill, 1935:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  The Second Stage of the Bill shall be the first Order of the day on Tuesday, July 9th, 1935, and the proceedings on that Stage, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 7 p.m. on the said day by putting from the Chair forthwith the Question: That the Bill be now read a second time; and after the said hour no Question shall be put from the Chair on any amendment to the motion for Second Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.  The Committee Stage of the <Col N="29" /> Bill shall be proceeded with immediately upon the conclusion of the Second Stage and the Questions necessary to bring to a conclusion the proceedings in Committee on the Bill shall be put forthwith and successively, and shall be decided without amendment or debate.</P>
    <P>3.  The Fourth Stage of the Bill shall be proceeded with immediately upon the conclusion of the Committee Stage, and the Question necessary to bring to a conclusion the proceedings on the Fourth Stage shall be put forthwith and shall be decided without amendment or debate.</P>
    <P>4.  The Fifth Stage of the Bill shall be proceeded with immediately upon the conclusion of the Fourth Stage and the proceedings on the Fifth Stage, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 9 p.m. on the said day by putting from the Chair forthwith the Question necessary to bring the proceedings to a conclusion.</P>
    <P>There is only one fact which it is necessary to mention in connection with the Bill which is brought under this motion, and that is that it must be law by 29th July.  It is, therefore, absolutely necessary that the Bill should pass through all its Stages to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary says that this Bill must be law by 29th July.  Why?  Let us take the Emergency Imposition of Duties Order, No. 66, imposing an excise duty on tyres.  It was issued on 12th April, 1935.  I have already pointed out that, under Section 2 (1) of the Act which empowered the Executive Council to make that order, that tax stands, and will continue to run until 12th December next.  What does the Parliamentary Secretary mean by saying it must be law by the 29th July?  With regard to Emergency Imposition of Duties Order, No. 58, it was issued on 30th November last&mdash; seven months ago.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary say why it was not discussed before this?  It was not discussed before this because that Emergency Imposition of Duties Order, <Col N="30" /> which last year began by an Order issued on 15th May, a few days after the Budget statement of the Minister for Finance, is on a par with the Cement Order which was made on 14th May this year.  After the Budgetary statement of 1934, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture went to a back room and they put an Excise duty on every pig that was killed in the country, for the purpose of collecting moneys in revenue, hiding completely from the people of this country that those moneys were going to be raised during the year, although their Budgetary statement was made a few days before the issue of the Order.</P>
      <P>They raised during last year £289,441 as a result of an Emergency Imposition of Duties Order issued in May, increased in October, and increased in November of last year. But it was part of their Budget scheme, issued a few days after the Budget statement was made, just as the £68,000 they propose to get on cement this year is part of the Budget scheme this year, the Order having been made the night before the Budget statement. They talk of urgency.  Why this matter is being dealt with in this way is that the Ministry are not prepared to stand over their proposals here and have them examined properly.  Look at the extremes to which they are prepared to go to obscure what they are doing by means of these Orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government one day last week allowed us the privilege of seeing a list of the business they wanted to get through before the summer recess. These items were run through and we figured out how much time it would take to deal with these matters in an effective and orderly way.  Here we have a motion to deal with one of them and the motion solemnly sets down that the Second Stage of the Imposition of Duties (Confirmation of Orders) Bill will be the first business the Dáil will begin to-day and it may run on until 7 o'clock on the Second Stage and until 9 o'clock on the other stages.  That is, the guillotine is put on to confine the discussion of this measure to five and a half, or, you might say, six hours.  The Government <Col N="31" /> were informed that our opinion was that it would take three hours to put the measure through all its stages, conducting the business in an ordinary and orderly way, and yet they introduce a guillotine motion.  This is a measure which they have been told will take three hours to discuss in an ordinary and orderly way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>They do it in a way that will prevent a short discussion which will expose what the position is, but which, at the same time, will enable the Minister for Finance to stand up here in indignation and say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We have been obstructed; a terrible lot of time has been spent on finance business this year and it is necessary to introduce very strict and harsh guillotine motions in order to get the business through.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>By this particular guillotine motion to-day the Ministry are preventing a reasonable discussion on four individual items, some of which are of considerable importance.  They are preventing the Dáil taking a decision of them on their merits.  The Government are attempting to paint a picture that they are being obstructed in their business. They give six or six and a half Parliamentary hours to a discussion in this kind of way of a measure that they were told, I think, on Thursday night, would in our opinion take three hours. The excise duty on pigs could have been discussed at any time since 30th November last.  Why was it not so discussed? The imposition of duties on ink could have been discussed any time since the 4th of January.  The excise duty on tyres can be discussed any time between now and the 12th December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why does the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Finance want to force through this discussion on tyres without allowing the House to come to a decision on tyres?  If the House votes against tyres here it must vote against ink and against cutlery.  Suppose the House says it cannot trust the type of Ministerial mind that puts on a <Col N="32" /> cement tax on the eve of the Budget this year, that puts on an Excise duty on pigs on the morrow of the Budget last year for the purpose of bringing in revenue that it will not disclose in the proper way to the Dáil it is getting.  Suppose the House says it cannot trust that type of mind not to continue the tax on pigs when the Pigs and Bacon Bill comes into operation and the House decides that it is not going to sanction the continuance of the Excise duty on pigs.  The point is, we cannot take a decision on such matters without declaring that we are not going to have a Customs duty on ink.</P>
    <P>I wonder what amount of sincerity there is in the protestations of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that he wants to assist Irish industry in a reasonable kind of way when he consents to the mixing of these four items and introduces a resolution that prevents the House discussing them one by one.  Some of them could have been discussed during the last six months and others could be discussed any time during the next six months.  They have set aside twice as much time under a guillotine motion for the discussion as they were told it would take to discuss the items in a reasonable and a sensible way. These are the facts.  It would be a pity to say anything else that might tend to obscure them.  Possibly it is because the facts that would be brought out would be very striking and would be very informative for our people that an attempt is being made to have them smothered and smoke-screened by guillotine resolutions and shouts of &ldquo;obstruction.&rdquo;  The Government have made themselves utterly silly and have made this House and you, Sir, silly by putting you into the position that they make you exercise your discretion and allow work to be done in this particular way.</P>

I submit, Sir, that this motion is part of the whole scheme to stifle discussion.  The Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Little, and one of the Ministers spoke about obstruction.  I want to ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether there was any obstruction by me or by the Opposition in that part of the Finance Bill of which he had charge in this House.

      <P>The main delay on the Finance Bill was due to the fact that the Minister for Finance refused to give any information on any section of the Bill.  That Minister refused to answer any question as to the effect of the new duties imposed, or as to the effect of the additional duties imposed, or as to the amount of <Col N="37" /> money which was expected to flow from these duties, or as to whether any additional employment and, if so, how much would be given.  The Minister treated the Chair and the House with the utmost contempt. This motion now is an attempt to prevent this House exposing to the people of the country the enormous load of taxation which the Government is placing on the people.  That is as clear as anything can be.  The members of the Government Party, from the President up or down, have been for the last 13 years continually blathering about freedom and democracy and here we have them now trying to put through this motion.  I could quote from memory some of the statements made by the President and the Government Deputies on a former occasion, when they were in opposition and when closure motions were introduced here.  I remember how the Minister for Finance used to work himself into a state of hysteria and the Minister for Industry and Commerce in his best cross-roads style used to thump the desk.  That was before he acquired the rather nice style he sometimes adopts now in laying down the law.  I can imagine the row that would be created to-day if the position were reversed and if the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the President were in opposition.  I submit, Sir, that this motion is part of the general scheme to stifle discussion and that is because the Ministers cannot stand over all this taxation.  The Minister for Agriculture is very keen to see that the Vote for the Department of Agriculture would be guillotined also.</P>

      <P>Personally, I regret that the alternative suggestion was not adopted; because by merely agreeing to amend the guillotine motion we could have a discussion on the Committee Stage of this Bill, the only stage on which a useful discussion could take place, and still, the guillotine motion being otherwise intact, the Minister could have been sure of his Bill without any further agreement with the Opposition.  That that suggestion was not readily adopted by the Government I can only put down to a desire on their part to avoid having a discussion on the Committee Stage.  We have heard a good deal of talk about obstruction on this Bill.  I think I took as much part as any Deputy in the debates last week.

      <P>I will say again that the Minister for Finance was most ostentatiously engaged and interested in matters not before the House.  The Minister was supposed to be in charge of a Bill.  I suppose it was inevitable that the speeches made by the Opposition were incomprehensible to the Minister because the Minister set himself out not to listen; but I was hoping to get the points we were making into the heads of the other Ministers.  I suppose it is only time and experience will teach the Minister anything.  These things are gradually teaching his followers.  I hope the <Col N="39" /> House was impressed by the case made by the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Little, for this motion.  I have very rarely heard a more convincing case than he made for this motion. One could nearly follow everything the Parliamentary Secretary uttered in reading the resolution.  He read it out well.  But the two minute speech he made in favour of it to show why this invasion of parliamentary right should be allowed must have impressed everybody in the House.  It could be summed up in one sentence&mdash;in fact, I think he himself confined it to one sentence: this matter is urgent.  So far, at least, as three items in the Bill are concerned, the statement was demonstrably false. Remember, it is not the first time within seven days that the Government have falsely put before this House a plea of urgency.  I admit that the Parliamentary Secretary to the President was following the noble example in that respect of the Government as a whole.  Last week they put forward the same plea of urgency with as much foundation as the Parliamentary Secretary now put forward the plea of urgency in his able speech supporting this invasion of the rights of the House. In his effort to prove how necessary it was to prevent discussion, he was able to suggest that a Bill dealing with one of them, and only with one of them, had to be law by the end of July.  That was as far as he could go. Was that any reason for curtailing discussion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put it to the House last week: has the Seanad ever shown any desire to obstruct the Government in connection with financial matters of any kind? If the Government and the majority Party in this House have any doubts of the attitude of the Seanad in this respect, I suggest that they should look up, just to enlighten them, the attitude taken by the Seanad on the Second Reading of the principal Act, the Act referred to in the Bill now before the House, the Act of 1932.  The Emergency Imposition of Duties Bill left this House on 15th July.  It was described by many members of the House as a Bill by which the Government <Col N="40" /> took to themselves most extraordinarily drastic powers, powers almost incompatible with democratic control over finance.  That Bill went before the Seanad and the same objection was made to it there.  The Seanad had a right to make suggestions.  Did they hold up the Bill?  That Bill left this House on 15th July and was back in this House on the 22nd July with Seanad recommendations.  So far, therefore, as three matters referred to in this Bill are concerned, the case absolutely lacks foundation and the statement that this is urgent is demonstratably false.  As Deputy Mulcahy demonstrated quite clearly, so far as the fourth is concerned the plea also is false.  Therefore, it is merely a desire on the part of the Government to show that, having their famous majority which they always boast of, they can force things through this House even when it is not necessary to do so.</P>
    <P>One thing was promised when that extraordinarily drastic Act was going through this House.  The Minister for Finance said that there would be an opportunity always for the Dáil to review; that any action taken by the Government would be always subject to review and subsequent confirmation by the Dáil.  This is the review!  Anybody who follows intimately the business of the House knows that, so far as the details of financial legislation are concerned, barring a few of the larger taxes, the really fruitful period of discussion is the Committee Stage. The Committee form of discussion is easily the most useful form of discussion, and any effort to curtail that, especially in matters of finance, tends to reduce the financial powers of this House to a mockery.  I presume that is the reason why it is precisely the Committee Stage, the stage during which useful discussion might have taken place, that is ruled out in this particular method by the Government.</P>
    <P>Under that particular Act, the Government have power to impose Customs and Excise duties.  But, certainly, at the time the suggestion was that there would be ample opportunity of examining anything done in that way.  But the Government have deliberately determined that there will <Col N="41" /> be no such opportunity.  The only one of these four duties in question for which urgency can be at all claimed might have been discussed any time within the last seven months if the Government wanted discussion.  But the Government do not want discussion of their taxation.  The Government never wanted it and particularly do not want it this year.  That is the reason for all these drastic motions&mdash; to cut down discussion on taxation, because it is precisely on taxation that the general policy of the Government is being shown up.</P>
    <P>Further, you will remember, Sir, and possibly the House may remember, the plea put forward for the Principal Act, and particularly for the rushing through of that Act under conditions at that time without precedent in the House.  I think you yourself, Sir, pointed out that there was no precedent for what was being done on that particular occasion.  You will also remember, Sir, that it was precisely the Committee Stage that was cut out then, too, without discussion.  So we had an Act conferring drastic powers on the Government carried through the House without any discussion in detail, and now we have a Bill framed under that Act and imposing taxes on the people being put through this House without any possibility of discussion in detail if the present motion is accepted. You will remember, Sir, what the plea for urgency was&mdash;that the Bill was necessary to wage the economic war. The plea was that weapons were necessary and that they might have to be forged and used quickly for the better waging of that war.  You will also remember, Sir, that most of the discussion on that occasion, on either side, was not on the Bill, if I might say so; it was on the economic war.  The discussion on the original Act ranged round the economic war and the methods that were necessary to carry it to a successful conclusion.  Now we have an Excise duty of 10/- on pig carcases which we must believe was imposed under an Emergency Order on the part of the Government in order to enable us to carry on the struggle against Great Britain: and that from a <Col N="42" /> Government that promised quite definitely, both here and in the Seanad, when that Bill was going through, that there would be most careful consideration of everything that was done, and nothing, of course, would be done to interfere with the rights of the House in the matter.</P>
    <P>We were told that only what was necessary for the winning of the economic war would be carried through.  That was the way the powers conferred by this Oireachtas upon the Government were to be used. But how an Excise duty of 10/- on pig carcases to be paid by everybody under the relevant section of the Bill will help to win the economic war is not quite clear.  But the next duty is one of great importance in connection with the economic war, seeing the amount of correspondence that this Government is engaged in with the British Government, and that is the Customs duty on the importation of ink.  Now the economic war is safe. We can write no more with British ink; we must reply to all proposals to end the war in Irish ink.  Possibly the next set of duties brings us nearer the war front not in the modern meaning but in the ancient meaning of warfare. That is the imposition of a Customs duty on cutlery which in fact might mean the prohibition of the necessary arms for carrying on the economic war.  What other connection it has with the economic war is not quite clear.  Then there is the imposition of Excise duties in relation to certain tyres.</P>
    <P>The original Act was framed purely for the purpose of the economic war; this is to be passed without any possibility of adequate discussion. The only means for discussion is, the Second Reading and Committee Stages.  The Government practically gets out altogether of the debate on the Committee Stage.  Consider how the original Act went through.  Consider the views, as seen in practice, of the Government Party, as to how they would use their famous majority.  The House need not be surprised.  We were told that to the abolition of the <Col N="43" /> Second House certain precautions would be attached.  It has been pointed out that there is no reason why the Government should go back on that.  Their action to-day, and last week, makes it perfectly clear that they have no conception whatever of the rights of Parliament or the rights, to examination in detail, of any of their proposals brought before the House.</P>

We are told it is only a <Col N="44" /> case of pig carcases, and that the Bill is not urgent.  That may be true, but Deputies opposite have sense enough to know that you do not bring in a Bill for every duty you impose.  Deputy Mulcahy's argument appears to be that you should bring in a separate Finance Bill for every duty and have it fully discussed.  It is admitted that there is urgency in the case of an Excise duty on bacon.  I think we were told that we wanted to stifle discussion on this matter.  The Excise duty on bacon was discussed in my presence on three occasions, and it was discussed also, I believe, in my absence on the Budget. It was discussed at all stages.</P>

I said when the Bacon Bill was going through that I expected that these Boards would come into existence on the 1st of July, and that as soon as they were going, we could consider the abolition of these duties, because there would be a different way of financing bacon when the Boards were set up.  I think I made it clear that the method of financing was to be this Excise duty, until the Boards were set up, and that after that, when the Boards were set up it would be different.  It would appear that it is necessary to repeat these things at least three times before Deputies opposite get a grip of them. I explained the recent duty was imposed because the home market was so good that we had to take something off the people selling to the home market in favour of those selling to the foreign market.</P>

      <P>You have spent three months in discussing it and nothing else, since the Dáil reassembled after Easter.  Nothing was discussed on the Budget or the Finance Bill but agriculture, and, so far as the Opposition's contributions to agriculture are concerned there is no farmer in this country would benefit one halfpenny by them.  That is not what the Opposition want.  They feel they might benefit themselves, but even that is not coming off.  We are prepared to give time for agriculture or any other Estimate &mdash;or subject, because the Estimates must go through this week&mdash;and if any Deputy in the Opposition wants to put down a motion with regard to agriculture, we will give time for it.  It is not a question of being afraid; it is a question of putting the Government's financial business through within the time limit.  If we have an Opposition here who have taken very much longer on the Finance Bill and on the Estimates than ever was taken before, in any year during the office of the last Government or this Government; if we have frittered away our time here on these discussions, the bringing in of these particular motions now cannot be helped.  When the financial business is through, however, we have no great objection to sitting on for as long as the Opposition want to discuss all these questions.  If they want to put down motions we will discuss them and probably, with our majority of two, we will beat them, because it is the first time a Government sat in this House with a majority and that must be realised.</P>

Neither does anybody else in that Party want it and they can, of course, say afterwards that the debate was closured.  We do not mind whether they do or not; it does not make the slightest difference.  So long as the Opposition have these little grievances they will be more satisfied, and that is about all we can say for them.  As I say, the Committee Stage could have been taken fully in that case.  If the Second Stage went through in two or three hours, another two hours at least could have been given to the Committee Stage and to discussion in detail, but the Opposition do not want that.  They want to have the argument that they were prevented from doing it.  Let them have their argument, because this motion is going to be taken now.  They say that they offered to take this Bill in three hours.  We are offering them six hours or giving six hours and withdrawing the motion, but that does not suit them.  That does not suit their propaganda at all. It is propaganda they are looking for and not an opportunity to do business here in an intelligent way.

      <P>The futile speech which the Minister has delivered to the House and which actually caused even the poor Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to roar with laughter when he heard some of the arguments advanced, may be very excellent from the point of view of amusement for the Minister, but it is a shocking thing that a Minister should get up and put forward arguments so absurd that even his own colleagues cannot restrain their risibility at the absurdity and audacity with which the Minister puts these matters before the House.  This is a tremendous departure from the principles which have always not merely in this Assembly, but in all legislative Assemblies, regulated the conduct of business.  The main thing an Opposition must do; the main thing the Dáil must do; and the main thing which <Col N="49" /> any Parliamentary Assembly must do, is to keep its eye on finance.  The one way in which an Executive can be kept in order is through finance, and here we have to-day, for the first time, a deliberate effort on the part of the Ministry to cut down discussion on finance and to prevent their Bills from being even amended or amendments upon the Finance Bill discussed.</P>
      <P>That is a new precedent and it is a bad precedent.  If the deliberate effort of the Executive Council is to destroy, by ridicule, the Parliamentary system in this country, they can adopt no better method than that which they have adopted.  We have the statement from the Minister for Agriculture: &ldquo;I will put off my Estimate until next week.&rdquo;&ldquo;Right&rdquo; comes the answer from our side and then we have from the Minister: &ldquo;Oh, no; I will not do that at all; I will give you a day for a discussion in the air, but my Estimate must go through under the closure, because, except under the closure, I dare not face my shortcoming and my failures and the wrongs I have done to agriculture here being freely discussed.&rdquo;  I am not surprised, and I do not think anybody in the country is surprised, at this exhibition of cowardice on the part of the Executive Council.  The Executive Council dare not have a discussion and they will be all driven back to the same condition of dumbness as the dumb Minister for Finance who cannot stand over his own measures.  Because that is a wrong to the House, and wrong to the traditions of the House and because it is creating a bad precedent, and, therefore, wrong to the future of the House, and of the country, I think this should not be passed.</P>

The date of the introduction of the Bill is on the back of it in the statement &ldquo;Ordered by Dáil Eireann to be printed 26th June, 1935.&rdquo;  This is the Bill about which there is so great haste.  We are to take all Stages without discussion or amendment after the Second Stage has been taken and pass it through the <Col N="50" /> House.  The first imposition in respect of the vital clause of this Bill, in so far as time is concerned, was last year. On 15th May, 1934, under the Statutory Rules and Orders, there was imposed a duty of five shillings on every pig carcase.  This was raised on 30th November and now the Minister is in a state of hysteria because there is some criticism of his method of doing business.  This Bill was introduced on 26th June, a fortnight ago, and we are told that there is such extraordinary haste about it that it is unreasonable for the Opposition to criticise this motion and to point out that it is not good business that a motion, which has been accepted by the Chair practically a day, to use technical language, before it ought to have been accepted, should be put to the House and the House told to take it or leave it.

This was the Minister's statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As soon as this Bill becomes operative, which I do not expect will be sooner than the 1st July, so far as the Department of Agriculture is concerned, it will ask for no further levy to the Revenue Commissioners.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That levy was put on at our request in order to increase our export bounties fund, and, although collected by the Revenue Commissioners, it was earmarked for that purpose.  We do not intend to ask for any further levy in that way.  I think the Minister for Finance has no intention of raising revenue in that manner, but I could not tie him to that, in respect of any future Budget.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister was kind enough to tell us that you cannot introduce a specific measure in respect of every imposition. Under the old law which operated until the House was made a mockery of, taxation was imposed at one period of the year.  On one occasion only, owing to exceptional circumstances arising from what was called the depression which affected major countries as well as minor countries, an imposition was made on the people in October or November, 1931.  That was discussed openly in the House and the case made for the imposition was opposed by the Minister and his friends who were then in Opposition.  Why should questions of taxation not come before the House always?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Because he is ashamed of it.  You have not alone the normal Budget brought in here about April or May, but in addition, you have all these peculiarities arising out of the economic war, emergency duties, and so on.  What are they?  They were supposed to enable them to fight the economic war, to enable the Ministry to deal with a special situation.  The Emergency Imposition of Duties Act states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Executive Council may, if and whenever they think proper, do by Order all or any of the following things, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>.........</P>
      <P>(d)  impose, whether with or without qualifications, limitations, allowances, exemptions or preferential rates, an Excise duty on any specified day and for the purpose particular matter or, as from any of such duty require the taking out of a licence for the doing of any particular thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then eight months ago this Bill was brought before the House and passed <Col N="53" /> into law.  The Ministry come here now and tell us that, having enacted that law owing to their incompetent handling of public business, it has not yet become operative.  Why was it that they could not have introduced this measure two months ago, as well as on the 26th June?  What prevented their doing so?  Nothing except the fact that they were too busy about other things, probably sending despatches to Great Britain, or probably examining the political situation here and our pronouncements to see if any political capital could be made out of them on public platforms.  Now they are ashamed that they have to come in here and answer for these Star Chamber methods of taxation.  What do they amount to?  The Executive Council meets after dinner and the Minister for Finance suggests that some of his colleagues should bring in some new proposal for a tariff which will bring in some money, and enable them to meet a deficiency somewhere.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce comes along and says: &ldquo;Put a tax on packets of cutlery, and give me power at the same time to enable people to import these goods free of duty.&rdquo;  The Minister for Industry and Commerce also says: &ldquo;Put a tax of 7½ per cent. on tyres, and if any deficiency should arise, when we come to the exemption orders we will impose a tax at the highest rate which can be charged to meet that deficiency.&rdquo;  These are the things we should like to have discussed in this House.</P>

      <P>There are four items in this particular imposition, and we have no explanation of the haste with which this measure is brought before the House.  The real cause of that haste is the neglect of the Government in introducing the measure.  There is also the fact that the Ministry has turned to this method of imposing taxation. Why not introduce these impositions to the House in the manner followed in the last ten years?  We are all quite willing to admit that the Government knew very little about methods of government in their early days, but they have been three years at it now and they should know the amount of taxation required for any particular matter.  Certainly, in this case, this guillotine motion and the whole conduct of the Government in connection with this business, show more clearly than anything else they have done the utter incompetence of the Ministry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ministry have accused us of being obstructive and have expressed a desire to facilitate us in the passing of legislation in a speedy manner.  This motion is a confession that the Government are in no hurry whatever to get through the legislation to which it refers.  We have the extraordinary spectacle of the Parliamentary Secretary bringing in this motion to-day, while in another capacity&mdash; that of Whip to the Government Party &mdash;he was aware that an agreement had been come to with this Party to put <Col N="55" /> through all the stages of this Confirmation of Orders Bill in three hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the Chair accepted the plea of urgency. How did the Government Party propose to prove urgency?  They knew that this Bill would be completed in three hours and they brought in a guillotine motion which they knew would be resisted by Deputies who had any conception of their rights and liberties.  A guillotine motion, such as has been put before us to-day, would not be accepted without resistance by any Opposition.  I do not know at whose instigation the motion was put down&mdash;whether by the Parliamentary Secretary or as is probable, by the Minister for Finance, who sat throughout a long debate on the Finance Bill without offering any guidance or explanation to the House.  Because Deputies on this side tried to elucidate the provisions of that Bill, they were accused of obstruction.  The Ministry now say: &ldquo;Let us withdraw this motion and you will have more time.&rdquo; I noticed that, for the first time in three days, Ministers got up to speak on this motion.  The Minister for Agriculture spoke for 15 or 20 minutes and I do not think he spoke directly to the motion.  He and the other Ministers were silent when they ought to be speaking on Friday and Saturday last. This is a motion which the House could not be expected to accept without protest and which we could not allow the Ministry to put through without expressing <Col N="56" /> a very strong opinion.  It would limit the rights of Deputies and it would give power in the future to curtail discussion on every item and reduce the House to a farcical position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee) Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the objections to this Motion can be placed under two main heads.  In the first place, it is contended that it does not give the Opposition sufficient time to discuss the measure to which it refers. Secondly, it is contended that it does not give the Opposition an opportunity to propose amendments to the Bill. Let us see what substance there is in these objections.  Deputy Bennett has made the point, which was made by previous speakers on the Opposition Benches, that the Opposition Chief Whip, who may be presumed to be in a position to speak for his Party, indicated to the Parliamentary Secretary that, in his opinion, this Bill would be disposed of inside three hours.  If it had not been for the time which has already been occupied in discussing the guillotine motion, the Opposition would be given not merely the three hours which they thought would be amply sufficient to discuss all the provisions of the Bill but an additional three hours, if they desired to take them.  I think that the Opposition are not likely to convince anybody, here or elsewhere, that, so far as the Government are concerned, adequate time to consider this measure is not being given.  The second objection&mdash;it has been stated by Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Mulcahy&mdash;is that the Opposition are not given an opportunity to put in amendments to the Bill.  You, Sir, have indicated that you had already conveyed to Deputy Mulcahy, who is Chief Whip of the Opposition Party and is responsible on behalf of his Party for the conduct of these matters&mdash;that up to a late hour you were prepared to accept amendments to the Motion which would make amendments to the Bill possible.  The Opposition refused to avail themselves of the latitude which you proposed to give them and, accordingly, they themselves prevented the moving of amendments here which would enable some of these <Col N="57" /> orders, the confirmation of which is not so urgently required, to be deleted from the Schedule and considered in greater detail at a later date.  Not only that, but the Minister for Industry and Commerce intimated early in the debate that the Government were prepared, provided they got an assurance that the Bill would pass through all its stages to-night, to discharge the order for the motion and to allow the debate on the Bill to proceed in the ordinary way without any guillotine and without any time-table. If that offer of the Government had been accepted, the Opposition would have been in a position to move amendments on the Committee Stage to delete from the Schedule any of the orders to which they took particular exception.  In that connection I may say that, if our offer had been accepted, I was prepared to agree that certain of these confirmation orders might stand over to a later date.  Accordlingly, there is no substance in the second objection which the Opposition has raised to this motion.</P>
      <P>On the general question as to what has rendered a motion of this sort essential, it is only necessary for me to put before the House some figures which will show that last week much more time was taken on the discussion of the stages of the Finance Bill then before us than had been taken previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection, and with particular reference to the point made by Deputy Cosgrave that the Bill was only introduced on the 22nd of June last, I should like to point out that if it had not been for the fact that the whole of the Government's programme was deranged by the prolonged and obstructive debate which took place on the Committee Stage of the Bill, it would have been possible to have taken the Second Stage of this measure very early last week: it would, in fact, have been possible to have taken it on Tuesday of last week, and to have found, inside the ordinary Parliamentary time-table, the three hours which several Opposition Deputies have already told the House would have <Col N="58" /> been more than sufficient to consider the measure in all its details.</P>
    <P>But everybody knows what happened last week.  Possibly, to-morrow there will be an opportunity for going into it in greater detail, but last week on the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill four Opposition Deputies got up and talked as often as three and four times on the sections of that Bill: and carried through a sort of filibuster to prevent the Bill passing through Committee, and in that way endeavoured to upset and derange the general Government programme.  If it had not been for that obstruction there would have been, as I have said, ample time.</P>
    <P>In that connection I think it is desirable that the House should understand exactly how flagrantly the Opposition wasted the time of the House.  It is usual, in connection with the Financial business of the year, to discuss the Resolutions on which the Finance Bill is framed at great length, both as Resolutions and, subsequently, as sections of the Bill.  In 1928 the total time occupied by the then Opposition on the Financial Resolutions and the Finance Bill amounted to 22 hours 21 minutes; in 1929, the time occupied was 28 hours and 5 minutes; in 1930, the time occupied was 18 hours and 25 minutes; in 1931, the time occupied was 26 hours and 10 minutes; but in 1932, when a new Government came in with a very heavy programme which, undoubtedly, would have made very heavy demands on Parliamentary time; when the Opposition changed, and when, instead of having a patriotic Opposition in this Dáil, when instead of having an Opposition which was anxious only to help the then Government in power to do anything that would improve the economic position of our people; when that Opposition was replaced by the then Cumann na nGaedheal Opposition, at once the amount of time devoted to the Finance Bill of the year jumped up to 77 hours and 35 minutes.  Then there came the General Election of 1933, and the then Opposition realised what the view of the people of this country was in regard to the attitude which they had exhibited here towards the Government <Col N="59" /> then in office.  As a result of that election the Opposition returned to the House in a more chastened mood, and the debate on the Finance Bill of that year occupied 36 hours and 15 minutes.</P>
    <P>In 1934 a little more time, but not an unreasonable amount of time, was taken in discussing the Finance Bill, the time spent on it being 40 hours and 50 minutes.  But, on the Finance Bill of this year, the Opposition having, I suppose, forgotten the lessons of the General Election of 1933, went back to its old recalcitrant and obstructive attitude, and in this year, notwithstanding the fact that the Government had a very heavy legislative programme: a legislative programme, for instance, which included the Pigs and Bacon Bill, a Bill to regulate, control and to organise upon sound lines the bacon industry in this country: a programme which included Widows' and Orphans' pensions, a social measure so long and so anxiously awaited by the people of this country, a legislative programme which included the Conditions of Employment Bill, the first attempt to frame a decent industrial code for the workers of this country, and when, in addition to these measures, we have also awaiting us a Bill to amend the Unemployment Assistance Act and a number of other Bills which will come before the House in due course: the Opposition, animated by a desire to hold up these measures and, as I have said before, to derange the Government's programme in the hope that when the time came for the Dáil to adjourn we should be compelled to drop some vital elements in it, reverted to its old attitude of obstruction, and so, in this year of 1935, the amount of time wasted, for very largely wasted it was, in the discussions on the provisions of the Finance Bill, jumped up to 74 hours and 40 minutes.</P>
    <P>I have said the time &ldquo;very largely wasted,&rdquo; and my justification for that is to refer any person who is sufficiently interested to take the trouble of going back and reading the debates, to what took place here last week.  On every section of the Bill, as <Col N="60" /> I have already said, we had three or four Deputies getting up asking for information which could, and should, most properly be elicited by way of Parliamentary Question.  When we were in Opposition; when we were preparing to debate the Budget proposals for the year, we took the trouble of putting down in advance the Parliamentary Questions which would elicit the data which we thought essential in order that we might be able to make a case against the proposals in the Bill and be able to criticise them properly.  That has not been the attitude of the present Opposition. They do not take the trouble to do that but they ask a multitude of questions on the Bill in the vain hope that a Minister will make a slip; that he will simply, because he has not had the time to refresh himself upon the various points of detail, give them some inaccurate information out of which they can make a debating point and waste the time of the Dáil.  We had one Deputy getting up and telling us, like a babbling Hans Anderson, on every occasion on which he spoke, the fairy tale of the Minister who went into a certain workman's house in Dublin and, seeing such and such a thing on the dresser, the table, or on the wall, decided to tax it.  In every speech of that Deputy that sort of picture was painted.  Now what was the purpose of that repetition except obstruction?</P>
    <P>Then we had Deputy McGilligan's speeches.  I do not know how far the question of the personal appearance of Ministers or Deputies can fitly enter into the question of a tariff upon ornamental glassware, but on that particular proposal in the Finance Bill the greater part of one of Deputy McGilligan's speeches was taken up discussing whether or not the Minister for Finance might be properly classified as a gargoyle.  I confess I could not see the relevancy of that speech to the proposed tariff on glassware, and I did not feel called upon, in discussing that particular item, to get up and plead that Deputy McGilligan, who, apparently, suffers from a Narcissus complex and may ocacsionally <Col N="61" /> see a reflection of himself on these benches, and the Minister for Finance are not birds of a feather, and that he ought not to take me for his second self on the Government Benches.</P>
    <P>Similarly we had Deputy John Marcus O'Sullivan in the same mood. I have already drawn the attention of the House to the intellectual content of that speech as reflected in one of the Dublin newspapers which published a report of its most striking passage in quotation marks.  I have no doubt that that particular gem of Deputy O'Sullivan's oratory will figure in one of the classical collections of Irish Bulls, when he, appealing to the intelligence of our people, stated that a man waking up in the morning, &ldquo;provided he had a ceiling above him&rdquo; would see that every slate on the roof was taxed.  I certainly did not feel that I was called upon to analyse that argument or to try to find a sufficiently strong refutation of it.</P>
    <P>That is how the Opposition spent not merely all the normal Parliamentary time last week, but, in addition, the prolonged sitting on Friday, and a very large part of the special sitting on Saturday.  Then they come along and tell us that one of the reasons why we are anxious to get this guillotine motion through is in order that we may avoid a discussion of the Estimates. I think that is the last point that has been made in this debate on the guillotine motion, that we were rushing this Bill because we did not wish to have a discussion on the Estimates. After this Bill is disposed of, the next business on the Order Paper is the Estimates, and the first of the Estimates can be taken as early as the Opposition will permit.  Up to 9 o'clock we are in their hands.  This Bill is urgently required because it must be law by the 29th of July, and we are anxious to give the Seanad ample time to consider it.</P>
    <P>If the Opposition will change from the obstructive attitude they have taken up to the present, and allow this Bill to go through this House expeditiously, we can get down immediately to a discussion of the Vote for Law Charges.  Deputy Morrissey who <Col N="62" /> has left the House, and who is scarcely ever in it, to help it to come to a right conclusion on any matter, said we were putting all these things on the Order Paper in order that we might avoid discussion of the Law Charges.  The matter is now in the hands of the Opposition.  They can allow this Bill to pass expeditiously through all stages, and we will proceed immediately to discuss the Vote for Law Charges, and all the other matters which were referred to by Deputy Bennett, the Votes for Old Age Pensions, Local Loans and Agriculture. If the Opposition do not depart from their obstructive attitude, and if we have to utilise all the time prescribed by the guillotine resolution in discussing the Bill before the House to-day, and the Finance Bill and the Appropriation Bill which will be before it in due course to-morrow and Thursday, we will still be more than generous. We have to get the Appropriation Bill through before July 31, otherwise more Parliamentary time is going to be wasted in taking a Vote on Account and a Central Fund Bill.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is disposed of early on Thursday the Opposition can still have additional Parliamentary time to discuss the Vote for Agriculture.  There is no advantage which they would get from a discussion of that particular Vote immediately, that will not be available to them, and that they cannot have on the special day which we are prepared to give for consideration of that Vote.  If they want more than one day they have the remedy in their own hands.  They can shorten discussion on these Bills.  The business which we hope to dispose of during the balance of any Parliamentary day that may be left will be confined entirely to the Estimates.</P>

      <P>I think it would have been better for the Minister if he brought the yellow book with him instead of having spoken on this occasion, because nobody could have made a greater defence of the attitude of the Opposition last week.  With regard to the statement made about the Finance Bill in 1928, when 28 hours were spent on it, that was the occasion on which the Minister made the famous speech that I often quoted in this House, in which he stated that the country could not stand the taxation.  The Estimates then amounted to £20,000,000.  In 1935, when taxation is £8,750,000 higher, I maintain that that is sufficient justification for the attitude which the Opposition took up last week.  The Minister for Agriculture talked about propaganda. I do not know what the country is going to call it, but it is the duty of the Opposition to bring before the people the policy of the Government regarding taxation.  I challenge the Minister for Finance to say if there is a single article going into a household that does not bear taxation.  The Minister stated that the Government wanted to have this Bill through the Dáil before July 29th.  Was there any occasion on which this Party did not accommodate the Government in getting Bills through?  The Minister said that he was anxious to get the Bill to the Seanad.  Was there ever such hypocrisy, seeing that this Government is going to do away with the Seanad on the grounds that it is of no use to the public?  The real meaning is that Ministers have become aristocrats, and that they want to get away on their holidays.  There was a time when the Dáil was about to adjourn for Christmas when Deputy Corry and other Deputies said they did not want to go home until the employment and other problems were settled. The Government should be honest.  We have always been honest with the people, and the people are getting to know that.  If proof of that is wanted it was given recently in the Galway <Col N="64" /> election.  The people are beginning to think.  It is our duty to give them something to think about and to bring home the real position to them.</P>

The Minister said that some Deputies had spoken three or four times.  I say that they were justified in trying to get the Minister to become vocal, but he was so interested in the yellow book that he could not find time.  He had so much contempt for the Opposition because he knew he could not stand up to the arguments which they wanted to bring before the people.  I desire to protest. This is a downright attempt on the part of the Government to prevent the Opposition criticising their Bills.</P>

      <P>It is a source of gratification that the Minister for Finance has found his voice.  Personally, I am gratified.  We are so accustomed to looking at a silent Minister for Finance that, possibly, this motion, if it did nothing else but make him speak, was worth while putting down.  The Parliamentary Secretary made a bad case for the urgency of this measure.  The Minister for Agriculture made a worse case, and the Minister for Finance failed altogether. The real joke about the whole thing, however, is that, while we have down here a guillotine motion which is depriving this House of the opportunity of discussing this Bill in the ordinary way in which Bills are discussed, we have the solicitude of the Minister for Finance and of the Minister for Agriculture about the Seanad getting due and proper time to consider it.  Is it not a great joke? The Seanad that we are about to abolish: the Second House that is going to be abolished, that is a nuisance&mdash;that House must get its full and proper time for consideration and discussion <Col N="65" /> of this Bill, but this House must not get it.  And this Seanad, this Second House, is the House that we scorn, that we regard as a nuisance, and that we are going to abolish!</P>

      <P>Exactly.  The Minister for Finance told us quite a lot about the things that the Government are contemplating doing.  There is one thing, however, in addition to all the things the Minister for Finance said, which he did not say, and which is a complete justification for the attitude of this side of the House in regard to the Finance Bill, and that is that this country is pauperised as a result of the Government's policy; and the Minister knows that.  We had nothing from the Minister to-day, as we had last year and the year before, about the revenue being buoyant.  The Minister trotted out the number of hours spent on the Finance Bill in 1928, 1929, 1931, 1932 and so on; but he did not enumerate the difference between the revenue-earning items in those years and in this year.  Does the Minister for Finance think that if there are half a dozen or a dozen revenue-earning items they are going to be disposed of in the same way as if there were 100 or 200 revenue-earning items, as is the case to-day?  Is there not complete justification for the attitude of the Opposition on the Finance Bill to-day in view of these facts?  It is ridiculous to urge, because a certain length of time was spent in going through the Finance Bill item by item, that it is a reason this particular Bill should be rushed through in this particular way.  There is no argument behind that.  The Minister goes further and tells us&mdash;the most astounding thing of all&mdash;that he was quite prepared to consider delaying the operation of all these items if we took the offer made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The extraordinary thing about that is that, before he made that offer, he had got down&mdash;or at least the Parliamentary Secretary had it down&mdash;&ldquo;that the Committee Stage shall be put forthwith and successively and shall be decided without amendment or debate.&rdquo;  The Minister took the precaution <Col N="66" /> of putting that down first, before saying that if the Opposition had accepted a certain type of offer made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, he was quite prepared to forgo certain things.  He has got a poor way of convincing anybody, by putting that motion down, that he was prepared to forgo certain items in the Bill which is coming before the House.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Bill governed by this particular motion, there is one item which is being put forward as an item of urgency, and that is, the pig carcases.  That is the one item.  I should like to know from the Minister for Finance what was the meaning to be attached to the Budget statement here on the matter of the levy on pig carcases?  Is it really a necessity that that should come up now and that levy be continued in view of the statement the Minister made here in the House in connection with the levy on pig carcases? My recollection is&mdash;I am subject to correction here because I am only relying on my memory for it&mdash; that he was going to lose a certain amount by this levy if he did not enforce it but that he was going to make it up by a levy on foreign wheat and on hydro-carbon oils.  I presume I am correct in that.  So that, if my recollection is correct, the Minister for Finance is collecting this on the double at the present time.  We were to have these taxes on wheat and hydro-carbon oils to make up for the proposed relaxation of the tax on pig carcases, but instead we have the two running.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Agriculture told us that this tax was a matter of absolute urgency.  Now, this tax was put on originally as a war measure.  The four measures which we are considering here to-day, and which we have got to closure in order to put them through the House, are war measures.  The Minister for Finance <Col N="67" /> told us that the Government was prepared to give us a greater period for discussion of those four items than we really wanted.  If that is so, why was the motion put down and why was it put down in such a way that we could not offer an amendment?  The Chair refused to take an amendment to that motion.  That is so.</P>

We endeavoured to put forward an amendment, but the Chair would not take an amendment.  I am not criticising the Chair or its rulings.  There is no use, however, in anybody else telling us that we could have had a complete discussion on this and have amendments to it.  We could not.  I think it will be admitted by everybody that a discussion <i>in globo</i> upon such things as an Excise duty on pig carcases, a Customs duty on ink, a Customs duty on cutlery and an Excise duty on tyres, cannot get any kind of individual or discriminatory discussion here in the House while they are taken in that way, and while we are prevented from having a Committee discussion on them.  The whole matter appears to me to be an effort to stifle discussion, and anything that the Minister for Finance would say or attempt to say about the position of the discussion here last week and what ensued as a result of the discussion on <Col N="68" /> the Finance Bill is certainly not convincing as far as the allegation of obstruction is concerned.  The Minister knows perfectly well that there was no obstruction last week.</P>

I suggest to him that he would be well advised to take the opportunity of replying to his critics at the proper time and that in that way he would save the time of the House.  No reasonable case has been made for the motion before the House and, that being so, the fact that these four items cannot be taken and discussed in the way in which we should discuss them is evidence that there is really something behind the Government's mind in stiffing discussion in that way.</P>

      <P>It is quite in keeping with the policy of the Government, which is gradually being disclosed, that this House should be gagged on every important measure, and that questions concerning the House and the people in the most vital degree, and affecting them in their very nearest interests, should be put through this House under a guillotine motion by which every attempt at amendment criticism, every attempt at amendment or any suggestion of amelioration or improvement is made impossible.  As I say, it is quite in keeping with the whole policy of the Government, both now and in the past.  Their policy is to tear down, discredit and belittle the institutions of this State.  Heretofore there was a system of two Houses. The Governor-General is quarantined; the Second House is annihilated, and this House is now to be gagged.  The more important the measure which should receive consideration the more keen is the Government majority on gagging the minority.  We had quite recently a delicate situation concerning this House&mdash;the nominating of a Parliamentary Committee to inquire into the deeds and acts of a Government <Col N="69" /> Department.  Surely it was a matter in which the very fullest discussion and freedom of expression of opinion should have been allowed. Surely it was an occasion on which the rights of the political Opposition, although in the minority, should have been respected.  But that was the occasion selected to gag the Opposition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Very well.  I was pointing out that the action of the Government in this particular motion is analagous with the action of the Government on every vital question which has lately come before this House.  When there was a motion before the House to appoint a Select Committee, an occasion on which one would expect the very fullest and freest discussion, the discussion was gagged and the matter was forced through by a guillotine motion such as we have here to-day.  The Finance Bill, which affects more closely than <Col N="71" /> any other Bill in the legislative year, the lives and the homes of the people, was also forced through by a guillotine motion.  Here we have a motion before the House to impose Customs duties and Excise duties on very dissimilar articles, and we have a guillotine motion to stifle discussion and link together in a common vote such dissimilar articles as motor tyres and pig carcases.  The situation which confronts us is that if an individual or a group of individuals is in favour of one duty and opposed to the other three, in order to get the one, they have to stomach the four; or if a person is in favour of three and opposed to one, in order to get the three which he is in favour of he has to vote in support of the whole four. The linking together of such dissimilar articles as ink, cutlery, pig carcases and motor tyres, in a common Bill, in a race against the face of the clock, is reducing this House to something more contemptible than a farce.  I say that that particular action and the intention behind it are consistent with every action of the Government Party both since they assumed office and prior to their taking up Government positions.  We are asked to rush this particular Bill through by some hour this evening. The Dáil does not matter, or the people who will pay the taxes do not matter.  The only thing that matters is the time, and the convenience of the civil servants.  Having destroyed the Seanad and made a humbug of the Dáil it is gradually coming out that the only people who matter and the only people who are to receive consideration in this State are the civil servants behind the scenes.  If they are slack in their administration, if they are behind-hand with their work, or if they are lazy in their duty, the way to get over that is to inconvenience the Dáil and inconvenience the public by rushing a Bill through so as to convenience the civil servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One portion of this Bill arises out of a Bill which was introduced in the Dáil on 12th December, and which <Col N="72" /> passed through the Dáil and Seanad on 3rd May.  In connection with the most urgent portion of this Bill, which is made the carrier pigeon for the other three parts, it is not necessary that it should become law before the 30th of the present month.  Yet, the tyrants in office decide that with the assistance of the gag it must be put through this House in all its Stages by 9 o'clock this evening.  Statutory requirements give up to the 30th July.  But statutory requirements can go by the board.  The necessity for a discussion can go by the board and consideration for the people affected can go by the board merely because some Minister or somebody behind the scenes presses a button and decides that it would suit his convenience better to rush the Bill through in a day and that it would be better in the interests of those behind the scenes to stifle discussion by preventing amendments and so abolishing the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I remember when the Minister for Finance and his colleagues occupied these benches the howl that went up if the closure on any question was suggested.  That howl would bring down the roof if the financial matters were closured through this House. The most urgent of the four measures affected by this Bill requires that it should be law by the 30th July.  The three remaining are required by statutory obligations to be put through the House by December.  About November or December would comply with the legislation and the necessity of the situation.  What is the excuse and what is the justification for linking those four items together in a common closure motion?  The statutory time allowed for three out of the four items mentioned in this Motion to-day is until December next, and from this to the 30th July is the period allowed for the implementing of the fourth item. Yet, by nine o'clock to-night they have all to be through this House.  There is to be no amendment of these Bills and no opportunity for an amendment is allowed.  Judging from the way things have gone latterly in this House I am strongly of opinion that it is only <Col N="73" /> taking part in a farce, bolstering up dishonest humbug and indulging in dishonest hypocrisy for any of us of the Opposition to attend here.</P>

      <P>We will put in the Secretary's Department and make them the real Government and the only thing that matters.  We will put a row of departmental secretaries there in the Government front bench. We can even discard that front bench and let the row of secretaries legislate from office to office over the telephone. What is the point in going to the expense, trouble and turmoil of appointing elected representatives of the people to come here if any Minister in a moment of pique and relying on a docile majority can decide that the most important legislation can be taken in so many hours and that there will be no opportunity for discussion and no opportunity for amendment?  If they can decide that months can be changed into days and days can be changed into hours and hours can be changed into minutes, why should we go to the expense and trouble of having elections to this House?  If what has been happening here for the last few weeks is to continue to happen in the matter of important legislation and the more rapid use of the guillotine is to continue to prevail, then I think the more quickly we hand over the administration of legislating for this country to a group of civil servants the better.  Let us get rid of the farce and get rid of the humbug; let us be honest about it&mdash; we are approaching the time when, if civil servants prefer their holidays, discussion is to be gagged here and legislation is to become a farce.  The elected representatives of the people through the selfish agreement of Government Ministers are to be over-ridden in order to suit the convenience of the civil servants behind the scenes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to remember that when he is legislating in this House he is also establishing precedents. The precedents that have <Col N="74" /> latterly been established in this House are precedents that are dangerous in the extreme.  When we have come to that state of affairs in the country that Excise duties, Customs duties and the big Finance Bill of the year have to be forced through Parliament by the aid of the guillotine and the gag there is something wrong with the policy that has the country in its grip and there is something wrong with those directing that policy.  I think it is as much in their interests as it is in the interests of the Opposition and in the interests of the people outside that matters such as this should be open to the fullest and freest discussion and there should be ample opportunities for the amendment of Bills such as these.  I am sorry to see, when this closure motion is under discussion, every member of the Labour Party absent from the House.  It was always a matter of principle with the Labour Party in the past that they would object to the closure on any subject. They objected to it on principle.  I wonder if when they became the tincan tied to the donkey's tail that they sank that principle as well as many others.  It is well known that the more wicked the donkey, the noisier will the tin-can be.  It may be a sign of a change of front to observe the silence of the Labour Party here to-day.</P>

      <P>Like other Deputies, I would like to get this in perspective &mdash;we have a very drastic guillotine Resolution here to-day.  It is admitted that the notice for the Motion we are discussing was one day late, that is, the notice for it was one day too short, but the Ceann Comhairle has exercised discretion in favour of the Government. The Ceann Comhairle admitted here last week that a discretion would be exercised in favour of the Government, but he said that a limited discretion would be exercised in favour of the Opposition and that an amendment could be received up to 11 o'clock this morning with regard to this Motion. There are Deputies in this House who did not get this notice until this morning. The ruling of the Ceann Comhairle seems to be that it would be in order for Deputies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not discussing the Ceann Comhairle's ruling.  I am discussing what arises out of it.  I am not questioning the ruling.  These are the facts.  We have had a standard set up here last week, and that standard must be accepted until it is knocked down.  That standard is that if a measure is proposed as urgent it is for the majority of this House to declare whether that measure is urgent or not. In deciding this point last week the Ceann Comhairle said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;He thought it would be a matter of impertinence on the part of the Chair to decide a majority of this House could not give a decision of that sort.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We have it now that when anything is urgent, because there is a necessity for speed, that the view of the majority of the House will prevail and not the judgment of the Chair.  The Chair evades the responsibility of deciding that matter.  The Ceann Comhairle will give a favourable exercise of his discretion on matters relating to the Government, but he will not exercise his discretion so favourably towards members of the Opposition.  Now, this decision is in relation to Finance matters.  It has been commented upon in the Press during the week-end. There is a very elaborate procedure in this House, as there is in other Parliaments, with regard to finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That procedure was not put together yesterday.  Its growth is back in centuries of history and took place at a time when the only power the common people had against those who ruled them was to have some control over what these rulers did in regard to taxing the people.  There were wars, revolutions and uprisings of people in many countries in relation to that matter, until finally you got the system that we copied here as being what human wisdom in other countries declared to be the best to meet the varying circumstances against the tyranny of rulers in regard to taxation. So we have the elaborate procedure <Col N="76" /> of financial resolutions, a general debate immediately, and detailed expression of opinion on the details of the Financial Resolutions; the report of such Financial Resolutions and the bringing together of these Resolutions further into a Finance Bill which goes through the ordinary stages&mdash;the Second Stage where the principle is discussed&mdash;the Committee Stage where every detail is exposed, dissected, criticised, and so on.</P>
    <P>Into that procedure of financial control the present Government has introduced a new system whereby, under the cloak of what is called Emergency Imposition of Duties, tariffs, taxes and exactions upon the people get rushed in.  They must be confirmed by legislation within a certain period of months.  But all that happens meanwhile is law, and the taxation, even though afterwards declared to be oppressive, is nevertheless imposed. So the financial procedure has been weakened, weakened by Government activity in the way of legislation, and it is being weakened further now by this establishing as a standard for rule in this House of the majority view in regard to urgency; and further, I suggest, weakened by the exercise of a sympathetic discretion on the part of those who control order in this House in favour of the Government and not so sympathetically in favour of the Opposition.</P>

      <P>I have a considerable sense of grievance over that and propose to discharge it at an early opportunity, but I consider that I am entitled to refer to the reactions of that when I am discussing the breakup of the financial procedure here.  I have said what I intended to say and I hope it has not been out of order. We have that elaborate financial procedure thus broken down.  We have <Col N="77" /> meddlers who are simply bent on revenge, which may be sweet, but its fruits may be very bitter.  If there is any man with a sense of responsibility sitting on those benches he would be considering this, not from the angle of what suits him at the moment but whether he would like to be faced with these new changes if he were sitting here.  It is the only way in which responsibility can be brought home to any man&mdash;that he should consider it from the angle of what he would consider to be a just standard if he were the person in opposition representing the people who are to be taxed&mdash;the people who do not favour the Government in office at the moment.  What is the good of this elaborate procedure and all this gleaning from history and all those elaborate devices which, as I say, the wit of mankind has settled upon as the best way of standing up against the coercion of a Government in power if they are going to be broken like a vase in the hands of a fool, just simply to get a victory at the moment&mdash;and what a victory it is!</P>
      <P>What are we to rush through this evening?  One Bill containing four items&mdash;a tax upon pigs, a changed tax upon ink, a changed tax upon cutlery and a taxation upon tyres.  I know well why we cannot be allowed to discuss freely the ink tax, because it is ludicrous to talk of it in this context, but in this context it was introduced. Remember, the bottle of ink is one of our weapons against the British in the economic war.  If we can stop British ink coming we have gained some great tactical advantage if not a big victory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It can be repeated. Why should we not be allowed to contrast ink and cattle?  It is an obvious contrast.  Why go 100 per cent. pro-British in cattle and decide that you are now, by reaction, to become more anti-British in regard to ink than ever before?  Or is this part of the general scheme of preventing the education of the people? You do not want paper to come into the country without any writing on it, and you do not want ink to come in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="78" /> What is done with regard to tyres? There is 7½ per cent. excise duty on the retail price of tyres.  It is a pity we could not be allowed to discuss the matter of tyres in some detail because we are starting a factory here&mdash;I am not sure if it has not been started already&mdash;for the production of Irish tyres.  We were told that the price was to be 15 per cent. above what these can be sold at in England, plus whatever Excise duty might be put on, plus whatever increased cost there may be in bringing in raw material into this country, where there was going to be a small consuming unit for these goods. We have to pass all this to-night.  We cannot get the inter-actions of the 7½ per cent., the 15 per cent and the other addition, whatever it may be.</P>
    <P>As far as cutlery is concerned, we had a 15 per cent. tax with 10 per cent. preference.  It was raised to 25 per cent.  We have put up that tax in the Finance Bill which is operating and yet we must get this through in order to enable us to give statutory confirmation to the 25 per cent. although we have completely over-ridden that 25 per cent. by the new tax in the Finance Bill raising it by 50 per cent.  Then we have, finally, as Deputy O'Higgins said, the one which carries the rest. Here again, we must see to the new procedure, urgency being the plea, and urgency to be admitted in a certain way.  Hereafter, if there is one urgent thing which commends itself to the majority in this House that one urgent thing can be made to carry on its back a dozen items.  They can be put in the same Bill and the little colour of urgency for one will give the colouring to the whole lot.  Deputies down the country may find measures down here for discussion on a certain day of which they have no notice and they are not entitled to put down amendments to them.</P>
    <P>What is the urgency about this pig matter?  On the 12th December last, a measure was introduced into this House dealing, amongst other things, with a tax on the carcases of pigs. For some reason, that certainly is not the responsibility of this House, that measure was not debated on Second Reading until the end of March.  It <Col N="79" /> was not very urgent then.  Then it went to a Special Committee and came back to this House in the early days of May.  It was listed for discussion one day early in May and there were 96 amendments to it.  Every one of these 96 amendments was either discussed or in some way dealt with and the Bill was given a final reading the next day.</P>
    <P>Now, take the delay on that measure which was introduced on the 12th December and passed through this House on the 23rd May.  Who was responsible for the delay between the 12th December and the 22nd May?  The House then sent the Bill to a Special Committee, where it was dealt with expeditiously, and when the final day came it was dealt with and went through.  It went to the Seanad.  It was discussed and passed, and it was signed on the 20th June.</P>
    <P>Under that Bill boards were to be set up, and certain administrative machinery was to be set up, and if that was done this Bill would not be required. The Bill was introduced on the 12th December, as I pointed out, and someone had in mind that some administrative machinery would be necessary when the Bill was through. Was anyone thinking about that since December last?  How was it that we arrived at the 12th June when the Minister was aware that it was going to pass and no delay and no obstruction, yet the measure was allowed to lie quiet ever since?  Why was there not someone thinking about the administrative machinery?  Why was there not some idea in someone's head to see that the setting up of the boards came about in time?  But we find that instead of there being anyone thinking of finding out whether this administrative machinery was necessary, this House was presented with a Bill and asked to pass it right off.  Why all this urgency now?  On the 26th June we were presented with the Bill and asked to get it immediately on to the Statute Book, while the Minister could wipe out the administrative machinery necessary under the other Bill.  This House is now asked to give a hurried consideration to this <Col N="80" /> measure, and in doing so to include other matters about which there can be no urgency.  Four disagreeable items are included here and are to be excluded from obtaining publicity in the Press or elsewhere.  This, no doubt, is done in order to impose excessive taxation on the people without giving them any chance of knowing anything about it.  The whole financial machinery of this House is to be wrecked because somebody who should have been thinking about this matter had not any time, or was not thinking at all about the machinery that should be set up under the Bill which was passed in June.</P>
    <P>Instead of that the House is asked to take up, and pass, all the remaining stages of this Bill in one day.  It was introduced on the 26th June and no move made since.  Apart from that, when we had this Bill before us last week, and there was talk about its urgency, no one whispered that this was a legislative Imposition of Duties Bill.  It was apparently to be rushed through.  Late as that was the arguments about the urgency are still later; in fact, they have not yet been brought forward.  If we got through all this business according to the guillotine resolution this week, we are told that there may be two days given for discussion next week.  Is it possible that in all this urgency the Ministry has not thought of the fact that there may be no business to be done next week? It may be well to accommodate members of the Opposition and do them a good turn.  They must prevent the exposure to the people of this mad rush, and that may be followed by the discovery that too much had been rushed through, and that the Dáil may meet possibly only two days next week: and so one day may be given for the discussion for the Department of Agriculture. But the other Estimates&mdash;the Finance Bill and the Imposition of Duties Bill containing all these disagreeable things are to be got through in three days.  All this is to be done at the expense of completely wrecking the financial procedure arranged here as in so many other countries and so carefully built up.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="81" /> This is a matter that concerns the protection of the whole people, not merely minorities.  But these opportunities are to be denied the people. The Government say they are tired with the repetition of talk on the taxation of foodstuffs and so on.  They are tired of all the talks of taxation on house building materials, and the exposure of their plans with regard to the Border, and so on.  These things brought forward and stated once or twice might pass without notice.  But to have them repeated as they appear in the schedules discussion would mean that the knowledge of them would penetrate through the newspapers down to the people in country districts and eventually there would be a fair appreciation amongst the people of what the Budget means.</P>
    <P>They are afraid that there might be a fair appreciation in the minds of the people of the depth&mdash;the financial depth&mdash;to which the Government is sinking.  The Minister tells us that there has been prolonged and obstructive debates.  I have been a close student, as far as my time permitted, of the financial resources of this country; but until the Committee discussions on this Finance Bill, I had no idea that rice or figs or grapes were taxed, or that so many matters used in house building were taxed.  I venture to say that our people in the country had no idea that all these things were taxed; and the Government presumably think that they should not have any idea of what things were taxed.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that on Finance Bills, in certain years, there were certain numbers of hours spent in discussion. Is it any argument to say that one year there was only 18 hours' discussion on the Finance Bill and that in another year there was 74 hours. Does the Minister not know perfectly well that if taxation is being taken off there is very little criticism, but if taxation is being put on, there is bound to be a great amount of criticism? Will the Minister relate to those hours and years what was their relation to the taxes under discussion? Will he tell us what was the nature <Col N="82" /> of the taxation in the years when the hours were short and what was the nature of the imposition in the years when the debates range out over many hours?  Will he tell us the relation between the hours taken up when it was a question of the reduction of taxation and the hours taken in discussion when it was a question of the imposition of taxes?  If we are to have 74 hours' discussion this year, in relation to the imposition of taxation it is not too much.  If the Minister introduced a Bill containing only four of the Schedules of the Finance Bill, and brought it in, and had a Second Reading debate and then proceeded to the Committee Stage and if the Committee Stage on these four Schedules lasted eight hours no one could say that it was too much.  The Minister should allow ample time for the discussion of these matters instead of atempting to rush them through, sitting insolently in his place and refusing to give any information whatever on questions raised from this side of the House, because, as he was one time forced to admit, it could only prolong the discussion.  Is there any appreciation here of the fact that this House meets for discussion; that the only virtue in this House is discussion; and that, without discussion, this House ought not to be elected and had better not be elected?  If you take away argument, you take away government by persuasion.  You can get another type of Government, but we have been told that that is not desired, but blot out discussion on the main item of finance and you might as well decide to do what Deputy O'Higgins referred to&mdash;dissolve this House, save money by dissolving the House and save even your own honesty by dissolving the House&mdash;and do not have a pretence of democratic government and government by persuasion, when, in fact, what you are operating is government by guillotine and particularly government by guillotine and closure on the delicate item of finance; on the question of whether the people ought to be taxed and to what degree they ought to be taxed: how far they can stand taxation; and <Col N="83" /> whether what it is proposed to give them in return for taxation is good and sufficient and whether it can be met in another way.</P>
    <P>Take away all that and you take away the substance of this House and no leaning on the majority and no leaning on the simple statement that, as we all know, the majority rules, if operated in that way, is compatible with the type of Government which we have been brought up to believe exists in the country.  It would be far better to sweep the whole thing out and to sit down securely placed for the time as dictators, and more securely placed as dictators than if there is criticism, because it would take longer then to find out what is on.  It would be more honest to do that than to have this House meeting and the people believing that there is discussion and freedom of discussion, the right to argue freely and to get information brought to the point of mind operating on mind, while, at the same time, by guillotine and closure, you are simply saying: &ldquo;We will this&rdquo; and then the law operates and comes into existence.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy thinks that is the procedure, why not do as is sometimes done in other House and allot a certain number of hours for the voting of supply and let there be notice given of that and let Deputies accommodate themselves to it?  There is no use, however, in pretending to be a democratic Assembly with the guillotine operating without notice given, <Col N="84" /> so that Deputies might accommodate themselves to the situation, and particularly in circumstances such as rule here, in which there is merely not one method of financial procedure but a second specially invented to meet the needs of the Government.  Every Deputy knows what the Emergency Imposition of Duties Bill means.  It means that you are flooded out by a heap of White Papers in your morning post which you cannot read and the details of which you can only get examined here.  They are held over until the eight months' period is nearly gone and then there is a rush and discussion is stifled.  Deputies can face up to that other situation if they want to. The majority generally can engineer that and they can bring that situation about, but if that is going to be done it should be done openly and it should be done with good notice given, instead of having the statement &ldquo;We are here and we are not going to have any of this pother about finance and pretending to protect the people's pockets; we rule.&rdquo;  As one newspaper said at the week-end, &ldquo;the majorities will troop in for the division and the law is going to be made.&rdquo;  Give notice that that is your intention and then we will know what type of Government there is, but do not pretend to have discussion and argument and a clash of mind upon mind when all you want is a guillotine motion and the cutting short of debate and an attempt to break down the physique of people who have to stay here to endeavour to put up arguments on insufficient information&mdash;information denied when it should be given. You can have that; there is no way of avoiding it if the Government wants to have it; but do not ride the two horses together.  Do the coercion openly and do the dictatorship openly, or do the democratic thing, but do not, as I said before, leave the people with the mistaken belief that we are allowed to argue here, that argument has some chance and that persuasion occasionally matters, and that even, whether persuasion matters in the way of changing a point of view argument, at any rate, there is allowed here, what discloses and dissects and lays bare to the people what is on, so that they <Col N="85" /> know in a sufficient way what is being imposed upon them.  You are going to close that down, too, because, I suppose, a situation has now been reached when the so-called democrats hold the belief that knowledge is a bad thing for the people and that it would be well, in order to have things kept quiet, that they should not get a knowledge of what is going to be done, but that they should just be faced with the increased cost of living, the increase in their ordinary budget, and be left in a maze and in a bewilderment to be surprised by what is put in upon them.</P>
      <P>We are told that we would upset the heavy Government programme of legislation if this was allowed to go on.  The Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Bill was one of the measures that was so urgent the other day.  It went through, by agreement, without a division. If it had been held over until now it would probably be one of the urgent measures for which the country was gasping and which, presumably, the Opposition were trying to obstruct.  Does the Minister remember when he first talked of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Bill in the Budget speech?  It was not this year's Budget speech but the Budget of 1934.  It was terribly urgent and the Minister's heart bled for the widows and orphans and continued to bleed so for the whole year, and it gave him an opportunity for another compassionate bouquet to himself this year.  Then it is brought in here and, with all the pother about urgency, passed without a division.  It is, I suppose, part of the heavy legislative programme that would be upset&mdash;that addition to it announced in 1934 and the fructification of the promise not occurring until some time this year.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brennan referred to one of the four matters contained in this Bill. I have already passed one type of criticism on this as an urgent question. Deputy Brennan referred to another aspect of it&mdash;the Excise duty upon the carcases of pigs.  Here is what the Minister said in his Budget speech this year, on 15th May, at column 871:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Included in the Estimate under that head is the amount which it <Col N="86" /> was estimated would be collected over the 12 months from the existing Excise duty of 10/- per pig carcase and part of a pig carcase.  The Minister for Agriculture has pressed me very strongly to remit this duty altogether.  I am not in a position to do that immediately, but I have agreed, when the Board which is contemplated under the new Pigs and Bacon Bill has been set up...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>so that the Minister had it in contemplation then</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...ultimately to remit this duty during the current year.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Is that satisfactory?  Will the Minister attend to the rest:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This will cost the Exchequer £240,000 and is a remission which must be made good by a new impost elsewhere.  In my opinion, the advantage which agriculturists will derive from the remission of the pig duty would not be lessened, but rather would be increased by a tax on foreign wheat.  Accordingly, I propose to levy an import duty of 6d. a cwt. on that commodity in the hope that it will recoup us to the extent of £190,000.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>So that is the terrifically urgent matter of this Emergency Imposition of Duties Bill. It is tied up, as far as the Budget speech is concerned, with the remission of £240,000, and that remission is going to be made up in another way by two taxes which are already operating.  If that is the urgency, it is not to relieve the people.  Deputy Brennan said that it was possible that the two taxes might be in operation together.  The Minister laughed at that.  Is it so? I say it is so.  And yet, on the back of the Pigs Bill ride the tyres and the ink&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kelly is shocked into silence by his vicarious suffering for the poor at this moment. Surely this is a pretty pass that everything has been brought to, that we can have a resolution of this sort introduced with these fantastic reasons about urgency, which can be passed without attempted argument on any one of the four items.  It is now acknowledged that the four items must be taken together.  The four have got to go with the supposed urgency of the one tax mentioned.  This is done while apparently Deputies believe that they are a democratic Government and that the people ought to be allowed to know, at any rate, why taxes are being imposed on them, and that the taxes that are being imposed are the only way in which revenue can be raised, <Col N="88" /> and that there is possibly some relief for them in future.  We have not had that argument to-day.</P>
      <P>If we are going to have this new procedure, will the Ministry tell us whether they have thought out the steps of the new procedure?  Is there any scheme or any way of wiring to Deputies in the country the terms of guillotine resolutions which may at any time hereafter be brought in and sanctioned by the majority?  Will Deputies by wire be allowed to put down an amendment, or is there any thought of substituting a new procedure for the procedure that is now being abolished? Are Ministers simply without any idea about procedure or the principle which lies behind procedure?  Are they simply taking a rush at this because, no doubt, they have been affected by the knowledge which has crept out through the Press to the public of the taxation imposed in this year's Budget?  If this procedure is going to continue, it is going to be looked upon as a new procedure for the House.  If there is any chance of its being operated even occasionally, surely it would require some meeting of the Committee on Standing Orders to devise some way in which Opposition rights will be protected under the new procedure?  I have said Opposition rights, but it may happen that even members of the Government Party will want to put down an amendment to some type of pressing tax which Ministers may rush in here with a guillotine resolution, without prior discussion at a Party meeting.  Apart from members of the Government Party, it may be that people associated with the Government Party may find a Labour interest in conflict with some tax introduced under a guillotine resolution.  Will they be enabled to get first hand information so that, at any rate, they may not be left entirely bereft of any counter to what may be proposed or so that they may be enabled to put down some amendment which will give them an opportunity of having the matter ventilated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are only at the point, as far as this procedure goes, of a matter which is one day late being admitted.  There is no reason why two days' delay or <Col N="89" /> three days' delay in the tabling of such a motion might not, on the grounds of great urgency, be excused.  We might have it that a resolution, introduced even on the morning of a day on which the Dáil sat, a financial resolution imposing taxation, might be rushed through the House in 24 hours.  At the moment one does not consider it likely that that would happen, but once the thing has happened, the old principle goes, and the conscience that may operate through delay may not operate for the future.  Once the barrier of the day's notice is gone, and the appropriate notice under the Standing Orders has been broken into, the principle has gone.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;  I do not propose to say anything on this stage of the Bill as so much of the time allocated to it has already been taken up by the Opposition.  I would like, however, to point out that one of the Orders to be confirmed by this Bill, the one to which greatest exception has been taken by the Opposition&mdash;it is included in the Bill because we regard it as a matter of urgency and, therefore, it becomes such, since the passage of the Bill is a matter of urgency&mdash;is the Order which, in fact, would substitute for the 33? per cent. import duty on motor tyres a 7½ per cent.  Excise duty on motor tyres manufactured here, and which would mean a considerable reduction in the revenue to be derived by the Exchequer and, therefore, a considerable reduction in the taxation to be borne by the citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might give a little more information with regard to tyres.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce told us that tyres would be manufactured in this country at a price 15 per cent. higher than the manufactured price in England, but that there would be an Excise duty put on, on account of the increased cost of importing raw materials owing to production being smaller than in other places.  The Minister might tell us why the imposition of an additional tax on motorists is required, and generally might say a little more on this Bill. When the Emergency Imposition of Duties Bill was originally introduced the Minister for Finance stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...the trade relations between this country and Great Britain are such that for every penny piece which she robs from us by a tariff upon our agricultural produce we can recoup ourselves by a tariff upon her manufactures.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>One of the heavy impositions being confirmed in this Bill is a tax on pigs killed here for the purpose of taking the money so raised and adding it to whatever carcases of pigs or bacon we can force in on the British market, with the inducement of having some Irish pounds attached to it.  One of the main items being put through in this way, without any separate discussion, is this item.  Instead of inflicting any disability on Great Britain or the British buyer, it inflicts disability on the consumer of pork here, by taking the increased tax and throwing it over to Great Britain to make pig products cheaper there.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give you time when I put one other point. When introducing this measure on June 12, 1932, the Minister for Finance said, in column 1004 of the Parliamentary Debates:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The powers which we are seeking are wide; they are sweeping.  I do not want to disguise that fact either from the Oireachtas or from the people of the country.  They give the Executive Council power to impose stamp duties and duties of Customs and Excise with every possible variation of such duties that can be thought of or that may be found to be necessary.  But if the powers are wide and sweeping they are not more than are required to deal with the present situation.  They will be used with prudence, with moderation and with foresight, and the exercise of them will be subject to review and subsequent confirmation by the Dáil. I said that it was not our purpose to attack, but if the doors of the British markets are closed to us, then it is our duty and the duty of the Dáil to give the Executive all the powers that may be necessary to find markets elsewhere.  We are confident that such markets can be found.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to assist the Minister for Agriculture to stick to one point. Why are we raising money to throw over to Great Britain with our pig products?  Why are we taxing our own people instead of raising taxes from the British people, in the way the Minister for Finance said we could? Why are we sending these products to the British market instead of finding <Col N="96" /> markets elsewhere?  What did the Minister for Agriculture mean when he said that as soon as this Bill became operative, which he expected would not be sooner than July 1, as far as the Department of Agriculture was concerned, he would ask that no further levy through the Revenue Commissioners would be raised?  In the first three months it raised £107,000.  The Minister for Agriculture is aware of the circumstances under which it was imposed.  He is also aware of the circumstances under which the tariff on cement was imposed. Will he state that as soon as the new fees are being levied by the Pigs and Bacon Boards this tax will cease?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable that an opportunity is not given for discussion on this Bill.  The first item in the Bill dealing with the levy on pigs is an absolute breach of faith with the House and the country.  I am sure it was never intended that any Government that was given special powers in an emergency would use them, not against the enemy, but against the people of this country.  This levy on pigs makes it possible for England to get cheap bacon from us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Pigs and Bacon Bill was introduced in December, and the Second Reading came on about March. A Spcial Committee which was set up to expedite matters, was told that the Minister wanted this Bill in operation by July 1st.  Why is it not in operation?  The Minister is aware of the special case made by the Pig Producers' and Feeders' Association when giving evidence before the Pig Tribunal, that they are anxious that this tax should be remitted and that the other proposal should function.  Many of these unfortunate people have all they possess invested in pigs.  Some of them have 100 or 150 sows and are fattening the produce.  The Minister has a good idea of the amount of money and anxiety that is involved in a business like that.  Although those people did not get everything they wanted, they preferred to co-operate and were told that this Bill would be in operation on July 1st.  Their grievance was that the tax of 10/- a carcase was too much. They really believed that they were to get the entire benefit of the 10/- by way of helping exports.  I quoted a statement made by the Minister for Finance in the Budget in which he said that he could not afford to remit this tax.  I put this question to the Minister for <Col N="98" /> Agriculture: Was he doing his duty by agriculture when he allowed the Minister for Finance to impose a tax on pig carcases, ostensibly to help the export of bacon, and thereby helping the trade in bacon in this country and outside it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is suggested that we are giving cheap bacon to British consumers by this arrangement.  Our bacon is realising more on the British market than bacon from any other country, so that, in reality, the British consumer is paying more for our bacon than for any other he is getting.  How it can be contended by anybody, even by the Opposition, that we are giving cheap bacon to John Bull by paying this bounty is more than I can understand. <Col N="109" /> The British consumer is paying the very highest price for it, but the point is that we believe our producers are not getting enough, and, on that account, we are giving our producers an export bounty in addition to what they are getting from Great Britain. That is the position.</P>
      <P>I was also asked why there was any delay about the Bacon Bill.  It must have been explained many a time, when that Bill was going through, that there were various steps that had to be taken after the Bill had passed both Houses and had been signed before it could come into operation.  We have to register all the different factories and, naturally, some notice had to be given for the reception of applications for registration.  They had to be registered and the register has to be built up; we have to get a panel of electors to elect the boards and the boards have to be set up and have to issue orders.  I said, all along, that it would take a couple of months from the time the Bill passed for the Act to become operative&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It was also suggested that somebody had broken faith in regard to this money that was collected as Excise duty and that it did not go towards export bounties but into the Exchequer.  That was explained over and over again in this House on the Bacon Bill, on the Budget and when a Bill like this went through the House last October, confirming certain Excise duties on bacon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I explained, at the time the Pigs and Bacon Bill was going through, that when the Bill would be operative there would be power to collect levies, put them into the funds of the Pigs Board, and have them paid out again by that Board.  They need not go through the Exchequer.  Until the Bill becomes operative, the levy must be collected as an Excise Duty, must go through the Exchequer and be paid out again as a bounty.  So far from it being a fact that we did not keep faith, as a result of this Excise duty which was brought in during the last financial year, we collected something <Col N="111" /> like £289,000, and on the other hand we brought in a Supplementary Estimate for the payment of bounties amounting to £850,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>On bacon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not on bacon alone.  A sum of about £490,000 went in bacon bounties and only £239,000 was collected towards that by way of Excise duty and paid into the Exchequer. In addition to the £289,000, there was paid from the Exchequer back again in export bounties something like £600,000.  These are the facts about the allegations that have been made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might give a little further explanation in regard to this matter.  He said that they had kept faith with the farmers. Let us see what they have done.  He admits that a sum of £289,000 was collected within a certain period which was not a 12 months period.  It was a ten months period.  There would be well over £300,000 collected from the producers in 12 months.  Is it really not to the advantage of the Exchequer that this Bill has been held back so long?</P>

      <P>The peculiar thing about this Bill is that the Minister for Finance gave the game away in his Budget speech.  Previous to his Budget speech, he gave a reply to a question in this House which was similar in effect to the statement of the Minister for Agriculture just now, namely, that they had kept faith with everybody, and that in addition to the sums of money they collected from the pig producers, they paid out several thousand pounds.  The peculiar thing about it is that the Minister speaking in this House some time previous to the Budget, said that every penny he got in by way of levy on pig carcases was of no advantage to him. Now let us agree on that, that he had to pay out all the money he got in. He states in his Budget speech that the levies amounted to a sum of <Col N="112" /> £240,000.  He said: &ldquo;This will cost the Exchequer £240,000.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall read the whole paragraph.  It states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Before proceeding to consider how this expenditure is to be provided for, there is one proposed change in the basis of the existing tax revenue to which it is necessary to allude.  Included in the Estimate under that head is the amount which it was estimated would be collected over the 12 months from the existing Excise duty of 10/- per pig carcase and part of a pig carcase.  The Minister for Agriculture has pressed me very strongly to remit this duty altogether.  I am not in a position to do so immediately, but I have agreed, when the Board which is contemplated under the new Pigs and Bacon Bill has been set up and is fully functioning, to take steps to reduce and ultimately to remit this duty during the current year.</P>
      <P>This will cost the Exchequer £240,000&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
      <P>That is where I started at first, and I do not see that the first part makes any difference.  The Minister's statement goes on:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;and is a remission which must be made good by a new impost elsewhere.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>When the Minister was proposing to remit this £240,000, the reason given was that it was to be taken up by the new Pigs Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="113" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the intention, and that is what the Minister for Agriculture has told us, that when the Pigs Board start functioning they will undertake the collection of this levy as part of the business.  Notwithstanding that, the Minister for Finance speaks as if this were a loss to the Exchequer, although he is not going to be responsible for the future bounties. The Pigs Board is going to see to that. The Minister said further:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In my opinion, the advantage which agriculturists would derive from the remission of the pig duty would not be lessened but rather would be increased by a tax on foreign wheat.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Of course, that is downright humbug. He went on:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Accordingly, I propose to levy an import duty of 6d. per cwt. on that commodity in the hope that it will recoup us to the extent of £190,000.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Recoup you for what?  You are not losing anything by it.  If you collected a tax of £240,000 in the past, and if somebody else collects it for the same purpose in the future, why should you be recouped?  Further, the Minister says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The balance of the £240,000 will be found by an extension of the existing duty of 8d. per gallon on mineral hydrocarbon light oils, to cover all mineral hydrocarbon light oils used in the propulsion of motor vehicles. This will produce £60,000, leaving an acceptable balance of £10,000 for the general purposes of the Budget.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will not.  It will leave an acceptable balance of £250,000 because you will have the whole thing.  Other people are going to impose the levy on the pig producers.  You are going to have your wheat levy, plus your hydrocarbon oil levy, which you have put on in substitution for the pig levy.  Is not that the meaning to be put on that?  That is the position we have been landed into. The Minister for Agriculture tells us quite calmly now that the very highest prices are paid for Irish bacon on the <Col N="114" /> British market, the good old British market, that extraordinary market in which we are able to get the very highest price! Of course, because of the economic war and because of this type of measure, we must take 10/- off every pig fed in this country.  It is the pig producer who will pay that, not the bacon producer.  It is not the man who kills the pigs who will pay it.  We are agreed upon that, but the Minister for Finance is going to recoup himself for something which he does not lose at all. Other people are going to collect the levy on pig carcases.  That is the position in which we have to discuss this Bill.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to take up much of the time of the House in this debate, but the extremely misleading speech of the Deputy who has just sat down has made it necessary for me to engage the attention of the House for some considerable time.  First of all, let me see how this Excise duty arises.  It was necessitated in the first instance by the failure of the bacon exporters here to fill their quota in the British market.  Why?  Because the prices which they were able to get on the Irish market at home were so very much better and so much more profitable to them that they were prepared to forego their British connections altogether.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Belton would listen, I think I started my speech by saying that the reason this Excise duty was necessary was because that was the position in 1934.  The Deputy has possibly heard the Minister for Agriculture and some of the members of his late Party say that this duty was first imposed by Emergency Order in 1934.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the House to know that, if valuable time has been wasted, it is due to the action of the Opposition Deputy who called a count.  I was referring to the circumstances which necessitated the introduction of this Excise duty.  The reason was, as I have said, that the bacon producers found the home market so profitable and so extensive that it was difficult to get them to fill their quota in the British market.  Therefore, the additional inducement of an enhanced profit on their produce sold in the British market had to be offered to them.  That was in 1934.  The value of the additional home market offered to them may be gauged from the fact that, in 1932, no less than £1,670,000 worth of bacon was imported into this country.  For the first time this market was at the disposal of the home bacon curers and of the home pig producers.</P>

      <P>It is impossible to make a connected speech if Deputy Belton continues with these irrelevancies. We are told that the British market is our most valuable preserve. Deputies opposite talked as if the British market was formerly a preserve of theirs, in which their produce commanded a monopoly price.  Deputies opposite talked as if this market was the most valuable preserve of Irish farmers.  What do the facts in relation to this bacon bounty disclose?  They show that even though Irish bacon is getting top price in the British market, that is not, in the opinion of Irish bacon manufacturers, an economic price.  Therefore, an additional inducement must be offered to them so that the Irish pig producers may be offered an economic price.  Deputy Belton is one of those Deputies who profess to speak for the farming community.  The Deputy is one of those members of the House whose actions always belie their words.  He is always pretending to advocate a new tillage and a new industrial <Col N="116" /> policy but, on every occasion, his vote is cast against the enforcement of a tillage policy or an industrial policy.</P>

      <P>I referred to Deputy Belton's attitude in these matters because I know he is going to vote against the provisions of this Bill.  If he votes against the provisions of this Bill and compels us to drop the Excise duty, then it will be necessary for us to delete the provision for the export bounty on Irish bacon.  In that way Deputy Belton will be voting for a reduced reward for the Irish pig producer.</P>

      <P>To come back to my Budget speech, what did I say there? It has been alleged by Deputy Brennan that I am trying to have it both ways. I pointed out in the Budget that, to meet the requirements of the Minister for Agriculture, I had agreed that, after the board to be set up under the Pigs and Bacon Bill, as it was then &mdash;the Pigs and Bacon Act as it is now &mdash;had been set up and was fully functioning, I should take steps to reduce and, ultimately, to remit this Excise duty on pig carcases and parts thereof. There is not in that statement any reservation that if the Exchequer does forego that £240,000 of Excise duty there will be a corresponding reduction in the export bounty on pigs and bacon. It is only on the supposition that I had made that reservation there could be any force or substance in the allegation which Deputy Brennan has made in the House.  The trouble with the Opposition is that either they cannot read or they do not appear to understand what they do read.</P>

      <P>We heard Deputy Brennan's colleague state on the motion which preceded the discussion of this Bill that, until he listened in <Col N="117" /> here on the Committee Stage, he did not know there was to be a tax on rice or on grapes or on certain materials used in the building of houses.  That is a confession on Deputy McGilligan's part of one of two things&mdash;either that he had the Bill and did not read it or that he tried to read it and could not read it.  The imposts upon these items were discussed here time after time.  They were published not merely in the Bill, as it appears and as it has been discussed here, but they were set forth in detail in the Resolutions which were considered by the House. Deputy McGilligan's statement this evening was a confession&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that until he came in here he had not read the proposals which he was supposed to come into the House prepared to discuss, and it is the same with Deputy Brennan. I would like to emphasise again that there is nothing in my statement on the Budget which would justify Deputy Brennan saying that I was trying to have it both ways: that I was going, first of all, to make good the loss to the Exchequer occasioned by the reduction and eventual remission of the Excise duty by imposing a duty on wheat and on hydro-carbon light oils for propelling motor vehicles and that at the same time we were going to reduce the export bounty by a similar amount.  It is only if we did these two things that, as I have said, there would be any foundation for the charge which Deputy Brennan has so lightly levelled against us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it might be no harm, in view of the statements that have been made here, to call attention to what is in the Bill which the House is now asked to pass.  There are four Resolutions. The first is this one dealing with the duty on pig carcases.  The principle of that proposal has been discussed in this House on at least one occasion. It was discussed in October last when the Bill confirming the first emergency duty was passed by the House.  The principle was then accepted by the <Col N="118" /> House, after it had been explained to the Deputies why it was necessary to impose this Excise duty at all.  When it was pointed out that, pending the establishment of a board to control the industry and to provide for the proper marketing of Irish pig products, emergency machinery of this sort had to be set up, the House accepted that, and I do not think there was very much discussion about it. The Deputies who are supposed to come in here equipped to discharge the nation's business, who are supposed to be familiar with what they have done in this House before they get up to talk here, seem to have forgotten what happened earlier, and that is why we are accused of presenting to the House some new and novel principle.  Not merely was this proposal and the effects of it discussed in 1934, but it was discussed on what was then the Pigs and Bacon Bill and is now an Act.  It was also discussed in the general Resolution on the Budget.  Deputy McGovern made a very long speech on it.  He spoke, I think, for almost an hour, and the main burden of his speech was the question of this Excise duty on pigs and pig products, and quite naturally because the pig producing industry is a very important one in the constituency which he represents.  So much, then, for the item in the Schedule which confirms this Excise duty on pigs and pig carcases.</P>
    <P>The next item which is to be confirmed is the duty on writing inks, a duty which slightly increases the existing duty by removing the preferential rate.  That has been discussed at great length in the House on other occasions. As a matter of fact, in the debate on the Resolutions Deputy Dockrell got up and spoke at some length.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>And got no reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>He spoke at some length on the Resolutions, and at some length on the question as to whether what was known as washing-out ink was properly chargeable under this clause.  But what is the position?  The position is this: that the House, having accepted the principle that the home manufacture of inks was an industry <Col N="119" /> which ought to be protected, imposed a duty in order to afford Irish enterprise an opportunity of establishing that industry here, finds itself in this situation: that having imposed the duty, the duty is, to a large extent, ineffective.  It is ineffective for this reason, that by virtue of the fact that the manufacturers of a certain country got a preferential rate under the earlier resolution of the Oireachtas they were enabled to send considerable quantities of their manufactures into this market and that the new industry had not in fact the opportunity of establishing itself firmly, which the Dáil thought it had conferred on it when it accepted this principle to protect ink.  This emergency duty has been imposed in order to remove the preference and to put all foreign manufacturers upon the same plane in this country in that regard.</P>
      <P>Now, I do not think, notwithstanding all the six hours' talk that we have had here this evening, that even Deputy Belton or Deputy McGilligan, if we had put this proposal only before them, would venture to get up here and say that we were justified in continuing to extend this preference to manufacturers who are out-selling our home manufacturers here.  I think they would have had to take up the same position in this regard as the Government.</P>

      <P>I come now to deal with cutlery.  The Finance Bill of this year once again was preceded by a Financial Resolution which was very fully discussed in the House.  There are provisions imposing an overriding duty of 75 per cent. on foreign manutured cutlery.  The Emergency Order which is to be confirmed is an Order imposing a duty of 25 per cent. on foreign manufactured cutlery.  In the course of the discussion on the Resolution, and on the Committee Stage of the Bill, one of the points upon which the Minister for Industry and Commerce was most closely challenged was <Col N="120" /> as to why it was necessary to have these two duties, the one of 25 per cent. imposed by the Emergency Order, and the other of 75 per cent. imposed by the Financial Resolution.  He gave a reason which I think was satisfactory to the House.  He pointed out that we had already taken steps to establish the cutlery industry in this country, and in order to make certain when established that the whole of the home market would be reserved for the products of this industry, it was necessary to impose a duty of 75 per cent. He anticipated that the new factory would be opened before next year's Finance Bill was introduced.</P>
      <P>But, in order not to impose an undue hardship on consumers in this country, pending the opening of the factory, the 75 per cent. proposal embodied very wide licensing provisions.  On the other hand, experience has taught us this, that when these licensing provisions are embodied in a proposal, there is a disposition on the part of wholesalers and retailers of the protected commodities to stock up to the fullest extent by importing abnormal supplies, and in order to prevent abnormal importation in that way, and, as it were, to damp it down, this 25 per cent. duty was imposed by Emergency Order. But some point may be made of the fact that it was only imposed last February, and is not a duty the confirmation of which is immediately required.  It must be confirmed before the 15th October.  Perhaps the Dáil, when it adjourns, will adjourn until some date later than 15th October.</P>

      <P>Accordingly, as this is the only opportunity we have before the Session ends, and in order to obviate the necessity for bringing the Dáil back to do something about which <Col N="121" /> there could not possibly be any contention or any difference of opinion, it is embodied in this Bill.</P>
      <P>Again, take the Excise duty on tyres. That duty is imposed at the rate of 7½ per cent. on the retail price of the tyres for motor cars and steam cars.  It is a duty of which the Dáil had prior knowledge.  Remember that the manufacture of pneumatic tyres was at a very early stage in the development of these tyres undertaken in Ireland. The whole facts concerning the reestablishment of this Irish industry were before the Dáil when the motion to confirm the quota order on tyres was discussed here at length.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan was able to get up here to-day, and to refer to that discussion, saying that they had been told that over and above the 15 per cent. which was at present imposed on motor tyres, there would possibly be imposed an additional duty on motor cars, and he told us why.  Because the cost of manufacture would be so high, and the market comparatively small, while imports of raw materials would cost more.  The Deputy said that all that was disclosed to the House by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. While Deputy McGilligan did not specify the occasion, I am stating now that it was when the motion to confirm the quota order was discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Did he say that there would be an Excise duty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>He pointed out that the Exchequer was going to lose by reason of the establishment of this industry here, and that it would have to recoup itself for that loss.  He did indicate that there would, possibly, be an Excise duty.  This was all discussed in the Dáil at length and the principle embodied in the quota Resolution was accepted by the House.  What then is the position in regard to the Excise duty?  The Customs duty on rubber tyres is a tax of 33? per cent. <i>ad valorem.</i>  When this Emergency Duty Order was made we were told that the new factory in Cork would be <Col N="122" /> coming into production within a week or a fortnight.  Of course, at the commencement it would manufacture largely for stock.  We realised that these stocks were going to come on the market eventually, and that there was going to be a considerable loss, by reason of the fact that imports were going to diminish proportionately as the factory began to deliver Irish-manufactured tyres for motor cars and cycles.  This emergency Excise duty at the rate of 7½ per cent. on retail prices for tyres for motor cars and steam cars was imposed merely as an emergency duty, to allow the Revenue Commissioners to set up the necessary machinery, and to recoup, though only partially, the Exchequer for the loss of revenue which would arise immediately these tyres were put on the market and that imports of tyres diminished.  It now comes before the Dáil.  If the House had ten hours to discuss that Order, is there any person here who would have the hardihood to get up and say that we should not take this 7½ per cent. off motor cars?</P>

That is the position in regard to Deputy Mulcahy.  I do not think, however, that, with the exception of Deputy Mulcahy, there was any other Deputy, who is so adamantine in his opposition to industrial development in this country, who would get up here and say that we ought to throw the whole of this industry into the flames again; that we ought to throw it back to England and thus undo what we regard as being one of the signal achievements of this Government: the re-establishment of the manufacture of the pneumatic tyre in the land of its birth.  This is the country where this tyre was invented; and one of the things that we can pride ourselves on is that, whereas the manufacture of these tyres was driven out under the <Col N="124" /> British régime, it was brought back to this country by a Republican Government.</P>

      <P>When the House considers the purposes which each of these emergency orders have been designed to serve: the payment of an economic price to our pig producers, which is what the first order is designed to do; protecting adequately the manufacture of writing inks in this country, which is the purpose of the second emergency order; the facilitating of the establishment of a cutlery industry in this country, which is what the third emergency order is designed to do; and the assisting of the establishment on a firm basis of the manufacture of pneumatic tyres for motor-cars and cycles in this country, which is what the fourth emergency order is designed to achieve&mdash;it is little wonder, knowing the attitude which the Party opposite take towards Irish industrial development and the attitude they took when they were in office, that Deputy McGilligan referred to-day to these emergency orders as four disagreeable items.  Yes, they are.  They are very disagreeable items to the Opposition, because they mark four more stages in the fulfilment of the Government's policy of industrial development in this country.  That is why so much time was wasted last week on the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill&mdash;not because they had any hope that they were going to defeat the Government on that Bill <Col N="125" /> or to criticise intelligently any of the proposals in that Bill, but because they wanted to hold up, if they could, the confirmation of these orders and, in that way, retard and obstruct the Government in its endeavours to develop Irish industries in this country.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan said to-day that we were supposed to be a democratic Government and he alleged that the action of the Government, in taking the necessary steps to see that this measure would become law in due course, was subversive of the principles of democratic government.  The Opposition may have a duty to criticise&mdash;I do not think they ever discharged that duty, because they have confused criticism with obstruction&mdash;but the Government has also a duty.

      <P>The burden is ours, and the duty is ours, of seeing that our programme goes through, and we are the more determined to put it through because we have now, beyond equivocation or denial, the overwhelming support of the thinking people of this country for our policy.  If we had not this motion: if this Bill was being discussed otherwise than under a kangaroo resolution: if the Whips were off, and if there were a free vote in this House: is there anyone opposite who is prepared to say that the Deputies who will go into the lobby and support this Bill, if it were a free vote of the House, would vote in any other way than they are going to vote on it now?  First of all, they have given their allegiance to the Fianna Fáil Party because they believe in the Fianna Fáil policy.  The people have returned them to this House to support that policy and put it through. I say, beyond any fear of challenge, <Col N="126" /> that, if the Whips were off to-morrow, and there were a free vote of Deputies in regard to any one of the proposals in this Bill, not merely would everyone of the Deputies who accept the Fianna Fáil Dhips support it, and everyone of the Deputies who accept the Labour Party's Whip support it, but some of the Deputies who are compelled, against their conscience and their feelings of patriotism, to vote against it now, would vote for it also. I think that even the public pronouncements of the Opposition themselves throughout the country show that whatever views the people have of the Government's political policy, they have no doubt whatever about the wisdom of our industrial programme and that they are prepared to support it and to make considerable sacrifices to support it, because it is the programme, not merely of President de Valera and those who opposed the Treaty, but of the late Michael Collins and Arthur Griffith as well. We are the true inheritors of the programme which the Irish people hoped to see put into operation at the close of the Black and Tan campaign in 1921, but we have not got any help or consideration in this debate from the Party opposite.  They have not been concerned to see Griffith's policy initiated and consummated in this country, or to see even the steppingstone policy of Michael Collins put into operation.  They have turned their backs on all those things, and now they are fighting that policy&mdash;the policy of Sinn Fein and the policy of the Republican Dáil&mdash;as the obscurantists in Ulster and throughout the Thirty-two Counties fought Home Rule under Sir Edward Carson.  Despite all the vexatious opposition of the last ten days this Bill is going to go through, and I hope it will become law.  The justification for our action will be the new industries which are springing up in consequence of the Emergency Orders which we have made.</P>

I hope that <i>Dublin Opinion</i> will not lose this opportunity of having the Minister for Finance with a firm grip of a pig's tail in its next issue.  There is one thing which I would advise the Minister for Finance to do, and that is to study the elements of economics.  Let him get the old files of the <i>United Irishman</i> edited by Griffith 35 years ago, and down to 30 years ago, and read them.  Then if there is any human feeling left in his heart, he will try to make restitution for the rest of his life for having been in any way remotely responsible for the early death of Arthur Griffith, and similarly with Michael Collins.  I am sorry that I have not time to reply to the illogical and ignorant arguments nad statements made by the Minister for Finance.  It would give me the greatest pleasure of my life to have him there and paste him with replies, but on every occasion when an opportunity comes the Minister for Finance bows himself out.  I have him now, but the guillotine is against me.  He, nor the Minister for Agriculture, who told us that this emergency duty had to be imposed last year to save the Irish export trade, did not tell us the reason why that export trade was vanishing&mdash;because of the British special duties.</P>

The economic war had throttled the Irish export trade to Britain, and this levy had to be put on, not to save that export trade in bacon, but to cover up that breach which the Minister and his Government are not able to maintain or repair in this so-called economic war. Now, Sir, why was the bounty which was necessary not provided for without taxation?  What was the Minister doing with the £4,000,000 that he was collecting here and not paying to the British?  What was he doing with the local loans that all the local authorities in this country had to pay into the Exchequer, and that the previous Government paid to the British?  He got it into the Exchequer but he did not pay it to anybody. Why did the exporters and the producers of bacon and other things not get the benefit of that without any further taxation?

    <P>This is the Estimate which I understood from Deputy Morrissey <Col N="133" /> the Opposition charged the Government with a desire to prevent the Dáil from discussing.  It is now before the House, and if there is any information required with regard to the details of the Estimate I will endeavour to supply it.  As I presume, however, that the Opposition are eager to get down the business I do not propose to detain the House unnecessarily.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Deputy Mulcahy I move: That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration. I think that if the House uses anything approaching an unfettered judgment I will, before I sit down, have succeeded in satisfying the House that the Attorney-General has acted in a most improper fashion in the discharge of the duties of his office; and that that improper fashion of acting is shown as much by what he has done as by what he has refused to do.  The Attorney-General is responsible for the administration of criminal justice and for the conduct of prosecutions in every court in this country.  It is within the unfettered judgment of the Attorney-General whether a prosecution will be brought or not brought, and the method in which a prosecution is to be carried on lies also within his unfettered judgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I charge the Attorney-General with acting in a most improper fashion in the discharge of his duties.  I charge the Attorney-General, through his counsel, as he is responsible for the counsel whom he appoints, with endeavouring to have men convicted against whom he knows there is no legal evidence.  I charge the Attorney-General, through his counsel, with endeavouring to secure convictions <i>per fas et nefas</i>, by fair means or foul.  I charge the Attorney-General, not only with endeavouring to get, but actually succeeding in getting verdicts which he knows, and which everybody knows, to be verdicts which could not be sustained in law.  I charge him with obtaining verdicts through his counsel and having men sent to prison in cases  which, if he properly discharged the duties of his office and did it fairly and honourably, he would enter a <i>nolle <Col N="134" /> prosequi</i> because there was no evidence against those men.  He should not allow the Military Tribunal or any court to convict any persons who, in law, have committed no crime, or against whom, in law, there is no evidence of having committed a crime.  Yet he has done so.</P>
    <P>I could give plenty of instances to this House but, owing to the very short time we are given to consider the Estimates, I do not wish to take up the time of the House by going into specific cases in detail.  I will say this much: that when you get a case, such as one to which I have referred in the House on a previous occasion, where there is a revolver found in an open shed to which any member of the public had access, it is against the law and against decided cases, that the man in question should be found guilty.  Yet men have been found guilty on evidence, or the absence of evidence, such as that and have served or are now serving terms of imprisonment, though there was not one scintilla of evidence which would justify any court in convicting them.  I will not say that the Attorney-General has been quite impartial; I will not say that he has leant with an equally heavy hand on the I.R.A. as he has upon followers of this Party, but he has not let even the I.R.A. off scot-free.  I have no brief for that body; but there are members of the I.R.A. in prison at present against whom there was no evidence which would justify a conviction.</P>
    <P>I am only dealing now with the general question.  Nobody should be found guilty unless there is legal evidence against him, and the Attorney-General should not allow a case to go to the Military Tribunal unless there is evidence upon which the Tribunal could act.  I go further and I say that the Attorney-General is doing wrong, and the counsel acting for him are doing grievous wrong, if they tender in evidence what they know themselves not to be evidence.  It is a wrong thing, and has always been against the high traditions of the profession to which I belong, and to which the Attorney-General belongs, that a person should not get fair play.  It is against the high traditions of the profession <Col N="135" /> that any underhand method should be undertaken for securing a conviction.  It is against the traditions of our profession that anything should be put in in evidence by prosecuting counsel or tendered by prosecuting counsel which he himself knows not to be evidence.  The Attorney-General knows that and the country knows that.  But the Attorney-General and his counsel are not acting upon that salutary rule.  They are, day by day, putting in evidence things which they know not to be evidence.</P>
    <P>There is one very great and glaring example of it, and I would like to hear, when the Attorney-General comes to reply, how he will explain this.  If there is one principle which is deeply embedded in our law it is that no statement made by an accused man is admissible in evidence except as a free and voluntary confession.  It follows from that that no statement made in answer to interrogatories or questions put to any accused person under Article 2A of the Constitution can possibly be made admissible in evidence.  The Attorney-General knows that, and he must know that it is elementary law.  A statement, to be admissible as a confession, must be free and voluntary.  Nobody can say&mdash; it is a contradiction in terms to say&mdash; that a thing is voluntary where a man is told that unless he makes a confession he will be liable to be sent before the Military Tribunal, where he will be sentenced to a term of imprisonment. A confession is just as voluntary, or involuntary, and forced, if a man is told: &ldquo;You will get six or nine months for not making a statement&rdquo; as if he were told he would get his head broken.  Yet the Attorney-General, through his counsel, is deliberately putting in statements of that nature for the purpose of getting men convicted, and the Attorney-General cannot deny the fact.  What is important is that as soon as a question is put under Article 2A of the Constitution any statement subsequently made by that person to whom these questions have been put becomes evidence.  The fact that the questions were put, to <Col N="136" /> commence with, prevents the confession from being free and voluntary, and prevents any subsequent statements to the Guards being regarded as a voluntary confession.  That is perfectly well established law in this country.  I do not want to weary the House, consisting largely of laymen, by reading many precedents.  I will take the case of one man, named Doherty, decided by Chief Justice Whiteside and Baron Fitzgerald.  It is a case where a prisoner was told by a constable at 10 a.m. that it would be better for him to tell the truth and not to be putting people to extremes afterwards, and the admission by the prisoner to another constable at 6 p.m. the same day, which was not allowed to be put in evidence although the second constable had previously cautioned the prisoner.  That is the principle under which the law was always administered.</P>
    <P>There was a decision of the Lord Chief Baron, who stood very high and was at the very summit of the pinnacle of the judges of his generation&mdash;there was a decision by him which I admit went too far in law, that in no circumstances whatever was a statement made to the police to be put in evidence.  But that does not arise here. I only mention it to show the tendency of the judges in the country to prevent forced confessions being put in evidence.  Here we have case after case in which statements to the Guards which are not free and voluntary and cannot be argued as free and voluntary, because if they are not made the person has committed an offence for which he can be punished, are tendered day by day by the Attorney-General, through his counsel, before the Military Tribunal and he cannot deny that.</P>
    <P>There is another matter with which I would like to deal.  The Military Tribunal, and the Attorney-General cannot deny this, are as much bound by the law of evidence as any other court. They have power under Section 5, subsection (2) to regulate their own procedure but they have no power to alter the law by one jot or tittle.  Therefore, <Col N="137" /> they are largely at the mercy of the Attorney-General.  They are not trained lawyers and must trust that they will be guided rightly in the law by the Attorney-General or his counsel. It is the duty of the Attorney-General or his counsel to see that the Military Tribunal are kept straight in law, and that whenever a question is doubtful in law the prisoner shall get the benefit of that doubt.  Whether it be the law of evidence or ordinary criminal law, if there is any doubt where there is a tribunal before whom the matter can be argued, it is the bounden duty of the Attorney-General to see that the prisoner gets the benefit of the doubt as to what the law may be.  I think every single member of this House will agree with me in that assertion.</P>

      <P>And furthermore, the Attorney-General must know that the practice which is taking place of writing on documents containing statements forced from accused persons the words: &ldquo;I make this statement freely and voluntarily&rdquo; after it is completed&mdash;that signed statements such as that are not worth the paper they are written on.  A statement not freely and voluntarily made but made under compulsion is of little value.</P>
      <P>There is another matter which I can only touch upon briefly for two reasons. In the first place the Attorney-General is not responsible for the Guards, and, in the second place, the brutalities which are charged against certain members of Colonel Broy's new recruits &mdash;appalling brutalities, the nature of one so indecent that I could not now in any circumstances mention it to the House&mdash;are to be the subject of proceedings.  I am not going to quote that matter against the Attorney-General because as I said he is not responsible for the Guards and secondly, because I know that legal proceedings have been taken against certain Guards who have been charged with the commission of these appalling outrages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Attorney-General must know and the whole country knows, and certainly Deputy Corry's county knows, <Col N="138" /> that there are third degree methods used on unfortunate prisoners in the barracks of that county which would shame the State of New York where third degree is supposed to be brought to a great state of perfection and the confessions extracted by that method as the Attorney-General must know are put forward as free and voluntary confessions before the Military Tribunal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is as clear as daylight that these statements are not admissible in evidence. Every trained lawyer before whom such statements are tendered has refused to admit them in evidence.  Every District Justice has refused to admit them in evidence.  Judge McElligott refused to admit them in evidence, yet the Attorney-General, through his counsel, is endeavouring to get them accepted as evidence.  I leave it to the House to say whether that is fair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is desperately hard.  I am hitting a bit too hard for Deputy Corry, I am afraid. Those are facts which the Attorney-General cannot deny.  Anybody who has read the papers of the last two or three days will have seen the very point raised of a confession extorted from a man under the powers conferred by Article 2 A of the Constitution put in evidence by the Attorney-General's counsel, who argued, with, of course, the authority of the Attorney-General, and, I suppose, by the instructions of the Attorney-General, because I presume <Col N="139" /> the Attorney-General read the papers in the case, as it was his duty to do, that a confession is voluntary when the man who makes it is liable to a term of imprisonment unless he makes it.  That things are voluntary and involuntary at the same time is the magnificent proposition which the Attorney-General will have to stand over in this House.  I should like to know how he will do it.</P>
      <P>I have only dealt rather briefly with these matters, because I do not wish to take up the time of the House at any very great length upon this question, but I want to impress on the House as strongly as I can that nothing is worse for the administration of the law, nothing can bring the law into greater contempt, than that the Attorney-General should deliberately endeavour, and, unfortunately, taking advantage of the want of legal knowledge on the part of the Military Tribunal, succeed, to have men convicted against whom no evidence can be produced.  No legal evidence is produced or can be produced.  The duty of the Attorney-General and the duty of his counsel is the old duty which has always been recognised, as I have said, by prosecuting counsel at the Irish Bar &mdash;the duty to the prisoner.  Especially there is a duty in the prosecuting counsel towards the prisoner who is undefended and the Attorney-General is under the greater obligation of seeing the prosecutions are conducted fairly and that no illegal evidence is admitted, because the Attorney-General knows that, largely owing to the way in which he has conducted his prosecutions, a very large number of counsel at the Irish Bar have made up their minds that they will never appear before the Military Tribunal again because the Attorney-General has reduced trials there to a travesty of justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Attorney-General knows, or should know, that a large number of counsel who had experience of the way in which cases are conducted and results arrived at in that court have decided that they will never enter the doors of that court again and never defend prisoners in such an atmosphere <Col N="140" /> again.  Because that is so and because the Attorney-General, through his method of prosecution, has brought that Military Tribunal as low in the public estimation as he has brought it, the Attorney-General ought to make redoubled efforts to endeavour to restore some sort of public confidence in the Tribunal and to endeavour to let the country know that men are getting, as they ought to get, something approaching a fair run in that Tribunal.  Prisoners are not getting it, as I have said.  It is not confined to one side, I admit.  It is not confined entirely to the followers of Fine Gael.  Prisoners who come from a political association which I personally abhor are likewise being convicted without any evidence against them, and no matter how much I may abhor the association to which they belong, I do say that, so far as I am concerned, wherever I see a miscarriage of justice, wherever I see men convicted of a crime where there is no legal evidence to convict them of that crime, whether they be my political opponents or whether they think as I do in public matters, I will raise my voice in protest in this House against such a course of conduct.</P>
    <P>There is another matter with which I want to deal and it is the manner in which the Attorney-General is making use of certificates coming from the Minister for Justice which he knows to be false certificates.  In this House, I have twice charged the Minister for Justice and once the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I said I would not press the charge against the Minister for Industry and Commerce because the certificate he gave may have been, and probably was, given in good faith, but nobody could say that the certificate given by the Minister for Justice was given in good faith. I charged the Minister for Justice, on his own Estimate, and the Minister sat dumb.  I charged him again in case one of the gravest charges that could be made against his personal honour might, by any strange chance, have escaped his notice, on the President's Estimate.  I charged him in respect of the certificate he gave in the case of Clifford and I gave full particulars <Col N="141" /> to the House then and need not repeat them now.  The Attorney-General is just as well able to see that a certificate is false as I or anybody else.  It was obvious and patent upon it.  I daresay there are a good number of other cases but I saw the papers in Clifford's case myself and that is why I press it home.  The Attorney-General cannot wash his hands and say that the crime is the crime of the Minister for Justice.  He can no more wash his hands of that than he can wash his hands of the wrong things being done by prosecuting counsel in his name. He is responsible, and the washing of hands method, which did not avail Pontius Pilate, will not avail the Attorney-General.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy seems to suggest that I washed my hands of what counsel did on my behalf.  I never did.  I have always accepted their actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall be interested to hear what explanation the Attorney-General will give of the admission and pressing on the court of evidence which he knows to be illegal evidence.  I do not say that all his counsel do it.  I want to be careful.  A great number of counsel instructed by the Attorney-General prosecute perfectly fairly.  I want to make that clear.  I am not charging all his counsel by any means, but I am charging the counsel who put in evidence what they know not to be evidence.  I know that there are counsel whom the Attorney-General briefs who are men of high honour and who would not dream of putting statements such as that in evidence, but there are others who do put them in evidence and the Attorney-General is responsible.  The guilt is his and if, as is undoubtedly the case now, people in this country do not regard a conviction by the Military Tribunal as showing either the guilt or innocence of a man, but simply brush it aside, it is due to the fact that the Attorney-General has not watched over the decisions of that Military Tribunal as he should have and has not carefully seen that no innocent person was ever convicted, and certainly that no person who in law ought <Col N="142" /> not to have been convicted was convicted. I know the blame may not be all his.  I give him that credit.  The Military Tribunal would be a much better court if the Executive Council had done its duty, but I cannot deal with that question now.  I do not really care very much how far you apportion the blame as between the Executive Council and the Attorney-General, but the fact remains that the Attorney-General, by his method of prosecuting, has brought that court at the present moment into such disrepute that a conviction by it or an acquittal by it&mdash;such few cases of acquittal as there are&mdash; does not in the public mind establish the guilt or the innocence of the person charged or does not even tend to establish the guilt or the innocence of the person charged.</P>
      <P>I have dealt as shortly and as concisely as it lay in my power with some, the chief as I think, of the Attorney-General's sins of omission, but I am going now to deal with the Attorney-General's great sin of omission.  I am going now to deal with the thing which has put a stain upon the reputation of the Attorney-General that nothing on earth can ever wipe out.  I am going to deal with the non-prosecution of members of the Civic Guard, of Colonel Broy's new recruits, who shot down a number of men and murdered one, in Marsh's Yard, in Cork.  When I dealt with that matter last, the Attorney-General made two excuses.  He said that there was no precedent for an Attorney-General putting upon their trial guards or police who had been guilty of shooting citizens of this country.  He said that there was absolutely no difference between military and police in the matter of shooting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the difference between military and policy goes, if he reads the Fetherstone Colliery case, which is the leading case on the subject, and Lord Burns' decision and report, they are looked upon as being the best summary of the law on that matter which could be got.  If he comes to a case nearer home and considers the report on the shooting at Bachelor's Walk in 1914, he will find that the British Government, when citizens of Dublin were shot down, thought it <Col N="143" /> worth while to enquire into the matter. But in 1934 when citizens are shot down in Cork the Government and the Attorney-General do not consider any prosecution necessary.  In both these cases it was laid down clearly that military may shoot where the police cannot, because the soldier has one weapon and one weapon only.  He has got his rifle and nothing else, but the police have got their batons and until they have used their batons and shown that the use of their batons is insufficient, they are not justified in firing.</P>
    <P>Indeed, in the Bachelor's Walk Inquiry, the Commissioners held as a fact that if the troops who fired on the crowd in Bachelor's Walk had been accompanied by the Dublin Metropolitan Police, firing need not and would not have taken place.  Yet the Attorney-General made the case that there was absolutely no precedent for the Attorney-General prosecuting police who had been guilty of firing upon a crowd.  Granted there was not, is the Attorney-General going to stand over this position, that the police are wantonly to fire on a crowd, that they are to be the judges as to when they can shoot down citizens of the State, and, if they so shoot down citizens of the State, then the Attorney-General is to put forward, as he has already put forward, a doctrine which, in my humble judgment, is a contemptible doctrine?  But the Attorney-General is quite wrong in his opinion. In the case of the Borrisokane riots, Chief Baron Joy, who was then Attorney-General, did put two members of the then police force on trial. What is more, in order that there might be no question at all, such was his opinion of the value of human life, so different was his opinion from that of his successor, the present Attorney-General, that not only did he put the police who fired on their trial, but he sent up to the Grand Jury a bill against Captain Dodd, the magistrate who read the Riot Act.</P>
    <P>It is true the Grand Jury flung out the Bill against Captain Dodd but the Attorney-General did what he could&mdash; he cloaked nothing&mdash;to see that there <Col N="144" /> would be a full investigation and the men were put upon their trial by the then Attorney-General, the Chief Baron Joy, in a case not half as strong as the Cork case.  In that case the Riot Act had been read.  In that case every opportunity had been given to the people to clear away.  It was a case not one-tenth as strong as this particular case, but the then Attorney-General Joy considered it part of his duty, and rightly considered it part of his duty, to put the police on trial. Our new Attorney-General on the new principle that the life of a wretched Cork boy is not worth considering, says, in effect: &ldquo;What if the Guards did shoot him?&rdquo; That did not matter; I suppose the Attorney-General thinks that a Cork boy more or less does not matter.  In consequence the men who fired at him, who coolly and deliberately shot down his comrades and himself and who murdered him&mdash;I shall call it murder until it is shown to the contrary&mdash;go scot-free.  Not only does the Attorney-General promote them, but he permlts them to go scot-free.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with this case of the Marsh's Yard shooting in this House before, but since I referred to it previously a pronouncement has been made by the highest authority in County Cork in matters appertaining to justice and religion.  A pronouncement has been made by Dr. Cohalan, the Bishop of Cork.  I shall just quote a few words from it here.  At Glanmire Parish Church, which was the parish church of Michael Patrick Lynch, when giving confirmation there, Dr. Cohalan referred to the shooting of this boy, and what he says is this:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There was one grave violation of justice by public authority in relation to a boy of the parish since my last visit for confirmation.  I avail myself of this visit to the parish to express and convey my sympathy to the father and mother of the young man, Michael Patrick Lynch, who was killed in Marsh's Yard, Cork, and to say that some reparation should be made by the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a clear and important statement by a man whose duty it is, when occurrences of this nature take place, <Col N="145" /> to say what are the views and teachings of the Church.  He expressed them in very quiet, dignified language. &ldquo;There was one grave violation of justice by public authority.&rdquo;  He is responsible, as far as one man can be, for the upholding of Christianity and the law of the Church in the diocese which he rules.  The Attorney-General is responsible for the maintenance of civil law in this country.  The one speaking on behalf of the Church says deliberately that there has been a violation of the eternal principles of justice&mdash;a grave violation of justice by the public authority.  The Attorney-General says there has been no breach of the law at all.  The Fianna Fáil Party have a very nice problem to face to-night.  They will have to vote one way or the other.  They will have to approve the Attorney-General and disapprove the moral law or they will have to approve the moral law and disapprove the Attorney-General.</P>

      <P>These are not my words.  They do not rest on my authority.  They rest on the authority of the Bishop of Cork who says that there was a grave violation of justice.  The statement goes on to say that there were three stages in this particular shooting.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The first stage was when a motor lorry was seen to be driven at a very dangerous speed towards the entrance gate of the auction yard. One would say that, at that stage, if the Civic Guards feared danger to life, they should give some warning and, if the warning was unheeded, one would not blame them for firing. The second stage was when the motor lorry crashed through the gate.  It was said that a few persons were injured.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is not correct, but it is not material.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;But once a law is violated it is for the courts and not for the police agents to deal with the case.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="146" /> Surely that is correct.  Surely that is the view the House takes&mdash;that it is for the courts and not for the police to deal with the case.  If a man has broken the law it is for the courts to punish him and not for the police to shoot him down in cold blood.  The punishment for breaking into a yard is not punishment to death or serious injury.  But it was punishment to death which the Guards inflicted on Michael Patrick Lynch.  The statement goes on&mdash;and this in the crucial part:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The third stage was when the motor lorry was brought to a standstill at the centre of the auction yard. There was not a machine-gun or rifle or shot-gun among the men in the motor lorry.  Michael Patrick Lynch was not of the lorry party at all.  Yet, the agents of the Government fired deliberately at these unarmed men, when there was no question or danger of an attack on anybody.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There we have an impartial man reading the evidence and coming to the only conclusion to which anybody who read the evidence could come.  The statement goes on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Surely it was wrong.  And surely the Government owe some reparation to the father and mother of the boy who was killed.  We have much to criticise and condemn in the relations of England to Ireland.  We have much to learn, too, from the English mode of Government.  If a grave injury like this were committed, even by mishap, reparation would be made.  A friendly expression of sympathy from the Government and some reparation would be far better than any legal proceedings.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am not dealing with the question of reparation.  It is not germane to the issue before the House.  What is germane and what the House should really and seriously take into consideration is that, there, an impartial authority, examining the case carefully, not in any hurry but some months afterwards, has come to a clear conclusion as to what took place.  There, we have the clear view of an impartial, highly-placed person whose duty it was to make a pronouncement of this kind. <Col N="147" /> The pronouncement is not rashly made or made in a hurry.  But the Attorney-General brushes it all aside.  The Attorney-General's view is that no matter under what circumstances, no matter when and no matter how the Guards fire upon the people, they are to be the judges and the sole judges. If any Guard decides at any time to shoot down members of a crowd which is hostile to the Government, then the doctrine which the Attorney-General has laid down and will, I suppose, lay down again, is that he is justified and that he will not prosecute.  Where is the law?  Who are to be the judges? Are Colonel Broy's new recruits above the law?  Who has made them the judges of when people should shoot or not shoot&mdash;judges from whom there can be no appeal?  Who has put in their hands powers of life and death? When they take the powers of life and death into their hands, when they shoot without any justification under heaven, the Attorney-General will bow down and say: &ldquo;I dare not prosecute them because there is no precedent.&rdquo; That is the issue now, that is the real issue on which the House will vote when it votes upon the Attorney-General's estimate.  Does it approve of the Attorney-General's conduct?  Does it consider that the life of an ordinary Irish farmer's son is a thing of value or a thing of no value?  Do Deputies think that the Government, without the intervention of the law, without the intervention of the courts, are justified in putting to death any citizen of this State?  That is the principle upon which the House will vote.  If Deputies think that the Government is above the law, that the Guards are above the law, that they have in their hands powers of life and death and may execute these powers at their own sweet will&mdash;if they approve of that doctrine, which is the Attorney-General's doctrine, they will vote for this estimate, which contains the Attorney-General's salary.  But if there is any respect for the law in any member of the Party opposite, if there is any belief that the citizen of this State, has got his God-given rights whether he be the son of a small farmer <Col N="148" /> or of a large farmer or of any other member of the public, then they will vote for the preservation by law of those rights.</P>
    <P>The greatest and first of these God-given rights is the right to live.  No government under heaven has got the right to take away, or to put it into the power of their Guards to take away, the life of an innocent individual or, indeed, of any individual, without trial.  Under the other doctrine, you may get your Hitlerites walking around and murdering their political opponents in the morning.  Is that a doctrine you approve?  Is Hitlerism to come into this country?  Is the Attorney-General, the Minister for Justice and the whole Executive to stand for a policy of that nature?  Are they to stand for the non-punishment of a wanton and deliberate shooting of that nature, for wanton and deliberate it was?  Nobody can deny that.  The facts were sworn to at an inquest and they are on record.  Yet, the House is asked to support an Attorney-General and to vote for the salary of an Attorney-General who stands behind murder&mdash;an Attorney-General who is standing for the principle that the Guards have a right to shoot down, without cause or excuse offered, the citizens of this State.  I dare say the Party opposite will vote for the Attorney-General.  I do not believe that many members of the Party opposite will do so willingly.  I will give the Party opposite, at least, this credit &mdash;that some of them have some respect for the law and some respect for the sanctity of human life.  They may be forced by their Party Whips and under Party discipline to vote for the Estimate, but I do hope that some of them, at any rate, will have the courage to stand up and say that a crime of that nature is one which will not have their approbation, and that they will not vote for an estimate which contains the salary of an Attorney-General who fails in his duty, who shirks his duty, who, like a coward, runs away from his duty and is afraid to put men upon their trial who have openly committed offences of this <Col N="149" /> nature and who calmly and deliberately swore they took away human life.</P>

      <P>It would have been better for the Opposition if they had put up any other Deputy, folded with the cloak of innocence around him, than Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney.  Any one who will look back on the old official records of the Dáil will see that an individual member of the Gárda Síochána, convicted of having committed three assaults, was described in this House by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney as a perfectly good Guard who was entitled to promotion, doubtless in order that he might proceed to get voluntary statements by this means. When we remember the crowds that used to collect outside the various barracks in Cork city and county listening to the tortured wails of the prisoners making voluntary statements inside during Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's reign, when we remember the men who were taken out along the lonely roads and beaten up, and remember the prisoners brought into the barracks and found five minutes after they had been released outside the barracks&mdash;within ten feet of the barracks&mdash;with their skulls broken in with the butts of revolvers, when we remember all these things and think of the voluntary statements, then we know the perfectly fair show that was given; the perfectly fair show that Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney now talks about. Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney was very happy in those days screening behind the fact that those men would not recognise the court.  When he makes statements now he should remember that on every occasion on which there was a complaint made here of the conduct of the Guards and told that it was his duty to prosecute the Guards concerned he would not do it.</P>

It is within the recollection of the House, and of the Deputy who raised the point of order, that Deputies have (in discussion of these Estimates) gone back to 1933 or even 1922, for the stated purpose of contrasting the present administration with the past.

      <P>Now, they are squealing under their own whip.  We have also been accused in connection with the shooting in Marsh's Yard.  I do not want to go into that matter very much except to say that the responsibility for the Marsh's Yard shooting rests with the legal advisers who advised these people on bad law: those who advised them to carry out this work and who had not the courage themselves to stand in the gap. Instead, they brought in their dupes, innocent country fools, and let them go into the breach that they themselves ran away from.  The same cowards came along the other day and signed their cheques to pay before they would let even their cows go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="151" /> There is one other matter that was alluded to here.  Whilst I pay every respect to the Church and to the teaching of the Church as far as my duties to the Church are concerned, still, when I hear the Bishop of Cork alluded to as an impartial man and an impartial teacher in this matter, I cannot forget the excommunication orders that were issued by the same Bishop against the soldiers of Ireland in 1920 and 1921 when we were at death-grips with the &ldquo;Tans.&rdquo;  Neither can I forget his silence when four young Irishmen were pulled out and murdered in 1922.  If he had broken his silence then he would have spared many a good life. I think his pronouncement now, when his relatives are breaking the law, when their cattle are being seized for unpaid annuities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not wish to go into that matter at any length except to make these two statements.  I think I would not be doing my duty to my people if I did not make them.  As far as Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's statements to-night are concerned, we all know the difficulties that the Minister for Justice and the Attorney-General had to contend with.  We all know the kind of a Gárda force they got over. We cannot blind ourselves to the Gárda force that was there for 12 years&mdash;that was being taught every illegality&mdash;a Gárda force in which an assault on an unfortunate I.R.A. man was considered a step to promotion. We cannot forget these things and, therefore, we cannot forget the difficulties <Col N="152" /> there were in weeding out that particular murder gang that was introduced here, and that has labelled the Deputy opposite for all time as the Deputy of the kicking cow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The last speaker dealt with old history.  It would be well for everybody, and particularly for the country, if as much of that history as possible could be forgotten.  I do not see what use it is to anybody at this time to be recalling that history.  There is one comment to be made on the speech made by the last speaker, and who has now left the House, that it squares very badly with the present tactics of the Government.  Some years ago some of the Gárda Síochána were charged with being a murder gang.  Does the Deputy not realise that when such charges were made they were made against our own countrymen? I think it was very bad taste to make such charges against any body of Irishmen.  If it was right that the law should be obeyed at Marsh's Yard, it was equally right that the law should be obeyed at the time Deputy Corry spoke of.  When the Deputy referred to Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney and the kicking cow, and what that is associated with, he should remember that Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney was only administering the law as Deputy Ruttledge, the present Minister for Justice, is administering the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the reaping up of old sores of that kind is going to do any good.  At best all who do that from a particular point of view, only level charges against a body of Irishmen.  Outsiders can only say to it: &ldquo;Well, that is the Irish.  What else can you think of them?&rdquo; If what produced the occurrence at Marsh's Yard was faced up to in a proper manner, this question could have been dealt with long ago, and the extra charges that have to be borne by the Exchequer would not arise.  Under the gag and the closure we were prevented from developing an aspect of this question that impinges on the Vote for <Col N="153" /> Law Charges.  The Minister for Agriculture remarked, by way of a challenge, that if any Deputy wanted to put down a motion time would be given for its discussion.  The Minister for Finance tried to build up a case for the payment of imaginary sums to help the agricultural industry.  The climax or anti-climax of Marsh's Yard is connected with Law Charges and arose out of the Government not facing up to the situation that was created here. That situation was created owing to the economic war, and the withholding of payments to England.  I am not going into the rights or wrongs of that now.  The money was diverted from England.  As a result our Government benefited by the amount diverted but did not compensate the people who had paid.  In that way the Government was false to the farming community.</P>

Statements were made that other people rushed young fellows up there in lorries and that the Guards fired on them.  I heard the Minister for Justice saying that the Guards who shot young Lynch were promoted.  I do not want to identify anyone, but it was stated that there was promotion.  I am not saying that the Minister said it was any particular Guard who shot at young Lynch was promoted.  I was a charge under this Vote for Law Charges but that may not be for the year under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Was there anything wrong about that?  I paid my share when the Minister did not pay his share.  He incurred expense equally with the Deputy.  He is going away and can take that with him.  The Attorney-General came into the case. I have nothing to say to the Attorney-General for the way in which he conducted <Col N="154" /> that case.  I hope he has nothing to say to me.  I made the best case I could and I was convicted and had to look pleasant.  I put it to the Attorney-General that all this agitation and all the passive or active resistance has come about because of the position in which these people found themselves.  There has been a charge on the Exchequer and that charge will continue to increase on this Vote.  The Government should be above sections and should accept a challenge when it has been given.  It has often been stated that there was an organised decision not to pay.  I am putting another interpretation on that.  I put it to the Attorney-General that he should advise the Executive Council to face up to the situation, and to investigate the cause of the trouble. As far as an individual could do that, I did it by Questions in this House. There was a motion on the Order Paper in connection with the matter, if it has not been forgotten.  I should like the Attorney-General to have the matter faced up to.  From what I know of the Attorney-General he must consider his duty unpleasant, because no Irishman wants to be the agent for prosecuting people of this class.  The Attorney-General should put it up to the Government&mdash;probably it would be best to put it to the President&mdash;to investigate the position of the agricultural community, arising out of the mix-up with England during the last two or three years, seeing that it is increasing Law Charges, police charges and in a variety of ways is bringing the new section of the Gárda Síochána more or less into contempt.  There is a popular belief in many quarters that that section of the Guards is being used for a certain purpose.  I know that they are being used.  Deputy Corry referred to people who put young fellows into lorries and ran them up against the law at Marsh's Yard.  Why do not the knaves up along the Border, who have the police acting as their agents in Clonmel and Fermoy, come into the open?  I know what I am talking about when I say that, and I can give the Attorney-General the names.</P>

      <P>I suppose he may be deemed for the time being to represent that arm of the law.  If anything occurred the Attorney-General would very soon come into the matter I am now discussing.  I know that he came across my path.  The sore is there, and the only way it can be dealt with is by the peaceful way of an investigation. These people rightly or wrongly &mdash;I say rightly&mdash;hold that they are suffering under a great grievance Why is it not investigated?  If it was investigated, and if there was a decision on it, no matter what the decision was, the position would be very different from what it is now.  Those people believe they have paid already, and they look upon it as robbery under arms to make them pay again, and that is how I look upon it.  For any man to be forced to pay his annuity by the Government at present, and for Government money to be spent on its collection, I consider as bad as if the Government went up to a man and put a revolver to his head and threatened to blow out his brains if he did not hand over his purse.  That is my honest conviction and that is the honest conviction of thousands, and even hundreds of thousands, of people in this country.  Why is it not investigated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister for Agriculture is not here at the moment. When he was here he said that if anybody &ldquo;over there&rdquo;&mdash;with a wave of his hand&mdash;would put down a motion to discuss agriculture, time would be given to them for its discussion.  As I say, I am sorry he is not here now so that I could question him, but I will ask him for time at the first opportunity. The Attorney-General comes into all these cases by virtue of his office.  Before arraigning people before <Col N="156" /> a Civil Court and charging them with these things, would it not be better for the country if these things never happened? If there is any chance of preventing that offence being committed, would it not be the best thing to try to prevent it, and why is not every avenue exhausted?  The people believe that they have paid already, and why is not their claim investigated?  I hope that the Attorney-General when he is replying will tell us why it is not investigated, or will he promise to use his influence in the proper quarter to have the matter investigated?</P>

      <P>I want to approach this matter from a different angle.  I should like to draw the Attorney-General's attention to the matter of the employment of counsel by the Attorney-General in many of the cases which have been brought before the courts and, particularly, before the Military Tribunal.  It is the opinion of many people and, speaking as a layman who does not know very much about the legal side of things, it seems to me also that the Attorney-General appears to want to have a full array of counsel even for what might be looked upon as a comparatively simple case.  I have seen a case where there were as many as four senior counsel with one or two junior counsel engaged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the statement, according to the information given to me, that in one case where the Attorney-General employed more counsel than it is the custom to <Col N="157" /> employ on a case of that sort, the case having gone in favour of the State, the counsel employed by the Attorney-General demanded fees which, I am informed, were nearly double the fees which would be ordinarily given.  I dare say that those fees are subject to review by the Master or somebody else.  Speaking as a layman, I do not know whether they are or not; but that is my information and I should like to get from the Attorney-General, when he is replying, some information as to whether there is a basis upon which counsel are employed or whether it is just a case that the Attorney-General takes a sort of humour and says: &ldquo;We will have two senior counsel and one junior counsel on this case,&rdquo; or &ldquo;We will have one senior and just a junior counsel,&rdquo; and so on.  On that point also, I should like to know whether it is on the Attorney-General's instruction, and at the public expense, that we have counsel for the State going into court in certain cases and giving lectures on the different forms of republicanism.  We had a notorious case a few months ago of a counsel appearing for the State as Prosecutor getting up in court and spending hours giving a lecture to the court and to the prisoners on the reasons why they could not claim the same continuity from the Republic as the President had claimed up to a certain period.  Are we to pay public funds for that sort of performance, or are counsel to be allowed to drag in any irrelevancies so as to get refreshers &mdash;I think that is what they are called &mdash;to add to their own fees?  Was it on the instructions of the Attorney-General that this imposing performance took place on that occasion?  I must say that I am quite certain it was not on his instructions that that was done.  I am sure that the Attorney-General was as surprised, and perhaps as disgusted, as anybody else in the country when he read this statement in the courts.  The prisoners were not professionally represented and the counsel took advantage of that fact and proceeded to expound how the constitution of the I.R.A. of to-day differed fundamentally from the <Col N="158" /> constitution of the I.R.A. when the present Minister for Industry and Commerce was Minister for Defence in 1925 or 1926, before his Party came into this House; and proceeded, at the expense of the State&mdash;money which we are now asked to sanction here in this House&mdash;to lecture these misguided young fellows upon the error of their ways and to point out to them the statement made here in 1927 or 1928 by the President&mdash;then leader of the Opposition&mdash;about claiming that the rightful authority existed outside of this House and that he could claim the same continuity with those he had left outside in the wilderness as he had claimed from 1921 onwards.</P>
      <P>Surely, we are not to be asked to pay money for performances of that kind and to be put in a position where lawyers who, very recently, so far as the majority are concerned, became supporters of Fianna Fáil, are to be employed&mdash;four or five of them at a time&mdash;and paid at the State expense? That has happened in the last 12 months.  It is known to every Deputy in this House, and I say that the Attorney-General has a very strong responsibility in the matter seeing that he is in the position of accounting for the expenditure of every penny in this Estimate.  I submit that he is not at liberty to employ more counsel than is necessary in order to see that justice is secured, whether the case is before the Military Tribunal or the ordinary courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I should like to refer before I sit down. I think that there does not seem to be what one might call that strict impartiality that there should be.  One reads in the papers&mdash;personally, I am speaking here altogether of things I have read in the papers&mdash;of members of some organisation and some who were not members, or alleged that they were not members of any organisation, being brought before the district justice on serious charges&mdash;far more serious charges than other charges levelled against members of other organisations who were brought before the Military Tribunal.  The Attorney-General knows that people belonging <Col N="159" /> to the I.R.A., or who were alleged to belong to it, have been brought before the district justice on a charge of possession of arms, whereas in other cases, which ought to be quite simple cases, men were brought before the Military Tribunal because they were, or were alleged to be, members of the Blueshirts.  If that is a fact, it seems to me that it is something the Attorney-General ought to be ashamed of.  I should like him to deal with that matter when he is replying.</P>

      <P>As I have said <Col N="160" /> already, I only know this from what I can gather from the newspapers.  That is my only means of finding out the facts, and I have read in the newspapers of cases brought before the district justice which were far more serious than other cases that were brought before the Military Tribunal. I make that allegation now and it is for the Attorney-General to deal with it when he is replying.</P>
