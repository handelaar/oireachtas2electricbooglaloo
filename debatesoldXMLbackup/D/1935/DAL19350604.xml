      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle (for Mr. Morrissey)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether in view of the fact that large numbers of men who were employed on building schemes are now owing to the completion of many of those schemes, unemployed, he will urge on local authorities the necessity of undertaking, as soon as possible, necessary sewerage and other schemes which would give employment.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept as an accurate description of the general position the implication contained in the first part of the question that large numbers of men employed on building schemes are now unemployed.  The number employed on such schemes throughout the Saorstát has remained constant since November last.  There has been a decrease in the number of unskilled men employed on schemes in Tipperary N.R. which are nearing completion. In the South Riding of the county tenders are being invited for over 600 cottages.  In the urban districts in the North and South Ridings of the country, with the exception of Nenagh, new schemes which are well advanced should absorb all unskilled labour that has been temporarily unemployed.</P>

      <P>On 14th May, 1935, a notice was published in <i>Iris Oífigíuíl</i> to the effect that the Executive Council intended to make an Order under Section 17 of the Control of Manufactures Act, 1934, declaring knitted fabric made wholly or mainly of artificial silk to be a reserved commodity. The notice contained the provision that any person objecting to the making of the proposed Order might, within 30 days after the 14th May, 1935, send in writing to the Secretary of the Executive Council a statement of his objection, and of the specific grounds on which it was based.</P>
      <P>The Act requires that the Executive Council shall not make such Order until the expiration of the time limited for making objections, and until they have considered such objections (if any) to the making of such Order as may have been made within the time limited for making objections.</P>
      <P>No definite arrangement has yet been made for the granting of a reserved commodity manufacture licence in respect of the commodity in question. Before any such licence is granted, any representations made within the specified time will be fully considered.</P>

      <P>I moved to report progress on this Vote on the last day on which it was before the House.  The President gave us a very sketchy account of the work of the External Affairs Department during the past year.  In particular, he said nothing on this Vote with regard to that aspect of external relations which has, by far, the greatest importance for us&mdash;that is to say, our relations with Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  I propose to confine my remarks to that subject.</P>
      <P>In other countries, strong efforts are made to arrive at some sort of agreed foreign policy as between Government and Opposition Parties, so that there can be continuity when Governments change.  Foreign policy or external policy&mdash;whichever you like to call it&mdash; has a far more vital influence upon home affairs in this country than it has in any other country and, accordingly, the desirability of arriving at agreement and continuity is even greater here than it is elsewhere.  Speaking on this Estimate last year, I pressed for the making of a sincere effort towards arriving at such unanimity and I want to press the same view to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before there can be any hope of getting agreement, there has got to be understanding.  There has got to be clarity.  My principal complaint against the Government on this subject is the complete want of clarity that distinguishes their utterances and the <Col N="2164" /> state of mental confusion in which they seem to be themselves and which they are creating in other people.  Our discussion on the Estimate for the Department of External Affairs will be well worth while if we get any further towards clarifying the situation, as to what the Government and the Fianna Fáil Party really have in their mind, if anything.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we can start by agreement on one thing.  We can say on both sides of the House that we all want to achieve a united Ireland of Thirty-Two Counties as a political entity, and that we want that united Ireland to have the right to determine for herself, at all times, what her constitutional relations shall be with Great Britain, or with any other part of the globe.  I think the fact that we can get as far as that ought to be some help and consolation to us, ought to stop us from using violent expressions about each other and casting reflections upon each other's patriotism.  After all, that is the fundamental thing, if anything is.  Further, we can agree upon this, that nobody is in favour of trying to achieve that ideal by force; at least nobody in this House is in favour of trying to achieve it by force. The President of the Executive Council himself has made that quite clear on more than one occasion, and most recently in his speech on his own Department a few days ago, when he announced that if there were a European war, this country would not allow itself to be used as a base for hostile operations by any other country against Great Britain.  Obviously, if there were any intention to attempt to bring partition to an end by force, that declaration of the President could not have been made.  I take this opportunity of saying that I consider his declaration was a statesmanlike one, and can do nothing but good, from whatever point of view you regard it.  I think that we, just as much as his own supporters, must realise the desirability of that particular fear being eliminated from the mind of the British Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2165" /> But if we are all agreed that the ideal cannot be achieved by force, we must be equally agreed that it can only be achieved by persuasion and consent, and I am afraid I must remind the House once again that there has not been the smallest approach since Fianna Fáil came into office towards achieving it along these lines.  It is because I consider that the element of general consent is so necessary, that I have never been able to feel much interest in the question of merely defeating the present Government and the Fianna Fáil Party.  Something more important than that has got to be done.  They have got to be converted; they have got to be induced to change their point of view, because, merely throwing them out of office and leaving them still to continue to act as a fatal barrier in the way of re-union with the North brings us no further towards the accomplishment of our object so far as national policy is concerned.</P>

      <P>The first thing is to try to get our minds clear, and to try, especially to get the minds of Deputies opposite and Ministers clear.  A certain number of ingenious gentlemen, interested in the stories of Conan Doyle about Sherlock Holmes, have tried to reconstruct a private life of Sherlock Holmes, apart from his detective activities, from the various hints about that private life included in the detective stories.  They have never succeeded in producing a coherent life of Sherlock Holmes along these lines because of the multitude of inconsistencies in the <i>obiter dicta</i> which Holmes lets drop in his conversations with Dr. Watson.  One can pardon Conan Doyle for that, because he was writing fiction. But we are in a similar situation if we try to arrive at an understanding of what really is the national policy of the present Government by a study of the speeches of Ministers.  They contradict each other, and they contradict themselves.  I am going to make an attempt to induce the President or some of his colleagues to bring order <Col N="2166" /> out of chaos and to tell us what the Government's policy really is.</P>
      <P>At one time the President speaks in this House as if separation from the British Commonwealth was something that would have to be deferred to a future generation, and, at another time, he speaks as if separation would be achieved in the morning, if only the British Government promised not to make themselves disagreeable in the event of such separation taking place. We had a speech in the Seanad last summer by the Minister for Finance, in which he said that he would hate to think of our future as permanently divorced from that of the people of our blood in Australia and Canada, in which he expressed satisfaction at the nature of our association with these countries, and said that, as far as they were concerned, our association with them was free and voluntary.  He also spoke of the great attraction of continuing association with people of our blood not only in those countries overseas, but even in Great Britain.  He seemed to imply several times in that speech that, provided we got the theoretical recognition of our right to withdraw from the Commonwealth at any time, he, at any rate, would find the arguments in favour of such association as he described overwhelming.  A speech was made in this House last December by Deputy Flinn, in which he referred with indignation to my suggestion that it would be better to have immediate separation for the Twenty-Six Counties than to go on keeping the country in turmoil by a policy of republicanism without a republic.  He made the following comment, and it appears in the Parliamentary Debates, Vol. 54, No. 5, column 1700:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;There is not a man in this House who does not know that when he speaks of the Twenty-Six Counties he speaks of some artificial entity which has no reality in relation to the fundamental matters of his own soul. Yet people who knows that have the effrontery&mdash;there is no other word for it&mdash;to suggest that we can take in our hands the Twenty-Six Counties of Ireland and tear them away from <Col N="2167" /> the rest of the component body of Ireland.  We have no right to do that.  We have no power; we have no will, and we have no intention of doing anything of the kind.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the other hand, we have had speeches, even over this week-end, from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the Minister for Finance, which are in a very different key.  The Minister for Finance has announced his intention of dying a republican in a republic.  I do not know how soon he expects that lamentable event to occur but, at any rate, sooner or later that is his ambition, and moreover, it is to be a republic that has been obtained by the now President of the Executive Council.  What sort of a republic is he talking about?  Is it one for Twenty-Six Counties or one for Thirty-Two Counties?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, over the week-end, said that we would go out of the Commonwealth&mdash;speaking, apparently, of the Twenty-Six Counties&mdash;as soon as it was convenient, economically, for us to do so.  The Minister for Local Government said the same thing.  He claimed that the present Ministry should be entrusted by the Irish people with complete power to choose the day.  But he also refrained from saying, quite specifically, whether he was talking about the existing area of the Irish Free State or of the whole of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assume that those Ministers, who were talking over the week-end on this matter, were talking of the area of the Irish Free State; otherwise, their remarks were merely nonsensical. But, surely, in view of these diverse utterances, we have a right to ask for more clarification.  It is quite impossible to co-operate, however anxious we might be to co-operate, if we cannot make head or tail of the speeches of Ministers.  Let them tell us definitely do they or do they not intend to establish a republic for the area now covered by the Irish Free State at the first moment that they <Col N="2168" /> feel economically strong enough to do so?  Is it their view that there should be a referendum taken of the population of the Irish Free State before they would feel authorised to take the action of establishing a republic for the Twenty-six Counties?  Must they wait until they have cured unemployment or are they prepared to face the possibility of Irish unemployed in Great Britain being deported and sent back here to find employment in this country, possibly in numbers amounting to hundreds of thousands?  In one of his speeches the President suggested that we could not have separation for the Twenty-six Counties until the British Government evacuated their maintenance parties from Cove and Berehaven.  Is that to be taken as an indication of the conditions that must be brought about before any sort of Twenty-six County republic is declared?  Have we got to wait until the British evacuate Cove and Berehaven and Lough Swilly?  All these things are left in a state of most undesirable obscurity.  I ask the President to give us one straight answer as to what he himself, and his colleagues, mean by these various utterances.</P>
    <P>I think that with regard even to the Twenty-six County republic we could go this distance towards agreement: that we would like to see that question disposed of one way or another.  We on this side of the House would be delighted to see it settled on its merits and we do not want to see it settled on the basis of any intimidation either outside or inside this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, speaking last week, quoted from a letter of mine to the <i>Times;</i> and he was unfair enough and audacious enough to imply that I wrote that letter, and the rest of the letters I wrote on the same topic, for the purpose of denying the right of this country to dispose of its own destinies. But in point of fact, every one of my communications to the <i>Times</i> was written for the purpose of asserting that it was desirable from everyone's point of view that we should have freedom of choice as to whether <Col N="2169" /> we would remain within the Commonwealth or not; and while I have never disguised my belief that it was desirable for us to be inside the Commonwealth, I want the question to be dealt with by the Irish people, on its merits, and I am, of course, prepared to acquiesce in any decision the Irish people give on the merits of that question.</P>
    <P>The President says that the whole situation has been what he described as &ldquo;bedevilled&rdquo; by the Treaty.  He took the phrase &ldquo;bedevilled&rdquo; from the ex-Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Hogan.  But Deputy Hogan declared that the whole situation was &ldquo;bedevilled&rdquo; by the President.  The President says that it was &ldquo;bedevilled&rdquo; by the Treaty.  It is an unfortunate fact that in the forefront of our relations with Great Britain there stand two agreements&mdash;the Treaty and the Ultimate Financial Settlement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is interesting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate because in the present state of the world a treaty of any kind has only got to show its nose in order to induce somebody to want to break it. Treaties, like disarmament conferences, seem, in the present state of world opinion, to provoke people into acts of bad feeling and unreasonableness.  I, personally, would rather see relations with any country develop out of the logical facts of the situation than out of any agreement whatsoever. Nevertheless, I cannot admit that the &ldquo;bedevilment&rdquo; of the Irish situation originated with the Treaty.  I think the frame of mind that makes it so difficult for matters to be considered on their merits in Ireland, dates from a good deal longer than that; and, so far as our immediate modern history is concerned I would say it originated from the Carson movement against the 1912 Home Rule Bill and the amount of support that was given to that movement of violence and treason, if treason has any meaning, by British politicians; and that it also originated from the episode called the Curragh Mutiny.  This already exasperated state of mind <Col N="2170" /> was further accentuated by the threat of conscription during the War. While I agree that the Treaty and the ghosts and memories immediately associated with the Treaty have had the effect of preventing many in this country from thinking straight upon a subject on which it is very important that we should think straight, I think that &ldquo;bedevilment&rdquo; began at an earlier date than the date of the Treaty.</P>
      <P>Now, although it is the fashion of the day to make light of engagement of any kind, and to break a treaty where a treaty exists, I suggest to the President that what he has got to keep very much before his mind is that probably there has never been a treaty which should really irritate those whom it affects less than this particular Treaty, because it produced not a static but a dynamic condition of affairs in regard to our relation to the Commonwealth of Nations.  We are put on a level by that treaty with Canada, South Africa, Australia and the rest, and according as their sovereign position has developed, ours has developed also.  I, for one, do not interpret the Treaty as imposing a restriction upon our right to separate the Twenty-Six Counties from the Commonwealth, if we choose to do so.  When the President talks about a forced position, as he continually does, it seems to me that he is talking about the past rather than the present.  Even if the phrase was a fair phrase at any time, I suggest it is not a fair phrase now and that, in fact, he is giving away a part of the Irish case that he should not give away, by suggesting that the Treaty should be interpreted as depriving us of the constitutional position that other parts of the Commonwealth have attained, explicitly attained, since the signing of the Treaty, by the Statute of Westminster and by the general development of constitutional thought throughout the Commonwealth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there is the other agreement which upsets his mind and produces, as he calls it, &ldquo;bedevilment&rdquo;&mdash;the Ultimate Financial Settlement.  There is no sense in taking hold of that document, calling it a thing of shrede and tatters and displaying it here as an <Col N="2171" /> exhibit to excite us all, unless you mean to imply by that exhibition that there is some ambiguity about its terms. Even if there was not anything on paper, that agreement would still, in honour, be a binding agreement, if those who were connected with it, on both sides, were clear on what was agreed to, and that is, after all, the situation.  Even if the agreement had been a verbal one, I maintain it would still be binding upon us.  The fact that it does not seem to have emerged from a solicitor's office for somebody to sign according to correct legal form and that it may not be a polished legal document, is nothing to the purpose unless there is some doubt as to its terms.  There is no such doubt.  There was no novelty in that agreement except such novelties as were favourable to this country.</P>

      <P>It was only an afterthought, a discovery by that ingenious man, Colonel Moore, or somebody else, that there was what he considered a legal flaw in the situation&mdash;a theory on which he had to work very hard for a long period of time before he could get the Party opposite to accept it&mdash;it was only that which brought about the state of affairs and the dispute in which we now find ourselves.  The Ultimate Financial Settlement, it seems to me, is more of a tie, if &ldquo;tie&rdquo; is the word to use, than the Treaty, because the Treaty, as I suggest, created a dynamic constitutional position.  The Ultimate Financial Settlement was a perfectly clear and honourable agreement between two nations with regard to finances.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>That is nothing to the purpose.  Assuming that it were true, it is quite irrelevant.  Both parties having consented to it, it is in honour binding upon us.  Therefore, I suggest there is no reason for getting into a state of righteous indignation about the Ultimate Financial Settlement at all.</P>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that if some hypnotist could get the President of the Executive Council and his colleagues in succession to call upon him, if he could put them into a hypnotic trance and, while in that condition, could suggest to them that there never had been such a thing as a Treaty; if we could start afresh, simply on the basis of the actual facts of the situation and if the hypnotist could make a similar suggestion to the President, even as regards the Ultimate Financial Settlement, I think that the Government, starting afresh and &ldquo;unbedevilled&rdquo;, with those causes of excitement removed from their minds, would arrive at an arrangement with Great Britain, satisfactory to all concerned, very much more easily than they seem at present likely to do.  The President referred contemptuously to my recommendations as Couéism.  But Couéism has its uses.  It has its uses particularly with hypochondriacs who think they are sick when they are not. Couéism would have a very useful effect on the present Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash; who have induced themselves to believe that they are being put upon, and that we are all slaves instead of being free men, when as a matter of fact we are perfectly free and nobody has put anything over on us at all.  Could we not see if it would not be possible to get some way towards a national external policy by getting rid of these complexes with regard to the Treaty and the Ultimate Financial Settlement? After all, I have heard about a certain document&mdash;Document No. 2.  I presume that Document No. 2 would have involved a treaty of some sort.  I do not know whether we have moved away <Col N="2173" /> altogether from Document No. 2 or whether it is still regarded as a satisfactory basis for the relations between Ireland and Great Britain.  It would have involved some sort of agreement, possibly a more static and more rigid agreement than the other.  So the President should not really be quite so severe as he is about the iniquity of anybody who makes a treaty with Great Britain at all.  But, let us get away in thought, from treaties and just think of the logic of the situation looking at the facts of the present day as they are, and starting from there.  If we did that, I cannot help thinking that our path towards an agreed external policy for national affairs would be a very much easier one.</P>
      <P>Over and above the &ldquo;bedevilment&rdquo; created by the existence of these agreements, which grate upon the President so much, there is one other state of mind which stands very much in the way of any sensible progress and that state of mind I can best describe as racialism.  It was exemplified in the debate on the President's Department by the speech of Deputy Cleary.  The Government should make up their minds first and then tell us whether their aim is an Irish Ireland, a Gaelic Ireland, or a Gaelic 26 counties.  Is either a Gaelic 32 counties or a Gaelic 26 counties a sensible object?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very relevant to our external affairs I submit, because if we are to have satisfactory relations with the people across the water, it can only be upon a basis that will hold out some hope of a united Ireland.  I do not see good feeling between this country and Great Britain being brought about until we have some sort of hope or plan for reconciling the people of the North.  That reconciliation with the people of the North is impossible if we allow a spirit of racialism to dominate us.  We have got to take the statesmanlike view that there are two stocks in this country to be reconciled and that our national aspirations, to which Deputy Cleary referred as something that we, on this side, were inviting the country to surrender, <Col N="2174" /> can only be fulfilled by that reconciliation.  Our policy with regard to external affairs includes our attitude with regard to the people in the North. Deputy Cleary, for example, exclaimed that a person like me ought not to be in the Free State at all, but that I ought to be in Northern Ireland doing missionary work among the Northern Unionists.  In my time, I have done a great deal of missionary work among the Northern Unionists.  When contesting West Belfast, I preached the same doctrines of reconciliation and opposition to racialism which I have been preaching here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>If I had been elected by the Northern Unionists the whole problem would have been solved. Unfortunately, I was not.  If I went back much beyond that&mdash;and I could go back 25 years&mdash;I could show Deputy Cleary, or anybody like him, speeches of mine made in Northern Ireland in advocacy of exactly the same principles. There is a great deal of missionary work to be done in Northern Ireland, I quite agree, but, unfortunately, there is a great deal of missionary work to be done here too, and there is a great deal of missionary work to be done in Great Britain and they ought all to be going on simultaneously. Missionary work ought to be going on everywhere for the purpose of bringing about reconciliation, for the purpose of beating down racialism and for the purpose of creating friendly feelings between ourselves and Great Britain and a united national feeling that can be shared by ourselves and the Unionists in Northern Ireland as well as the Nationalists in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I invite, then, Deputies opposite to reflect upon these problems from that point of view.  We are in no way desirous of making Party capital out of external affairs.  We take remarkably little interest indeed in the question of turning the present Government out of office as compared with the far greater achievement, if we could accomplish it, of modifying their point of view.  Every now and then one of <Col N="2175" /> them makes a speech which gives us a glimmer of hope that they are seeing sense, and then, feeling that he has gone a step too far, he makes a speech, a few days or weeks or months later, which completely obliterates the effect of his lapse into sanity.  Take, for example, the famous effort of the Minister for Finance on the subject of the roofless monasteries and Penal Laws.</P>

      <P>The Protestant succession upon which, I understand, Document No. 2 made no attack and which men of our race and blood in Australia and Canada appear to be able to accept without excommunication. I suggest to Ministers and Deputies that they should make a serious effort to clear their minds and give us the benefit of the consequences of that process of clarification, and should present to us a policy that offers some hope of national advance towards union with the North.  Even if they put aside for the time being, as something for a future generation&mdash;though I am all against their doing so&mdash;the question of unity with the North, let them at least see whether we cannot arrive at an agreed policy with regard to the relations between the 26 Counties of the Irish Free State and the British Government.  Let them make it clear whether it is separation for the 26 Counties that they are after; let them make it clear whether they wish the Irish people to have an opportunity of deciding that question on its merits; and let them make it clear what are the conditions under which they think that act of separation would be justified, because if they are going to wait until the British have been turned out of Cove and Berehaven, or until our unemployment problem has been so completely solved that the absorbing of another 200,000 Irishmen from <Col N="2176" /> Great Britain would offer no difficulties to us, or until the British market is of no importance to us, it appears to me that we are going on forever with the state of turmoil here which is produced by this policy of republicanism without a republic.</P>

      <P>The Minister for External Affairs, in introducing this Estimate, followed the example of the President&mdash;no introduction.  I am beginning to think that the President is one of the most naive and simpleminded men in this Assembly.  He has never introduced an Estimate, covering no matter what policy, about which he thinks it is necessary to say anything. His mere presence, his mere existence, so to speak, is sufficient explanation. He generally starts his reply to the various criticisms that are passed on the administration of the Votes for which he is more directly responsible by drawing attention to the fact that as usual the Opposition has started by criticising him because he made no introductory statement.  By this time, it might dawn upon him that the Opposition expects an introductory statement from him and that if he is to make that complaint of his at the beginning of each exculpation of his conduct, it is because he has fallen into the bad habit of telling the House nothing about his policy.  I do not say that it would enlighten the House if he did; I do not say that the country would be anything the clearer.</P>

      <P>It is interesting always.  It might not clarify our minds, but it is very often an interesting effort in gymnastics to watch when the President or the Minister for External Affairs tries to clarify his own mind or the minds of his followers on quite a number of subjects.  Here, at least, we might have expected from him some introductory statement, because I think he will admit that this is a Department about whose activities most of the people in the country know comparatively little.  I am not suggesting for a moment that it is a Department that is not active, but it is certainly a Department on whose activities <Col N="2177" /> the country is not very well enlightened and there was an excellent opportunity for the President to state precisely, or even in general outline, what his Department was doing.  As usual, he refrains from any statement of general policy or any summary of the activities of the particular Department even during the last 12 months.  That, of course, has one great advantage&mdash;I am not suggesting that it is the reason why the President uniformly follows this course&mdash;in that the people who come after him are not in a position to criticise what he has said.  He is in the strategic position of always being able to conclude, and his concluding statement is the only statement he generally makes on an Estimate.  As I say, the strategic advantage of that is so obvious that I am rather slow to attribute it to the President, whose motives, generally speaking, are anything but obvious.  My colleague, Deputy MacDermot, seems to be suffering from an attack of tremendous optimism.  He thinks that because he has put a number of definite questions to the President he is going to get definite answers to any of them.  Everybody knows that he will not.  Does anybody think, with two elections on, that he is going to get a definite answer?  Not likely. Everybody knows it is now a case of policies for everybody.  If you are an out-and-out republican, the Minister for Finance&mdash;he has left the House&mdash; gives you a policy for the moment anyway. If you are a dilatory republican you have the Vice-President.  If you are leaning a little towards Communism the Minister for Defence will threaten the farmers if they do not fall in with Government policy.  If you are not quite sure what policy you stand for you have the President.  Could there be more excellent tactics than that, with two elections on?  No elector need be dissatisfied.  He can take his choice. There is an election in County Dublin, and it is supposed that the conservative element, generally called ex-Unionists, have a considerable vote there.  We have the statement that if England gets into a war this country is safer for her. If you are an out-and-out republican, who takes seriously the statements of <Col N="2178" /> the President and the Vice-President that we have only one possible enemy, there are explanations of that, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody will remember&mdash;at least I remember&mdash;that a couple of days ago I ventured to make a prophecy that we should probably hear something about negotiations for a settlement being again started; that the time had come; that there were elections on.  I ventured to predict, basing my prediction on the experience of every member of this Party, that we should hear whispers through the country coming from people in the confidence of the Government, that a settlement and a good settlement was coming at last.  We have heard that at every election&mdash;by-election, county council election, and every other election.  I ventured to say that here last week, and I got an interruption from the President.  The idea of the thing!  He scoffed at it as coming from their side.  But that very same night the President got up and told the Dáil: &ldquo;We are not going to stab England in the back if there is a fight.&rdquo;  In that way the ball was set rolling, and the ball will keep rolling for the next fortnight.  After that there will be insuperable difficulties to the further rolling of the ball owing to our national position.  We shall be quite ready to enter into business negotiations with Great Britain.  We shall be delighted to settle all those outstanding difficulties, but we are not going to sacrifice our national position. I admit that during the next fortnight it will be rather difficult to keep together all those horses pulling as they are in their different directions, but I have no doubt that the President and Deputy Donnelly between them will manage to keep all those unruly horses in some kind of order, and therefore make an appeal to everybody.  What is the use of the President's making a statement here for an hour, an hour and a half, or two hours, notwithstanding the anxiety of Deputy Little to finish the proceedings quickly?  The net result of any of those statements, so far as the definition of the policy of the country is concerned, is that he has managed to confuse a few extra <Col N="2179" /> minds.  He has added to the number of people who do not know precisely where the country stands, where the Government stands, or where the President stands in relation to any of those things.  I think even Deputies opposite will almost acknowledge that that is the general result of what I have ventured to call a clarifying statement by the President on his position.</P>
    <P>As I say, my colleague Deputy MacDermot is certainly unduly optimistic if he expects anything like&mdash;I was going to say a straight answer&mdash;a definite answer to the very definite questions which he has put.  I venture to say&mdash;and I hope my prophecy will not be as true as the one I made last week&mdash;that after the President's statement Deputy MacDermot will find it still more difficult to know when the Republic is going to be declared, for what area it is going to be declared, and why it is not being declared. Deputy MacDermot also referred to the fact that he was rather shocked at the President's raising, more or less &ldquo;off his own bat,&rdquo; the suggestion that we are not free to leave the Commonwealth.  The suggestion has come, as Deputy MacDermot rightly pointed out, mainly from the President in the last couple of years.  I am not at all sure that the President wants to be clear in his own mind on that matter.  I think he would prefer not to know whether he has that particular constitutional power or not.  I do not think he wants to know that.  I think he has deliberately raised that difficulty because he wants that difficulty there.  That piece of subtlety fits in, I suggest, with the rest of his policy.</P>

      <P>What are the activities of that Department?  Deputy MacDermot has dealt with one particular aspect of what should be the activities of that Department.  I hesitate to think that the rest of the activities are as futile as the clarification of the statement on our relations with Great Britain.  The President is remarkably silent on the matter, so I get a gleam of hope from it; he does not spend the columns over it that he does over our relations with Great Britain, and, therefore, the activities of the Department are possibly carried on in a more normal fashion.  What has it done for him?  He is Minister for External Affairs in this State.  It may be that the Deputies opposite think we should not have our eyes on the end of the earth, and that we have enough and more than enough to do in looking after our own little business here.  That may be true but we have a Department of External Affairs.  We are discussing its estimates.  What is it doing?  Has the Minister any outlook on external affairs?  If he has, he certainly has been remarkably careful to conceal it from the public.  We have representatives in different capitals in Europe. Have they submitted reports to the President on the general or particular situation?  The President may remember that in the course of the last couple of weeks there was raised here by a Deputy in this House&mdash;a man who can claim, at all events, to speak for his whole Party or the 50 per cent. of it which is generally here, Deputy Belton&mdash;the question of European affairs and their possible reactions upon us. We have had no statement from the Government.  We have had no indication that they are the slightest bit interested in those matters.  The only statement on external affairs which we have had from the Government was the humorous peroration to the speech of the Minister for Finance in introducing his Budget.  The last three pages of the Budget statement constituted <Col N="2181" /> the only statement on external affairs which we have had from the Government up to the present, and these were the Minister's most choice pieces of humour.  Here we are discussing the Vote for External Affairs with all the relevant information, if there is any relevant information, not exactly concealed, but certainly not given to the House.</P>
      <P>We have made treaties with different countries.  We do not know whether the Department of External Affairs was or was not active in the negotiation of these treaties, or whether the negotiation of them was confined almost exclusively to the Department of Industry and Commerce.  We have not had an opportunity of discussing the value of these treaties and the price paid.  The President and members of his Party may take up the line that in external affairs we are really so small that we do not count; that in European affairs it is only the larger nations that count.</P>

      <P>Deputy Donnelly may say &ldquo;Hear, hear.&rdquo;  I wonder does that represent the attitude of the President&mdash;that it is only the larger nations that count?  If so, apart from trade relations, why does he not scrap his Department?  I state that if that is the attitude of the President, he is wrong.  I am not pretending for the moment that a small nation does or ever will count as much as a great nation&mdash;it cannot count as much, and it would be absurd if it did&mdash;any more than in a country a small minority should count as much as a large majority; in the same way in international affairs, the small nation cannot count as much as the big nation.  But it does not follow that it is of no account at all, any more than that a minority is of no account, or that its voice cannot be heard on very important matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People may criticise as much as they like the League of Nations, but my experience of it has been this, that there is no place where the small nations can count as much&mdash;altogether out of proportion to their size&mdash;as they do at the League of Nations.  It was <Col N="2182" /> rather illuminating that when the Party now in Opposition were responsible for the Government they did achieve a position of importance, I think, in that Assembly, and they certainly were able to play a part altogether out of proportion to their strength and the size of the country.  That was shown by the fact that, despite a considerable amount of opposition, despite a certain lack of enthusiasm on the part of some members of the League, we did succeed in getting elected to the Council.  That was a tribute, at all events, to the position that we had achieved when the present Government entered into office. The Minister for External Affairs might now at least inform us what use he has made of his office during the years when he was a member, not merely of the League, but of the Council.  For three years this country was a member of the Council.</P>

      <P>His Ministers have been busy abroad.  We heard nothing about their activities.  He has added to their number.  We have heard nothing as to the reasons for the addition&mdash;trade reasons or otherwise.  Did members of his Department negotiate <Col N="2183" /> these trade instruments, be they good or bad, which have been negotiated between this and other countries within recent months?  On that, as usual, the President was silent.  I understand there is a trade treaty with Germany. Quite recently Deputy McGuire raised a matter of some importance to business men in the city and the country, namely, the fact that when foreign documents came into the Customs, they were sent to the business firm concerned to supply a translation because there was nobody in the Customs able to translate the particular documents. The answer of the Minister for Finance was &ldquo;Why should the Customs officials do the business of private firms?&rdquo;  Is the President aware that though he has negotiated a treaty with Germany he has not people in the Customs offices of the capital of the country&mdash;I take the facts as put forward by Deputy McGuire&mdash;capable of making a translation, and is he aware that the Civil Service Commissioners have issued a notice that German is to be no longer a subject for examination?  Is there any kind of co-ordination in the policy of the Government in great matters or in small matters?  As regards the way the President has treated the House on this Vote, the worst thing I can say is that it is characteristic.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>One would have thought that with the return of the leader of the Opposition&mdash;and we are all glad to see him back, and well physically&mdash;there would have been some kind of co-ordination in the speeches delivered from the Opposition Benches.  Mentally, I do not think the leader of the Opposition has much improved, judging from his speeches over the week-end, and possibly that is reacting on his followers. Deputy MacDermot attacked a phrase used by the President last week, that the whole position had been bedevilled by the Treaty, and he switched on also to the Ultimate Financial Settlement. I agree with him to a great extent that the position as regards the North was bedevilled by the Ultimate Financial Settlement, so much so that it has been almost impossible to make any advance. <Col N="2184" /> The whole position was surrendered, so far as the North was concerned, at that particular time.  Not only do the Deputies on this side of the House agree with that attitude, but I think Deputy MacDermot will find quite a lot of his own colleagues of that opinion.  I do not think it could better be described than by a quotation. The whole position was put by Deputy McMenamin in the Batt Hall, Ballybofey, in June, 1927, when he said, referring to the Ultimate Financial Settlement: &ldquo;It was referred to as a White Paper but we regarded it as the blackest document in Irish history since the Act of Union... every claim made by Ireland was surrendered to the British.&rdquo;  That was the opinion offered by Deputy McMenamin of the Ultimate Financial Settlement and the Deputy is one of Deputy MacDermot's colleagues.  That was the general opinion all over the country&mdash;that it was a surrender.  Not only was that the opinion then but it is reacting still.  Prior to that settlement President Cosgrave, as he then was, in a speech that he made at Letterkenny, said: &ldquo;They were standing on the Treaty; on every line of it and every sod, every bit of territory in the North that should go into the Free State would go in.  One of the cleverest men they had in their Party had been appointed to that Commission.&rdquo; That was the Boundary Commission. Certainly, if ever a national position was bedevilled it was bedevilled by the Treaty and it was bedevilled in addition by the Ultimate Financial Settlement.  I agree with Deputy MacDermot that it was bedevilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could go back a little further but it is not necessary; neither is it necessary to reply to Deputy MacDermot with regard to the attitude of the Party.  It was one of those things that do not make for much good.  It was started, we are told, by a lot of politicians here, but Deputy MacDermot could have said it was started by leaders of political thought in England, people who formed the Government there afterwards.  It was these people who came over here to start it.  It was <Col N="2185" /> started by men like Lord Birkenhead.</P>
    <P>The Treaty did bedevil the national position.  And it was worsened afterwards by the Ultimate Financial Settlement which Deputy Cosgrave called a &ldquo;damn good bargain.&rdquo;  A good bargain !  Clause 12 of the Treaty, which protected the people in the North-East, was given as a <i>quid pro quo</i>, and in addition £5,000,000 a year was paid to England.  That was one thing that we were able to rescue from the wreck&mdash; this money that was being exported to England on the strength of this Ultimate Financial Settlement, if we can call the document which the President produced in this House a settlement. But we were able to keep at home that money, and to that extent we have rescued something out of this national settlement.  I was glad to hear Deputy MacDermot speak of his mission in the North.  Next month will be a good time for missionary work in the North.  I suggest that the Deputy should go back to his old constituency and hold a few meetings there, canvass their views, and, when he comes back, let us hear what they say.</P>

      <P>There is the impression sought to be conveyed that the population of the North is wonderfully attached to the Empire.  Well, there is a half million of the population there who are not attached to it.  There is as good a Republican Party there as in any part of Ireland and any time they have been asked to do anything they did not hesitate to do it.  I suggest to Deputy MacDermot that one of the best steps he could take would be to carry out missionary work in the North.  It will improve his own ideas of nationalism and it will lead him along from the path he is following at the moment.  I do suggest to him that he should take a little trip to the Mourne Mountains, along South Down and South Armagh and Tyrone and Fermanagh, and other parts of the North and not allow his whole idea as to the people of the North-East to be formed from the experience he gathered in Belfast.  There is a big <Col N="2186" /> hinterland to that city and in that hinterland of that city he will find views expressed that will at any rate stop him from making the type of speeches that we have been hearing from him for some time past.</P>

The finest types of Irish nationalists, the finest types of republicans, were the Protestants of the North.  That is my reply to that.  The best types of Irishmen in the world, types like John Mitchel, were northern Irishmen.  All this talk about racialism was an inspired argument&mdash; inspired by the British.  I never found anything yet but wholehearted nationalism from people in that part of the country.  The whole talk about racialism is only a manufactured argument. I was glad to hear Deputy MacDermot say that he wanted no dictation outside or inside as regards the question of the republic.  It is a good thing to hear the Deputy say that.  If the Deputy does not know it himself, Deputy Cosgrave can inform him that the Treaty would never have been signed but for the threat of war.</P>

When the President says we must safeguard the national position in any negotiations that follow as a result of the present <Col N="2187" /> dispute, then it is absolutely necessary to safeguard that position.  One thing that the people of the country as a whole will react to and one thing they always did react to is to safeguard the national position and safeguard our scheme for independence.</P>

I agree with him that it is better to follow President de Valera with an absolutely blank mind and drop the luxury of thinking for himself.  Because, if one indulges in that at all, if one had a mind of his own one would have to leave the benches opposite.  Deputy Donnelly attacks Deputy MacDermot harshly for referring to racialism.  He calls to mind the memory of John Mitchel, and he says &ldquo;John Mitchel was a Protestant Nationalist.&rdquo;  What in the name of Providence has racialism to do with Protestantism, or what has racialism to do with a man's class consciousness?

I wish I could feel with him that that was a realisable possibility. I do not deny that at one time I hoped <Col N="2189" /> it was.  But the more I see of President de Valera shaking his shackles that nobody but himself can perceive in the eyes of the world and proclaiming for the edification of the least initiated sections of our people that he has broken another shackle in the sacred name of Irish independence, the more I am driven to the conclusion that all this national confusion, all this war atmosphere, all the boundless suffering in which our people have been involved in the last three years through President de Valera's foreign policy is for no other purpose than to demonstrate to posterity that any misfortune in which this country was involved in 1922 was everybody's fault but President de Valera's.  It is all so futile and so imbecile; and the President himself is falling into the trap that he perceived himself some years ago.  He is forgetting that there is growing up after him a generation who are not interested in the details of the controversy that took place in this country 15 years ago; who are concerned that this country should survive and advance in the world as a dignified nation, and should not hold itself up before the world as a nation which, having realised liberty devotes its entire energies to tearing itself to pieces.</P>
      <P>Is there any other nation in the world with the opportunities we have, with the constitutional position we have, with the advantages that there are there for the taking, who would deliberately embroil themselves in a war with an enormously powerful nation who, we ourselves admit, are anxious to be friendly and are anxious to establish good relations with us at the earliest possible opportunity? Who can question, or who can doubt, disastrous as it would be, in my opinion, to declare a Republic for Twenty-Six Counties, that it would not be far better to face that disaster now than to go on for ever dangling the carrot in front of the donkey's nose and leading the people from one disaster to another, with that continual goad of threatening that if they retire, that if they elect a form of government other than a republican form of government they are betraying those who died for Ireland.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2190" /> One of the horrible qualities of this question to my mind is that it has so many tragic aspects and so many ludicrous aspects at the same time.  Whenever I think of President de Valera and the Republic my mind inevitably gets back to <i>Alice Through the Looking Glass.</i>  Deputies who are familiar with Lewis Carroll will remember how Alice, whom I somehow or other always identify in my mind with the Vice-President, plaintively asked the Red Queen when she might expect to have jam for tea; and the Red Queen replied: &ldquo;We always have jam for tea.&rdquo;  Then Alice inquired: &ldquo;Why haven't we jam for tea now?&rdquo;  and to that the Red Queen replied: &ldquo;We always have jam yesterday; we always have jam to-morrow; but we never have jam to-day.&rdquo;  Let me substitute for the word jam the word Republic, and I will offer a farthing prize to the first member of the Fianna Fáil Party who will identify the Red Queen in this House.</P>

      <P>What is there within the area of jurisdiction of Saorstát Eireann that Deputy Donnelly cannot do as a member of this House, with the powers vested in this Assembly, that he could do if this was a republic?  That is the first question I want to ask him.  The second question I want to ask him is if he agrees with me that there is nothing for the dignity or welfare of our people that we are not in a position to do: does he believe that in his lifetime, or in mine, or in that of as many generations forward as we can see as public men, there is any prospect of restoring the unity of Ireland on the basis of a republic? Having considered that question, I ask the Deputy does he believe that if, as a sovereign nation, we co-operate with what seems to me to be the only effective league of nations in the world, and that is that league of nations known as the British Commonwealth of Nations&mdash;if we co-operate with the other sovereign nations that are in it, does he seriously contend that Ulster, or the Six Counties thereof which constitute the independent constitutional unit at the present time, will go on remaining the only constitutional anachronism in the whole Commonwealth of Nations?  Or will they set up a separate Dominion Government for themselves, or, as I suggest to Deputy Donnelly, will they do what I believe the British people want them to do, and what I believe the Ulster people would be glad and willing to do in a very short time if certainty was arrived at&mdash;the only thing that can contribute anything valuable from them to the Commonwealth of Nations or to the welfare of this country&mdash;and that is to join us in founding a sovereign State, not of Saorstát Eireann or of Northern Ireland, but of all Ireland?</P>

Moreover, if there is one party to the dispute who says, as we have consistently said for the last three years to the people on the other side of the fence: &ldquo;Not only will we make no advance, but we give you fair warning that if we can ever &lsquo;deluther&rsquo; you into coming over, we will put you in a republican pocket, and it is &lsquo;As go brath leat,&rsquo; then.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us not go into the things that are past.  When the Deputy goes back to 1920, my mind goes back over the decades even further. It is clear to me, however, that it is no more use for me to be discussing 1912 or 1914, or the year afterwards, than it is for Deputy Donnelly to be discussing 1918, 1919 and 1920.  I ask Deputy Donnelly carefully to consider the three questions I have put to him. I want now to communicate to the House an apprehension that I think seriously threatens the Constitution of the country.  I think that we are arriving at a stage when the independent members of the Commonwealth of Nations will tell us to get out: will kick us out.  I was discussing this matter recently with a very prominent supporter of the Fianna Fáil Party and I said to him: &ldquo;My apprehension is&mdash;not that any difficulty will be created by our going out, because I do not think there will be the least difficulty; I do not think anybody in England gives two hoots whether we are in the Commonwealth or not&mdash; that the assembled nations of the Commonwealth of Nations will determine that the time has come to tell Saorstát Eireann to get out; that they are sick of them.&rdquo;  In fact, I said, &ldquo;My grave apprehension is that at the next meeting of the independent Nations of the Commonwealth Great Britain will ask the other members to join with her in ejecting Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;  The reply of this prominent supporter of the Fianna Fáil Party to that was: <Col N="2193" />&ldquo;Ah, she would never do a thing like that.&rdquo;  And I am perfectly convinced that, in the back of the minds of the vast majority of Deputies sitting on those benches, there is the profound conviction that they can go on blathering about the Republic, and proclaiming themselves irreconcilable die-hards, in the deep conviction that Great Britain would never do anything nasty: would never do anything mean on them, and that there is never any danger there, in any case, of their turning the anvil on them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not appear to look forward to that date with any great anticipation.  What would be his reaction to it?  He is a bit doubtful.  He is not quite sure. Surely, it is time the Deputy cleared his mind on those questions.  Surely, it is time he took the desperate risk of thinking.  Surely, it is time for him to realise that, although President de Valera is available&mdash;and I hope will be available for many, many years&mdash;to do the thinking of the 76 or 77 members of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it is very necessary that there should be some additional thinking done also by the other members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Let them realise that, while they may manage to maintain their unity on a universal blank mind, there is always the danger that at any moment a single member of the Fianna Fáil Party may start to think, and if that happens, disaster will fall upon them immediately. I suggest that that is a rather unpleasant state to be in.  I have refrained from addressing any of my queries to President de Valera, because I am sure that he has absolutely no intention of answering them.  If anything is said that he does not like, the President will shake the front lock of hair over his eye; he will <Col N="2194" /> thump the table, and say eventually: &ldquo;If you want to sell out to John Bull, sell away.  As long as I am here the national position will never be compromised for a mess of pottage.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And Deputy Mrs. Concannon will say blandly, &ldquo;Hear, hear,&rdquo; and everybody will sit back feeling very comfortable and satisfied. Deputy Smith will go down the country and say &ldquo;President de Valera is on the right road.&rdquo;  The Minister for Finance will say that, ere his whiskers grow grey, he hopes to see the Republic established here by President de Valera; and the interrupters of Finglas will say that they take leave to doubt that.  But the bulk of the members opposite will speak of their readiness to die for Ireland, and some of us will be reminded of the story told here some time ago by Deputy Burke of Cork, about the thousand men who were ready to die for Ireland but the &ldquo;polis&rdquo; would not let them.  And we can say that there are in Dáil Eireann 76 members who will lay down their lives for Ireland the moment they are certain that Mr. Thomas will say he will let them.  They are all ready to die for Ireland by Mr. Thomas's leave, and even then to die only a theatrical death, because, according to the President, if there is any threat from the far side of action which would involve us all in the danger of defending the Republic against Great Britain, the declaration of the Republic will be indefinitely postponed. I only trust that the Minister for Finance's whiskers will not have grown too long or too white before the danger, which the President anticipates, will have passed away.  I hope that his anticipations of one kind or another will be realised before he goes down unhonoured to the grave, but if he has no greater confidence in the President than I have, then he had better be prepared to die as an unreconciled Imperialist and as a Republican only in embryo.</P>

      <P>This particular Estimate was introduced very lucidly by <Col N="2195" /> the Minister in words which might be briefly described as saying: &ldquo;There is nothing really to report.  There is nothing unusual happening.  The situation on the Continent is black, and we are doing all we can to help in maintaining peace.&rdquo;  Of course, it took a much longer time to say that than I have taken in the short explanation I have given of it.  As a matter of fact, I would not wish to waste the time of the House on this Vote if it were not for the intervention of Deputy Donnelly.  I want to thank him for his courteous observations and his welcome back.  I would like to assure him in connection with the remarks I made on Saturday night about the Budget, to which he takes exception, that these were taken from the Minister's own speech; they were his own words.  I would much prefer to take the other line, and to say to him that the Minister got the information from No. 3 Merrion Square as to what to say in connection with this Budget and the balancing of accounts, but, as he himself preferred to say, and did say, that he was borrowing on the strength of the land annuities to balance his Budget, that is his affair and not mine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of this debate, with his usual relevance and with his eye on the two pending by-elections, Deputy Donnelly was kind enough to mention the Treaty and to explain what imperfections there were about it.  He said in connection with one clause of it, that which deals with the North of Ireland, that it had been hopelessly mishandled by the previous administration. There is no Vote before the House for the previous administration, but the people of the North of Ireland were invited to come in here and to warm their hands at the fires which the Party over there were lighting at that particular time, and to enjoy the destruction that went on.  Every possible effort that could be made was made by individuals and by the people in that Party to bedevil, to destroy and to make inoperative the Treaty. Was not that their whole policy?  It is not a question upon which I need <Col N="2196" /> make any defence at all.  History will deal with that, and I am not concerned how it will deal with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the Ultimate Financial Settlement is concerned, this House was told about that in the first instance.  The matter came before the House on nine occasions.  There was not, as has been so lucidly described by the Minister, a secret agreement. The House was acquainted with every penny that was involved in connection with it.  The Minister's own counsel, Deputy Gavan Duffy, as he then was, was a member of the House when the necessary Estimate was introduced in connection with the very first payment that was made to Great Britain.  Let us now, on this occasion, when this Vote is before the House hear something about the secret disagreement there is with the British Government. We have not heard it yet.  There is a dispute between the two countries. This is one of the matters which might naturally fall to the Department of External Affairs to deal with.  We have been told occasionally by Ministers, as a sort of peroration, that we can have a settlement by yielding on our tariff policy.  Can we hear, in connection with the secret disagreement, whether any such condition as that was mentioned by any British Minister? Can we hear what terms, if any, were offered?  Can we hear what there is in connection with that matter which would be of interest to the people of this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Assuming for the moment that there is all this difficulty in connection with the previous agreement, is there not a way of dealing with it, the way that ordinary business people would deal with it, and why should not Governments do likewise?  Why not say: &ldquo;If you do put that up as an obstacle towards a settlement, let us consider the matter in the fashion in which business people would consider it and say: &lsquo;well, we will admit that without prejudice&rsquo;, &rdquo; and you are no worse off than you were before.  The Minister will remember his own statement, made <Col N="2197" /> at the time that we were dealing with financial matters: his own observations as to what the British demanded at that time.  The figure that, I think, he mentioned was £19,000,000 a year. That was a great help to us.  We have given help from the commencement of this dispute with a view to a settlement of it.  I say that, not because we have any interest in the Ministry. Speaking for myself, there is not a single person sitting on the benches opposite&mdash;I regret to have to say it&mdash; whose word would bear any weight with me.  We have done that, not for them but for the country, the people outside whom we represent, or misrepresent, whichever you wish.</P>
    <P>The country, according to the Minister, is suffering.  When Deputy Donnelly says that we have stopped this money going over, we have the Minister saying that they are getting it more expensively in another way. That is hitting some people much harder than a good many have any appreciation of.  It is not hitting the Ministry.  They are making money out of it.  This is obviously a case where, if they had any sense of justice, if they had any charity in them at all, they would stop this awful drain that there is upon one section of the community.  In connection with that we are prepared to give them all the help that they need, and well they know it.  I am not making any complaint about the fact that I got no help from them.  I got nothing from them but hindrance, but I was able to get on without their help and I did not care about their hindrance.</P>

      <P>And then about the Treaty.  What are the facts?  We had benches here empty for five years. They are full now.  Did they come in simply to reap the fruits of office, or did they come in to represent the people?  At any rate, the previous Administration never deceived the people about any single thing they did.  They made no attempt to make themselves popular.  They made no attempt at any time to put an undue <Col N="2198" /> burden on any person's back in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, perhaps, and let us hope that it will not be too costly. A little examination of the internal condition of affairs in this country might, perhaps, shake the laughter off the faces of some of the Deputies opposite.  Perhaps the Minister himself would make inquiries in his own constituency from the mental hospitals as to whether or not Government policy has not increased the number of persons in them.  That is not a matter to laugh at.  We had over here quite recently some members of the British Commonwealth of Nations.  I wonder did anyone ask them, how was their business getting on since the dispute occurred?  I wonder whether, if there was a settlement, there would not need to be another Ottawa arrangement or agreement?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;just at this moment this dispute is benefiting people at the ends of the earth.  One <Col N="2199" /> may ask, has there been a greater sale for goods from places thousands of miles off than would have been the case if the people of this country had their rights in the British market? These are matters which the Minister, if he has not got the time to look into them himself, might ask the Department of External Affairs to go into. Whatever national advance this country is going to make, it will make that advance only when we have a sound, balanced economy and sound financial conditions in the country.  One may prate about national advance and about forms of government, but the whole thing comes down to this in the long run: that you require to have employment for your people, the means of making a living for the vast majority of them.  If you are ever going to make advance, to have ultimate union with the North of Ireland, you are not going to achieve that by pointing out to certain sections of the people up there that they have never conceived the idea of a united Ireland. The way to bring that about is by persuading them, and one of the methods of doing that is by letting them see that we can do our business down here in a proper manner.  If we did that we would have a very much stronger standing than we have.  We would be in a much better position to help in keeping peace on the Continent and elsewhere if we could say that we, too, were at peace, economically and politically, with our neighbours.  While, according to some of the speeches that have been delivered recently, our national economy must be framed with a view to possibility of war, we, apparently, do not mind that when making a trade agreement with people much farther off than our immediate neighbours.  We cannot have it every way.  In the long run, the Minister's Department will be faced with the special responsibility of effecting an accommodation with our neighbours&mdash;an accommodation that will be beneficial to this country.  As Deputy MacDermot has said this evening, this Party believes that there should be a common foreign policy for <Col N="2200" /> all parties represented in the Parliament.</P>

I can understand that he may have a certain objection to that constituency because he was faced with certain questions, through my agency, in the town of Borris, which he did not entirely enjoy. There are quite a number of questions which I might put with regard to his Department.  A couple of years ago, I gave the President an opportunity of letting the House know whether certain property stolen from this State in Paris had been returned.  We have never been told that, although we have been asked for a supplementary Vote of about £5,000 to the man who was guilty of that crime.  I referred also to certain negotiations in which a man now employed by the President in his Department had participated with a man who was known by the secret name of &ldquo;Marino.&rdquo;  I invited the President to let the House know whether or not that was with a view to getting money from outside sources to assist in the overthrow of social order in this State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be <Col N="2201" /> raising the question now if a straight answer had been given.  I wanted to know if certain files belonging to that Department had been returned.  This House has never been told that.  I regret very much that last year we did not take what I should have considered a right and dignified line.  A country that seeks to make its voice heard in international councils should, at least, have a definite point of view and have its mind made up on any point that arises.  There was the question of the admission of Russia to the League of Nations.  One could understand that the President or his Department or this country might have been entirely in favour of Russia coming into the League of Nations or entirely opposed to it.  If I remember rightly, on that question of Russia coming within the comity of nations, our country voted neither for nor against.  That was our contribution to that question.  I could quite understand that there might be good reasons, unknown to the public, for a certain course of action but the natural course would have been that taken by Mr. Motta.</P>
      <P>Another thing that seems to me to have militated against the good name of this country arose from the fact that there are two types of nations completely unpopular in the international sphere, because they make trouble. One is the big bullying nation and the other is the small truculent nation. The small nations of truculent, arrogant, exaggerated nationalism have been the cause, and possibly are the cause, of enormous injury to and lack of peace in the world generally. I do not think&mdash;this is only a personal judgment&mdash;that a small nation which truculently enters into a condition of war, even though it be only an economic war, with a country for which it is not a match, is likely to be a good advocate of world peace.  If every country sits down and morbidly considers what, in its own morbid condition, it regards as full justice, then the only possible condition for the world is a state of chronic war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attitude of the President and of the Government is always that of complaining of existing facts.  What is <Col N="2202" /> our real quarrel with England?  That geographically we are very near her. Another quarrel is that we are an agricultural country and need her market.  We have that as a sort of grievance.  Whether we are a small or a big nation, there are going to be certain disadvantages attached to our position.  Let me give an instance of that.  A few years ago, the British went off the gold standard and the value of their £ decreased to about 16/- or 15/-.  The natural reaction of that was that the new type of £ would not buy as much as the former type of £.  That is to say, considered in £'s, a larger number of £'s would be required to buy the same commodity. It is well known that the effect of that action by the British was to diminish the producers' and wholesalers' prices all over the world.  In Patagonia, Australia, Yugo-Slavia, Africa and all producing countries, they found that, because the British Government had decided to change the value of their £, the goods they produced changed in value to something less.  They had a grievance about that.  That comes from the fact that Britain, with its 45,000,000 people&mdash;the greatest consuming and importing country in the world&mdash;is so important in the world market that their action in regard to their £ meant that 16/- could buy as much as 20/- did before.  Because the British are in that position, they suffer a certain weakness.  They are an enormous importing country, depending on sea-borne food.  Because of that position, in which they can change the value of goods in all parts of the world, they have to maintain an enormous navy, because otherwise they could be cut off from their food supplies and starved out in a short time. In that way, they have to pay the price of their advantage.  We have the disadvantage of being next to an enormously powerful country, but we have the advantage that it is our natural market.  We have entered into a completely absurd and futile quarrel with the British.  It is all right to sit down and think of the possible rights you can claim as long as you can make that claim operative.</P>
    <P>What did we do?  We started a row <Col N="2203" /> about the land annuities.  It was proposed at first that the question should be negotiated.  Speaking from memory, I think the President seemed to be afraid that the British might agree to an international tribunal, and speaking subject to correction, at another stage he found it necessary to raise not merely the legal question about the land annuities, if it was to be arbitration, but also the whole political question.</P>
    <P>Another proposal I understand was that there should not be arbitration but that there should be negotiations; that two Irish representatives and two British representatives should meet to consider whether some agreement could be come to on the disputed question of the land annuities.  What the public understood at the time was that the British were agreeable, but that at one stage they said that the land annuities that had been previously paid should continue to be paid, and that if, as a result of the negotiations, the payments were remitted, wholly or in part, then they would send back the amount overpaid during the period of the negotiations. We understood that our Government objected to that and said they would retain the land annuities in a Suspense Account while the negotiations were going on.  The British as we understand then said &ldquo;Very well, in that case tariffs will be maintained on Irish produce during the period of the negotiations,&rdquo; so that the proposal came to nothing.  One can understand that the Government might have some point of principle in that.  They might have said that the mere fact of not agreeing to enter into negotiations with the British, while they are making their claim operative, might tend to prejudice the case to be considered during the negotiations.</P>
    <P>In the month of January we were told that negotiations had taken place on parallel lines, and that while they went on, the British continued to collect tariffs.  In spite of that, agreement was reached, under which the tariffs were to remain.  The agreement created a condition in which the total sum collected <Col N="2204" /> by way of tariffs was going to be greater.  Is it not possible now for the President to say that what was talked of in 1932 could have been made a reality?  We say that there is no objection whatever in principle to negotiating with the British on questions arising out of the economic war while they continue to collect the tariffs on our goods.  If that is so, is there any objection to the previous proposal, having two or 20 Irish representatives meeting a similar number of British representatives to go into the whole question, even while tariffs are being collected on our goods, and while we retain the annuities?  What is the objection?  Is there any reason why that should not be done?  As a result of the Government's action in having the matter thrashed out with the British, to see if what they propose is something that we can consider acceptable or, in the alternative unacceptable, we are committed to nothing.  It is only a short time since the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, in the course of a speech, wanted to know what were our proposals, or what could we promise in the way of getting the British to forego their claim to the money.  If we said that we could promise anything it would be dishonest to do so.  We could not promise that.  If we did so, Fianna Fáil spokesmen would immediately go around the country, as they did before with typical dishonesty, saying: &ldquo;Clearly, you are acting treacherously; you are negotiating with the British behind the backs of the Government.&rdquo; We have no right and no authority to do that.</P>
    <P>But what did the Government do?  If the position of 1932 remains, that can be ascertained by short negotiations or by protracted negotiations, and the whole matter can be thrashed out with the British without in any way prejudicing any point of principle that the Government might have at heart.  They can put to themselves the question put to us by the Parliamentary Secretary, and be able to tell the people what are the maximum concessions to be got from the British, and let the people then judge whether it would be worth while <Col N="2205" /> making any concession on our side, with a view to reaping from whatever the British might be prepared to give, any advantage that it would bring to our people.</P>
    <P>This Department has been referred to as the Cinderella of the Departments. I do not want to be injust to the Minister, but it seems to me that during the last couple of years it has been turned into a sort of Limbo.  We have seen a man transferred from the <i>Irish Press</i> into this Department.  We saw another man jettisoned into this Department&mdash;I do not wish to refer to this because I have only seen a newspaper report&mdash; who, it is suggested was over the Civil Service retiring age.  I could quite understand such a situation in the case of a man with particular qualifications, which would make it an advantage to disregard the ordinary Civil Service rules and to bring him from outside.  As far as my knowledge goes the men who have been brought into this Department were brought in to the detriment of the ordinary progress of promotion, and consequently of good order, the contentment of the staff and of ordinary justice to men who have given good service.  Men from outside, including, I am informed, men beyond the ordinary Civil Service retiring age, were brought in, as if the Department could not produce men for the various functions to be performed.  I referred to a similar type of thing with regard to the Army.  I do not think it is very important, but it seems to me to err against justice.</P>
    <P>The cost of the Department is increasing.  I do not complain of that, only that it does seem rather strange, while the Minister for Finance should assume that he would be able to make each Department cost something between 3 and 4 per cent. less than estimated, yet, within a few weeks he has to come along for an additional Vote which indicates that instead of being able to make a saving on the original Vote the Department will cost more.</P>
    <P>I feel that there is a general attitude of truculence, especially amongst <Col N="2206" /> the stronger powers.  In ordinary life we know that people have to have regard to existing circumstances.  If a small man threatens a big man and suffers for it we all say, &ldquo;It serves him right; he was asking for it.&rdquo; This Government came into office and immediately began to challenge our constitutional relations and even our financial relations with Great Britain, the only justification being that the Government would have been able to get away with it.  It has not, but it has inflicted enormous hardship on the people.</P>
    <P>It is right and proper that the existing Government of this country, irrespective of what their past may have been, should be in the closest co-operation with Great Britain. Instead of that we have Minister's representatives going around the country telling the people that we are not free, that we have got to suffer and to cripple ourselves economically merely to show that we are not satisfied, while others hold out an ideal of freedom not attainable by any country. The British people are forced by the attitude of other countries to maintain a Navy.  If they had not got it their ideal of freedom would be an immediate jeopardy.  We have been told that other countries are not satisfied with their position.  Belgium is not free according to the President's ideal of national freedom.  I might say that the United States is not free, according to the President's ideal of national freedom.  I pointed out here before that, although the United States Constitution provides that no alcoholic liquor was to be brought into American territory, the United States entered into an agreement with Great Britain and other countries, which permitted the Constitution to be overridden.  In order to meet the wishes of Great Britain and other countries, the American Constitution was overridden. I remember when in the Department of External Affairs some time ago, that Belgium and Holland proposed to make an agreement with regard to the navigation of the Scheldt and we were asked to agree.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We did, but the proposal did not come to anything in the end.  If such a position happened with regard to us, if we were not able to negotiate any change or arrangement with regard to the navigation of our own waters without the permission of other countries, we would have the Fianna Fáil Party declaring that this was intolerable and that we would never rest satisfied with such conditions. On this ground Belgium, or any other country would not have internal peace.  Spain is not in turmoil because Britain holds Gibraltar.  This country is to be kept in intolerable turmoil until England is in a position to give assent to something she wants. What we want above all else is to let things rest for a while and build up our own country.  Was Spain never to recognise any proper authority in her Government, until that country had got control of Gibraltar?  Were her people to be justified in disregarding all law and order until such conditions came to pass?  There you have a position that cannot be changed until some outside power agrees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are apparently to keep things in turmoil here until some change takes place in Great Britain, although we are not in a position to force that change upon Great Britain.  One Minister has gone round this country at one time declaring: &ldquo;Peace with England!&mdash;never!&rdquo;  In his view Ireland was never to be at peace until we were free, according to his view. We are to be punished by never enjoying peace in this country until such time as some change takes place in England.  As far as I can judge, there is every possibility at the present time, as there has been in the last three years, of the difficulty with Great Britain being overcome, and overcome not by what Deputy Donnelly would call the complete surrender of this country&mdash;far from it.  It can be overcome by an agreement that will recognise our economic position at the moment, and the harm done to us by having to pay, and will recognise our position in historical circumstances and the right for our goods to enter their market under privileged, instead of penal, conditions.  The President admitted <Col N="2208" /> that the present situation has inflicted additional cost and expense on our people by having to pay tariffs, but he maintained there is a very high principle at stake.  He has, however, shown that there is no principle whatever which precludes our negotiations with Great Britain upon every aspect of the case even with tariffs in operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (The President) Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (The President)</NameTxt>
      <P>We had several hours' debate here on the Vote for the President's Department and it was because of that that I understood there was ground for hope that the other Departments&mdash;External Affairs and, to a certain extent, perhaps, the League of Nations Vote&mdash;would be dealt with and finished on the last occassion.  Now in a long speech I dealt, I think, fairly fully with the points raised, and with the question of our relations with Great Britain.  I see no point whatever in going back over that ground again.  Particularly do I feel it is unnecessary to do so because members of the House are fully aware of what the Government's attitude is, and because if I did go back upon it, no matter what I said it would be discounted by a cry raised from the benches opposite, that I was speaking simply because two by-elections were on.  I do not want to speak on these matters in this House when by-elections are on.  If I am going to speak on election matters I shall speak to audiences in the constituencies affected, and the people of the country as a whole can hear what I have to say.  I am not going back, therefore, over the question of our relations with Britain on this Vote.  I dealt with them completely and indicated the attitude of our people on the matter already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to general policy, the policy that this Government would adopt, if returned to office, was stated more clearly and definitely than ever a political party before put their programme before the people.  We stated our programme and put it before the people at the elections, and have not departed from it in the slightest degree. Fault was found because when <Col N="2209" /> introducing this Estimate I did not make any statement.  As a matter of fact, I think, as a rule, in dealing with these Votes, I give more information to the House than Ministers under the previous administration were in the habit of giving.  On this Vote, however, Deputies will remember, there was a motion to refer it back.  Deputy Belton was in charge of that motion, and took up the time that was available in introducing it. I might have been tempted to read some notes to the House on our trade agreements and trade relations abroad were it not for the fact that every Deputy has had a copy of these agreements. They were circulated, and the people of the country have been kept fully informed of their tenor through the Press.  I do not see any advantage in wasting the time of the House by going over matters of this sort.  I have here a very short summary of the position but, as I say, I do not think there is any point whatever in going over here again matters dealt with extensively in detail by their circulation amongst Deputies and also in the Press.</P>
    <P>There has been a suggestion that since we came into office the Department of External Affairs has, as one would think listening to some of the Deputies opposite, disappeared from the map.  There is no truth, of course, in that.  It was said that we were represented at the Council of the League of Nations for three years. The greater part of that time was during the period of the previous administration. I came on at a time in which it became our turn&mdash;it does not happen except after long periods&mdash;to occupy the chairmanship of the Council. During that period, I think, most Deputies are aware of the attitude which representatives of this country took in the matter.  On later occasions, in relation to the unfortunate conflict that has been going on in South America, as far as the representative of any one nation could, we tried to bring public opinion, and the whole weight of the League of Nations, to bear on bringing that conflict to an end.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2210" /> I said here on the last occasion, speaking about the general situation in Europe, that a small State could not do much and that is the truth. When a storm is coming on, when you have a situation such as there is at present in Europe, it is only the big States who can speak, everybody knowing that they are able to back their views with heavy armaments and can be powerful allies to other countries. We see that the whole idea of peace which was prevalent for some years after the Great War, is now being put aside and that we have a reversal mainly to the old idea of alliances, balances of power, and all the rest of it.  In circumstances such as these, representatives of small countries like ours cannot hope to do very much, but we can do something and we are doing it.  We have been doing it consistently. Our strength must lie in creating a general public opinion, a public opinion in our own country and in countries situated as we are and throughout the world generally, as to the necessity for bringing about a certain relationship between nations and such organisation if possible as will ensure that we are not going to have a war such as we had before. We have consistently on every occasion thrown in our weight on the side of reasonable accommodation between nations.  We have adhered consistently to the principles upon which the League of Nations was founded.  We shall be only too happy to assist anything that can be done to make the League of Nations a more effective instrument in the maintenance of peace.</P>
    <P>It is not right, therefore, to say that we are unduly lowering the esteem in which we should hold ourselves and our influence, by that statement. Deputy Costello found fault particularly with me for that.  Of course, I was simply expressing a well-known fact.  It is a fact that we are members of the League of Nations and as a member of the League of Nations we have co-operated.  We have a voice in the questions coming to the general body of the League.  Our whole attitude in the League has been one of co-operation <Col N="2211" /> with the small States, that like ourselves can afford to take up a position of independence and who have taken up a position of independence in like matters.  I had intended to leave this question until the League of Nations Vote was reached, but we might as well deal with it as it has been raised in connection with this Vote.  I think everybody in the country, except Deputies on the opposite benches, is aware of the part that has been played by the representatives of this State at Geneva since we took office and that our actions there have received far greater attention than the actions of our predecessors when they were in office.  It is all nonsense then to suggest that since we took office there has been some extraordinary eclipse of the energies and the efforts of the Department of External Affairs.</P>
    <P>The ordinary routine of the office is not a matter that it is necessary I should speak about.  On the last occasion I spoke about it in so far as it is possible to indicate the routine of such Departments.  I have been asked what is the justification for the extension in the case of Spain.  In the short statement I made I indicated clearly that our purpose in making this extension was in accordance with a general plan.  We propose to be represented in the greater European capitals and also at centres in which we have special interests.  Deputy Costello, I think, referred in particular to Canada and South Africa.  I do not know if he mentioned Australia.  There is no doubt that in Canada and Australia there are special interests of ours which would merit representation from our State, but the Deputy is aware that there are considerations of various kinds which might possibly weigh with the Governments in these countries, and of course before we could possibly establish representatives in these countries we should be assured that we would be able to have representatives of these countries here&mdash;that there would be an exchange at any rate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald continued statements <Col N="2212" /> of innuendo and suggestion which were made very fully by him on previous occasions.  He talks about the stealing of files or something of that sort.  These were files which this representative had when he was representing a Republican Government.  It appears that these files were not given back in 1922 or 1923.  I have not asked that these files be given back.  I am perfectly certain if I had asked for them to be given back they would be, but I have not asked for them.  There was a position here in this country which everybody is aware of it.  This particular representative supported the State which he believed was the constitutional State at the time.  He has been brought back to the Civil Service. Why should he not?  Was he not entitled to come back?  There was also a suggestion that I brought somebody from the <i>Irish Press</i> into this Department.  Why should I not? He was entitled to come back.  He had been Secretary of the Department of External Affairs at its inception. He was the first Secretary of the Department of External Affairs. Why should he not be brought back? He has been brought back just as other civil servants have been restored to their positions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald spoke about one man and suggested that he had had something to do with some negotiations with reference to Russia or somewhere like that.  There is no truth whatever in that, and that was pointed out to Deputy Fitzgerald before, but nevertheless, he comes along here with it on each occasion in the hope, of course, that somebody will sometime believe him.</P>
    <P>With regard to our extension abroad, we are extending to Spain because Spain is one of the principal European countries, because of past associations with that country and because of the trade relations which we are reestablishing with that country.  The position with regard to Spain was that we had an altogether unbalanced trade with Spain and by a recent agreement we have advanced, not to parity&mdash;we are still a considerable way from parity <Col N="2213" />&mdash;but in a direction which is going to be of particular value to our people. What is it then the Opposition want to know about the Department of External Affairs that they do not know already?  Is there anything?  I have spoken of our external policy as regards Britain, and they have in the Estimates a very full list of the offices and salaries.  They know what our consuls and diplomatic representatives in general are doing.  They know that we get reports from them from time to time on the changing situation, which are of great value to us if we go to the League and want to know exactly what the European position is and so on, but these, in their very nature, are not matters which you can make the subject ordinarily of a discussion here.</P>
    <P>It has always been one of the difficulties about the Department of External Affairs that you have not got the thousand and one details that are criticised in the case of other Estimates here.  In the case of other Estimates&mdash; the Land Commission and so on&mdash; Deputies speak about certain points of administration and criticism them.  I was waiting for criticism on points of administration or criticism generally, but, of course, these criticisms do not come.  They do not come because the activities of this Department do not come so directly under the notice of Deputies.  The general idea, however, and what is being done by the Department is known; the general policy of the Department and what is being done are so completely and sufficiently known at present that I think it would be a waste of the time of the House to enter into a long explanation as to what is happening and what is being done.</P>

People are asking why we do not go out and declare a republic.  They know perfectly well that we told the people we were not going to do any such thing during this period of office and they would be the first people to shout and cry that we were acting beyond what we had authority to do if we attempted to do it.  As I have said, apart from the question of our immediate relations with Britain, there is on this Vote very little I can do usefully in the way of general explanation.  I was asked whether these trade agreements were negotiated by our Department.  Representatives of our Department were in the delegations.  We have a Trade Department which is there to examine the possibilities of international trade and to assist the Department of Industry and Commerce in regard to these treaties, and, as a rule, when trade agreements are being negotiated, the delegation includes a represent <Col N="2215" /> tative of the Department of External Affairs, with representatives of the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Agriculture as being the three main Departments concerned.</P>

      <P>The Department of Industry and Commerce is in touch with all the industries in the country and with the trading sections of the community. They are constantly in touch with them and, therefore, any arrangements of that sort that are made are made by people who have a knowledge of the conditions and the needs of the trading community.  I have no doubt whatever that wherever there are any matters that affect them, their opinions&mdash;not directly because you cannot negotiate by asking every trade whether they would agree and so on; if that is what the Deputy means, it is quite impossible&mdash;are borne in mind.  They have the knowledge and if they want to know how a particular agreement <Col N="2216" /> would affect a particular industry, they would probably find out.  It would be their duty, I take it, if they did not know already how it was going to affect them, to find out.  I am sure that is being done and if there are any complaints that particular interests have been affected, it is for those interests to bring them to our notice.  I have no information that any particular firms had special objection to any of these arrangements that were made, but, even if they had, the Department, having heard any objections they might have to make, would have to decide in the general interest.  Having heard any particular point of view, they would have to decide in the general interest.  The Department of Industry and Commerce is constantly in touch with these matters and, therefore, representatives of that Department are always included in these delegations that are responsible for the negotiating of trade agreements.  I do not think there is anything further that would justify me in keeping the House.  There has been no question raised in detail and with the general questions I have already dealt on the President's Vote.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Do we gather that the President is not going to make a statement relative to the activities of the representatives of the Irish Free State at the League of Nations?  As I said on the Vote for the Department of External Affairs, it is not merely out of curiosity that we sought and still seek for information as to the activities of the Department in the field of foreign affairs.  The President, during his concluding observations on the last Vote, made certain remarks about the League of Nations and our policy at the League, and he interpolated the observation that he had intended to make these remarks on the Estimate for the League of Nations. I regret that he interpolated the remarks he did about the League of Nations on the Vote for the Department of External Affairs, because apparently we are not going to have any information whatever on this substantial Vote for the League of Nations about what we have been doing during the past 12 months and what we intend to do in the forthcoming 12 months in reference to the activities of the League of Nations and the various subsidiary activities that take place under the auspices of that body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter of some moment to this country to know what we are doing at the League of Nations, whether we propose to do anything at the forthcoming meeting of the Assembly and whether, after the next Assembly, there will be, in the opinion of the President, any League of Nations at all.  We are interested, not out of mere curiosity, but because a number of us have an interest in matters relating to external affairs and matters dealing with the League of Nations.  It was the practice during the period of office of the last administration <Col N="2221" /> to issue each year a pamphlet giving an account of what had been done in the League of Nations and in the International Labour Office. Apparently that practice has been discontinued.  At all events, I have not recently got any of those accounts that used to be circulated in relation to our activities in the International Labour Office and at the Assembly of the League of Nations and the meetings of the Council.</P>
    <P>The President, I think, admitted we had a status and a standing of some import at Geneva.  The President, at the same time, seems to think we have very little influence at Geneva, very little hope or possibility of influencing the general trend of foreign affairs through our membership of the League of Nations.  Because of our position as a member of the family of nations represented at Geneva, we have a two-fold duty and right.  As an independent member of the League we have our right to influence policy and the affairs of the nations assembled there in council.  In addition to that, we have a rôle which we can fulfil, and which was fulfilled by the last Administration, with the object of increasing the prestige and the influence of this country as an independent member of the League of Nations.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out during the discussion on the last Estimate, we had a very considerable influence in the League of Nations by reason of the fact that we were regarded as a State entirely outside the current of European international policies and for that reason, and because of the fact that we were an independent-minded member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, that gave us a considerable prestige and an opportunity for exercising influence on current international policy.</P>
    <P>The League of Nations gave to the small nations of the world an opportunity of influencing international politics and policy that they never had before and the result was that in the history of the last 12 or 15 years at Geneva the nations that exercised the greatest influence on world affairs, and <Col N="2222" /> current European policy in particular, were the small nations, particularly the Scandinavian group, the Northern European nations.  They were sought after by the bigger nations because of their influence and independence.  We had been in that position.  I think we still should be, if we are not in that position at the present moment.  I do not say we are not in that position at the moment; all I do say is that the President has not told us whether we are or not.</P>
    <P>It was comforting to hear the President say our influence would be thrown, for what it was worth, against the influences that appear to be at work on the Continent on the side of a possible war.  I think we should have some considerable influence in that. The President did not seem to think we would have much influence, but at all events it is comforting to know that the policy of the present Government is against war.  When the treaty for the renunciation of war was brought before this House in the year 1929 for ratification, the policy of the people who now form the Government was entirely contrary to the policy enunciated to-day by the President.  They were in favour of war at that time and they voted against the treaty for the renunciation of war, the Treaty which was known as the Kellogg Pact.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit it arises in this way, that I was about to make a statement to the effect that the Vice-President at that time stated in reference to the Kellogg Pact that he was not going to sign a pact which would prevent this country from making war on its powerful secular enemy, Great Britain, in order to bring that powerful secular enemy, Great Britain, to her senses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President has stated to-day that the Government policy was against war.  I want to know from the President is the policy of the present <Col N="2223" /> Government different from what they stated at the time when they voted against the Kellogg Pact?  I want to know if the policy of the Government is as stated&mdash;in Volume 28, column 279, of the Official Debates&mdash;by the Vice-President when he spoke in February, 1929, about the Treaty for the renunciation of war and referred to &ldquo;our powerful secular enemy&rdquo;?  I think we are entitled to know if the policy of the Government with reference to war, which is stated by them to be against war, includes Great Britain?  Because we have at the moment what is called an economic war with Great Britain. I think the House is entitled to an explicit declaration as to whether that policy covers our policy in relation to Great Britain?  The Minister for Industry and Commerce in the present Government stated in 1929 also that the pact or any pact and no matter what pact was made or ever could be made would not prevent us from renewing the war here to achieve the long-desired independence of our country.  I respectfully submit to you that I am entitled to ask for an explicit declaration of the policy of the Government in relation to war, as to whether that general pious declaration that the Government is against war includes our nearest neighbour, Great Britain.</P>
    <P>I was anxious to know what the Government representatives have been doing at the International Labour Offices and what their policy was at Geneva, and also we would like to know something of the activities of the various subsidiary branches that are carried on in Geneva&mdash;the Health Section and any of those other Departments in which we took part for a long number of years and in which we had many friends in the international world.  I was personally interested in one activity, the codification of international law.  When I was last at Geneva I raised that very point. There had been a vast amount of work built up by the most eminent jurists of international law in Europe and the South American States with a view to having a general codification of international <Col N="2224" /> law.  When that would be available it would be one of the subsidiary, if not one of the main, means by which war could be prevented in the future, or at least it would help to prevent the grave abuses which had taken place during the European War from being repeated in future wars.</P>
    <P>The work done by these jurists included some codification aspects of Government law and we were anxious to help forward the codification of international law so far as possible, I put forward at the first Commission the policy of the Government and I took on that particular activity with renewed vigour.  I have heard nothing since about the codification of international law.  I would have thought that the President would have given us some information about that, particularly as he has in his office men who are well versed in the question. It may be a pure personal idiosyncrasy with me, but I happen to be interested in it.</P>
    <P>I think that on the Vote on External Affairs and the League of Nations, where we could leave out for the moment our relations with Great Britain, we should have some common policy in which all parties in the House could agree and discuss and adopt without reference to Party views or political considerations.  I would appeal to the President if he happens to be Minister for External Affairs next year, to adopt that attitude.  We want to see a genuine interest displayed in this House in our foreign policy and foreign affairs and in our activities in the League of Nations. If that interest were displayed in this House it would be disseminated outside. I can see nothing but good to the general public outside this House from taking an interest in these matters&mdash;foreign affairs and foreign policy generally.  It would react favourably upon our internal policy and internal affairs.  I think the House is not being treated properly in not being given some account of the activities of our representatives at the League of Nations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to discuss our activities at the League of Nations intelligently in the absence of any statement from the Government. I confine myself to asking one or two questions on this Vote.  I think we are entitled to ask the President whether on the whole he considers that the League of Nations is justifying its existence at the present time and whether he looks forward with approval to our continued membership of the League? That is one thing I would like to ask him, in view of the various utterances made in the past on that question. Another matter, and one of the most interesting, if not the most interesting, that occurred in the League of Nations during the course of the past year was the admission of Russia to membership. That was an admission which the President supported at the time. In supporting it he made various observations about conditions in Russia in regard to civil and religious liberty.  These were very proper observations and I think he expressed the hope that association with other nations in the League would lead to an improvement in internal conditions, I would like to hear from the President now if he is still of opinion that it was right to admit Russia into the League and whether he has taken any steps to ascertain the consequences of such admission upon the internal conditions of Russia with regard to civil and religious liberty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another question I should like to ask him.  As he is aware there has been much controversy in England and elsewhere, but especially in England, as to the principle known as collective security&mdash;whether it is more desirable that there should be individualism on the part of nations, that each nation, especially a nation separated from other nations by the sea, should try to isolate itself as much as possible from wars and rumours of wars, or whether there should be pacts <Col N="2226" /> and treaties embracing two or three or more powers and perhaps leading to some sort of balance of power such as existed in Europe before the war, leading to the division of Europe into camps glaring suspiciously and angrily at each other, or whether the aim of the League of Nations should be to establish a system of collective security in the full sense of the word?  Does the present Government of the Free State accept the idea that I would like them to accept&mdash;that we should not isolate ourselves from Europe as a whole and from the world as a whole, but that we should take an interest in seeing that justice prevails in this world of ours, and in the case of the great misfortune of another war occurring, that we should be prepared to give at any rate our moral and economic support to whatever power or group of powers is declared by the League of Nations to be the innocent party.  In other words, do we accept the general principle that we would always turn our hand against the aggressor in case of the very great misfortune of another war breaking out?</P>
    <P>I should like to hear something from the President on these points.  I, myself, am a very firm supporter of the League of Nations.  I do not care what its faults or deficiencies are&mdash;I know they are very many&mdash;yet I see in it the only hope for suffering humanity, and the more its faults appear, the more actively we should try to correct them and to make it a success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SydneyBMinch" hpid="Mr. Minch Mr. Minch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the President if there have been any activities on the part of the Irish Free State towards getting Germany back into the League of Nations.  As we all know, the peace of Europe and the peace of the world depend upon getting Germany back into the League of Nations, and I should like to know if this country is playing its part in trying to bring that nation back into the League of Nations and thus avoid another great World War.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise very much with Deputies like Deputy <Col N="2227" /> Costello, who have shown themselves in the past to be, and who are obviously still interested in our activities abroad, in speaking as they have spoken here, about getting our people to take a keen interest in what is happening abroad.  I wonder whether the Deputy is not wrong in thinking that they do not already take a very keen interest.  I think that is the difference between us&mdash;that I believe the people of our country read the newspapers very carefully and keep in touch in the main with external affairs.  We might have in our Department certain confidential information from day to day as to present tendencies, and so on, but these, as a rule, develop in a very short time; and though we might have a certain amount of advance information, the fact is that in a very short time it becomes information which everybody has.  The position in connection with a Vote like this is that the majority of our people, and certainly Deputies, know very nearly as much about what has happened abroad over a period.  We may know what is just about to happen, or what is just happening at the moment, but the fact is that things reveal themselves in a very short time, with the result that the information we may have a little in advance becomes information which everybody has.  That is really one of the difficulties about making any useful statement in introducing this Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are asked to publish a report of what we have done at the League of Nations during the year.  The fact is that the League's publications are in the Library and are available for Deputies who want to study them; and whenever there is any major activity in the League it is very fully reported in the Press.  Does the Deputy want me to go back and publish a special report of the speeches I have made?  That would be simply a waste of money and they would not be read by anybody except somebody who wants to refer to them for the purpose of quoting or misquoting them.  If that is the position, they have the report of the League <Col N="2228" /> itself to which they can refer.  So that I do not think any useful purpose would be served in presenting a report here containing the activities of the League, which are already published in the League's own publications and are available to Deputies, and the major part of which is published to the community at large through the Press.</P>
    <P>As to our general attitude there, the difference between Deputy Costello and myself in the matter is clearly that I am somewhat more of a realist than he is.  I have measured the amount of influence that we can exercise in the League.  I do not want to minimise it in any way.  I think that we have been playing our part and that there is a certain amount that we can do in conjunction with other States, which are similarly detached and have not special axes to grind, in preserving the peace of the world; that we have done and are doing a great deal.  But I am not so foolish as to imagine that, when you have practices against air-raids to-day on the Continent and to-morrow in Great Britain, and so on, when Governments are in a mood like that, there is much use in a smaller nation trying to counsel them to peace.  The only way I can see in which peace can be preserved at the moment is by having such a feeling against war that Governments before seeking the way of war will try genuinely the way of peace, realising what war under the new conditions will mean.</P>
    <P>As to collective security, I have always felt that, unless the League of Nations has some sanctions by which its decisions can be somehow enforced, it is not going to be permanently of any use.  It is of value in minor ways. It helps to bring people together who would not otherwise come together; and to that extent it helps to bring about an atmosphere of peace.  But until there is some system by which the League will have effective sanctions to enforce its decisions, then it seems to me that the League will not be a real instrument for the preservation of peace.  I felt that the whole time. Deputies on the opposite benches are as much aware as I am of how extremely difficult it is, when you get <Col N="2229" /> down to try to devise a system of sanctions, to get agreement upon it. I agree that if we had an agreed system of collective security it would be far more preferable and cheaper. But you have the old difficulty with sovereign States as to what extent they are prepared to surrender any portion of their sovereignty in order to bring about a situation which will amount to collective security.  I do not think there is any nation at the present time, certainly none of the bigger Powers, prepared to rely on the collective sanctions which seem possible to the League.  As everybody can see, all of them are working as rapidly as they can to build up armaments to defend themselves, whether that defence is merely what I might call of a passive kind or a very active defence, which is almost indistinguishable from aggression. So that the Deputy can only get from me what our desires and wishes are.</P>
    <P>There is no basis upon which a definite policy can be framed or formed at the moment.  There was a time at which I thought there were possibilities in certain Protocols of getting a development in that direction, but that was stopped.  It seems to me that for the last few years there has been a retrograde movement rather than a forward movement in that direction. The League has received a few shattering blows within the last few years as regards its ability to prevent war. When one great Power snaps its fingers at the League it is not likely that another great Power is going to pay much attention to what the League says, except in so far as what the League says might affect the moral position of the great Power concerned. If it is prepared to sacrifice its moral position, then it is not going to bother much about what is thought by the Council of the League.  That was the importance, from the League's point of view, in the case of a decision a few years ago: that, if it became clear that one big Power could defy the wishes of the majority of the members of the League and defy the wishes of the League, then it would be only a short <Col N="2230" /> time until every Power would act in a similar fashion.  We have not yet got to a position in which the moral effect of a decision is going to deter a big Power, when it has special interests to serve, from following its own course. Of course, that means, in the long run, getting back to the old pre-1914 position, and that is what is happening in Europe at the moment, as far as I can judge at any rate; that we seem to have learned little from the last war and that there will be another war, and another war still, to end war.</P>
    <P>It is well that the peoples of the nations should realise that, and I am sure that responsible people in every nation are bringing to the attention of their people the desperate situation into which we are rapidly drifting. The only way, I think, that you can avoid wars in the future is by giving to the League sanctions by which the League will be able to enforce its decisions.  When we get to that stage, then I think we will have gone a good distance, but that is very far in the future.  Instead of that, there might be some form of federation of the States of Europe, for a specific purpose at any rate.  When we look back on history, however, we must come to the conclusion that where there has been agreement by groops of, shall we say, small States, or even of individuals, to submit to law, it has been for the most part by some one Power imposing its will upon the others.  The United States, perhaps, would be regarded as an example where people came together and where a group of states came together and formed a Union without one state impressing itself or imposing its will upon the rest.  I am sorry to think, however, that history indicates to us that the usual way in which people surrender rights which they regard as of a sovereign character is, as a rule, in the first instance, as a result of pressure by another Power which takes their rights from them, and later by beginning to consent to it. That is, I hope, not going to be the way in which the nations of Europe or the nations of the world will learn <Col N="2231" /> to obey some some system of law which they will make for themselves.</P>
    <P>We were asked about the codification of international law.  That is, more or less, at a stand-still, and I think that Deputies opposite will agree with me that it is very hard to speak about international law in the way in which we speak of national or domestic law. If certain principles were accepted it would be different, but law is law, for the most part, only where there is some power to enforce it, and except there is power for the enforcement of law, there is not much value in international law, because it is not going to be a protection.  Law ought to be a protection for the rights of those who submit to it&mdash;to protect them against aggression.  International law will become important and effective, to my mind at any rate, only when there will be some power which will give effect to and enforce its decrees.  That brings us back to the original question of collective security, or the question which, in my opinion, is closely related to it&mdash;the question of sanctions to the League of Nations.  I do not know whether there is any other particular point.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, on the question of Russia: first of all, with regard to the entry of Russia into the League, I was satisfied that, if the League was to serve any useful purpose, it should be its object to embrace within the League all the big States.  It is for that reason, naturally, that I should like to see Germany, and, naturally, Japan also, become members of the League, but only members if they were prepared loyally to accept the principles and loyally to act in accordance with the general spirit of the League. I thought that Russia&mdash;one of the biggest States in the world, if not the biggest, in territory, certainly very large, and with a population, I think, of over 160,000,000 of people&mdash;was a State that the League should desire to have within its membership.  For that reason, I supported the entrance of <Col N="2232" /> Russia into the League, but I pointed out at the same time that I would do so with far less questioning if we, in the League, had any assurance that principles, such as had been accepted by Russia when Russia made agreement with the United States, were accepted by Russia in regard to members of the League.  I indicated the hope&mdash;and so far as I have had any speech with representatives of other States I have tried to get them to see that it would make generally for good relations between the other States and Russia, and for good relations in the world generally&mdash;that that freedom of conscience to which we, and, I would say, the vast majority of the people of the world, are devoted and which they consider as essential from a human point of view, would be guaranteed and given in Russia.  I have tried to get that done.</P>
      <P>Again, here is a case where we must be realists.  By our statements we can do a great deal; we can make it of value to the representatives of Russia to meet world opinion in that matter.  We have not the power, however, of bringing these results about that the bigger States have.  I have no doubt whatever, that, if the representatives of the larger States pressed for the acceptance by Russia of principles and a line of action such as was accepted in regard to the United States, world relations generally would be greatly improved by that. I am certain, however, that it will require the advocacy of other States than ours.  It would require, in my opinion, the advocacy of a number of the greater States, and if they did that, I feel convinced that the desirable object that I expressed in the League of Nations would be secured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say before I close that Deputy Costello is right, as far as I can judge, in the view that we are regarded in Geneva as being in a very special position.  The representatives of States there have come to know that we can be trusted to act fairly, to judge these questions that come before us impartially, and to work generally in the genuine spirit of the League; to help for peace and good <Col N="2233" /> relations amongst all States and peoples.  We have that position.  We are co-operating with other States, particularly as was suggested with the northern group of States&mdash;the Scandanavian Group.  We have co-operated very frequently with them on lines of policy in that direction.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say further about what has happened since we took office than this; that I do not think that, during our period of office, whatever prestige we had has been lessened.  In fact, if I may say so, I believe that it has been greatly increased.  I think that also is the opinion of most people who are in touch with Geneva.  During the past year or so there were occasions when, in a signal way, we had appreciation of that fact by the League.  One was when our representative in Geneva was appointed High Commissioner in Dantzig.  Another was when Mr. Justice Meredith was made Vice-President of the Saar Plebiscite Tribunal. These were indications, in situations of delicacy and difficulty, where it was most important to get representatives who could be depended upon to act impartially and with a single eye to fair play and to promoting the interests of peace, when we were definitely in the forefront.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied with the work that is being done by our representatives in Geneva, and by our Department. But, of course, I am not going to pretend that I am satisfied with the League of Nations in its present form as such.  I do not think that anybody could be quite satisfied with it.  I am only hoping that, before we are caught again by another world war, we will realise, without having to be taught in that manner, how necessary it is for the various States to co-operate, by arbitration or otherwise, in getting rid of those immediate causes of war. Our representatives&mdash;so far as I was a representative I can speak for myself&mdash; have pursued that end without deviation, and we propose to continue in the same manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: That this Bill be now read a second time.</P>
      <P>The general purpose to which all social legislation is directed is the alleviation of the hardships accruing from risks to which all persons are exposed, and to meet which certain classes of the population are of themselves unable to make adequate provision.</P>
      <P>Of these risks the three which are most outstanding are old age, invalidity and death.  In this country protection against old age has already been afforded under the Old Age Pensions Acts.  Invalidity has been dealt with by the provision of sickness and disablement benefit under the National Health Insurance Acts, but there has hitherto been no adequate form of social legislation to cover the risk of death by assisting widows and orphans who on the death of the breadwiner have been left without means of subsistence and who in the nature of things are frequently not in a position to secure their own livelihood.</P>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to supply that deficiency and to put these deserving and helpless people in a position of comparative security.  In conformity with the principle which is now generally accepted that extension of the social services is best pursued along the lines of compulsory contributory insurance, the scheme for which the Bill provides has been framed mainly on the idea that during the working years of life contributions should be paid to provide for the protection of the worker's surviving widow, children or orphans in the event of premature death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has not, however, been possible to adhere altogether to the contributory principle.  In the first place, there is already in existence a number of widows and orphans, who are the survivors of men who, if the scheme had been earlier in force, would have been insured under it and in respect of <Col N="2235" /> whose insurance, pensions would have been payable.  It would be a great hardship on this class if, through a deficiency in the social legislation which is now to be remedied, they could never become entitled to the benefits of the scheme.  There is, therefore, included in the Bill provision for the payment of non-contributory pensions to the existing widows and orphans of men who at their death belonged to the class which is to be insured under the contributory scheme. Secondly, schemes of compulsorily contributory insurance are suited, in the main, to the circumstances of the wage-earning classes.  Starting with the idea that these are the classes for which protection is needed, it is reasonable to require from the employers and the employees, a weekly contribution payable with the same regularity as the cash wages are paid.</P>
    <P>It is true to say, however, that out of the whole population of workers in the Saorstát whose means are little more than sufficient to provide the ordinary necessities of life, there is a large number of persons who are not in receipt of cash wages at regular intervals.  The principal class of this type is the small working farmer whose level of subsistence is comparable with that of the urban wage-earner, and who requires, to the same extent at least, to be protected against the loss which his premature death might bring to his wife and children.  No proper solution of the difficulty of applying a scheme of compulsory contributory insurance to persons of this class has yet become apparent.  Their inclusion in the scheme is, however, regarded as imperative and it has been decided to include in the Bill provision for the payment of non-contributory pensions to the existing and future widows and orphans of agricultural &ldquo;small-holders,&rdquo; where the valuation of the holding does not exceed £8.</P>
    <P>In the application of the contributory scheme, certain conditions as to the number of contributions to be paid in order to qualify for pension are laid down.  In some cases these conditions may not be satisfied.  It would be <Col N="2236" /> inequitable to exclude the widows and orphans of such men entirely from benefit in view of the provisions made for the &ldquo;small-holder&rdquo; class in respect of whom no contributions are payable. It is accordingly provided that non-contributory pensions will be paid to the widows and orphans of men who, though insured under the contributory scheme at the time of their death, fail to satisfy the qualifying conditions as to contributions.</P>
    <P>The Bill, therefore, provides for two separate classes of pensions:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I. Contributory&mdash;applying to practically all the wage-earning classes whose rate of remuneration does not exceed £250 a year.</P>
    <P>II. Non-contributory&mdash;applying in the main to three classes:&mdash;(i) existing widows and orphans of persons who were in the wage-earning class at the date of their death; (ii) future widows and orphans of persons in the contributory class who though insured persons at the date of their death failed to satisfy the qualifying conditions for contributory pensions; (iii) existing and future widows and orphans of persons who at death were occupiers of agricultural small-holdings not exceeding £8 in valuation.</P>
    <P>In conformity with the general principles observed in such cases, certain conditions as to &ldquo;means&rdquo; will apply in the case of the non-contributory scheme.</P>
    <P>The contributory scheme on the other hand applies to persons whose pensions are supported by contributions, and who, therefore, so long as the qualifying conditions laid down in the Bill are fulfilled must be regarded as entitled to pensions as a matter of right.  There can, therefore, be no question of applying a means test for contributory pensions and they must be paid quite irrespective of what the pensioners' position in life may be or how they may be otherwise provided for.</P>
    <P>The dates at which each of the schemes is to come into force are to be appointed under clause 8 of the Bill and may either be separate dates or the same date for both schemes.  The actual dates so appointed will be as <Col N="2237" /> soon after the passing of the Act as is consistent with the making of the necessary administrative arrangements for dealing with the large number of initial claims.</P>
    <P>Contributory Scheme.&mdash;The scope of the contributory scheme is practically identical with that of the existing National Health Insurance Scheme.</P>
    <P>Every person who is at present insured for health insurance will become insured for widows' and orphans' pensions and the beneficiaries will be the future widows and orphans left by these persons.</P>
    <P>The number of persons at present insured for health insurance is about 500,000&mdash;345,000 men and 155,000 women. Those members of the Defence Forces who are insured for health insurance will also be included in the contributory scheme.</P>
    <P>Certain classes were excepted from the provisions of the National Health Insurance Acts, on the grounds that the terms of their employment secured to them sickness and disablement benefits not less favourable than those provided under the Acts, for example, Government employees, employees of local authorities, salaried staffs of railway companies, etc.  It does not follow, however, that any provision has been made for widows or orphans of such persons and accordingly these classes will, if their rate of remuneration does not exceed £250 a year be required to be insured for widows' and orphans' pensions.</P>
    <P>If in any of these classes the Minister is satisfied that the terms of the employment provide protection for widows and orphans not less favourable than is provided by the Bill, he may be order exclude them from the scope of widows' and orphans' pensions insurance.</P>
    <P>Insured persons under the National Health Insurance Acts include voluntary contributors.  These are persons who having left insurable employment after not less than two years' insurance elect to continue to be insured persons and to pay the whole health insurance contribution (both employer's and employee's portion).  Existing voluntary <Col N="2238" /> contributors under the Health Acts can elect to continue to be voluntary contributors, but they must do so before contributions under the Pensions Bill begin to be payable and must pay the whole health and pensions contribution.</P>
    <P>Persons who, in the future, cease to be compulsorily insured on leaving insurable employment, can, if they have had not less than two years' insurance elect to be voluntary contributors under the Health Insurance Acts.  If they so elect, they become insured also for pensions purposes and are required to pay the full pensions contribution in addition to the full health contribution.  The option to become a voluntary contributor is extended to persons in employments excepted under the Health Acts but insurable under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Subject to the fulfilment of the qualifying conditions widows of persons insured under the contributory scheme will receive pensions of 10/- a week up to age 70, when they will become entitled to old age pensions without any means test.</P>
    <P>In addition, children's allowances will be payable for children under 14, or under 16 if they are under fulltime instruction at school.  The allowances will be 5/- a week for the eldest child and 3/- a week for each of the other children.  If the widow remarries her own pension will cease but the children's allowances will continue until the statutory age is reached.  A widow of an insured person who is over 70 when her husband dies becomes entitled to an old age pension without any restriction as to means.</P>
    <P>Orphans' pensions at the rate of 7/6 a week are payable under the contributory scheme for each orphan of a man or of a widow, who was insured under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Contributions will be at the rate of 8d. per week for a man (of which 4d. will be paid by the employer and 4d. by the employee) and 4d. per week for a woman, all payable by the employer.  Voluntary contributors will pay the full pensions contribution themselves, in addition to the full health contribution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2239" /> The contributions will be payable as one with the National Health Insurance contribution, by means of stamps affixed to cards.  The values of the stamps ordinarily used will be as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Men&mdash;1/4 per week, of which 8d. will be in respect of health insurance and 8d. in respect of pensions insurance.</P>
    <P>Women&mdash;11d. per week of which 7d. will be in respect of health insurance and 4d. in respect of pensions insurance.</P>
    <P>The arrangement for the payment and collection of contributions under the Health Acts will apply automatically to contributions under the scheme. The same contribution card will be used for health and pensions purposes and the employer will be required to affix to the employee's card a stamp representing the combined health and pensions contribution for each week for which a contribution is payable. The stamped cards will be surrendered as at present to the Unified Society by the members concerned.</P>
    <P>Special provision for payment of contributions will be necessary in respect of soldiers and persons in excepted employments who are insurable for pensions.  In the case of soldiers, the Minister for Defence will pay direct to the Pensions Fund contributions at the rate of 8d. per week in respect of each insured soldier, subject to a deduction not exceeding 4d. per week from each insured soldier's pay.</P>
    <P>In the case of persons in excepted employments, pension contributions only (and not health and pensions contributions) are payable.  Power is taken to modify the regulations made under the Insurance Acts for the collection of contributions, and the power will probably be used to allow of direct cash payment of contributions by the employers of excepted persons.</P>
    <P>Contributions will cease to be payable on the attainment of age 70.</P>
    <P>Persons engaged in agricultural employment which is insurable under the Health Acts are included in the <Col N="2240" /> scope of the contributory pensions scheme.  As the rates of wages obtaining in agricultural employment are in the main lower than those of other wage-earning classes, it has been considered desirable to include in the Bill special provisions for dealing with them which can be reviewed if necessary at a later date.  For a period of five years from the date of commencement of the scheme, the rates of contributions of such persons will be half the ordinary rates, <i>i.e.</i>, 4d. for a man instead of 4d., and 2d. for a woman instead of 4d., and the rates of pensions payable in respect of their insurance will be:&mdash;Widow's pension, 8/- a week; Children's allowances, 4/- for the eldest and 2/6 a week for each other child; Orphan's pension, 6/- a week.</P>
    <P>The qualifying conditions for contributory pensions involve a minimum period of insurance and payment of a minimum number of contributions before a claim to a pension is established. The person in respect of whose insurance the pension is claimed must have been at least two years in insurance, and must have paid at least 104 contributions.  If more than four years have elapsed since the date of last entry into insurance, an average of 26 contributions must have been paid in each of the last three contribution years.  If the person was over 70 at the date of death, the contribution test is to be applied to the period before the attainment of age 70 during which contributions were payable. When an insured person attains the age of 70 he remains an insured person until he dies, although contributions have ceased.  This point on which there had been some doubt is made clear by the amendment of the National Health Insurance Acts in clause 67 of the Bill.  Insurance for the purpose of the National Health Insurance Acts and contributions paid under these Acts before the scheme begins will count towards satisfying the qualifying conditions.  In the case of excepted persons for whom contributions under the Health Acts were not payable, contributions under these Acts are deemed to have been paid before the commencement of the Scheme if the person was <Col N="2241" /> then in the excepted employment or within the prescribed period (which will probably be 12 months) before the commencement of the scheme.</P>
    <P>These provisions make it possible for widows and orphans of insured persons or persons who have been in excepted employment and who die soon after the commencement of the scheme to qualify for contributory pensions.</P>
    <P>Non-contributory Pensions.&mdash;I now come to the non-contributory pensions, and I might preface my explanation of this Part of the Bill by directing attention to the fact that no contributions have been paid or are to be paid in respect of these pensions, and consequently the entire cost must in the final resort be borne by the State.  It is desirable, therefore, that payments should be limited to necessitous cases, and that widows and orphans who either are in a position to provide for themselves or are already so provided for should not be entitled to these free pensions.  Acting on these considerations the Bill imposes two main limitations on the title to non-contributory pensions.  Firstly, pensions are only payable subject to a test as to the means of the applicant.  Secondly, widows under 60 years of age who have no dependent children will not be entitled to pensions.  Dependent children are children under 14 years of age, or under 16 if they are receiving full-time school instruction.</P>
    <P>The persons to whom non-contributory pensions will be payable may be classified as follows:&mdash;(i) Widows and orphans of men who have died before the date upon which contributions under the Bill become payable, and who were insured persons under the National Health Insurance Acts when they died.  This provision covers also the existing survivors of men who were over 70 when they died, if on the attainment of that age they were insured persons; (ii) widows and orphans of men who had died before contributions under the scheme become payable, and who when they died were engaged in an excepted employment which would have been insurable if the scheme had been in force when they died.  This provision covers also the <Col N="2242" /> existing survivors of persons in excepted employment who were over 70 when they died, if, when they attained the age of 70 they were in an excepted employment which is made insurable under the pensions scheme; (iii) the future widows and orphans of men who become insured under the contributory scheme, but who when they die have failed to satisfy the qualifying conditions as to contributions; (iv) the future widows and orphans of men who on the date when contributions under the contributory scheme become payable were not liable for the payment of contributions because they were over the age of 70, provided that when such men attained the age of 70 they were either insured under the Health Acts or would have been insured under the Contributory Pensions scheme if it had then been in force; (v) the present and future widows and orphans of agricultural &ldquo;small-holders&rdquo; the valuation of whose holding does not exceed £8.  It is a necessary condition in this case for the payment of a widow's pension that the widow shall continue to reside on the small-holding.</P>
    <P>The rates of pension payable under the non-contributory scheme will vary according to the locality in which the pensioner resides and also according to the means possessed by the pensioner.  The maximum rates of pensions are as follows:&mdash;(i) Widow's allowance: (a) resident in a county borough&mdash;7/6 per week, (b) resident in an urban area&mdash;6/- per week, (c) resident in a rural area&mdash;5/- per week; (ii) children's allowance: (a) resident in a county borough&mdash;3/6 a week for the eldest child under 14 (or 16, as the case may be) and 1/6 per week for each other child, (b) resident in an urban area&mdash;2/6 a week for the eldest and 1/- per week for each other child, (c) resident in a rural area&mdash; 2/- per week for the eldest and 1/- per week for each other child; (iii) orphan's pension: resident in a county borough&mdash;4/- per week, resident in an urban area&mdash;3/6 per week, resident in a rural area&mdash;2/6 per week.</P>
    <P>These maximum rates are reduced to 3/-, 2/- and 2/-, respectively, if <Col N="2243" /> the orphan is in an institution or is boarded out by a local authority. Provision is made to discourage cases of migration from rural areas to urban areas or county boroughs in order to qualify for pensions at the higher rates.  As I have already indicated, non-contributory pensions are only payable subject to a test of the means of the recipient.  The Bill provides that no pension will be payable when the net weekly means of the claimant are equal to or exceed the maximum rate of pension payable to the claimant.  If the net weekly means are less than the maximum pension payable, the maximum rate of pension will be reduced by 1/- for every complete 1/- of the net weekly means.</P>
    <P>The First Schedule to the Bill describes the manner in which the annual means are to be ascertained and their division into earned means and unearned means.  The annual means of a widow include the annual means of any children in respect of whom allowances are claimable and the annual earned means include the annual earned means of such children. The weekly means and the weekly earned means are the weekly equivalents of the respective annual means. In calculating the net weekly means from the weekly means certain exemptions are allowed.  These exemptions are as follows:&mdash;Residence in a county borough&mdash;an exemption of 5/- from the weekly means together with an additional exemption from the earned weekly means of 2/6 for each child with a maximum exemption in respect of children of 7/6.  Residence in an urban area&mdash;an exemption of 4/- from the weekly means together with an additional exemption from earned weekly means of 2/3 for each child with a maximum exemption of 6/9 in respect of children.  Residence in a rural area&mdash;an exemption of 3/- from the weekly means together with an additional exemption from earned weekly means of 2/- for each child with a maximum exemption of 6/- in respect of children.</P>
    <P>If these exemptions exceed the weekly means, the net weekly means <Col N="2244" /> are taken as nil and the maximum pension is payable.  If these exemptions are less than the weekly means, the net weekly means are taken as the difference, and for each shilling of net weekly means the maximum pension is reduced by 1/-.  In the case of orphans the exemption from means is 3/- in all cases.</P>
    <P>Widows' non-contributory pensions cease on re-marriage or on the attainment of age 70.  It is to be noted on re-marriage the whole pension, i.e., the widows' allowance and the children's allowances cease, while in the case of contributory pensions, re-marriage of the widow does not affect the children's allowances.  As already stated a non-contributory pension is granted only to a widow who is over the age of 60, or to a widow who being under 60, has at least one dependent child.  In the latter case the widow's allowance continues for a period of six months after the right to children's allowances ceases.  If at the end of the six months the widow has not attained the age of 60, the widow's allowance also ceases.  On the attainment of age 60 she may again become entitled to a non-contributory pension.</P>
    <P>Administration.&mdash;The administration of this scheme will be carried out by the national health insurance section of the Department of Local Government and Public Health, to which all claims for pensions will be made.  The Minister has power, with the sanction of the Minister for Finance, to appoint investigation officers for the purpose of investigating claims, means etc., and deciding officers who are to decide on the claims and make awards.  Any claimant who is dissatisfied by the award or decision of a deciding officer may appeal to a referee or referees selected by the Minister from a panel of referees appointed by the Minister for Finance, and the decision of the referce or referees will be final.  Books of pension orders of a type similar to those used for the payment of old age pensions will be issued, and the pensions will be payable weekly in advance at a post office selected by the pensioner.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2245" /> The Minister for Local Government and Public Health will have control of the Widows' and Orphans' Pension Fund, to which will be carried all contributions payable under the scheme and out of which pensions will be paid. Moneys not immediately required for current expenditure will be paid over to the Minister for Finance for investment in the &ldquo;Pensions Investment Account.&rdquo;  An annual State grant of £250,000 will be paid into this account in each of the first ten years.  Whenever the amount in the Pension Fund is insufficient to meet current expenditure, the necessary sums will be paid into the fund from the Investment Account.  The Minister for Finance is given power to have an actuarial investigation made into the general financial operation of the scheme at such time or times as he may consider necessary.</P>
    <P>Ordinarily contributory pensions will not be paid when the pensioner is resident outside Saorstát Eireann. Power is, however, taken in the Bill to arrange for the payment of pensions to persons who are resident in another country if that country has a contributory scheme of a similar nature, and if it provides for payment of pensions in Saorstát Eireann.  Power is also taken to make reciprocal arrangements with such countries for the continuity of insurance and the maintenance of acquired rights.  A non-contributory pension will not be granted unless the applicant has been resident in Saorstát Eireann for two years before the claim is made, and in no case will a non-contributory pension be payable outside Saorstát Eireann. In order to safeguard the scheme against abuse, the Bill provides that the widow of a man who marries after the Bill was introduced and was over the age of 60 at the date of the marriage will not be entitled to a pension.  Certain exceptions to this provision are set out in clause 28 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>A widow's pension, whether contributory or non-contributory, will not be paid while a widow is undergoing imprisonment or is maintained at the public expense in a mental asylum. The widow's allowance both cease. but children's allowances both cease, but <Col N="2246" /> the children, in such circumstances, are deemed to be orphans, and orphans' pensions (contributory or non-contributory) become payable to the guardian of the orphan or to such other person as the Minister may direct.  Cases may arise where the child of a widow is removed from her custody by order of a court, or is sent to a reformatory or industrial school, or is deserted or abandoned.  In such cases the widow cannot include the child in her claim for pension, and if the child is removed after the widow has been granted a pension, the pension will be reviewed.  The child in such cases is deemed to be an orphan and an orphan's pension will be payable to the guardian of the orphan or to such other person as the Minister may direct.  The Minister has power to pay a widow's pension to some other person for the widow's benefit, or to pay any child's allowance to a person other than the widow, for the benefit of the child.  An orphan's pension will be payable to the guardian of the orphan or to some other person appointed by the Minister for the benefit of the child.</P>
    <P>If a person who has claimed a pension receives outdoor relief pending the payment of the pension, which would not have been given if the pension were being paid, or if relief at a lower rate would have been given, the Minister will have power to repay to the public assistance authority granting the relief, the amount of such relief, or the excess payments of relief, and deduct the amount so paid from the pension.  Similarly, if a person who has claimed a pension receives unemployment assistance pending the payment of the pension which would not have been given if the pension were being paid, the Minister will have power to repay to the Minister for Industry and Commerce the amount of such assistance and deduct the amount so paid from the pension.</P>
    <P>Certain amendments in the National Health Insurance Acts and the Old Age Pensions Acts are required and these are contained in Part VIII of the Bill.  Section 13 of the National Health Insurance Act, 1918, is amended to provide <Col N="2247" /> that a person who attains the age of 70 while he is insured under the Health Insurance Acts, remains an insured person thereafter until he dies. This section also grants to insured persons, who cease to be employed and who were members of an approved society or the Unified Society, a period of free insurance after the termination of employment known as the &ldquo;Free Year.&rdquo;  For the purposes of qualifying for pensions, this period of free insurance is now granted to persons who were not members of a society. Cases have arisen where persons have applied for membership of the Unified Society and have produced contribution cards relating to previous periods of insurable employment.  Under the provisions of the Health Insurance Acts a person who was not a member of a society and who ceased insurable employment even for a week, was not entitled to a &ldquo;Free Year&rdquo; and was consequently regarded as a new entrant into insurance on subsequently becoming insurably employed.  Periods of insurable employment separated by short periods of unemployment could not be linked up.  In order to preserve continuity of insurance in the cases of such of these persons as are genuinely persons whose normal occupation is insurable, the &ldquo;Free Year&rdquo; is now deemed to apply.</P>
    <P>The Old Age Pensions Acts are amended so as to remove the means test under those Acts in the case of a widow who reaches age 70 while in receipt of a contributory widow's pension, or in the case of a widow who is over age 70 when her husband dies, who if she was under 70 would be qualified for a widow's contributory pension.</P>
    <P>Statement of numbers of widows and orphans and estimates of costs.&mdash;The Dáil will probably desire to have some indication of the number of persons covered by the scheme and of the cost of pensions.  In making these estimates considerable difficulty has been experienced, as full materials were not always available on which to base calculations.  The following figures have, therefore, been arrived at with <Col N="2248" /> some reserve but may be regarded as sufficiently accurate to give an approximate indication as to number and cost.</P>
    <P>Taking first the contributory scheme, it is estimated that in the first year the number of beneficiaries will be 700 widows and 1,200 children, including orphans.  These figures will rise gradually as insured persons die, leaving widows and orphans, until ultimately there will be 3,000 widows and 18,500 children in receipt of pensions or allowances. The cost in the first year will be £30,000, rising ultimately to £800,000 per year.  Under the non-contributory scheme the persons covered fall into various classes.</P>
    <P>Firstly, there is the class now existing of widows with dependent children, and of orphans of persons who had insurable status at their death.  It is estimated that there are 6,700 widows and 16,700 children and orphans in this class and that the cost of pensions will be £180,000 in the first year, gradually decreasing year by year as the widows remarry, die, or attain age 70, and as the children and orphans reach the statutory age.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there are the now existing widows between 60 and 70 years of age who have no dependants, and whose husbands had insurable status at their death.  The number of these widows is 8,660, and the cost of pensions in the first year will be £125,500, gradually decreasing year by year as in the first class.</P>
    <P>The third class comprises the now existing widows, with dependent children, and the orphans of small-holders. It is estimated that this class will include 4,000 widows and 10,460 children and orphans, and the cost in the first and each subsequent year will be £94,500.</P>
    <P>Lastly, there are the existing widows between 60 and 70 years of age, who have no dependants, and whose husbands were small-holders.  Of these, there are 4,750 and the cost in the first year and each subsequent year will be £62,000.  Taking these four classes together, it is estimated that the non-contributory pensions will cover 24,110 widows and 27,160 children and <Col N="2249" /> orphans, and the cost in the first year will be £461,500.  This figure added to the first year's cost of contributory pensions brings the total figure for pensions in the first year to £491,500.</P>
    <P>As the years progress, the general effect will be that the cost of non-contributory pensions will decrease, and the cost of contributory pensions increase, until eventually a position of comparative stability is reached in which the total annual cost will be £956,500, of which £800,000 will be for contributory and £156,500 for non-contributory pensions. The contribution income in the first year is estimated at £402,000, rising gradually to £426,000.  To this will be added an annual State subvention of £250,000, which it is estimated will be sufficient to cover the cost of benefits and administration during the first 10 years.</P>
    <P>The financial position will then be actuarially examined and further consideration given to the future arrangements necessary for the operation of the Act.</P>
    <P>That, I think, is a fairly full explanation of the Bill.  I am sure many questions will be asked in the course of the discussion and I shall be very happy to answer them and to give any fuller explanations Deputies may desire.  Before I sit down, I should like to express a word of very sincere thanks to the Chairman and members of the Committee who sat for a considerable period and at my request examined into the feasibility of a scheme of widows' and orphans' pensions.  Members who have seen the report will agree that they gave us a very interesting and instructive document.  There was not complete unanimity, although a very considerable amount of unanimity was achieved.  There were majority and minority reports as is usual when matters of this kind are under consideration. I should like to express to Judge Meredith&mdash;who sat as chairman of the Committee for a period in the beginning but who later had to leave in order to take up other work of a similar kind&mdash;and to Sir Joseph Glynn, to every member of the Committee and to its very competent <Col N="2250" /> Secretary, my best thanks for the splendid report they gave us and for the magnificent information which they gathered from all parts of the world and set out here for us.  I am sure Deputies would also like to express their thanks for the very fine report which they have submitted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I should like to congratulate the Minister upon the very lucid and explanatory statement which he has read to the Dáil.  I think it rather a pity that a statement of that kind was not circulated with the Bill because if it had been, it would have enabled the Deputies to understand the Bill with greater ease and clarity than was possible in the absence of the clear and lucid statement which we have just now received from the Minister. I should like, for instance, to ask the Minister to explain Sections 1 and 2 of the Bill, if he had not got that statement and if he was not assisted by an abundant supply of wet towels. These are two of the most complicated sections of the Bill, and I think only persons familiar with its drafting and who have in mind the situation with which these sections deal could find a ready explanation of them. The Minister's statement as read to the House now makes clear what is intended by the sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the House will feel satisfied that this Bill has at last been introduced. I say &ldquo;at last,&rdquo; because we had hopes that this Bill would have been introduced last year, especially since the Minister for Finance told us that he had set aside £250,000 in his Budget in order to finance a scheme of widows' and orphans' pensions, during the financial year ending 31st March last.  The fact that that sum was allocated, suggested that one might reasonably expect that the State would have made that contribution towards widows' and orphans' pensions during the last financial year.  While I welcome this Bill as the first, and a very important, step towards adding widows' and orphans' pensions to our code of social legislation, I should like to say to the <Col N="2251" /> Minister that I do not regard it by any means as the final step.  I think many more steps will be required to be taken before this Bill could adequately deal with the problem of providing for the nation's widows and fatherless children.  Recently there was circulated to Deputies the Report of the Committee of Inquiry into the question of widows' and orphans' pensions.  I agree with the Minister that the thanks of the House are due to the members of that Committee for presenting what, I think everybody who has read it will agree, is a very comprehensive document full of important information bearing on this all-important problem.</P>
    <P>Looking at table 1 on page 141 of this report we find that the Minister was presented with the fact that there were 134,000 widowed families in the country. It was on the basis of this report, with such later information as it was possible for the Department to obtain, that this Bill was presumably drafted.  We find in the table a declaration to the effect that there are 134,000 widows in the State.  The table also gives information as to the number of dependent children and step-children under 16 years of age in the family when this information was last obtained, namely, in 1926.  If we look at the Bill and study it in the light of this table, we find that the Minister, presented with the problem of providing pensions for 134,000 widows, promptly proceeds to eliminate 21,000 because they are childless widows under 60 years of age.</P>
    <P>Not apparently satisfied with this sufficiently large deduction from that number, the Minister proceeds to take away 55,000 widows who are 70 years of age and over.  By the elimination of these 55,000 and the 21,000 who are placed in the position that they can get no pensions, because they are childless, we find that 58,000 widows are left in the Bill.  So that the Minister, faced with the problem of providing pensions for 134,000 widows, proceeds to say that 58,000 of them will be dealt with by <Col N="2252" /> the Bill and that 76,000 will not be dealt with by the Bill.  So far as dealing with the existing problem is concerned, the problem of providing pensions for widows and orphans, the Minister is going to make it possible for 58,000 widows as a maximum&mdash;and that is a generous maximum&mdash;to get pensions, while 76,000 existing widows, so far as this table can be regarded as reliable to-day, are not going to get any pensions under the Bill.  I suggest to the Minister that, so far as dealing with the existing problem of widows' and orphans' pensions is concerned, he is leaving outside the scope of the Bill more existing widows than he is bringing within its scope.  Obviously, a Bill which does that is imperfect and unsatisfactory from the point of view of providing for existing widows.</P>
    <P>While I have given the Minister credit under this table for bringing 58,000 widows within the scope of the Bill, one must make a further subtraction from that figure because some of the 58,000 would also be ruled out by reason of the fact that their dependants are over 14 years of age.  They are shown to have dependants in this table because the age of dependency is shown as up to 16 years of age, but if you reduce the age of dependency from 16 to 14, you will find that the 58,000 will undergo a further process of shrinkage and that there will be a still smaller number of widows provided for under the Bill.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the Minister's statement that the State would provide a subvention of £250,000 per annum towards widows' and orphans' pensions, but that seems to be inconsistent with the declaration we had from the Minister for Finance last year in connection with his Budget Estimate.  On that occasion, the Minister, referring to the provision which he was making for widows' and orphans' pensions said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It has been exceedingly difficult to prepare a practicable and satisfactory proposal.  The difficulties, however, have been overcome and, in fact, the administrative details of the scheme are being worked out by <Col N="2253" /> the Departments concerned.... The proposal will cost about £400,000 in a full year and about £250,000 in this, and the latter sum is being set aside accordingly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There we had a clear indication from the Minister for Finance that so far as the Exchequer funds were concerned, it was anticipated that the cost would be £400,000 in an ordinary year.  Now we are told by the Minister, and, of course, it is clearly indicated in the Bill, that the normal maximum contribution by the Minister for Finance will be £250,000 instead of the £400,000 indicated by the Minister in his speech last year.  If the State were not excluding a minimum of 76,000 widows, and if they were not under this Bill to pay low non-contributory rates, one might understand the Minister's reducing the State contribution from £400,000 to £250,000 but in face of the exclusion of at least 76,000 widows and in face of the low non-contributory rates provided for in the Bill, this decision, arrived at subsequent to the Minister's Budget statement, seems to me to have been based on economy and not to have been reviewed in the light of the adequacy or otherwise of the provisions which were being made in the Bill for the payment of pensions to necessitous widows.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister when it was decided to reduce the contribution from £400,000 to £250,000; what considerations actuated that reduction; and whether the reduction was put into operation after the Government were satisfied that the rates provided in the Bill were adequate having regard to the problem to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I was interested in that portion of the Minister's statement which dealt with the question of contributory and non-contributory schemes.  The Minister did not indicate for what reason the Government had decided that this scheme should be a contributory scheme, in part, at all events.  The report of the Committee of Enquiry recommended a non-contributory scheme and, in 1927, the report of the <Col N="2254" /> Poor Law Commission recommended a non-contributory scheme.  Here were two bodies, after a thorough examination of the problem, convinced that a non-contributory scheme was the most practical scheme and yet this Bill provides for contributory pensions without our being given any indication as to the reasons which induced the Executive Council to embark on a contributory scheme.  I know, of course, that there are two well-known and well-defined schools of thought in respect of pensions of this kind, one favouring contributory schemes and the other non-contributory schemes.  So far as this country is concerned, we have two authoritative declarations on the matter by the Poor Law Commission which sat in 1927 and by the recent Committee of Enquiry set up by the Minister himself to enquire into the provision of pensions for widows and orphans. These two authoritative declarations indicate that the respective bodies believed that the non-contributory scheme was the more practicable and the more advantageous in relation to the problem to be dealt with in this State, but, notwithstanding that, the Executive Council appear to have departed radically from the scheme of non-contributory pensions and to have introduced the contributory scheme, without, in my view, any adequate explanation for departing from the recommendation of these two bodies.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that the contributory pensions provided under this Bill will do something to relieve the appalling poverty and destitution which frequently follows in the train of the death of a breadwinner, but, while it will do something to relieve that awful poverty, it will by no means adequately deal with the problem of the family left without its breadwinner and compelled to fend for itself.  If we take, for instance, the worker employed in the City of Dublin with a wage of £3 per week and with a wife and three children to maintain, we find that under this pensions scheme, in the event of his death and assuming that he fulfils the qualifications required under the Bill, his widow will be entitled, under the contributory <Col N="2255" /> section of the Bill, to make application for a widows' and orphans' pension.  If she does, and is successful, she will receive a pension of 10/- a week for herself, 5/- for the first child, 3/- for the second and 3/- for the third, making a total of 21/- per week, but even that income will be £1 19/- per week less than what that family found necessary for its subsistence previously, so that even the new rates of benefit provided under the Bill will go only a very small way, in homesteads such as that, towards making provision for the problem of providing the family wants once death has claimed the breadwinner.</P>
    <P>If we look at the position in respect of agricultural workers under this Bill, we find that the provision to be made is even more inadequate than that which is made in the case of nonagricultural workers under the contributory scheme.  It is provided in the Bill that, for a period of five years, the rates of benefit to agricultural workers are to be reduced.  The widow is to get 8/- instead of the ordinary allowance of 10/-; the first child is to get 4/- instead of the ordinary allowance of 5/-; and for each other child the allowance is to be 2/6 a week instead of the 3/- normally allowed.  I concede that the rates of contribution are likewise reduced, but I should like to know from the Minister what special circumstances existed to justify the reduction of the rates of benefit to agricultural workers for the first five years under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what considerations prompted that reduction and whether the fear was that the burden on the agricultural worker in the matter of contributions which he will be required to pay would be too great during the first five years or whether it was felt that there was some special case for reducing the pensions payable to the widows and orphans of agricultural workers as compared with any other person who was not an agricultural worker and who claimed a pension under the contributory section of the Bill.  It seems to me that the State might well have allowed the agricultural worker to receive the same <Col N="2256" /> rate of benefit as other persons under the contributory scheme, because I think that one of the objections to this whole Bill, an objection which could be forcibly and effectively urged, is that it creates too many separate classes. There is an obvious advantage in simplicity, more especially where that simplicity runs side by side with making better provisions for those particular classes.  It is in my view very much better to adopt a uniform scale, which also has the advantage of being a scale that it is possible to administer with greater simplicity.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the course of his statement, referred at length to the rates of benefit which will be provided under the non-contributory scheme. Here I want to say that I think the non-contributory section is a very serious blot on the whole Bill.  The rates of benefit which are provided under the non-contributory scheme are so low as to make it quite impossible for widows and dependent children to live on them.  There must, of course, be a non-contributory section dealing with the cases of pre-Act widows, but there is no reason why the rates of benefit in the case of pre-Act widows should be reduced to what I can only describe as the pauperised scale set up in the Bill.  If we look at the provisions of the Bill in respect of the pensions which will be paid under the non-contributory scheme we find that a widow in the City of Dublin will receive an allowance of 7/6 for herself, 3/6 for the first child, 1/6 for the second child, 1/6 for the third child, and 1/6 for the fourth child&mdash;a maximum of 15/6 per week&mdash;which is subject to a means test. I should like to know from the Minister how a widow and four children can possibly exist in the City of Dublin on 15/6 per week.  How can she pay rent, provide food, clothing, school books, and other necessaries and amenities of life, for a civilised family, on an income of 15/6 per week?</P>
    <P>If we go to urban areas, which under the Bill are towns with a population of 7,000 and over, we find that a widow with four children will get a maximum allowance of 11/6 per week, again subject to a means test.  I should like <Col N="2257" /> to ask the Minister on what basis he considers it possible for a widow to live for instance in Clonmel or in Drogheda or in Galway, maintaining four children, paying rent and providing the necessaries of life, on an income of 11/6 per week from this source?  It may well be of course that that income will be the maximum income of the family.  If we go on to other areas, towns with a population of less than 7,000 at the last census, we find that under this Bill a widow with four children will presumably be expected to sustain herself and her children on an income of 10/- per week.  I should like to ask by what process of reasoning is it considered possible that a widow can maintain herself and four children in a town like Naas, Kildare, Athy, or any town with a population under 7,000, on an income of 10/- a week.  I say that this section, in respect of the rates of pensions which are to be provided, is a very serious blot on the whole Bill.</P>
    <P>In the same section we find that a childless widow under 60 years of age is to get no pension at all.  A widow of, let us say, 50 years of age, with one child, will if she lives in the City of Dublin get 11/- per week.  When the child becomes 14½ years of age, no further pension is payable in respect of that child, although it will still be idle, it will still eat and drink and require to be clothed and sheltered. The expenditure on the child, because of its advancing years, will be greater, but notwithstanding the fact that the child will go off the pension fund the widow will go off the fund as well. The child goes off the pension fund six months after attaining the age of 14 years, so that a widow of 50 years of age with one child aged 14½ years will not get a pension under the non-contributory scheme.  If a widow has three children, aged, let us say, 14½, 16 and 17 years, under the Bill she will not get a pension in respect of those three children, and will not get a pension in respect of herself until she becomes 60 years of age, whereupon she will come back on the fund as a childless widow entitled to a pension.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that that <Col N="2258" /> section of the Bill is obviously unfair. It is bad enough to cut off the child of a widow at 14½ years of age, but, when that child is the only title to the widow's pension, to cut off the widow as well if she is not 60 years of age is going to impose a very serious hardship.  Those rates of benefit which are paid under the non-contributory section of the Bill are, in my opinion, altogether inadequate to sustain human existence. Those rates of benefit are, in many cases, lower than the rates provided in the form of home assistance.  When the Poor Law Commission was reporting in 1927 it said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We received a considerable amount of evidence in favour of removing destitute widows with children from the purview of the poor law.  It is urged that the present system of poor relief for widows, even when administered sympathetically, is altogether inadequate; that the assistance allowed varies considerably, and except in Dublin there does not seem to be a regular scale; that it is hurtful to the self-respect of those widows, who have been reduced to destitution through the deaths of their husbands, to be compelled to parade their poverty every week at the office of the assistance officer. Witnesses were generally in favour of substituting for home assistance widows' pensions payable by the State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that those rates of benefit paid under the non-contributory section will not, as the Poor Law Commission hoped, result in widows being taken out of the disedifying position of having to parade their poverty before home assistance officers to try to obtain home assistance each week, because it is humanly impossible for persons to lead any kind of civilised existence on the rates of benefit which are provided under that section.  To that extent we will still have the position where widows are compelled to seek home assistance in order to supplement the low rates of benefit which they will receive under this Bill.  I have said that the rates paid under the non-contributory <Col N="2259" /> section are lower in many cases than the rates paid in the form of home assistance.  If the Minister examines the position in the City of Dublin in that respect I think he will find that the rates of benefit paid under the non-contributory scheme here are in fact less than the outdoor relief which is granted in a great many cases in the City of Dublin, or if he goes on to the Balrothery Board of Assistance and compares the scale in operation there with the scale under this Bill he will find an enormous disproportion.  If we take, for instance, a widow with four children living in Balbriggan, and compelled to seek home assistance from the Balrothery Public Assistance Committee, we find that under the scale of benefit in operation there she gets 7/6 for herself, 3/- for the first child, and 2/- for each additional child, so that a widow with four children living in Balbriggan would get from the Balrothery Board of Assistance 16/6 per week. That would be their conception of what it takes a widow to sustain herself and her four children.  Under this Bill a widow with four children in Balbriggan coming under the non-contributory section would be given a maximum of 10/- a week as compared with the 16/6 which could be got from the Balrothery Board of Assistance in a case of destitution.</P>
    <P>In its report, on page 38, the Committee of Inquiry appointed by the Minister, recommending the adoption of a scheme for the payment of widows' and orphans' pensions at a rate much higher than the rate set out in the non-contributory section&mdash; a rate which would provide 21/- a week pension for a widow with three children&mdash;apologised even for the small rate of pension thus allowed and in doing so used these words:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In making this recommendation, we are fully aware that the scheme proposed will do no more than satisfy minimum requirements.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When the Committee was using these words they were proposing to pay a widow with four children at the rate <Col N="2260" /> of 24/- a week.  They were then convinced that benefit to that extent would do no more than satisfy minimum requirements, but yet, under the non-contributory section of the Bill, it is proposed to grant a maximum pension of 10/- a week! If 24/- so shocked the Committee that they felt bound to apologise and to say that it would do no more than satisfy minimum requirements, one wonders what the Committee would have thought if they had been recommending a proposal to give a maximum of 10/- instead of the 24/- which they had in mind when they drafted the report.</P>
    <P>The rather striking part of this Bill is the complexion it gets from a reference which was made by the Minister in the course of his speech. He said power was taken in the Bill to provide that if a person received home assistance or unemployment assistance benefit while waiting for the sanction of a claim for a widows' and orphans' pension, steps could be taken to have the amount refunded to the respective authority, either the Department of Industry and Commerce or the local county board of health.  If it is intended by that statement to indicate that a person might, while awaiting sanction for a widows' and orphans' pension, go to the local board of health and seek home assistance, and the amount received by that person in that way has to be refunded when the widows' and orphans' pension is granted, then it seems to me to be postulating an assumption that the rate of benefit provided under the non-contributory section is to be regarded as capable of sustaining the persons concerned. I suggest that widows with four children living in towns with a population of less than 7,000 will find it necessary to ask for home assistance to supplement the rates that are set out under this particular section of the Bill.  Any proposal to refund to the local authority moneys received by way of home assistance seems to imply that the Minister is satisfied that the amount granted by way of pension will be adequate for the <Col N="2261" /> sustenance of the person concerned. I hope that is not intended as a declaration of policy, because in my opinion many widows will find it imperative to go to the local authority to supplement the small income which they will receive under the non-contributory section.</P>
    <P>I think a widows' and orphans' pension scheme which provides uniform rates of benefit has obvious advantages from an administrative point of view. There is a good deal to be said for the introduction of a scheme to provide uniform rates of benefit for all widows.  This Bill suffers from the blemish, and it is a serious blemish, that it creates certain classes of persons. In some respects it creates new categories of poor persons, to deal with whose destitution this or some future Government will have to introduce legislation.  I suggest that the Government should reconsider the rates of benefit provided under the non-contributory section.  Instead of the low rates provided, they should give uniform pensions for all widows at the rate that is applicable under the contributory section.  The obvious answer from the Minister is &ldquo;Where is the money to come from?&rdquo;  I am sure if the Minister were responsible for dispensing the money, he would be much more generous than the Minister for Finance.  But the problem of finding the money is not wholly insuperable.  He will probably recollect that when the National Health Insurance Act was introduced it was given a substantial paper credit in order to send it on its way.  It ought to be possible to provide a substantial paper credit for this widows' and orphans' pension fund, and that credit could be redeemed out of any actuarial surplus which the fund might show on a future actuarial examination, or loans so advanced to the pension fund might be met out of Budgetary moneys at some date in the future when, perhaps, there will be a greater amount of prosperity with us than there is to-day.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Industry and Commerce were here I have no doubt he would give us a glowing picture of the future of the country.  In some <Col N="2262" /> of his rhetorical moments he might tell us the only danger threatening any of our citizens was that they stood the risk of being drowned in an avalanche of milk and honey.  If the Minister for Industry and Commerce can persuade the Executive Council, and the Minister for Finance in particular, to believe that there is even a 50 per cent. chance of it being realised, would it not constitute a good case to give an advance to this fund in order to enable a uniform rate of benefit to be paid? Let such loan as is advanced to the fund be repaid out of surpluses which may be shown on actuarial examination or otherwise by the redemption of a loan from budgetary allocations each year.  I suggest that aspect of the Bill might receive sympathetic consideration.</P>
    <P>I believe once this measure is in operation that there will be a strong outery against the low benefits proposed under the non-contributory scheme.  I believe this Government or some future Government will be compelled by pressure of public opinion to introduce at a later date, probably not far distant, a Bill to raise the rates of benefit to the non-contributory class.  I would suggest to the Minister having regard to the obvious hardship which will be imposed by the rates of benefit paid under the non-contributory section and having regard to the obvious advantages of having a uniform rate of benefit, that at this stage the Executive Council might reconsider the matter with a view to overcoming such difficulty as resides in the shortage of money either by a better credit to the fund or by annual Budgetary allocations.  We should have available still an extra £150,000 that the Minister for Finance spoke of last year.  We had promises then that there would be £400,000 available for this measure and now there is only £250,000.  At all events the extra £150,000 promised last year by the Minister for Finance would help to meet the problem of raising the existing rates of benefit.  I hope the Minister will undertake to give sympathetic consideration to the question of <Col N="2263" /> raising the rates of benefit under the non-contributory scheme.  That is the serious blemish in the whole Bill and it will only provide the motive power for a fresh and legitimate agitation to raise the low rates of benefit provided in the Bill.  If the Minister will do that and raise the rates of benefit to the existing widows to the levels set out in the other sections of the Bill he will have done much to make the Bill acceptable from the point of view of assisting widows and fatherless children.  If the Minister in replying would assure the House on that matter he would make this Bill a very notable contribution to social progress in this country to-day.</P>

      <P>Let me at the outset join with the Minister and with Deputy Norton in conveying the best thanks of the House to the members who formed the Commission of Inquiry into the question of widows and orphans and who issued that very valuable report.  The report certainly showed very careful study of the existing conditions.  Only for that report we could not have advanced so far as we have advanced here this evening.  The extension of the social services for widows and orphans is a thing that appeals to all Christian-minded people and personally I believe that the Minister is entitled I will not say to congratulation but to sympathy in his endeavour to deal with a matter of so much importance.  I have no doubt that, like Deputy Norton, there will be many people disappointed with the Minister for Finance and the Government for not living up to their promises with regard to better and more generous provision for widows and orphans.  Deputy Kelly tells us that we should not rely on these promises, that they are only promises and that there is a big difference between promises and performances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What strikes me about this Bill is that while an attempt has been made to grapple with a difficult situation there is a certain amount of discrimination shown between the different classes.  That is bad.  It is particularly so with the introduction <Col N="2264" /> of the different scale of pensions for people who are engaged in agricultural occupations as against people engaged in other occupations.  These appear to me to be entirely unwarranted.  In the Minister's introduction of the Bill he gave no indication as to why that should be so.  I can well understand in the case of non-contributory pensions&mdash;say, small farmers who would have something to get out of the place &mdash;that there would be some reason in saying &ldquo;well, they are not dependent on these pensions; they have other means.&rdquo;  In Section 10, here we have a scheme of pension rates from 10/-, 5/-, 3/- to 8/-, 4/- and 2/- in the case of agricultural workers.  I would like to know what influenced the people who drafted this Bill to discriminate like that?  We have the case of rural workers living in labourers' cottages. We have also workers, probably artisans, living side by side with agricultural workers in labourers' cottages.  Under this Bill, the widow of the road worker will apparently get a bigger benefit than the widow of the agricultural worker.  The Bill apparently was originally conceived with the idea of helping the necessitous widows and orphans.  Though it is on a contributory basis, I do not think that it is fair to pay the agricultural workers a lesser pension because their husbands had been paid, if you like, a lesser wage.</P>
    <P>It is quite possible and probable that the agricultural worker was paid a lesser wage and that his contribution was less than that of the artisans, but what he lacked in actual cash he was in receipt of in kind.  Possibly he got milk, vegetables and other things.  Why his widow should be deprived of her rights or why she should get less is a matter that is beyond me, except it is that the agricultural labourer's contribution to the fund was not as great as other people's contributions to the fund.  But after all if this Bill was conceived for the purpose of relieving necessitous widows and orphans I do not see that point should carry the weight it has carried and why the man who happens to be an agricultural worker instead of <Col N="2265" /> a road worker should have his widow paid a lesser pension.</P>
    <P>I entirely agree with Deputy Norton in the matter of the non-contributory pensions.  I really do think that the Minister will have to mend his hand or you will have somebody else coming along and endeavouring to mend his hand for him.  The rates of pension laid down here on the non-contributory basis are rates on which nobody could be expected to live.  They are below what is ordinarily given by boards of health in the way of home assistance. The whole Bill appears to me to be a Bill that is relying entirely for its administration upon the operation of other Acts.  To that extent, of course, it is largely involved for if we want to know the meaning of one section we have first to go back and see what section of another Act is repealed. The Bill is very involved in that respect, and it makes one feel that the Minister is entitled to a certain amount of sympathy in the matter, but he ought to have made some attempt to even up the pensions and to have less classes.  I think in that respect the principle followed is wrong.  The Minister must apparently realise the very difficult task that is in front of him in endeavouring to put this Bill into operation.  Section 63 appears to be an extraordinary section.  That section sets out:&mdash;</P>
    <P>If in any respect any difficulty arises in bringing into operation this Act, the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may by order do anything which appears to be necessary or expedient for bringing this Act into operation, and any such order may modify the provisions of this Act so far as may appear necessary or expedient for carrying the order into effect.</P>
    <P>That is really all-embracing. Apparently anything that this House does may be undone by the Minister if he feels it prevents the bringing into operation of the Act in any particular respect.</P>
    <P>Again, I should like to say that the Minister ought not to have the pensions <Col N="2266" /> governed by conditions of previous employment or the contributions that happened to be previously paid.  I think that really the whole basis of the agitation for a Bill of this kind was irrespective of the employment they were in, to provide for necessitous widows and orphans.  That seems to have been departed from, and the pensions are now to rely to a very large extent on the contributions that people are able to make or have been able to make in the past.  That is a departure from the general principle which had its effect upon the origin of the Bill.  I should like the Minister to reconsider a good many of the sections in the Bill with regard to the pensions.  Of course, the Bill as it stands is obviously very involved and, on the Committee Stage, we will probably have much more to say about it.  The Minister ought seriously to reflect, however, upon the fact that the Bill has not met the demand, which was for provision for necessitous widows and orphans irrespective of what their previous employment was.</P>
    <P>On the whole, of course, we welcome the Bill.  It is an attempt to meet a crying need; but I am afraid it falls very far short of what was expected of it.  As far as the allowances are concerned, particularly under the non-contributory portion, they fall very far short indeed of what decency would suggest should be given to these people to live upon.  The fact that childless widows are debarred and that children when they come to 14 years of age, or 16 years of age if they are school-going, go out of the scheme and take the mother out with them, seems to me a very great drawback.  I hope the Minister will endeavour to amend that either on the Committee Stage or sometime before the Bill leaves the House.  I am afraid that this is a Bill which will be difficult to administer and to operate and that an amending Bill will be required very shortly.  On the whole, we wish the Bill God-speed, and we hope it will meet to some extent the purpose for which it has been framed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SydneyBMinch" hpid="Mr. Minch Mr. Minch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite obvious from the information we have received and <Col N="2267" /> the reports we have read that this Bill has been for a long time under the consideration of the Government and their advisers.  The Bill will create a great deal of disappointment.  We realise that the all-important matter which this House has primarily to consider in connection with this Bill is the amount of money that the country can afford.  We also realise that the next matter to be investigated is how the Bill, in fairness and justice, can be applied to those who would be entitled to benefit under it.  The intention to bring in this Bill received such tremendous advertisement for the last two years that very big things indeed were expected from it by those who believe that they will come within its scope for benefit.  I may say that the Bill will create, not only disappointment, but a certain amount of bad temper.  In my belief, it is a Bill which falls so short of what the people were led to expect that it will act as a boomerang on the Government themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Owing to the classifications that are being made, it seems to me that certain people who will come under one or other of these categories will feel very humiliated indeed.  As a matter of fact, the Bill in some of its provisions is very humiliating.  Under the non-contributory part of the Bill, people will be worse off than they would be under home assistance.  When this Bill comes into operation, the widows' and orphans' allowances which were in existence under the home assistance scheme will be cast aside and under the pensions which they will receive now the people will be worse off.  A widow with a small family living in a town down the country, who will come under the non-contributory part of this scheme, would be better off under the home assistance scheme.  In other words, this Bill is going to lower the standard of living of such people and make them worse off than they were under home assistance.  I am quite satisfied that the Minister did not belive that that would be the effect of this Bill and that he is sincerely anxious to remove the distress that <Col N="2268" /> exists.  But, if the distress is to be increased by it, or if these people are to be worse off under it, then there is something wrong.</P>
    <P>We have a definition of an agricultural worker and a definition of a road worker under the Bill and these two are to be classified separately.  How is an agricultural worker to be definitely determined?  Everybody knows that an agricultural worker sometimes gets six months' work on a farm and for the next three months is working on the roads or <i>vice versa.</i> There should be no discrimination made between a road worker and an agricultural worker.  My belief is that the classifications might be reduced to two.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that this Bill, welcome as it is, is not going to meet the situation at all&mdash;that it is only a poor attempt to meet the situation.  I am quite satisfied that this Bill is only a camouflage; that it is a smoke screen. I am quite satisfied that it is not the Bill that we were expected to believe was going to benefit the widows and orphans, and I believe it will meet with a very bad reception in the country.</P>
    <P>I thoroughly agree with the remarks passed by the Leader of the Labour Party and by Deputy Brennan, in the Front Bench of my Party, in respect of the non-contributory part of the scheme, in which they deprecate the poor allowances which that part of the scheme gives.  I believe that the end of this Bill will be many amendments. If it is not, it should not be received by the House and it should not even be brought outside the House on the pretence that it is an honest attempt by this House to give decent assistance to widows and orphans.  My belief is that it will not be received as such outside the House and I believe that it should not be received as such inside the House.  That does not mean, however, that I would oppose even a small step by way of advance towards relieving these people, and I shall not oppose the Bill; but I would advocate a better and more sincere attempt at relief of the widows and orphans of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. T.J. Murphy Mr. T.J. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we might all congratulate ourselves on the fact <Col N="2269" /> that this Parliament is actually considering proposals for a measure of this kind after a very prolonged delay. If the measure is rather a poor and inadequate one, at least we can congratulate ourselves on the fact that it represents a principle that is very valuable in social legislation.  I have not had the advantage of hearing the Minister's statement, and I must admit that, in endeavouring to understand the principles of the Bill, I have not been as successful as I should like.  I tried to study it as carefully as I could but found it difficult to understand, and any summaries of the measure that have appeared have not been as illuminating as one would wish.  If, however, we are to have a contributory portion of this Bill; if we are to have widows' pensions partly on a contributory basis, the provisions represented in the Bill seem to go some distance towards meeting the position.  I should prefer, and I think it would be the real solution of the question, that widows' pensions should be payable entirely on a non-contributory basis, but if the contributory basis that is fixed in one portion of this Bill is to remain, it seems fairly reasonable, with the difference that exists between this and the same portion of a similar measure in other countries in regard to the age of 14 years, after which a child ceases to qualify as mentioned in this measure.  That period is two years more&mdash;16 years&mdash;in similar measures in operation elsewhere.  That seems to be partly made up for in the contributory side of this Bill by providing that, if children after the age of 14 continue to attend school, the provisions will apply until they reach 16 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one turns to the other side of the Bill, one is very much disappointed. It is clear that there are very many deserving people who will not be included in the scope of the Bill, and when one remembers that the very large number of people who would benefit immediately, if the scope of the Bill was wider, represent a very deserving section of the population, one is very much disappointed.  There are quite a number of widows with <Col N="2270" /> dependent children in this country at the present time whose breadwinners, in life, were not people who would normally be insurable.  So far as I can understand the Bill, people in that position will not benefit as a result of the operations of this measure. The non-contributory portion of the Bill, in relation to the amount of pensions payable in rural areas, represents a very poor and meagre financial provision.  When one remembers that it is proposed that the amount of the pension will be determined ultimately after a means test based, possibly, on the same lines as that in the Unemployment Assistance Act, one does not see very much prospect of anything like the substantial pensions that widows in rural areas would be entitled to.</P>
    <P>I had the advantage of hearing portion of Deputy Minch's speech and I am in agreement with a good deal of what he said, with one difference, and it is one, I think, that I ought to emphasise.  Deputy Minch states that in some cases some persons at present in receipt of home assistance will be no better off, and perhaps worse off, if they benefit by this measure.  There is at least one difference, however, and I think it ought to be mentioned. Even if the people who receive pensions under the non-contributory portion of this Bill will not be better off financially, at least they will be better off in having the stigma attached to outdoor relief removed.  I think that is a very welcome change.  Some people, whose pensions will not represent very much financially, will be put into the better and happier position of feeling that the money they receive is not charity and that they are getting it at the hands of the State in the same manner as the old-age pensioners are getting their pensions under another measure.  However, with much of what Deputy Minch said in other respects I am in agreement.</P>
    <P>I regret that it is not possible for me, not having heard the Minister's statement and having, as I previously admitted, failed to understand the provisions of the Bill by reason of the numerous references one finds in its <Col N="2271" /> provisions, to offer a more detailed or helpful criticism of the measure.  I feel that from all quarters of this House, where there is a desire to approach this matter with a view to doing full justice to the very deserving section of the people that will be affected by this measure, there will be an appeal to the Minister to reconsider the whole position so far as the non-contributory portion is concerned, with a view to seeing how much wider the scope of the Bill can be made.  Members of this Party, and private members throughout this House, will be in a difficulty in having their desire expressed by way of amendments for the purpose of more generous provisions, by reason of the fact that they are precluded from moving amendments the effect of which would be to increase the charge on public funds. I hope, however, that whatever criticisms have been offered on the Bill, and whatever criticisms will be offered before the Second Reading of the Bill is passed, will enable the Minister to reconsider what are very obvious defects in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I should like to say, in concluding, as I said in the beginning, that I think it is a matter we can congratulate ourselves upon when we reach the point of considering a measure of this kind which represents a very substantial advance; and though we may regret that the provisions of the Bill fall a good deal short of what they might be in certain respects, at least we have gone the distance of securing the principle. If we do not succeed in making the Bill all that some of us would wish that it could be made on this occasion, at least we can feel that we have taken some step on the road towards giving justice to a very deserving section of the people who have been denied for a long time the justice to which they were entitled and which has been given to other peoples by Governments throughout Europe for a number of years past.</P>

Of course, we all admit that the Bill has many defects, but some of these, I expect, will be remedied on the Committee Stage.  I hope that before the Bill passes through this House the Minister will do all he can to make it acceptable to all Parties. I would be glad if the Minister, when replying, would give some indication as to when it is hoped to pass the Bill into law.  Is it intended that it should become law before the adjournment for the summer recess?  That is all that I have to say on the Bill.  I again congratulate the Minister on introducing it.  It is a measure that is very much needed and one, of course, that is long overdue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>On the whole, Sir, I think I may take the liberty of saying that the reception of the Bill has been more or less cordial.  I was very disappointed with Deputy Minch's speech.  I have often heard the Deputy here lecturing us on the desirability of avoiding bitter Party controversy.  His speech in my opinion struck a very bad Party note.  That was how his speech impressed me.  I do not know how it impressed others.  The language that he used in describing the Bill was not, I think, worthy of him or of the Bill. He said it was camouflage; that it was humbugging the people.  I could sympathise with him, and so I believe could a great many other people, if he had stopped at saying that to him it was a disappointing Bill.  I could understand reasonable criticism from him or from any Deputy, but the language that he used in describing the Bill, was, I think, quite unworthy of him, especially coming from a Deputy who tells us from platforms and, as I have said, in this House, that we ought not to make Party speeches, particularly on matters of this kind which are within our competence to deal with and on which Party considerations ought not to arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not expect that anybody would get up and say: &ldquo;this is a magnificent <Col N="2273" /> Bill, we are glad to get it, it satisfies our demands and the people will be very happy to have it.&rdquo;  I think a Minister introducing any Bill would be very foolish to expect anybody in the House to make speeches of that kind, and particularly on a Bill dealing with a question of social legislation that has been under discussion for a long time at public boards and other places where people interested in social problems meet.  I know of my own knowledge that this question of pensions for necessitous widows has been advocated for at least 25 years in the City of Dublin.  As Deputy Murphy said, we can at any rate congratulate ourselves in this House on this: that we are at last actually dealing with the principles of a measure to give some relief to necessitous widows and orphans.  We can congratulate ourselves on this: that we have a Bill embodying practical suggestions for dealing with that problem before us, and that we have a large sum of money available to be divided amongst that very deserving and worthy class, necessitous widows and orphans.  That much is true and that much cannot be denied.  There is no camouflage in that.  There is hard cash there provided by this Government, provided by the country if you wish, and I can say that it would be a long time before the Government which Deputy Minch supported would provide anything like the sum that we are providing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is now doing the very thing that he deprecated in Deputy Minch's speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, Deputy Minch is getting what he was looking for.  The Government which Deputy Minch supported was asked over and over again to provide money for this purpose, and did the people ever get any from them?  The Deputy when he talks of camouflage should address that language to his own colleagues.  After the speech that he made, he should, if he were honest, divide the House, or get his Party to divide the House, on this stage of the Bill.  That would be the way to deal with a Bill which, according to him, is a dishonest Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2274" /> I do not claim, and if I were to do so it would be foolish on my part, that this Bill meets all the requirements of the situation.  I think that if we were to do that, to do even what was outlined by Deputy Norton &mdash;he did not make the 100 per cent. claim that he might have made: he made a reasonable case&mdash;and were to make the provision that should be made for everybody who is a widow or an orphan, not merely necessitous widows and orphans, then I think the House could not provide the sum of money that would be required.  It could not dream of doing so in present circumstances.  So far as I can see, we are a long way from being able to provide the sum of money that would be necessary to meet not alone all the cases, but even a very considerable proportion of the cases, that might be regarded as on the border line of being necessitous.  That is our position.  I wish it were not so.  It would be a very happy thing for me, or for any Minister in my position introducing a Bill of this kind, to be able to offer to the House something much greater and much more generous towards meeting the full needs of the situation. I would be very happy indeed if I were in the position of being able to come to the House with a generous measure of that kind.  At any rate it can be claimed for this Bill that it is a big step in the right direction.  Despite all that Deputy Minch said, we are here now discussing a practical measure to provide the money for pension for a very big percentage of the necessitous widows and orphans in the country. So far as that is concerned there is no camouflage, no dishonesty and no hoodwinking of the people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton, in his speech on the Bill, commented on the fact that it ought to have been introduced a year ago.  I would say that from some points of view it ought to have been introduced many years ago.  It was promised a year ago and it is not the fault of the Minister for Finance and it is not my fault&mdash;of course, we are responsible&mdash;that it <Col N="2275" /> was not introduced earlier.  Deputies have commented on the intricacies and difficulties of the measure.  I may say that it has been a really difficult measure to draft, first of all to get the basis to go on, and then to get the official drafting of it done. That took much longer than we anticipated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>He had not as much to do with it as I had.  I quite agree that this Bill does not cover all widows.  It was not meant to.  It does not cover the 134,000 that Deputy Norton referred to.  This is a Bill to provide pensions for necessitous widows, and among the 134,000 mentioned in the report and referred to by Deputy Norton, there are widows who are over 70 years of age.  They are already getting the old age pension. There are also widows who would not take a pension, no matter how much it was, if you offered it to them.  What their number is I do not know, but they must represent a considerable number, taking the total of widows in the Free State.  If I knew some of them, I might be able to introduce them to some of the bachelors of my own Party and other Parties. There must be a fair number of them about.  I know that there are a few around Dublin.  Mention was made by Deputy Norton of childless widows. If childless widows under 60 are to be entitled to pensions, one could, in the same way, argue that spinsters of certain ages would be equally entitled to pensions.  In fact, some of the spinsters might be more entitled to pensions than the childless widows.  It is very difficult to know where to draw the line.  We might not have any line if we had enough money but, when we have not, we have to cut our cloth according to our measure.  Deputy Norton properly emphasised&mdash;I do not object to his doing so&mdash;the inadequacy of the pensions in general.  He laid special emphasis on the non-contributory pensions.  He quoted instances to <Col N="2276" /> show that the pensions would not be sufficient to maintain the widow and her dependants.  I know of no scheme of social insurance of this kind in which an attempt is made to provide the beneficiaries with such a standard of living as they might have been used to when the breadwinner was alive.  I know of no such social scheme of insurance in any country.  I do not say a word against that if we could afford to do it, but no country, rich or poor, that I have heard of offers such an example.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton, Deputy Murphy and Deputy Brennan asked why this was made a contributory scheme.  The Department and I gave earnest consideration to the recommendations set out in the Report.  I and, later, the Executive Council, in considering the matter, had particularly in mind two ideas.  One was that I would rather see people getting something for which they had paid, or partly paid, and which they could demand as a right. We were anxious to get away from what Deputy Murphy described as the &ldquo;stigma&rdquo; of home help&mdash;to give it its more polite name.  There is a certain stigma attaching to that.  If the people feel that they are in a contributory insurance scheme, as this is, and that they have paid a certain amount, no hat-in-hand business will be necessary. They will have paid something for what they are getting and they can go to the Post Office and demand the pension as of right.  That was one matter that carried great weight with me.  It is merely a development of that argument to say that the old pauperising idea is not the kind of philosophy that I should like to see established and continued in this State.  In looking over the Report, I found statements that helped me in coming to the conclusion to which I came.  On page 11 of the Report, paragraph 12, I find the following statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>For the reasons set out in Appendix C., we consider that, on general grounds, the principle of contributory insurance is to be preferred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the statement of the majority of this Committee.  Having weighed all the evidence, they did unquestionably, <Col N="2277" /> in the end, come down on the side of the non-contributory scheme. The Minority Report is against that but the majority did come down on the side of the non-contributory scheme. Giving full weight to all the recommendations and considering what would be for the benefit of the nation as a whole and even for the recipients, I thought&mdash;the Executive Council were entirely with me&mdash;that a contributory scheme would be best for this State. We found it impossible to make the scheme completely contributory but we went as near to that principle as we possibly could.  I find the following statement on page 91 of the Report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The principle of compulsory, contributory insurance, applied either on a national scale or to large sections of the population, has been accepted by the majority of European States and by several countries outside Europe.  They include Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, Cuba, CzechoSlovakia, Ecuador, France, Germany, Great Britain</P>
    <P>and about 15 or 16 others.  That shows that these nations, great and small, believed that, for their States, a contributory scheme was best.  The last paragraph of Appendix C. states:</P>
    <P>It may not be out of place here to refer to the implication of schemes where the burden of social protection is borne by the general resources of the whole community. In looking to the State alone for protection against all the contingencies of life, the tendency is to weaken personal and family responsibility and to strengthen correspondingly the conception of the overriding authority and responsibility of an abstract State.  It is necessary to state that, in this country at any rate, such a tendency is not in accord with the type of social philosophy predominantly held.</P>
    <P>With that view, I am in complete agreement.  I think that it would be best for the people in general and best for the beneficiaries under this scheme that they should have the feeling that they have paid something for what they are getting, that they are getting <Col N="2278" /> it as a right and that they are not being pauperised by the pensions, as they claim, in many cases, that they are pauperised when they have to accept outdoor relief.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton raised a point about the power we are taking to refund certain moneys to the Department of Local Government and the Department of Industry and Commerce in connection with the unemployment assistance scheme and public assistance. The Deputy is probably aware that local authorities have complained frequently to me and to other Ministers&mdash;and the complaints have been voiced in this House&mdash;that where claims to unemployment assistance were delayed, and where months sometimes elapsed, these authorities continued to pay home assistance or unemployment assistance.  They felt sore later on when what they regarded as large sums of money&mdash;although I have no proof, I heard in some cases it was as high as £30 or £40&mdash;were received as back pay by the claimants.</P>

      <P>Probably, I heard that, whether it is exaggeration or not.  Local authorities feel sore, when, say, £20 was paid to individuals, at having had to continue to pay home help for a certain time out of the funds of the boards of health.  When large sums were received they stated the money was not spent very wisely, and that it would have been better if the amount had been refunded to local authorities or spent on some other deserving cases.  That statement was made to me more than once.</P>

      <P>All cases brought to our notice would be examined, and in justice, as far as we could we would refund the money to local authorities. Deputy Norton made a case for uniformity in all pensions paid.  That would be an excellent thing from some points of view, and would save a good deal of trouble in administration. While the amount paid out might be uniform, it would not be justice to give the same amount to a widow living in Dublin, having to pay in rent anything from 5/- to 10/- a week for a room, and a widow in a labourer's cottage in the country, where the State and local authorities continue to pay a considerable amount of the rent, which would be anything from 9d. to 2/6 a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Are you not doing that on the contributory side?  Will not the widow of a carpenter, on the contributory side, living in a labourer's cottage in the country get the same rate as the widow of a carpenter in Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>But they have paid for it.  When they contributed nothing one has to consider the matter from a different angle.  There would be uniformity, as far as the office and administration is concerned, but there would not be uniform benefit, because a person living in a small town, or a rural area, would be deriving much greater benefit than a person who had, fortunately or unfortunately, to live in Dublin or Cork, and pay the cost of living as we know it as well as the high rents that have to be paid in these places.  Deputy Norton raised a point about the provision of funds for expanding the benefits of all classes of pensions, and probably emphasised the non-contributory pensions, by the provision of paper credits.  I do not think that would find any sympathy with the <Col N="2280" /> Executive Council, even if I were so hardy as to suggest it.  There is this much against it.  Whereas Deputy Norton can suggest that such a principle was adopted when national health insurance was inaugurated; under national health insurance no non-contributory people were insured as will be the case under this Bill.  Under national health insurance everyone likely to benefit was regarded as an insured person from the first week they were insured.  That is the underlying principle in any insurance scheme.  To provide paper credit for people who would never be able to bring anything to the credit of the fund is, I think, a principle that even Deputy Norton would not insist upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All who spoke agreed that this Bill will have to be amended and improved.  I wonder if there was ever a Bill brought to this Parliament that had not to be amended some time.  That is the fate of every Bill.  No piece of legislation is going to remain the same for all time, least of all social legislation of an ephemeral kind.  On all sides demands will be made that this piece of social legislation, as well as other social legislation on the Statute Book, be amended at some time.  There will be a constant demand from all parties.  Of course a lot will depend on which side of the House Deputies are on.  Demands will come at any rate from the Labour Party and from the Opposition of the day for an improvement in social services, and for an increase in the amount awarded as pensions under this or any other scheme that is likely to follow.  That is to be expected.  I expect no sooner will this Bill be passed than there will be resolutions to that effect.  I hope they will not be as strongly worded as Deputy Minch's speech.  Denunciatory resolutions will surely be passed telling of the blemishes in this Bill and of a variety of ways in which it has failed to come up to expectations.  Such demands will spread from the fact that the Bill has been brought into operation.  When people realise the benefits that widows' and orphans' pensions will bring we will have <Col N="2281" /> demands from organisations for an improvement and an increase of the benefits in the future.  They will then have realised what benefits are being derived under the Bill and will be very anxious to see them increased.</P>
    <P>Deputy Nally asked when the Bill will become law.  I expect there will be a long Committee Stage.  I do not know when the Committee Stage will be taken, but if the House is willing perhaps it could be taken in a fortnight. I have been anxious to get the Second Reading through for the last three weeks, but I have not had a great deal of success owing to pressure of other business.  I am anxious to get the Bill through as rapidly as possible.  For administrative reasons I am very anxious about it, because there is a big amount of work to be done connected with the initiation of the scheme, as well as an enormous amount of organisation necessary to bring the machinery into operation.  I will press it forward with all possible speed, and I ask the House to help me.  The sooner we can get the Bill into operation the better I will be pleased.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Eireann hereby approves of Control of Imports (Quota No. 11) Order, 1934, made on the 21st day of December, 1934, by the Executive Council under the Control of Imports Act, 1934 (No. 12 of 1934).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this Order the importation of coal, culm, shale and slack into Saorstát Eireann was prohibited except under licence.  The object of the Order was to enable effect to be given to the informal arrangement entered into with the British Government, concerning coal and cattle, of which Deputies are aware.  The quota appointed under the Order for the first quota period effects no reduction in the imports of <Col N="2282" /> coal, but the Order appointing the quota prescribed that out of a total of 1,100,000 tons of coal for the first period, that is from the 1st of February, 1935, to the 31st July, 1935, 1,099,000 tons should be shown, to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners, to have been purchased in, and consigned from, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  There is a difference between this Order and others approved of, or covered by other resolutions on the Order Paper, in so far as this is not designed to effect a reduction in imports, but to insure that the informal arrangement with Great Britain should be carried out and that the coal imported will be only consigned from that country.</P>
    <P>The other Quota Orders are designed to effect reduction of imports for the purpose of stimulating the production of the goods involved at home.  On that account the fixation of the quota was designed to ensure that there would be no limitation upon the quantity brought in having regard to the quantities imported in previous years. It will continue to operate in that manner.</P>
    <P>The principal effect of the Order was to transfer to Great Britain orders for coal that had previously been going to continental countries, principally Germany and Poland. The agreement under which this is done is of one year's duration.  It is not possible to say how long the Order will remain in operation, but certainly until the end of this year.  Whether it will be continued in the following year will depend upon circumstances then existing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>One would expect a much more important statement from the Minister in putting this Quota Order before us.  The arrangement under which the Order comes is certainly a very important one.  It has been very elaborately described as an important one by many Ministers and their followers.  The arrangement under which the Order is made puts a very big tax upon the people of this country for their coal.  We will have <Col N="2283" /> another opportunity of discussing that with the Minister and it will give the House an opportunity of expressing its opinion upon that tax.  But the fact is that in the full year the operation of this Order will impose a tax of £600,000 or more on the people of this country as a customs duty in respect of their coal.  The arrangement out of which the Order comes has been described by Deputy Geoghegan, speaking in Mullingar on the 14th January, in these terms: &ldquo;The new understanding between Britain and the Free State is a milestone in their national life.  In its own small way it has placed the country's trade on a basis of equality with Great Britain.&rdquo; It was further referred to in a leading article of the <i>Irish Press</i> on the 7th January last.  It first referred to the other Orders generally and then remarked: &ldquo;Any trade agreement we make with these States must bring the balance nearer to equality, the ideal, of course, being absolute equality as in the cattle against coal pact,&rdquo; and again in a leading article the <i>Irish Press</i> stated: &ldquo;The agreement is a trade agreement similar to those recently made between other nations.  It is in line with the new direction international trade has taken since the policy of developing native resources became general throughout Europe.  This new form of trade is practically one of barter by which the surplus of one nation's products is exchanged for the surplus of another's to make up a home deficiency in the imported commodity.&rdquo;  So that the general stress which was made by commentators of the Government in what was involved showed that a very considerable amount of importance was attached to it.  I do not know why the Minister described this as an informal agreement.  If it were so made, we would like to hear a more elaborate statement of the matter from the trade aspect than the Minister gave the House on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question arises whether this was a war arrangement or a peace arrangement.  The question of coal was first tackled by the Government as a war matter.  Five shillings penal tariff was put on British coal coming <Col N="2284" /> into this country.  Substantial volumes of coal were bought from Germany and Poland and there was no tax upon that coal.  Suddenly this informal agreement changed the whole position and gives a monopoly of the coal supplies of this country to Great Britain.  We would like to hear from the Minister whether the war aspect has completely gone off and if it is a trade agreement, whether we are going to be exempt from the £600,000 tax which this agreement, such as it is, imposes upon the people in respect of their coal. It has been figured out that this arrangement puts an additional burden upon the country as a whole of £876,000, as additional tariff to be levied by Britain on the increase of 150,000 head of cattle going into Britain.  It has been figured out also that it imposes another burden upon the taxpayer here to the extent of £140,000 in respect of bounties.</P>
    <P>If you take all of these figures and add them together, you find that £1,600,000 has to be paid by someone in this country to keep the coal-cattle agreement in operation.  This is represented as putting the trading of the two countries on an equal footing!  The Minister's figures for the trade of this country generally for 1933-34 disclose that whereas we imported from Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1933 and 1934 goods value £50,032,000 they only took from us goods value £17,939,000.  In our trade with Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the year 1933 we were down £7,092,000 and for the year 1934 we were down £8,970,000.  It should strike the House as a rather remarkable thing that we entered into a trade pact with a country which gave us, no doubt, the advantage of relieving the farmers of 150,000 cattle that were eating them out of their homes, and which they could not otherwise capitalise&mdash;that we should give them a chance of selling them even at the bankrupt prices at which they are selling them at the present time&mdash;and that for that advantage we incurred an expenditure of £1,600,000 on our side.  On the British side, we <Col N="2285" /> are enabling them to put about 5,000 additional miners into employment and we give them a very substantial volume of trade involving no cost of any kind to the people of Great Britain.  These superficial facts should drive the Minister or some member of the Government to make a more elaborate statement on this agreement than the Minister has given us here.</P>
    <P>Since the agreement was entered into quite a number of other points have arisen.  It has been pointed out in various articles in both the local and the daily Press that apart altogether from the 5/- per ton tariff that is imposed on all coal now coming into the country, the price of coal has been raised pretty substantially for the consumer here.  The <i>Irish Times</i> reported on the 28th of February that &ldquo;Householders and others who use coal are aware from experience that the price of the commodity has advanced considerably during the past two weeks.&rdquo;  That is since the quota came into operation. The report goes on: &ldquo;It appears that, quality for quality, British coal is 6/- per ton dearer at the port of Dublin than Continental coal, and as there is also a Customs duty of 5/- per ton on British coal, the price works out at 11/- per ton more than the Continental product.&rdquo;  That aspect of the matter has been drawn to the Minister's notice by some Deputies in this House.  The question then arises for discussion by the Minister as to what exactly is the position and what precautions he took in entering into the agreement to see that, assuming that he was levying 5/- per ton on coal, there was going to be no addition to this increase in cost because of the cutting-off of Continental supplies and the giving of a monopoly to the British coal suppliers.</P>
    <P>We remember that when the coal taxes were imposed as part of the economic war against Britain, a number of Deputies of the Minister's Party were very vocal in pointing out how much superior German and Polish coal was to the coal that was obtainable from Great Britain.  No doubt <Col N="2286" /> there are people who will controvert that but, nevertheless, the fact remains that when the matter of the coal supplies was under discussion at a meeting of the Cork Harbour Commissioners in January, 1934, it was stated by a supporter of the Government that &ldquo;this Order was made to strengthen the morale of the Irish people when the British Government sought to beat them into submission.&rdquo; He was referring to the Order which put a penal tax on British coal.  He went on to quote figures of the board's engineer to show that in purchasing Westphalian coal as against English, they effected a saving of £189 in one cargo, £208 in another and £167 in another.  He quoted figures from the same source to show that it took 43 cwts. of English coal to accomplish what could be accomplished by 38 cwts. in one case and 31 in another of German coal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry supported the amendment that they should not depart from the arrangement they had come to to buy no British coal, and he said that &ldquo;the British coal was absolutely wiped out regarding price by German coal, which burned better, was cleaner and better in every way.  He thought there should be prohibition of British imports &mdash;the sooner the better in view of the figures in regard to the relative value of these coals.&rdquo;  So, members of the Fianna Fáil Party, unless they have changed their minds on the subject, consider that the people are getting an inferior class of coal now, and that they are being forced by the Minister's policy to get that because they can get nothing else.  They are going to pay a higher price for it, and to pay a tax of 5/- per ton in addition.  The position that we are in, as far as explaining the agreement is concerned, is that we have no more information about it than we had in the very beginning.  The whole policy of the Ministry with regard to it is so contradictory as to warrant a very substantial statement on the whole matter of the agreement and the way in which it affects this country.  The Minister will probably remember that when this Order was first issued one of the Dublin daily newspapers wrote:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2287" />&ldquo;On Christmas Eve the Free State Executive Council gave notice of a new &lsquo;offensive&rsquo; in the economic war&mdash;for we must assume that its latest action is designed primarily as a blow against Great Britain.  It issued an Order, under the Control of Imports Act, prohibiting imports of coal, culm, shale and slack from to-day until the 1st February next.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Surely when the Minister's policy on Christmas Eve was such as to draw a statement of that kind from that Dublin newspaper, which has some concern for its reputation in commenting on public matters, the Minister must understand the position in which the country as a whole is placed.  It is degrading to the position of the Government and its prestige that it should now come into the House for the purpose of implementing, to some extent, that agreement, without any explanation, good, bad or indifferent, as to the reasons that brought them to make this agreement, and the effect which this agreement is going to have on the country.  The House is entitled to an explanation.</P>
    <P>In the matter of price, too, I think there is a point to which the Minister should direct his attention.  If the Minister takes his own trade statistics as to the amount of coal brought in in February and March&mdash;the only months for which we have any information from him as yet&mdash;he will see that the prices of coal tend to rise.  There is rather an interesting point on the other side that, if you take the British figures for imports of coal into this country and the value per ton of these imports, the coal they are sending here, according to the British figures, has fallen in value per month per ton.  It would bear out the complaint that is being made by some of the people that have made complaints in the matter that an inferior class of coal is coming in here. It would be interesting to know how his statisticians place the price on the coal which they pay at the port if a different tendency is shown by the figures quoted with regard to prices and the figures quoted in the British returns.  However, the Minister will surely not tell the House that it need <Col N="2288" /> not know any more about this agreement than what he has told them here to-night.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want merely to make a few remarks about this quota order.  I shall not go into any detail because I think we shall have another opportunity of discussing other, and, possibly, more objectionable, aspects of the general policy of the Government in this respect.  There will be an opportunity afforded us, I hope, of discussing the extraordinary attitude of the Government on the whole question of the tax they still levy on the coal, and, therefore, I do not intend, as I said, to go into that particular aspect of the matter now, except in one sentence to state this, that in order to carry on a war against Great Britain, we put a tax on coal which our own people paid, and in order to bring about better relations with Great Britain&mdash;partly to cement a kind of peace with Great Britain&mdash;we keep on the tax on coal which our own people pay.  Therefore, whether we were waging unrelenting war on Great Britain or making peace or friendly bargains, of a formal or informal kind, with Great Britain, the main thing was that our people had to be taxed.  That is the one matter on which there has been a general line of consistency on the part of the Government, but, as I say, that particular aspect of the matter does not arise on this particular quota order, and, therefore, I shall not now discuss it.  There will be ample opportunity, I trust, for discussing that particular corollary, shall I so call it, of the coal policy in general of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can understand a certain defence being put up for this coal-cattle pact, although it has certain very strange aspects, especially when we consider the fact that we are supposed to be at war with Great Britain&mdash;only an economic war, but still a &ldquo;war&rdquo;&mdash;in that one of the most immediate results of this pact would be that Great Britain got more out of this country than she otherwise would have got.  That must seem strange to the ordinary individual in this country, but apparently the <Col N="2289" /> Government and the Government supporters find no difficulty in swallowing that particular aspect of the Government's policy.  A war on, waged with all the resources at our at our disposal, against what Ministers are so often anxious to tell us is the only enemy and one of the acts in that particular campaign when we complain that England is by <i>force majeure</i> getting from us these land annuities which we say we will not pay&mdash;we say to England &ldquo;You are collecting them by force; you are relying on your superior strength and your superior position; you are taking it&mdash;&rdquo; I forget the exact words of the President&mdash;as a bandit would take it.  Yet one of our acts is to say &ldquo;As you are not taking enough, here are three-quarters of a million pounds more.  We need not fight over the mere figures.&rdquo;  That is the peculiar aspect of the matter, but I can understand a defence being put up for this pact.  I will admit, and I always have admitted, that it did give at the time it came a considerable relief to the farming community in this country. It undoubtedly enabled the farming community to export 150,000 more cattle than they otherwise would have been able to export.  In the actual state in which the farmers found themselves, the actual state to which Government policy had brought them, that was a considerable relief.  There is no doubt about that.  It was a considerable relief even though it cost us &mdash;I do not mention the taxation&mdash;in the way of increased tariffs going into England, possibly something like £750,000.</P>
    <P>Even though there was that amount of additional money, so to speak, taken out of what the President represents as a very unwilling payer, it was still a relief to the farmers.  But what does that show?  Does it not show clearly the extraordinary straits to which the whole policy of the Government has brought the farming community? The mere fact that this coal-cattle pact, which, as I say, not merely imposed a burden of taxation in the coal we burn, but has also let us in for the payment of more tariffs on the cattle we send to England&mdash;I mean a greater aggregate <Col N="2290" /> amount&mdash;is looked upon as a relief and a substantial relief, is most illuminating.  Can you have any better commentary on the whole policy of the Government than that, which seems to me to be the only defence that can be put up&mdash;and it is a substantial defence&mdash;for this particular agreement?  Would the Government and the followers of the Government not learn the only lesson that can be learned from that?  In the course of their two years carrying on this economic war, which their followers told us was to make John Bull tighten his belt&mdash;&ldquo;he was starving for want of our cattle&rdquo;&mdash;they brought the farmers of this country to such a pass that it was a gift to the farmers of this country to have £750,000 extra levied off them so long as they could export 150,000 more cattle.</P>
    <P>That is the position into which the policy of the Government deliberately pursued over two years has brought the country.  Therefore, it is not so much the coal-cattle pact in itself that is objectionable.  It is the matter, which we can discuss afterwards, of the tax on coal, put on as a war measure and maintained apparently as a means of preserving peace.  But it is the other fact that is particularly to be condemned, namely, that Government policy has made this fact necessary.  I think that the idea which the Government had in mind in going to negotiate with Great Britain was a perfectly sound idea.  The general idea was quite correct.  Why was it?  Because whatever the President and the various Ministers may have pretended about the increased prosperity of this country, the country had reached such an intolerable position as a result of their policy that any kind of bargain &mdash;even this bargain&mdash;would be hailed with relief by the people on whom they had inflicted so much suffering.  The idea of negotiating was quite correct. If, under the quotas prevailing in different countries, Great Britain said: &ldquo;Take more of my coal and I will take more of your cattle,&rdquo; that in itself, isolated&mdash;if it could be isolated&mdash;from the general situation, would be at least a sane step on the part of the Government. Unfortunately, as I say, there <Col N="2291" /> are certain consequences of this whole traffic in coal which will have to be discussed in certain of their more disagreeable aspects afterwards.</P>
    <P>The Minister might enlighten us as to the effect which this pact has had upon the spirit with which the economic war is being waged by the Government. What effect has it had even on the price of coal?  Even though a bargain about quotas may, in the abstract, be a good bargain, or in any case be a good thing to contemplate, we should at least know what it is costing.  We should know what it is costing even so far as the price of coal is concerned. I am not taking too seriously the statements of the various Ministers or their followers, or their very useful mouthpiece, Deputy Corry, when they first determined to wage war against England by taxing our own people.  I am not taking those too seriously, but I think the House ought to know what the additional cost amounts to.  How has the cost of coal been affected, firstly by the tax and, secondly, by the fact that there is now a monopoly, and that except under an occasional licence only one type of coal is allowed into the country?  Those are matters on which information might be given. The other facets of the question we shall have ample opportunity of discussing afterwards.  I shall not, therefore, go into them now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to get from any Minister the reason of this coal-cattle pact.  On the face of it, it is a surrender in connection with the economic war.  Why did the Government here tax British coal in the first instance, and why did it develop a continental coal trade?  The people were told it was in order to hit back at Britain.  The Government tried to gull the people of this country into believing that because Britain put a tariff of 20 per cent., 30 per cent., 40 per cent. and upwards on our goods going into Britain, by putting a tariff on British coal coming in here we were doing to Britain precisely what Britain was doing to us; that even though a tariff of 5/- per ton had been put on here and we paid it, the British public <Col N="2292" /> were equally paying the tariff on our cattle going in there.  Of course, there was nothing further from the truth than that.  I will not go into a detailed explanation of the matter.  It has often been explained both here and outside, so often that the bluff of the Government has been called, and they do not now attempt to gull the public with statements that the British are paying the penal tariffs imposed by Britain.  It is enough to say in that regard that those tariffs are not imposed upon our goods until our goods are sold in the open market, in free competition with other goods in the British market, and on that market price the British duty is levied.</P>
      <P>The British coal coming in here is sold at the market price, and Britain gets its cheque at that selling price. The Irish exporter of cattle does not get his cheque at the market price for those cattle in, say, Birkenhead.  From that price is deducted the British tariff. But the tariff which we impose here on British coal is imposed on top of the price that the British get on selling their coal here.  A coal trade was developed with the continent, and the people here had become accustomed to using continental coal.  Prior to this coal-cattle pact it was the gospel of patriotism here to burn continental coal.  Without any explanation from the Government, and by forcing all the Government spokesmen to swallow overnight all they had said for a year before, it became the gospel of the highest patriotism to burn British coal. In fact, patriotism did not enter into it; you had to buy it whether you liked it or not, and pay an extra 5/- per ton for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the beginning I had no illusions about this coal-cattle pact.  If ever this country was sold by public or private, open or secret agreement, it was sold by this pact, so much so that we are told now it is only a kind of gentlemen's agreement.  Nobody signed it.  I suppose there is nobody in the Government who would have the brazen check to say that he had signed it.  He would be ashamed of his signature if he did.  Let us follow what it means.  We all know that the price of coal immediately went up by 5/- per <Col N="2293" /> ton.  That was the impost.  In addition to that, the British put up the price of their coal, so that the cost of coal here now is 10/- or 11/- per ton higher than it was before the coal-cattle pact.  In addition to that the coal is inferior. The Minister, I presume, will be speaking last on this.  I hope he will come down to reason, and that his bluffing will not last eternally.  The House has become accustomed to the bluffing of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. He thinks that by shouting and rapping the desk before him he will get away with it.  He has got away with it for a good while, but now we are coming a bit up against realities.  I am speaking from what I know, and I challenge the Minister to contradict it. I do not want any academic figures to contradict it.  I challenge him to come with me to the coal merchants of Dublin and deny that coal is not now 10/- and 11/- a ton dearer than before the coal-cattle pact, and that the British are sending inferior coal here.</P>
    <P>I have been endeavouring to get the figures of this coal-cattle pact.  I saw certain figures in an evening paper months ago, but I am yet in ignorance of the exact figures.  Let us take the figures that have been mentioned.  They indicate that £1,000,000 worth of coal extra would be admitted under this pact, and for that we would get 150,000 extra cattle exported.  I am sorry the Minister for Agriculture is not here. Let us reduce to money value 150,000 head of cattle.  Let us ask anybody who has ever held a bucket to a suck calf how you are going to produce 150,000 cattle and dump them into England for £1,000,000.  To people who do not understand, we are only taking £1,000,000 worth of coal, but we will get sale for another 150,000 cattle.  But at what price?  Divide 150,000 into £1,000,000 and you find you will not have £7 a head.  I wonder did they know what they were doing when they were signing the pact?  Of course, the resistance was breaking.  What was the situation when it became incumbent on the Government to sign this pact?  Little straws show how the wind blows, and how are the straws blowing on this occasion?</P>
    <P>There were bounties given for the <Col N="2294" /> export of cattle and they were fixed with a certain ratio to the penal tariffs. At the beginning of this year it was found that the farmers had been getting rid of their young stock and the old stock remained on their hands.  If the Minister for Industry and Commerce does not know that, I challenge him to bring in any Minister who has any pretensions to a knowledge of the live-stock situation at that period, and I challenge anybody on the Government Benches who pretends to have any knowledge of the live-stock situation to contradict, with any show of evidence, the statements I am making. It would not be necessary even to support my arguments with anything beyond what the Government themselves did.  These old store cattle, up to three years, could be bought for £7 or £8 if anyone was foolish enough to buy them.  The trouble was there was no market for them.  The quota had to be increased, and this is the price we had to pay for the increase.  To show it was those particular cattle that were the crux of the situation at that time, the export bounties for any other cattle except cattle over two years were withdrawn.  Something like 30/- a head was placed on the export of the older cattle.  In the desperate situation in which the Government found themselves, they had to sign something, and this is what they signed.</P>
    <P>I would be very glad to hear the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in calm, calculating language, defending this coal-cattle pact.  I admit it was a terrible situation that had arisen. Take that situation, isolate it from its surroundings, and what produced it? We had an over-population of old store cattle and we wanted to get rid of them.  A bankrupt wants to get rid of his stock; the sheriff wants to sell the cattle he has seized.  Anything you have on hands that is a finished product of your industry and that you are not going to do any more with, is a dead loss, and you must get rid of it at any price.  This coal-cattle pact was merely a sale of bankrupt live stock for which, in the conditions then obtaining, there was no market.  No wonder we heard even the Minister for Industry and Commerce say here last <Col N="2295" /> week that their whole trouble was the cattle trouble.  This is the puny attempt they made to face the cattle trouble.</P>
    <P>On top of that the men who found themselves, through no fault of their own, with these cattle on their hands and who could not cash them, were called conspirators; they were torpedoing the Government, sabotaging the Government.  That was the language used against them because they could not find money on the roads to pay bills, and the value of their cattle was reduced by the policy of the Government. I would not blame the Government for carrying out that policy if they were able to get any loophole of escape, but here last week they threw up their hands and said: &ldquo;We have not yet been able to solve the cattle problem.&rdquo; The Minister for Defence is solving the cattle problem by what he did in the Belfast market last week&mdash;or at least by what his agents did.  We had the Minister for Agriculture solving a special phase of it by his levy on butter.  He excluded the Kerry cattle area from having to contribute the levy on butter.</P>

      <P>Well, a horny path, and it is a very horny path in South Kerry &mdash;the long-horned Kerry cattle.  The Minister does not see any relation between the exclusion of a certain district from paying the butter levy, he does not see any relation between the situation that must have weighed with the Government to grant that exclusion, and the position of the farmers in that area which was crowded out with a large population of old Kerry cattle that they could not sell, and that were not worth the relative tariff that the British would impose if they were <Col N="2296" /> exported&mdash;they would not bear the £6 a head.  That is a thorny or a horny question for the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Cattle have nothing to do with the coal-cattle pact?  The Minister threw them away and he provided an exclusive market here for Great Britain and then waved the tri-colour&mdash;another blow at John Bull.  It would be interesting to know what prompted that.  I quite admit that the Quota Orders were more severe on the cattle situation here than the tariffs, because while you had only tariffs operating you had a market for all kinds of cattle, all grades and conditions of cattle at some price.  But when your market was restricted, and the situation was such that you could only export the quota, then you were roughly in this position, that you had five cattle and you could only sell three. You got the cumulative effect of that surplus up to the signing of this pact. It was to relieve this pressure that this pact, which was only an S.O.S., was agreed to or signed.  I do not know which.  It was not signed or agreed to, we are told, and one cannot get any definite information as to how it became effective only that it did become effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real pressure here was from the aged cattle, two years old and upwards. That is where the pressure was.  The relief came there on that pressure when this pact was agreed to.  I have heard Ministers and Government Deputies making use of the figures and boasting that 150,000 cattle extra can be exported under this pact.  Knowing something about the cattle position then, and the pressure from the aged cattle that we had in this country that could not be sold at all, it is clear that the Government's anxiety was to get rid of the older class by withdrawing the bounties from the younger cattle. The bounty on the two-year old cattle and over given by the Government showed that it was to relieve the pressure, to get rid of the surplus stock, <Col N="2297" /> especially the aged cattle, were the compelling forces in getting this coal cattle pact signed.  I do not blame the Government for signing it, being up as they were against that situation.  But if these 150,000 cattle were to be got away for £1,000,000 the Government tacitly was preparing to sell 150,000 cattle of two years old and upwards for £1,000,000, that is, less than £7 apiece, or less than I often got for sucking calves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>What were the conditions? Can we import coal <i>ad lib</i> and send out cattle <i>ad lib</i> of a corresponding money value?  Those figures were used, and surely if there is a gentlemanly agreement or an ungentlemanly agreement, or any sort of an agreement made, there must be some terms in that agreement.  Certainly we have not got these terms.  There is no authoritative source so that I could not turn round and say &ldquo;This is official.&rdquo; I would be glad if the Government. would give the House and through the House the country the exact terms of this agreement.  I am told now by the Minister that 150,000 cattle was not the understanding and that 1,000,000 tons of coal was not the understanding. What was the understanding? There is one thing certain that the real pressure was the number of our cattle on hands.  Under the conditions obtaining these could not be got rid of, so that there was a number of cattle which this pact enabled to be exported against a certain sum of money that would represent the value of the coal.  I should say for certain that these cattle were 99 per cent. old cattle, every one of them carrying a <Col N="2298" /> tariff of £6 a head.  Every one of the beasts sent over carried £6 a head.  I would like the Minister, in addition to giving us the amount of coal we were to buy under the quota to give the number of cattle we were to export.  What was the money value of the coal that we got and was there a quantity understanding of coal?  Was there a quantity understanding in the way of cattle?  Was there any quality understanding or did Britain get a free hand to dump in on the mugs any sort of coal here that she liked, such as she is dumping in at the present time?  I think if the Minister will just explain the terms of the pact and the causes which promoted the Government to make that pact or to agree to it he will be giving information that the country has not yet got.</P>
      <P>Some people have said here, while being opposed to the pact, that it was a step in the right direction.  No, a bad bargain is never a step in the right direction.  It would make the country nervous if the Government sits down to settle bigger problems and says to the people &ldquo;Now you keep quiet, trust to us and we will see you through,&rdquo; after the shameful way in which the Government have acquitted themselves in this comparatively minor agreement of the coal-cattle pact.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is minor in comparison with the big issues at stake.  If it is a major or a semi-major agreement then the Government have nothing to boast of in agreeing to it.  When we had developed a continental trade what were the reasons for abandoning it?  Were they monetary reasons? Were they exchange reasons?  What were they?  We were getting a good article from Germany where we were told that a market lay for our butter and livestock and the German buyers were in the market in Dublin every week.  A good deal of easy money was made by those who were hanging around the German buyers in the market and public money was being spent to develop the trade.  Is it a fact that actually this coal-cattle pact was signed while the Minister was in <Col N="2299" /> consultation with the German Ministers over here about developing a coal trade with Germany?  The people had become accustomed to using German coal and were prepared to go on with it as they were getting it cheaper than British coal, quality for quality.  The coal which the people were buying then was better than the coal they are now getting, and they were saving 10/- or 11/- per ton.</P>
      <P>What were the reasons that prompted the Government to abandon buying that good quality coal at 10/- or 11/- per ton below what they are paying for coal now?  Was it anxiety to balance the Budget?  Was it that, no matter what it cost the consumer of coal, the Minister for Finance wanted to get 5/- per ton out of British coal coming in?  Was the whole pact only camouflaged to bring more money into the Exchequer and to balance the Budget?  The country should know what prompted this agreement and what were the considerations.  I frankly see only one, which I have already mentioned, and that was the surplus of old cattle.  It was necessary to get rid of them even at bankrupt prices.  The prices we have got for these cattle were bankrupt prices.</P>

      <P>How can the Deputy say that they are anything else?  Is the Deputy unaware of the cattle situation as I have depicted it here?  The young cattle were, relatively, fetching a higher price here in the fairs than the older cattle, and people, in desperate straits for money, with sheriffs' notices being sent out for the annuities, special squads being organised by the Government, special police being sent to buy the cattle as well as special supporters of the Government, with a line of communication into the North through Donegal and Dundalk to get the cattle into the Belfast market, as the Cork cattle were sent last week, sold anything they had to get money.  They sold their young stock and were left with their old stock.  The Government <Col N="2300" /> were confronted with that situation, so that by the end of this year a whole generation, or two generations, of cattle would be wiped out and you would have nothing but very young and very old cattle.  That was the situation that was developing.  The Government woke up at the eleventh hour and this desperate pact was signed.</P>

Are we to accept this as the prelude to the type of bargain and conditions generally for which the Government are continuing to fight the economic war?  When it comes to a deal, can we not expect to have anything better than this?  The Minister should tell us how he will be able to injure John Bull <Col N="2301" /> in the fight now.  If there was any vulnerable point it was through the coal supply.  The British Government were more or less perturbed over the trouble in the South Wales coal-field. Welsh M.P.s were perturbed about their constituents and brought pressure to bear on the British Government to come to terms with this country.  It seems to me that our Government gave way on the only vulnerable point in Great Britain's armour.  Where are we going to hit John Bull now?</P>

How is the Minister going to hit him in the pocket now with 5,000 or 6,000 miners put back into work and a guaranteed market for coal at John Bull's own price?  That represents about £1,000,000, while we will send over our cattle at whatever price Great Britain likes to pay for them, so long as it is covered by that amount of money.  We are helping Great Britain to fix a low price for our cattle.  Fianna Fáil Deputies have gone round the country telling the farmers that they have got a market for another 150,000 cattle.  Great Britain can buy our old cattle at £6 or £7 per head, and we can wrap the green flag round us.</P>

      <P>I should like to get back to the question of the coal.  I should like the Minister to give us a little more information, when he is concluding, as to the background of this pact.  Will the Minister tell us what exactly induced the Government to make the pact?  Was it altogether for the purpose of getting rid, even at any price, of the 150,000 cattle?  Can the Minister tell us whether the conferences which were going on at the time between those interested in the coal trade in Germany, Poland, and Great Britain had anything to do with forcing us into agreeing with such a one-sided pact as this?  Something must have happened unexpectedly.  The Government, at the end of December, made a <Col N="2302" /> certain Order.  The Government, as Deputy Belton has pointed out, were actually negotiating with German representatives regarding a trade pact, particularly regarding a coal pact between this country and Germany.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the newspapers of the day, including &ldquo;Truth in the News&rdquo; must be misinformed, because they all had, as one of the principal items to be discussed with the Minister and the German representatives, the question of coal.  That was the biggest item between this country and Germany at the time, as I think the Minister will admit.  In any case, however, did the Government only realise between December, 1934, and somewhere in January, 1935, the necessity of getting rid of the cattle at any price, and were they forced, because of that, into concluding this coal-cattle pact?  I am not satisfied that their sole reason, or even the main reason, for concluding the pact, was the question of cattle.  I believe that the conferences going on at the time between the Polish, German and English representatives, had a good deal to do with it.  The Minister may smile.</P>

      <P>Of course, I accept the Minister's word for it, but the country does not know whether it had or not.  This pact has been described as a coal-cattle pact.  The President himself, on the morning it was made public, described it as an understanding. I think Mr. Thomas had a different word for it.  The Minister himself described it as an informal arrangement. When the Minister so describes it, was it merely an arrangement made sitting around a table, with nothing committed to writing and nothing definite about it?  Were the dates chosen haphazardly, or were they set down? Were the numbers and the value of the cattle and the value of the coal decided on haphazardly, or were they set down, signed and sealed?  It certainly meant this to this country&mdash;I am leaving inside altogether its effect on the cattle trade since Deputy Belton has dealt with that question very fully&mdash;that, so far as the coal consumers here were concerned, the immediate effect was that they were paying from 10/- to 12/- a ton more for household coal than they had been paying prior to that pact.  I do not know about the coal prices in the City of Dublin but, generally speaking, I know that in the provincial towns of this country the price paid for coal to-day&mdash;I am including, of course, the 5/- tax by our own Government&mdash;is at least 10/- a ton more that it was prior to the pact.  I am prepared to say also, from my own personal knowledge &mdash;and this view is supported by many people in the coal trade&mdash;that the coal sent from Britain since February is inferior.  I am referring now to the general supply of household coal.  I am not thinking of high-class coal such as Best Orrel, but of the ordinary household coal, and it is very much inferior to the Silesian or Polish coal that was coming in here prior to the pact.  That is the position, and the Minister cannot get away from it.  I admit that there has been some little improvement in <Col N="2304" /> the last month or so in the coal coming in here, but for the first three months it was absolute rubbish.</P>

      <P>I never described the Polish coal as rubbish, nor did I ever go to the other extreme, like Deputy Corry, and say that one ton of Polish coal would give him as much as a ton and a half of British coal, which is all bunk.  We know that.  In any case, the price is definitely higher.  I am putting it at 10/-, including the tax, and the quality is not as good as that of the Polish and Silesian coal that was coming in prior to the pact.  Another and rather important matter is that, as a result of this pact, and as a result of quotas which operate on certain mines in England, there is a very definite danger of a great scarcity of coal in this country.  I do not know whether that has been brought to the Minister's notice before now, but it is the fact, and if it were not for the stocks of continental coal, when this pact came into operation, we would be very short of coal in this country at present.  I should like the Minister to bear that in mind when he is fixing the new Quota Order which, I understand, is to be fixed on the 31st July.  Certainly, the whole coal trade has been upset and put into a position of uncertainty. They find it difficult to get coal of a good quality at a reasonable price and they are very uncertain as to future supplies of British coal.  I think myself that the Government have nothing at all to be proud of so far as this pact is concerned.  I have no hesitation in saying that if that pact had been concluded by any other Party in the House we would hear all about it from members of the Government Party.  It is a very one-sided pact and a pact from which all the advantages flow to Great Britain, both from the cattle and the coal side.  It seems to me that the only person who is getting anything out of it on this side of the <Col N="2305" /> water is the Minister for Finance, and, in order to get that advantage, he has taxed the consumers of coal to the tune of 5/- a ton, which, as Deputy Mulcahy pointed out, has given him between £600,000 and £700,000 a year. When the Minister is concluding, I should like him to inform the House, first, what induced him to enter into the pact and, secondly, whether he has been informed of the present position regarding stocks, and what steps he proposes to take with regard to the new Quota Order at the end of July.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather surprised at the obsequious manner of members of this supposedly democratic and sovereign assembly in dealing with the insolent and rather contemptuous Hitlerism of the Government in expecting us now to ratify a pact the terms of which we and the country do not know.  I presume that this is the first and the last time that this House will have the opportunity of expressing approval or disapproval of this coal-cattle pact.  We are, in fact, in this position, that we are expected to give ratification, so far as it can be given, without knowing the terms. It is a curious form of ratification, particularly as it ratifies an agreement the terms of which are unknown.  One Party, some years ago, were very particularly about the correct diplomatic form which ratification should take with reference to another allegedly secret agreement.  I am referring to the agreement of 1923.  Although that agreement was read out to the House, and although the terms of the agreement were embodied in Section 12 of the Land Act of that year, still it was dubbed a secret agreement.  Whatever may be the case with regard to the form and ratification of that agreement, there can be no doubt that this is a secret agreement, an agreement which is being entered into behind the backs of the Dáil and of the Irish people: an agreement which the Dáil is asked to ratify without even knowing its terms.  Deputy Belton was absolutely right when he pointed to the fact that there are no two Ministers who can give the same account of what the actual agreement is, and <Col N="2306" /> apparently this free, sovereign and elected assembly is expected to lie down humbly under such an exhibition of democracy.  This agreement, so far as we have heard from the rumours of what it contains, appears to be a very bad and unfavourable one from the point of view of this country.  We are throwing away the only valuable asset we had, from a bargaining point of view, with the British Government. Not only that, but in doing so we are in fact making permanent what is known fictitiously as a state of economic war, because once that asset is gone there is no reason whatever why the British should wish that the present situation should come to an end.</P>
      <P>Judging from Press reports and the various contradictory statements of Ministers, we have agreed apparently under this pact, which we are now asked to ratify, to give the British Government or, rather, as the President would prefer to say to let them take, £1,000,000 more in land annuities than Deputy Cosgrave agreed they should take 12 years ago under the alleged secret agreement of 1923.  We have agreed that they should get £1,000,000 more than they agreed to and finally accepted at the time that Mr. Baldwin agreed to pay the sum of £30,000,000 a year to America.  That, remember, was at a time when the Irish farmers were making three and four times as much as they are making to-day, when they were not being asked to pay their annuities twice. We must remember, also, that at that time we had not got 100 per cent. of an adverse trade balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one good thing that this so-called agreement has done and it is this: it has shown up the fake and the farce of the alleged economic war.  I have always maintained that there never was such a thing as an economic war between his Majesty the King's Governments in Dublin and in London. They have always been as thick as thieves.  In all this elaborately staged-managed, artificial, political play-acting which they call an economic war, they have been both engaged in robbing the Irish farmer.  There has been no more of an economic war <Col N="2307" /> between the Governments in Dublin and in London than you can say there is an economic war between two pigs feeding with their snouts in a trough. Sooner or later that trough will go dry.  When it does, I do not know what agreement they will come to.</P>

      <P>There is undoubtedly an economic war between the combined forces of his Majesty's Ministers in London and in Dublin and the poor unfortunate people of this State. Recently, in England I noticed that, with the exception of the King, there is no more popular man in England than the President of the Executive Council of this State.  Everywhere I went in London I found that everybody was very fond of him.  I found that he was extremely popular in the House of Commons.  I found Parliamentarians from overseas all sounding his praises.  Certainly, the farmers of England sound his praises because he has done something for them which they could never have done for themselves, and as a result of this pact the miners on the other side are also sounding his praises.  When you, find such general chorus of approval for the head of this Government in England, I wonder would it not be wise if we added his personality to this country's list of exports to that country, because then possibly we might have the chance of getting other people who might not be so easily fooled by the people on the other side of the Channel.</P>

      <P>The House is dealing with this question of the coal-cattle pact.  It would seem that in prosecuting this economic war we are to have pacts, more pacts, and still more pacts.  It reminds one of the cry that was heard during the Great War: men, more men, and still more men. When these pacts are made they are presented to this House, and Deputies are appealed to or asked or coerced to ratify and sanction them.  It seems to me that the permanent officials of the Government are now becoming a <Col N="2308" /> sort of international chamber of commerce rather than mere officials in their departments, whether they be engaged in the Department of Industry and Commerce or of External Affairs.  These pacts deal with trade matters, but when they are being made the people engaged in trade are not consulted as to the form they should take.  The result is that traders, whether they be exporters or importers, know nothing about them until they open their morning newspapers or get a message over the wireless as to the new arrangements that have been entered into by our Government. I submit that sort of thing is going to kill private enterprise and initiative, and eventually must bring about here a totalitarian State&mdash;a State in which officialdom will rule, in which individualism will be completely sunk, and in which trade enterprise will be surrounded with all kinds of legislative forms, Government arrangements, Government sanctions, Government control and interference.</P>

      <P>Pacts of this kind are now becoming quite common.  They average nearly two a month.  One is prompted to ask, who is in control? Is it the people who are affected by these pacts or those who make them? It is quite obvious, I think, that it is the people who make them.  They are based on theory and are worked out by the theorists who are now in complete control.  The result is that the impacts and the repercussions that follow from them are not foreseen at the time they are made.  One consequence of that is that either new legislation or new pacts are required to rectify the weaknesses that show themselves later.  The outcome of all that is confusion, more confusion, and still more confusion.  I am satisfied that there is a certain amount of sincere endeavour in all this to remedy the lopsidedness that has arisen in our economic position.  I am sure that those making them do the best they can for the country, considering what the present economic position is.  At the same time, I think that <Col N="2309" /> importers and exporters should be consulted before these pacts are made. They should not be left completely out in the cold as they are at present.  At the present time we have representatives in certain foreign countries, and those countries have representatives <Col N="2310" /> here.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware (a) that Patrick Merrick, Ayle, Oola, County Tipperary, made an application for unemployment assistance in March, 1934; that he was informed eight months later that his claim had been disallowed; that he appealed against this decision, and has not been informed to date whether his appeal has been decided, and (b) if he will take such action as is necessary to expedite a decision in this case.</P>
