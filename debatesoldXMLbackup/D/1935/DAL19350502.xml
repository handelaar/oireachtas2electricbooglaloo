    <Speaker pid="PeadarSeanDoyle" hpid="Mr. P.S. Doyle (for Mr. Eamonn O'Neill) Mr. P.S. Doyle (for Mr. Eamonn O'Neill)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle (for Mr. Eamonn O'Neill)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the President if he has seen the statement made recently by the Chancellor of the British Exchequer to the effect that up to the time of the introduction of the British Budget the British Treasury had recovered in penal tariffs from the Irish Free State £700,000 over and above the actual amount of the moneys withheld by the Irish Free State; if this sum has been so collected; and, if so, if he will cease to pursue the policy of collecting further sums in the form of annuities, levies and seizures from farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the statement which the Deputy has in mind is that made by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer on the 15th April, namely, that he had received &ldquo;a surplus of nearly £700,000 from the duties on articles coming from the Irish Free State.&rdquo;  If so, the Deputy has misunderstood the statement. Read in its context, it clearly refers to a surplus, not over the sums claimed by the British Government under the secret agreements and withheld by the Saorstát, but over the estimate of the yield of the duties which Mr. Chamberlain had made at the beginning of the financial year.</P>
      <P>I may add for the Deputy's information that the sums withheld amounted in 1934-35 to approximately £4,900,000. The yield of the British duties on Saorstát goods, as stated in a British Treasury return, was £4,692,000.</P>

    <P>The total amount of compensation paid to employees of former approved societies whose services were discontinued <Col N="165" /> is £122,119 12s. 5d., up to the 27th April, 1935.  The Society informs me that it will take some time to segregate the payments made to employees whose services were dispensed with subsequent to their employment by the Unified Society. When I receive the figures I will send them to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The present staff of Cumann an Arachais Náisiúnta ar Shláinte is 626, of whom 604 are permanent and 22 temporary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  I do not propose to introduce legislation for the amendment of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts on the lines suggested by the Cork County Council, as I am not satisfied that the security proposed would be a sufficient safeguard to the ratepayers.  As to the general position, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Deputy T.J. Murphy on the 20th March last.</P>

    <P>There are no complete records available as regards the number of persons who received injections for the purpose of immunisation against the disease and who contracted the disease subsequently. The number of cases in which persons who received the complete immunisation treatment contracted the disease after the expiration of the period (nine months) necessary to confer immunity from the disease is very small, as may be gathered from the following notes on the subject in recent reports of county medical officers of health:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In Cork County up to December, 1933, 10,397 children were immunised and only eight of these were subsequently notified as having contracted the disease, and no deaths occurred.</P>
    <P>In Louth County out of 2,000 children immunised since 1928, only one case of the disease occurred after immunisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish (for Tadhg O Murchadha)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that in the Cobh urban district there is an abnormal shortage of working-class houses; that the medical officer has reported that a number of houses in the area are unfit for human habitation; that the local urban council have had under consideration for a considerable time plans for developing building sites and the erection of new houses, but have failed to proceed with the work, and that there is a desire on the part of the workers in the district that the Department would take steps to expedite the local building schemes, and whether he is in a position to state what action he proposes taking in the event of the local authority failing to discharge its obligation to the citizens.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.</P>
      <P>Reports of the medical officers of health indicate that there are very few inhabited houses in the Cobh urban district which are unfit for human habitation but that, owing to the overcrowded conditions under which many inhabitants of the town reside, necessity exists for the provision of a considerable number of new houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The council recently completed a scheme for the provision of 30 houses and are negotiating for the purchase of a site for the erection of a further 100 houses.  Owing to difficulties of title, negotiations for the acquisition of this site are somewhat protracted, but I have no reason to understand that the council are unduly delaying <Col N="168" /> its acquisition.  Should it appear to me that the council are failing to show the necessary diligence and energy in providing houses, the matter will receive my serious consideration.</P>

      <P>I have given this matter consideration, not only in connection with the public utterances to which the Deputy refers, but on several other occasions.  I am advised that there would be serious difficulties in framing effective legislation on this subject, and in enforcing such legislation without undue hardship both to the persons employed in the cinema business and to the public.  I doubt also whether there is any general acceptance of the view that parents in this country are neglecting their duty as regards the control of their children of school-going age to such an extent as to make State interference essential in a matter of this kind.</P>

Moreover, the figures so extracted for the years 1933 and 1934 would not be complete owing to the length of time which elapses between the registration of a company and the filing of its first annual return.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>In moving this amendment, I have in mind what I consider to be the more efficient working of the scheme at a lesser cost.  I am not particular about the numbers on the Board and I was more or less influenced by the difficulties confronting the Minister. In addition to having the curers represented, he has divided the curers into three classes, and he has the problem of having those classes fairly equitably represented.  If the Minister would adopt this amendment and have a <Col N="179" /> lesser number than 12 on this Pigs and Bacon Marketing Board, I would prefer it, but it is because I know that he is faced with the difficulty of giving fairly equitable representation to the different interests in the bacon curing industry that I leave the number at that figure.</P>
      <P>As I said last night, this Bill has for its foundation the report of the Pig Industries Tribunal.  The Pig Industries Tribunal recommended the scheme on which this is built, and it was the bacon curers who put that scheme to the Pig Industries Tribunal. It is scarcely altered.  It was more or less what arose in the British market that produced the necessity for organisation of this kind.  Holland has an organisation with one Board, and I do not agree with the summary way in which the Pig Industries Tribunal dismissed the case of Holland as not being analogous to the situation here. They have one Board known as the Netherlands Pig Central and that is representative of the interests concerned, the bacon curers and the pig producers.  If the Minister carries out the intention of this Bill and has two Boards, it is going to be a lot more expensive than if we have the one Board.  I cannot see the necessity for two Boards.  There are some things that bacon curers, for example, would do better than a combination of bacon curers and pig producers, and there are also things that pig producers could do better than combined pig producers and bacon curers, and for that reason I have amendments here governing that situation.  The bacon curing members of the Pigs and Bacon Marketing Board will look after the curers' interests inasmuch as they are purely curers' interests, for example, allocating amongst themselves how much of the bacon cured within a production period should go during that period to the various curers and arranging for the curers then to take charge of the selling of that bacon. As the curers will be the marketers, it is purely a curers' function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are similar matters on the pig producing side that will best be <Col N="180" /> looked after by pig producers only. The Minister knows that the pig producers who gave evidence before the Tribunal put up a scheme somewhat on the lines of this amendment.  He knows that anywhere that pig producers have been articulate since the introduction of this measure they have been opposed to the one-sided nature of the measure.  They all say that it is a bacon curers' Bill.  In no measure that has been introduced in this House have I seen any Minister acting with greater fairness than the Minister for Agriculture has acted in the present instance.  I am thoroughly satisfied that his one anxiety is to get a measure that will deal with this problem with as near an approach to fair play for all parties as is possible.  I am satisfied the Minister has pursued that course and I think that represents his real feeling in the matter.</P>
    <P>We are, under this measure, setting up a monopoly of bacon curers.  In controlling that monopoly we must be careful that the monopolists, the bacon curers, will not have too much power. The power that the Minister gives the bacon curers in the Bacon Marketing Board, and which I am endeavouring to take from them by this amendment, leaving it to be dealt with by a composite board of bacon curers and pig producers, is the making of a production period and the making of a production order for bacon.  These matters govern the price of pigs.  The Minister gives, and I agree properly gives, in the Bacon Marketing Board a voice to bacon curers in fixing the price of pigs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Pig Marketing Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in the Pig Marketing Board he gives the bacon curers a voice in the fixing of the price of pigs. I agree he should, because if pig producers had the sole right of fixing it they would probably strangle the trade, injure it without intentionally trying to injure it, because they would perhaps fall into a lot of pitfalls. Bacon curers who know the technique of curing and the difficulties of selling <Col N="181" /> bacon on the home and foreign markets would see the difficulties, but the pig producers would not.  The Minister recognises that in fixing the price of pigs that is the key to the industry, and he allows equal voices in that matter.  I hold the fixing of a production order for a period which lays down the amount of bacon that can be produced in that period also lays down, without saying so, the number of pigs that can be bought during that period.  The Minister may say the Bill provides for a price for pigs.  The Minister now has experience of price fixing in other domains.  What good is fixing a price for pigs if there is not sufficient bacon cured within that period of pig production to absorb all those pigs?  In other words, what good is a fixed price if you cannot get any price?</P>
      <P>The experience of Holland and Denmark is there before the Minister. They have only one tribunal to do the work, and they have a bigger job to do than we have.  In Britain where the Pigs Marketing Board and the Bacon Marketing Board were set up, they were set up in slightly different circumstances from those existing here, but not very much different.  One thing the British authorities did was to have, on the one hand, a purely 100 per cent. Bacon Curing Board, and, on the other, a 100 per cent.  Pig Producers' Board, and then they allocated the work for each.  In this Bill the Minister has not provided for that.  I do not think there is need for it.  I think that a composite Board, fifty-fifty, will meet the case, a Board such as I have outlined in this amendment.  The Bacon and Pigs Committees will respectively look after the bacon and pig producing end, and all matters that are common to both interests will be looked after by the Board and not by the Committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another thing about which the Minister makes no secret.  I think he approaches this subject with a certain amount of nervousness.  I do not blame him, because it is a big jump in the dark and he has to bear the responsibility for it.  If it is a success he will get very few bouquets, but if it is a failure God only knows the bricks he will get.  He should take up every <Col N="182" /> idea that is suggested to him and examine it with an open mind.  One thing he must have or the whole scheme will be foredoomed to failure, that is, the confidence of the producers &mdash;the confidence that there is something in this Bill that will give them hope for their industry in the future.</P>
    <P>I submit that this Bill has not drawn from any producer one word of confidence. The curers have expressed confidence in it.  Of course, they have, because they have got 100 per cent. of their recommendations.  The recommendations are these in the Pig Industries Tribunal, and I do not think there was a comma altered when that was transferred into the Bill.  There are also a few big producers of pigs, and their recommendations, too, are turned down.  I am not saying that either of them are perfect, but I am going to say that this scheme lacks confidence, and the Minister would be well advised to pay a big price for the confidence of the producers and form a Board that will control all the material things in this organisation he is setting up, a Board in which he will divide the responsibility and authority between the curers and the pig producers. Within that framework let the bacon curers and the pig producers look after their separate ends.</P>
    <P>In Holland the bacon factories were scrapped as profit-making institutions. They were simply given the pigs to cure at a price by the Netherlands Pig Central.  The proposal here in this is to give the bacon curers the pigs to cure and to market at the best price they can but they will be controlled by the Board as to the price they must pay and that, of course, controls the other end of it.  Section 120 is the only alternative to ours.  Amendment No. 22 changes the Bacon Marketing Board from a Bacon Marketing Board to a Pigs and Bacon Marketing Board, and that is really the central amendment around which all the others ramble. Any functions that were originally intended by the Bill to be carried through by the Bacon Marketing Board I have left as functions of the Board. I have just changed the name of the Board.  The pig producers have no right to interfere with the functions of <Col N="183" /> the Bacon Marketing section.  I changed them to be looked after by the Bacon Committee.  When I came to the section dealing with the Bacon Marketing Board I did the same thing there.  In the matter of the operations that were originally intended to be dealt with by the Pigs Marketing Board, and which were purely matters for the pig producers.  I changed the name from the Pigs Marketing Board to the Pigs Committee.  Where matters concerned the bacon curers as well as the pig producers I allowed them to remain as being functions of the Board.  I do not think there is any need now to take up the time of the House any longer.  The Minister and the Deputies have fully grasped all the ideas behind these amendments, and they are fortified with this&mdash;that in Holland and in Denmark they have been substantially tried out.  In Britain where the Bacon Marketing Board and the Pigs Marketing Board were set up, the Bacon Marketing Board was exclusively dealing with the bacon curing and the Pigs Marketing Board exclusively dealing with pig production. The Minister does not follow the example of Denmark and Holland or the example of Great Britain.  In Northern Ireland the first Board that was set up was the Pigs and Bacon Marketing Board.  The provisional Boards expired on the 31st March and after that they are to be elected of 14 members each.  The Pigs Marketing Board is to consist of 11 representatives of the pig producers and three nominated by the Minister.  I think they must be producers, too, only they are the Minister's nominees.  I cannot see where the Minister has got the headline in regard to this machinery that he copied in this Bill.  He has two headlines set&mdash;one by Denmark and Holland and another by Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  He has copied neither, but he has set up the machinery which gives the curer control of the industry.  In that he is forfeiting the confidence of the producers. I submit that if the demand of the producers were not a just one&mdash;and I hold it is a just one&mdash;even if it were an <Col N="184" /> extravagant demand it should be granted.  If the pig producers would not have confidence in the scheme without getting that granted, I would say it would not be too big a price to grant it.  But in this case, when they have justice on their side and they are determined on their demands, and when there is danger of having the whole scheme foredoomed to failure if the demand is not granted, the case is much different.  I appeal to the Minister to consider again the central principle of these amendments.  The details do not matter, but I ask him to consider the principle before he turns down the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just one or two questions I want to ask the Deputy before he sits down.  This group of amendments has really two vital principles enshrined in them.  One is the division of the Bacon and Pigs Board into committees.  The other is that the Production Order should be transferred from the Bacon Marketing Board to the Pig Committee of the Joint Board&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will agree with me that the Joint Board is in effect very much the same as the Pigs Board at present, because it is a Board consisting of curers and producers, subject to the decision of the Chairman.  There is a good deal in common between the Pigs Board in the Bill and the Joint Board which the Deputy propounds.  If the Minister consented to transfer the Production Quota Order to the Pigs Board under the Bill would not that remove a good deal of the Deputy's objection to the present structure of the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="185" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, I thought of that in framing the amendment. It nearly comes to the same thing in principle.  I quite agree with that.  Will the Deputy consider this&mdash; that it is very important to have one body, and I strongly hold that where one body can cover a job it will always be done better than if you set up two equal bodies.  The Minister has set up two Boards&mdash;the Bacon Marketing Board and the Pigs Marketing Board. They are both of equal standing.  Would it not be better to have a Pigs and Bacon Marketing Board with one chairman and one secretary?  Would not the whole business of this scheme be carried out better by having one chairman and one secretary?  If there is too much work for one chairman and one secretary, have assistants, but have one chairman and one secretary responsible for the whole lot.  As a second line of defence or offence I would like to see the powers of the Pigs Marketing Board increased, but I submit that the other would be more effective, more centralised, more useful and more likely to gain general confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister on this series of amendments if there is any use, seriously speaking, addressing him on the proposal to get the fixing of the production quota order transferred to the Pigs Board under the Bill.  There is really a good case to be made for that and I think Deputy Belton would co-operate with me in jettisoning the Joint Board if we could get the production quota order transferred to the Pigs Board.  That would be an improvement.  The Pigs Board is so constituted that it is to consist half of curers and half of producers.  If there is disagreement between them, the person chosen as chairman of the Board will decide.  So that you will have a situation in which both sides are able to make a full case and, after the preliminary period of violent conflict between the two elements of the Board has passed away, I believe you will find that the curers and the producers will, in seven out of ten cases, agree on what is an appropriate production quota order.  In the <Col N="186" /> remaining three cases out of every ten, where there is a conflict, the chairman will weigh the matter as between the representations made between the two sides and decide.</P>
      <P>At first when this matter came under my notice I attached prime importance to the fixed price for pigs.  I still attach fundamental importance to the fixed price for pigs, but there is this snag in it&mdash;that the fixed price for pigs is payable only to the individual who delivers the pigs into the factory.  Any farmer can do that; but in practice what is going to happen is that the jobbers will deliver the pigs into the factory and they will be paid the fixed price, less the statutory allowances provided for here.  The jobber will go to the fair.  It is quite true to say that every farmer in the fair will know what the jobber is going to get for the pigs when he brings them to the factory.  Let us suppose that the fixed price in any given week is 62/-.  The farmer knows the jobber is going to get 62/- for the pigs and he is able to demand from the jobber a price which will be commensurate with the fixed price of 62/-.  But this dilemma immediately arises: if the pigs production quota order has been fixed too low, the jobber will only want 100 pigs while there will be 200 pigs in the fair, with the result that there will be 200 farmers, let us say, each one with one pig clamouring for the jobber to take his pig and to leave his neighbour's pig on his hands.  It is quite true that each one of these farmers will be entitled to demand a fixed price; but what will happen in fact is that one man will pull the jobber's sleeve and say, &ldquo;Take mine for 2/- less,&rdquo; because he will prefer to do that rather than have a fat pig on his hands for another month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be that no matter what precautions we may take that may happen from time to time; but we cannot close our eyes to the fact that if the production quota order, which may give rise to that state of affairs, is fixed by a Board consisting of curers only, that aspect of the case will not be as clearly present to their <Col N="187" /> minds as if the order were fixed by a Board consisting of producers and curers where both sides of the case will be stated.  My submission is, and I think Deputy Belton's is, that it is eminently desirable when you are going to fix this production quota order that both sides, the producer and the curer, would have an opportunity of being heard and of exchanging views.  That is our case and I think it is a very strong case. It is a case made, not with a view to creating difficulties for the Minister, but with a view to making the Bill work, because it is the common interest of all of us to make the Bill work.</P>
    <P>The Minister's objection is that this is a matter which obviously comes exclusively within the domain of curers&mdash;how much bacon they are, in fact, going to turn out&mdash;and that in deciding it they have to consider world markets, home demands and cold storage capacity.  In fact, his suggestion has been throughout that the only things they have to consider are things of which curers have a peculiarly exclusive knowledge.  Furthermore, he will submit that, in view of the exclusive interest of the curers in it, nobody else should have a say.  Surely he cannot rebut our case that the producer has a very great interest in this question?  Surely he cannot deny that the method which we propose does not by any means result in the curers being forced to do the impossible?  On the contrary, there is an absolute safeguard in the constitution of the Pigs Board, because it is provided in the Bill that if there is any disagreement amongst the members of the Pigs Board&mdash;unless there is a unanimous decision of the members&mdash;the chairman must decide the question, and his decision will be deemed to be a unanimous decision of the Board. So that there is no danger whatever of the curers being handed over to the producers and having an impossible Production Order made.</P>
    <P>There is an absolute guarantee that, if there is an apparent conflict of interests, the decision will be thrown into the hands of an impartial observer <Col N="188" /> who, taking every legitimate interest into consideration, will decide what is best for the industry as a whole.  I submit to the Minister that when he finds all sides who are interested in this Bill, except himself, agreed that it would be better to transfer this function to the Pigs Marketing Board, he ought to think well before he turns down the suggestion we make.  Deputy Belton demonstrated his willingness to waive the Joint Board if he could secure this important concession.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a clear indication that we are all desirous of co-operating with the Minister.

      <P>Unless the Minister can see his way to make this trivial change great anxiety, and probably misunderstanding, will arise.  For the reasons which I outlined, in connection with what may actually happen at fairs between farmers and jobbers, I submit that we have a really meritorious case for the transfer of this function to the Pigs Board, and that there is no solid ground for apprehending any evil by the transfer that we suggest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that neither Deputy Dillon nor Deputy Belton have shown in what way the Bacon Marketing Board would be likely to fix a production order for a period that would be unfair to the producers. They developed their case along the lines that it would be well that the two interests should be represented; that there should be discussion as to what the production order should be, and, in the event of failure, to agree that the matter should be fixed by the chairman.  Deputy Dillon should know a great deal about this sort of business, but he has not shown us what would <Col N="189" /> induce the Bacon Board, if the matter as proposed was left to them, to make a production order which would be unfair to producers.  When the Deputy talked of what was likely to happen at fairs, in a case where a man offered pigs at a price lower than that fixed, it seems to me he is anticipating a production of pigs far in excess of the demand, and far in excess of present production.  The Deputy seems to anticipate that as a result of this measure and the fixing of prices the population of pigs will soon increase, and that the production order will, of necessity, be so much below pig production that there will be a surplus for a certain length.  I think that is a wrong assumption.  The Bill does not propose to provide an economic price all the time, and is supposed to be a check on over-production. That is a point well worth discussing.  I listened carefully to the discussion, especially to Deputy Dillon, because I understand he is interested in this business.  He should be able to tell us what would induce him, if he was on the Bacon Marketing Board, as a man interested in bacon curing, to make a production order lower than facts put before him would entitle him to make.</P>

      <P>This point has to be admitted by Deputies, that the potentialities of the production order affect prices.  The making of the order directly affects the price of pigs, and, therefore, is of vital interest to the producers. They should be present when that production order is made.  I am not going to say that the bacon curers would avail of it, but we are here to make this as perfect as is humanly possible.  I might ask Deputy Smith: &ldquo;What have the bacon curers to fear from pig producers fixing the price of pigs?&rdquo;  Are they all angels on one side and are they all thieves on the other side?  We are doing this business and we should try to make it proof against <Col N="190" /> any rigging of the market.

      <P>I am afraid this particular transfer would cut at the fundamentals of this Bill.  When Deputy Belton speaks of Denmark and Holland, and even of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, I might point out that the whole conception of legislation in these countries is regulation of the production of pigs.  We are not doing that at all.  We are trying to avoid that, because we thought it would be better, if possible, to give farmers freedom to produce pigs as they did in the past.  I am afraid if this amendment were to be conceded it would inevitably lead to the control of pig production.</P>

      <P>Surely when the pig population increases you cannot get out of control?  It is because we are not producing so many pigs in relation to our requirements that they have not to be controlled, as is the case in Denmark and Holland.  It is because of a shortage of pigs.</P>

      <P>Deputy Belton has given the House a wrong impression by saying that the Pig Industries Tribunal have considered this matter, and accepted the plan put before them by the curers, as if such a plan was opposed by producers.  If Deputies will look at the report they will see on page 89 that the pig producers put their point of view before the Tribunal. First of all they recommended a pig industries council which would consist of five feeders, three curers, an exporter, a live pig exporter, and a representative of the Department, making a membership of eleven.  That particular body was to discharge certain <Col N="191" /> function of a very general nature. For instance, they were to consider the number of pigs that should be bred, the suitability of pigs for factories, the best type of pigs, and whether we should have pig testing or not.  It was decided, when drafting this Bill, that these matters could be looked after to a great extent by the Department of Agriculture.  They were to consider also the question of export bounties. They recommended further, that a price fixing committee should be set up from this pig industries council, consisting of three curers and three breeders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes&mdash;at page 89.  It is recommended that this price fixing committee should consist of three curers and three breeders, with a neutral chairman, which is exactly what we have put into this Bill.  That is we have adopted what the pig producers who gave evidence before the Pig Industries Tribunal recommended, and it is wrong for Deputy Belton to give the impression that the pig producers have found fault with this Bill from that point of view.  That particular organisation I remember at the time had tried to get pig producers from practically every county in Ireland on a convention to prepare this evidence.  The pig producers were as well represented as they could be at the time, and they recommended a pigs board to fix prices, such as we have put into this Bill, consisting of three curers, three breeders, and a neutral chairman.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want the Dáil or the country to be under the impression that the recommendation of the pig producers was ignored.  The pig producers were not ignored.  Their recommendation was accepted.  Deputy Belton on the Committee Stage and again here is anxious to have a board with two sub-committees, or three boards or three committees or whatever way you like to put it.  It does not matter whether you call it a board or a committee.  It would be quite easy <Col N="192" /> for me to bring in an amendment calling one a committee and another a board, and in that way we might meet Deputy Bourke's point; he says one board is enough.  Deputy Belton wants a board and two committees.  The point is what should their function be. If we were to follow the Dutchmen, which Deputy Belton appears to be in favour of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dutchmen appointed a committee which controlled the export business in bacon.  It was composed of two curers and four producers, and it controlled the export business.  It bought pigs for export, handed those pigs over to the existing curers in the country, and ordered those curers to convert the pigs into bacon at a certain rate per head on a commission basis.  The curer had no interest in making profits or anything else, because he was paid a certain rate per head, and then this body exported the bacon.  They did more than that; they also looked after the production of pigs.  The Minister for Agriculture, in consultation with them, gave a certain allocation of pigs for the year. That was divided between the provinces. The provinces divided the number they got into districts.  Then in the district a number of farmers were set up as a committee, and those farmers divided those pigs amongst the farmers of the district.  If we were proceeding on that line of cutting down pig production there is no doubt the Board should be composed entirely of farmers.  I would not have agreed, for instance, to putting two curers on such a committee, because I do not see what the curers have to do with cutting down production.  In Denmark they are also cutting down the number of pigs as far as they can.  A district has, say, 200 or 300 pigs, and the farmers form a committee which distributes the pigs amongst them.  It is the business of the farmers alone to distribute those pigs.  If there is a number of pigs available for the factories, and if the factories have to divide those pigs amongst them to be converted into bacon, surely that is a <Col N="193" /> matter for the factories alone and not for anybody else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is labouring under a most astonishing misapprehension about his own Bill.  In Section 145 he makes special provision for a case where curers will not use up all the available pigs, and gives power to the Pigs Marketing Board to go in and make the curer cure pigs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the only way we have&mdash;a temporary way if you like; it <Col N="195" /> cannot operate indefinitely&mdash;of dealing with the factories if they do not take all the pigs.  It is only a temporary provision&mdash;anybody can see that&mdash;because when that is going to be operated up to 20 per cent. or 25 per cent. it must mean the taking over of the factories, but it is hoped at any rate that the factories will work this Act willingly. If they do not, taking them over is the only alternative.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister a question?  Under the revised scheme suggested by Deputy Belton and myself, if the Pigs Marketing Board makes a quota order for 20,000 pigs, and the curers say: &ldquo;We will not cure any more than 19,000,&rdquo; the Minister says: &ldquo;Impasse!  Crisis!  There is no resolution of that crisis except by nationalisation of the pig industry.&rdquo;  My answer is that the Minister himself foresaw the possibility of that situation arising and inserted, very prudently, Section 145, which says that if the curers try to run amok, the Pigs Marketing Board, through its Chairman, can intervene; they can have pigs cured themselves if the curers should attempt to dictate to the producers as Deputy Belton and others were afraid they would.  There is no danger whatever in handing over the production order to the Pigs Marketing Board because you have a guarantee that the Chairman will decide if there is a conflict of interest. Therefore, there will be a fair check if the curers resist.  Section 145 comes in and restrains them until they come to their senses.  Why did the Minister put Section 145 in the Bill except to avoid the necessity for nationalisation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister must see that if the pig producers say that 20,000 pigs must be killed, against 19,000 which the bacon curers say they are only able to handle, and if the latter say they are not able to deal with more, there would arise a question of stalemate, if you had not the chairman to decide.  If even one curer says &ldquo;I disagree, we can handle only 19,000,&rdquo; that transfers the whole authority to the chairman, who will have the power to say how many can be <Col N="196" /> killed.  The Minister talks of a surplus being created.  If a surplus is created, it will be the duty of the bacon curers to see to it that it is handled.  If that is not done, then, it is a matter for the Minister to come to this House and get the necessary legislation to deal with the new situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We ought to get the fundamental issue into our minds when dealing with this question: that Section 145 could not be regarded by anybody seriously as being a section to operate all the time, or to a great extent.  It will operate temporarily and in cases of crisis.  For instance there might be a strike&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They do not think they would want more than 19,000 pigs and they send their three representatives to the Pigs Board and say that they would deal with 19,000.  The producers want 20,000 as the figure, then there is conflict and the Chairman must decide.  He would send a message to the producers on the one side and the curers on the other, and having heard both, he would decide, say, that there must be 20,000. The Bacon Board then say &ldquo;We will not cure 20,000.&rdquo;&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; says the Chairman, &ldquo;cure your 19,000 and then under Section 145 I shall make you cure the other odd 1,000.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps if Deputies would hear me out it would be better.  Deputy Dillon was visualising a surplus when he spoke of persons going to a fair with 200 pigs and only 100 of them required.  He said there was a great possibility that an individual farmer might say to the jobber: &ldquo;I will give you a few shillings if you take my pigs.&rdquo;  That visualises a surplus and leaves out of account the fact that in this particular case the farmer could send his pigs to the factory.  That does not hold in the case of cattle because if a farmer does not sell his cattle he might have to bring them home and keep them there for another month.  He would not have to bring his pigs home for another month but could send them to the factory.  I do not think you will have that difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have stated my very strong objections to this amendment.  Personally, I would be altogether inclined towards Deputy Belton's view&mdash;to give the producers all the power we possibly can give them&mdash;because I am altogether inclined to think that the producer should get every help and all the power that we can give him and that in framing this Bill we should not give the curers any power that we are not compelled to give them.  I am altogether inclined to think in that direction, but there is no use in getting the producers up against the curers and making it impossible for the Bill to work at all. <Col N="199" /> However, I am going to conclude with this statement.  I am prepared to consider this matter further.</P>

      <P>Before this matter is disposed of one way or another, there are some of us who have not had an opportunity of speaking at all on this Bill who might be allowed the opportunity of saying a few words now. Personally, I would have wished that the Minister would have accepted the principle of the amendment in Deputy Belton's name and that at least the powers as regards the production order would be left to a committee equally representative of bacon curers and producers.  Personally, I have no strong views with regard to the principle of having one committee or two committees.  The Minister, in defending the proposals of the Bill, seemed to imply that the bacon curers got no privileges, in any portion of this Bill, that the producers were not getting, and that there was no volume of opinion from producers against the principle of the composition of these committees.  Now, whether it is expressed in the Dáil or not, there certainly is a considerable body of producers very much against particular provisions in this Bill, and, notwithstanding what the Minister said, it seems to be commonly regarded, down in the various counties where they produce pigs, as a curers' Bill.  As a representative of the producers, I have no <Col N="201" /> hostility to the curers.  Some of the largest curing establishments in the country are situated in my constituency and they are admirably conducted by prominent and highly-efficient and honest business men, but I submit that the curers are well able to take care of themselves.  I think it is incumbent on those of us who represent farming constituencies to have some regard for the interests of the producers and, I might add, of the consumers also.</P>
      <P>Now, it matters very little whether one or other of those two original committees under this Bill is scrapped.  As they stand, both of them are practically controlled by the curers.  If we substitute one committee for the two committees, we stand in exactly the same position as we stand under the Bill.  I freely admit the difficulties that the Minister has to face, but I see no hope even of establishing a committee that would give the producers what they really want.  It would be difficult to establish such a committee, I admit, and perhaps what we wish to have done in that respect might rather come from further amendments in this Bill, to which we will come later on, than by any composition of the committee.  As regards the production order itself, however, I think that the Minister might reasonably accept the proposal that that particular arrangement should be left to a committee equally representative of curers and producers.  The Minister expressed the fear that ultimately, if it were accepted, it would cause a cleavage between the producers and the curers and that it would start a war, but the war will be started anyway, whether the Minister likes it or not, if he refuses to accept this. I do not see how it will be possible eventually to stave off any disagreement between producers and curers, if this is not accepted.  I admit that it is difficult to arrange for all these things.  If the producers themselves had the drawing up of the Bill they would find it extremely difficult to produce a Bill that would not be very controversial and that would not lead to much difficulty in its working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="202" /> The Minister also said that, possibly, they would have to interfere in the matter of production later.  If this Bill is going to be a success, the Minister or, if not the Minister, somebody else would have to interfere as regards the limit of production.  It is inevitable. Some control of production is inevitable eventually.  I think that a strong case has been made by Deputy Belton and Deputy Dillon for the concession that, at least as far as the production order is concerned, it should be left to a committee, to be arranged in some way, equally representative of curers and producers.  I do not intend to elaborate on the various amendments here, some of them touching on points a little beyond this.  Probably we will get to some of them later on.  I know that the Minister will give it consideration. That is perfectly certain, but the Minister himself was frankly honest in implying that he believed that the result of his consideration would be that he would not be able to accept the principle of Deputy Belton's amendment, and, accordingly, I think it is up to the House to give some expression of their desire in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make one comment arising out of the speech we have just listened to.  Deputy Bennett described the feeling in the country with regard to this Bill&mdash;that there is a general view in the country that it is a curers' Bill, and so on.  He then went on to state his own view on the matter, and said that there is no doubt that both the Boards are practically controlled by the curers.  That seems to me to throw a curious sidelight on Deputy Bennett's responsibility as a Deputy.  He remarked about the feeling with regard to this very important measure in the country and he implied, to some extent, that it is regrettable that that feeling should be there.  Yet he himself, as a responsible Deputy, makes the astounding statement that both the Boards are practically controlled by the curers.  Is there not as much reason to say, as far as the Pigs Board is concerned, that it is practically controlled by the producers?  How can any responsible Deputy claim that <Col N="203" /> a Board on which you have three curers and three nominated persons, representing the producers, with an independent chairman, is practically controlled by the curers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>But they do not arrange production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's statement of his own view, following his description of the confusion prevailing in the country, was that both these boards were practically controlled by the curers.  It seems to me, with regard to these measures which are going through the Oireachtas, that we have a little more duty to our constituents and to the people of the country as a whole than to be describing them in that reckless way, adding to the confusion of the people.  In my opinion, it is a very wrong thing for a responsible Deputy like Deputy Bennett who, apparently, has read the Bill to make a statement of that kind.  There is no foundation whatever for saying that the Pigs Board is practically a curers' board.  It would be just as reasonable to say that it is practically a producers' board.  It is neither one nor the other. It is equally representative of both interests, and with a really independent chairman it should make an ideal board for its purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say one word in reply to Deputy Moore?  The Deputy says that the Board is equally representative of both interests.  It is in this way: that the curers, through their own highly organised trade, have selected their own representatives.  The producers' representatives on that Board will not be elected in the first instance. Over a certain period the Minister will have the selection of them and, while I am quite satisfied that he will make the best selection it is possible for him to make, at the same time these representatives of the producers will not have the same standing as if they were elected and as they will be eventually by an organised body of producers.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, the question at issue is not the composition of the two Boards but the power that the Bacon Marketing Board will have, and Deputy Moore did not touch on that.  We want that power transferred to a central board or to the Pigs Marketing Board.  I would be glad if the Deputy would apply himself to that question, and then answer for his constituents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">

      <P>I do not think that any case has been made against transferring this power in regard to the bacon quota orders from the Bacon Marketing Board to the Pigs Marketing Board.  I think the House should either agree to that or accept Deputy Belton's amendment and have the Board representative of the pig producers as well as the bacon curers. There has been no real case made against that proposal.  The Minister should have regard to the confidence that the acceptance of the proposal would give to producers.  If there was nothing else in it except the confidence that it would give to producers they are surely entitled to that much.  In any case, where you have an impartial chairman will not the position be somewhat like this: that on the whole Board you will have, so to speak, two sets of lawyers pleading their side of the case, with the chairman deciding?  There is really no case for confining it to the curers' board, Nobody wants to say that the curers have any intention of doing anything that would not be in the interests of fair play, but at the same time the producers are as much entitled to be considered as the curers. If there is any difficulty about arriving at agreement the chairman will be there to decide.  I do not know how many amendments are included in this.</P>

      <P>My objection to it is that in certain counties where the producers produce only a small number of pigs, it would be very difficult to put that into operation and get them all registered.  If the country were divided into as many areas as there are members to be elected, then it would be an easier matter for these areas to decide <Col N="206" /> their own method of election of members. That is the criticism I want to offer on amendment No. 28.  I am entirely in favour of the general principle to give representation to the pig producers, and if Deputy Belton's amendment is not accepted, then I think that the amendment suggested by Deputy Lynch should be adopted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in sympathy with the principle underlying the amendment moved by Deputy Belton. As a result of discussions which I have had with a number of pig producers throughout the country, I think the amendment is a reasonable one.  From the conversations that I have had with these people they seem to think that they ought to have some say in regulating the production of pigs.  I think there ought not to be any lack of confidence, if it were <Col N="207" /> possible, in the Board which is going to perform these functions, but, unfortunately, we are a suspicious-minded people and we have not got that abiding confidence in each other that we might have.  We prefer to do our own job.  I believe that there is so much importance attaching to a spirit of confidence amongst both parties that this measure cannot possibly operate without that co-operation and understanding.</P>
      <P>So far as I can find out from pig producers in my area they are anxious to have a voice, at least, so far as regulating the production quota is concerned.  I completely disagree with Deputy Bennett and I believe that the men to whom I have been speaking would be as competent to take their places and represent the interests of their people as the most highly organised member of the Bacon Marketing Board with the organisation and skill at their command.  I believe that there are some pig producers who, given a voice, will be sufficiently patriotic and intelligent and have that full grasp of the business that will be useful in determining what the quota ought to be for a particular period.  The fact of having a representative, or representatives, there is going to be a message of confidence, whether it is necessary or not&mdash;and I am not so sure that it is necessary&mdash;but from what I have heard from many of those people, they look askance at being left at the mercy of the curers, because they feel they have always been &ldquo;had.&rdquo;  That feeling has crept up through many years of various kinds of marketing and they say: &ldquo;We are getting into the hands of a complete ring.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have done a great deal to disabuse their minds but I do not think I have been very successful, and, for that reason, I suggest to the Minister that if he cannot see his way to accept the amendment in its existing form&mdash;and I am not quite sure that it is in the very best form either, because the dividing of the Board and calling it two committees is not calculated to make a very serious impression on the actual results&mdash;I think he should <Col N="208" /> reconsider the matter and arrange, in some way or other, to get representation for the pig producers in the framing of their own quota production. If he does so, he will have gone a long way towards placating these most important interests and laying the foundation of harmonious working and the success of the Bill.  I think it is essential and I agree with Deputy McGovern and the other speakers who have gone before me, that it is a matter in respect of which it is well worth going out of our way to satisfy them if we can manage it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad that Deputy Keyes has made that speech because it was precisely that point which struck me, having listened to the debate.  It is really a question of creating confidence.  I think that is what the Minister wants to do. He wants smooth working.  I quite agree with Deputy Keyes that the form of the amendment is not an important thing.  We are voting on whichever amendment a division is taken on because we believe that in this important question of fixing the quotas it will make for the success of the Bill if the producers are represented. That is the reason we are voting and I think that is what Deputy Belton considers is the essence, the really important thing.  There are other things which Deputy Belton would like to achieve as well, but he has made it quite clear that the important thing is to secure, on this matter of the fixing of the quota, representation for the pig producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, it is really a question of confidence and I think the Minister made it quite clear that, in a way, his own personal sympathies would be along the lines suggested by the arguments put forward by Deputy Keyes, Deputy Belton, Deputy Dillon and others, but he fears that there will be confusion in the working of the measure, lack of smoothness in the working of the measure and that, in fact, as he said himself, you are asking for trouble if you do this particular thing.  If you look at it merely from the machinery or technical angle <Col N="209" /> alone, there is something to be said for the Minister's contention, but I think that if you take human nature as it is, in the long run you will avoid friction&mdash;more friction than you will cause&mdash;if you do what the various speakers have asked the Minister to do.  The Minister would find it much better to bring people together on this important question of fixing the quota, especially when the chairman will have the ultimate voice.  If you do not do this, whether it is well founded or not, as Deputy Keyes said, you will have suspicion, and you will not have smooth working, that is, instead of having the matter discussed there and, if necessary, occasionally fought out there amongst the people interested, you will have a transfer to some other sphere and I am sure that pressure will be put on the Minister&mdash;he may say that he will have no power with the Pigs Board to do it&mdash;to use what is really intended by him only as a last resort, namely, Section 143, the particular section that gives power in certain cases to the Pigs Board to take over control in certain matters.  If anything is calculated to do that, it is the plea on the part of the producers that they are not getting a fair show.</P>
    <P>I think that, whatever the theoretical difficulties may seem to be and which impress the Minister, if he takes into account the importance of getting people together to discuss these matters, he will be avoiding friction. As I say, I can understand the office mind thinking it will be the other way around, but if the Minister considers it, he will realise that, in practice, he will be avoiding, instead of creating, friction.  Remember that it does not require a big increase in pig population, as Deputy Smith suggested, to bring about the operation of a case like that which Deputy Belton mentioned of the people at a fair.  A surplus is sufficient to do it and if we continue with restricted markets, there is the possibility&mdash;and there is no good overlooking it&mdash;of a surplus of that kind.  It was no answer when the Minister suggested that if he is dissatisfied with the jobber, he can then bring his pigs <Col N="210" /> to the factory.  The big farmers may be able to do that but the small farmers will, in practice, not be able to do it.  Theoretically, they can, but that again is a purely theoretical answer.  It is not a practical answer because the small farmer cannot do it.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to go a little further than he has gone already.  For the real smooth working of the Bill he will find, in practice, that if he meets the case put up practically from all sides of the House&mdash; I do not know exactly, beyond those of Deputy Smith, what the views of the Fianna Fáil Party are on it in reality, but we have views put up by most people from all sides who are anxious for the smooth working of the Bill&mdash; he will secure that position better by allaying suspicions, well or ill-founded, by giving this voice to the producers in this matter, that is, by transferring the decision in regard to the quota to a Board which represents the curer and the producer, with a voice ultimately by the chairman.  The Minister said that the chairman, of course, would have no voice if there was a unanimous decision, but if the curers believe one thing, there cannot be a unanimous decision against a curer in that particular Board.  There, again, it will rest with the chairman, who, as we presume, is competent and has no desire unduly to hamper or cripple the work of the factories.  I think the amendment and the spirit of the amendment are eminently reasonable and I trust the Minister will advance a little further than he has advanced already and go beyond the promise of more consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with that, although there may be much in his argument for leaving the working of the quota order absolutely in the hands of the curers, I should like to remind the Minister that producers were born before curers.  If you had no producers you would have no curers and they should at least have some say as to what is going to be done with the industry.  I quite recognise that, possibly, this Bill is not the last word.  I know the peculiar position <Col N="211" /> in which the Minister finds himself owing to certain circumstances existing at the moment; but at any time the best laid schemes or plans set up by the Minister may be blown sky-high.  The whole thing is purely hypothetical and we must do the best we can under the present circumstances. What I am anxious about is that so far as this committee is concerned it is only right to claim that the producers should have some little say in regard to the working of this industry.  I am particularly anxious because of the conditions existing in the constituency which I represent.  I do not know whether the Minister is aware that at the moment one of our bacon factories is under a cloud; it may be put out of action at a minute's notice.  The pig producers along the Border counties, which embrace Louth, Monaghan and Cavan, have been accustomed to kill their pigs and sell them in the pork market.  Unless we have a representative on this committee who will voice the views of the producers of those counties, I can see, human nature being what it is, that possibly the other counties, especially the southern counties, will benefit at the expense of counties like Louth, Monaghan and Cavan.</P>
      <P>I do not know what Deputy Smith's view is on that matter, but it is my considered view that the pig producers of County Louth will be at a great disadvantage unless they have someone to speak on their behalf.  I was listening to the discussion to-day and I wondered if the curers took only 19,000 pigs out of 20,000 pigs in the country what would happen the remaining 1,000.  The 1,000 pigs could very easily be in Louth, Monaghan and Cavan.</P>

      <P>It may not, but when <Col N="212" /> we are up against a difficult situation it is the duty of each Deputy to do all he possibly can to safeguard the interests of those he represents.  I can see very great disadvantages accruing to the pig producers in my county unless they have somebody who will voice their opinions.  The only way those opinions can be voiced is by the Minister acceding to the almost unanimous demand of Deputies on all sides of the House.  I think I can speak on behalf of Fianna Fáil Deputies as well, because in their hearts they would prefer this.  I know that Deputy Corry especially always likes to give the producer a say as to how his business should be conducted.  The Minister would do well to fall in with the suggestion contained in this amendment.</P>

      <P>There is clear substance in what the Deputy says.

Then we must ask ourselves if it will be weighed promptly, and with the head and feet on, or will it be further dressed by the removal of the head and feet and then weighed and the supplier paid on the basis of the weight of the carcase, minus the head and feet?  Unless we put a statutory obligation on the curer to weigh before removal of the head and feet, surely he is quite free to say: &ldquo;In our business we never weigh the head and feet of a dead pig.  We ascertain the weight on the basis of the carcase dressed, in so far as the head and feet are removed.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In page 53, line 9, at the end of Section 116, to insert the following words:&mdash;&ldquo;the expression &lsquo;the economic price for pigs&rsquo; means the price arrived at by calculating the cost of production of pigs or pigs of any class prescribed by a formula in which provision shall be made for the cost of the weanling pig and for the costs of converting the wcanling pig into a bacon pig (said costs of conversion to include a detailed statement of a standard pig ration to be prescribed as provided for under this section) together with a fair additional percentage of profit.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The history of this amendment begins with amendments which stood in my name, and in the name of Deputy Belton, on the Committee Stage.  The object of my amendment certainly was to get a very exhaustive calculation made by the Minister for Agriculture in regard to the cost of production. When the amendment underwent close examination it certainly seemed clear to me that there were certain calculations adumbrated in it that could not be reasonably asked for from time to time, which involved an exact estimation of the cost of labour, as well as hours which would vary from district to district, and about which it would be impossible to get a uniform figure. The cost of production was the principle underlying Deputy Belton's amendment and my amendment.  After protracted discussion it was agreed that our several amendments should be withdrawn and that the Minister would propose a compromise on the Report Stage, which now appears in amendment No. 84, as amended by permission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The all-important element, to my mind, in the procedure of fixing the price of pigs is that that price should be fixed after due consideration has been given to the cost of production.  Accordingly, amendment No. 59, which stands in my name, proposes that a new statutory term called &ldquo;the economic price for pigs&rdquo; should be inserted in the Bill, and that it should be a price calculated according to a formula in which provision shall be made for the cost of the weanling pig, and for the costs of converting the weanling pig into a bacon pig (said costs of conversion to include a detailed statement of a standard pig ration to be prescribed as provided for under this section) together with a fair additional percentage of profit.  In that connection I would refer the Minister to the Lane-Fox Report, 1932, on reorganisation for pigs and pig products, which was published by the authority of the British Government.  On pages 35 and 36 of that Report a formula is set out, whereunder a reasonable cost of production could be arrived at with a view to ascertaining from time to time what would be a fair price to the producer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A strange fact emerged in the course of the Committee debate.  The Minister said that he could not accept the view that the getting of an economic price for pigs was a primary purpose of this Bill.  Nevertheless, I remember that when he was introducing the Bill he said that it was a producers' Bill&mdash;that the Bill was being introduced for their benefit.  I agree with him; I think it could be made so, but in order to make it so it is vitally important that he should insist on an economic price for producers. The reason I want some <Col N="227" /> statutory obligation to be placed on the price-fixing authority not to fall below the economic price is that it is essential that due weight should be given to paragraph (e) of amendment No. 83, which I think is taken originally from an amendment put down by me on the Committee Stage, and which the Minister undertook to accept.  It provides that the price of feeding stuffs shall be set out in detail.  It is clear under any circumstances that that would be important, but it is peculiarly important under the circumstances obtaining in this country at the present time, because the Minister for Agriculture, through the operation of the cereals legislation, can materially affect the price of pig feeding from day to day and from week to week, and there is a very grave danger that the producers of pigs in this country will be caught between the upper and the nether millstone of the fixed price under the Pigs and Bacon Bill, and the maize meal mixture price, which is provisionally affected by orders made by the Minister for Agriculture under the cereals legislation. Therefore, it is essential that we should have not only the cost of the production of pigs, and particularly the cost of feeding stuffs for the previous four months in that general way, but also have the standard mixture published from time to time and the cost of that standard mixture assessed in relation to current prices as determined by the Minister's orders under the cereals legislation. It will be seen, Sir, in that connection that my amendment No. 59 hangs together with some other amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>With Nos. 82 and 86.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No. 82 would place a statutory obligation on the Board not to fix a price lower than the ascertained economic price, and No. 86 provides that together with the publication of the economic price there should be published in the same issue of <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> details of the formula on which the current economic price <Col N="228" /> for pigs was arrived at.  That formula would consist of the costs of converting the weanling pig into a bacon pig, and that would, presumably, be based on the assumption that 4 lbs. of the approved pig-feeding mixture would add 1 lb. live weight gain to the weanling, in accordance with the formula established after very careful investigation by the Lane-Fox Committee in Great Britain, and that the cost of the weanling pig would be worked out in accordance with the formula contained in the same report and worked out by the same authority.  If we had those facts before us I think this Bill would be a very much better one.  Even if the Minister felt that he could not accept amendment No. 82, which places a statutory obligation on the Board in no case to fix a price for pigs less than the economic price, I think it would be a valuable thing to have, in addition to the specified price and the hypothetical price already provided for in this Bill, a third price to be known as the economic price, which would really be the actual cost of production plus that margin of profit which, in the opinion of the Board, would be deemed to be a reasonable margin to make it possible for the pig producer to carry on.  If we had that, we would be in a position to judge from time to time how the pig industry was doing, and unless we have it we will never know whether, in fact, pigs are being produced at a loss or at a profit.  When we undertook to regulate the price at all, and when we undertook in the specified price arbitrarily to give farmers, more or less than the hypothetical price, we ought to be sure that in making those arbitrary changes we do not ever unnecessarily lower the price below the cost of production to the farmer.  In this way we know that the economic price is a definite thing under amendment No. 59 in this Bill.  I cannot see how we can know, from time to time, whether the economic price is, in fact, higher or lower than the actual cost of production of the pig.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there can be no difference of opinion as to the desirability <Col N="229" /> of what Deputy Dillon suggests; that is, that pigs should be bought at an economic price.  But I submit that his statement is very incomplete.  He did not give any idea how he would meet the difficulty of getting over a long period of depressed prices.  He did not say at whose cost the economic price would, in all circumstances, be paid.  He argued that as far as pig production is concerned there should be no period in which the pig producers would not get a fair return for their industry.  Everybody desires such a condition of things for all producers, but no industry has had a history in which that would always be possible. The history of most industries would rather show that at certain periods such a guarantee would be impossible, particularly in a case of this kind where we have to export so much of our production.  May there not be periods when the price for our exports will be so low that to maintain an economic price for pigs would simply mean that producers in other industries would be working at unduly uneconomic prices?  Surely a big principle of this kind cannot be established with regard to a particular trade or business without having reactions upon practically every other industry in the country.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy Dillon did not give us sufficient information as to what was in his mind if he really wanted to establish this principle.  Obviously, we all want to establish it, if possible.  We have the case, as he pointed out himself, where an effort is being made to give corn growers, for instance, an economic price for their production. Root growers, I take it, would also be entitled to an economic price, that is to say, the growers of turnips, potatoes and so on.  They would be entitled to get from the pig producers a fair price.</P>

I was not surprised to hear Deputy Moore say he would like to see an economic price fixed, though he did see difficulties in the way.  Are not the Government themselves making difficulties by interfering and restricting numbers of people from carrying on their business in their own way?  They have been making these difficulties, and now they are trying to run away from them. They fix a price, but they are not prepared to face up to the difficulties involved.  There are industries living upon agriculture, and these industries have been protected to the extent of 50 per cent., sometimes higher, at the expense of agriculture, in order that these industries may pay an economic price for their labour.  Not only are agriculturists saddled with a burden imposed by British tariffs and the economic war, but they must not be treated as other citizens and allowed to get an economic price for their produce.  Is that the policy of Deputy Moore?</P>

      <P>To my mind, unless Deputy Dillon's amendment is accepted, the interest of a good many producers, and certainly whatever little interest I have in this Bill, would vanish notwithstanding the interjection of Deputy Moore that in times of depression it might be impossible to state an economic price.  In reply to Deputy Moore, I would say I do not see any suggestion in this Bill that in times of depression the bacon curers are compelled to manufacture bacon at a loss.  If one set of handlers of pigs are to be protected against loss, it is certainly due to the producers of pigs that their position should be safeguarded. The tendency of legislation, so far as there is interference with industry of any kind, has always been to provide a certain measure for the manufacturer and the retailer.  That has <Col N="232" /> always been the tendency of such legislation. If legislation is going to be fair, there must be a definite attempt to fix an economic price and a fair opportunity to the producers to earn a profit.  Deputy Moore has no more right to say that it is impossible to compel an economic price in a period of depression than he would be entitled to say that curers should be compelled to work at a loss.  Nobody wants them to do that.  If the curers cannot work on a certain price, let them go out of business.  But if we are to make any real attempt to assist the producers, we must make the Bill pleasing to them in its essential provisions. The only way to achieve that is to put definite words in the Bill providing that those who decide the price must make that price an economic price.  There is a subsequent amendment in the name of the Minister which is being debated at the same time as this amendment.  The Minister's amendment does not meet what is in some of our minds.  The Minister's amendment provides that the Board shall have regard to certain things.  We want to have it definitely provided that the price fixed will be an economic price&mdash;that that will be the first consideration.  Unless that is done, this Bill will not be worth the paper on which it is written so far as the producers are concerned.</P>

      <P>Deputies on the opposite benches completely and absolutely ignored in their speeches the principle of the Bill which they were discussing. Nobody should know that principle better than Deputy Dillon.  At an earlier stage, when we were discussing another question, Deputy Dillon attempted to demonstrate how a farmer would be squeezed in the fair.  Because <Col N="233" /> of a certain surplus and because of a farmer's anxiety to sell his pigs he would, Deputy Dillon said, go to a jobber and say: &ldquo;I will give you them 2/-, 3/- or 4/- per cwt. less than the fixed price.&rdquo;  The Deputy now comes to the House to recommend a proposal which would absolutely and completely remove any limit on the extent to which production might go.  Deputies should remember that, in this Bill, there is no attempt to control the production of pigs except in so far as the Pigs Board may, from time to time, fix an uneconomic price.  If, as Deputies suggest, there were an economic price all the year round and every year, you would have immediately to proceed to control production, indicate who should be allowed to go into pig production, the amount they would produce and so forth.  That would not be an easy matter.  We had a very frank confession from Deputy Dillon when discussing this question at the Special Committee. It was a confession that was absolutely unnecessary from our point of view, because we knew that the amendments then being discussed were political amendments, as we know that these are political amendments and that this is a political Party discussion. Deputies on the opposite side can go out to the cross roads and tell the people at Fine Gael meetings that Fianna Fáil is giving protection and profits to this and that person, and that the poor farmers who are producing pigs will not get an economic price all the year round.</P>

Deputy Dillon, Deputy McGovern and Deputy Bennett who were on the Select Committee know that they are engaging in pure politics.  How often have I said that this Bill aims at regulating the bacon industry without restricting the production of pigs.  You must regulate the price by supply and demand or, if you are going to fix a price, then you must say who is to produce the pig.</P>

      <P>Great Britain can do this because they have a home market for the pigs.  The Lane-Fox Committee can do as Deputy Dillon says&mdash;lay down an economic price&mdash;until their home market is filled but if they come <Col N="235" /> to the point where they will have to export, there will be a different problem.  The cases of Denmark and Holland were mentioned here.  Holland dealt with the position by reducing the numbers produced.  Denmark have dealt with the position by making it uneconomic for people to produce more pigs than are required.  We must either make it uneconomic to produce a surplus of pigs or we must see that only a certain number of pigs are produced.</P>

      <P>Until we can produce our <Col N="236" /> requirements in wheat, we can fix an economic price for it.  There is no trouble about doing that in our present circumstances&mdash;no trouble at all&mdash;but if we reach the stage where we will be producing more wheat than we require, we shall be in a different position. Beet has also been mentioned.  We can certainly fix an economic price for beet until we reach the point where we are producing too much.  When we reach that point, we shall be in a very different position.  Deputy Bennett says that, in this Bill, we are protecting the curers and giving the curers an economic price.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not impute to the Minister that he would be responsible for such a rash statement as that. The Minister, I am sure, as Minister for Agriculture in this country, has read the Report of the Sugar Inquiry in Britain, where they have laid it down that the State is paying for the production of the raw beet for the factory.  Of course, you can make the production of beet and wheat and peat, and all the rest of them, economic, but how will you make them economic? You can make them economic by subsidy. But then those lines, such as pig production, that were normally uneconomic, become economic by trying to bolster up something that was not economic.  You can make it economic in that way.  We cannot afford to fix a price for corn here, or for cereals, that is not warranted by the price obtainable for that cereal in its finished state, and the finished state of feeding cereals in this country is being dealt with here in bacon.  That is the market for our cereals, and not any fiction that you create by the passage of a Bill here.  Deputy Moore can go down to his constituency, which borders on the barley and beet-growing area, and make a speech there to the effect that we have guaranteed a price for beet and for wheat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>You cannot have a guaranteed economic price in this country now on any agricultural product, because nothing else is economic and the moment you guarantee an economic price for any commodity we are all ready to jump in to produce it. I agree with the theory of Deputy Dillon's amendment, of course, and it is enshrined in the British Act where a price is fixed representing the cost of production and a little profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Under that scheme, according to the Report of the Pig Industries Tribunal, &ldquo;contracts would be made by registered producers with the registered curers for the supply of definite quantities of pigs in each stated contract period, at a national price based on feeding costs plus an element of profit to be negotiated between a Pigs Marketing Board elected by registered pig producers&rdquo;&mdash;not nominated, but elected&mdash;&ldquo;and a Bacon Marketing Board elected by registered bacon curers.&rdquo;  I am reading here from the report of the Pig Industries Tribunal.  Deputy Dillon's amendment is quite a reasonable amendment but, in the circumstances prevailing in this country at present, we cannot do it. The Minister cannot accept it.  Were <Col N="239" /> I in the Minister's place, I could not accept it because of the circumstances under which we are carrying on agriculture in this country to-day.  I see the Minister's point, that it is bound to work on the lines that that price there will be regulated by supply and demand, and the small price that production in pigs will fix will be the corrective to over-production.  The Minister prefers that corrective to fixing a guaranteed price, knowing that in six or 12 months' time he would have to give out pig cards, as in Denmark and Holland, and would be faced with the problem as to whom he should give the cards, and, of course, then Party politics would come in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another part of this Bill, dealing with prices, to which I intended to put specific amendments. Not having done so, I would say, if I may be permitted to do so, in connection with these amendments, that the Minister should consider whether he thinks it wise to have power in this Bill to interfere with seasonal prices, the hypothetical price, the ascertained price, or whatever it is.  There is an economic reason why, in the second half of the year, more pigs are produced than in the other half, even though in the half of the year in which most pigs are produced the price is steadily and consistently lower than in the other half.  Now, if there was not an economic reason for that&mdash;we need not go into it because we know what it is&mdash;the very difference in price would have corrected it long ago.  In other words, I take it that in the half of the year in which there is the greatest pig production it must be cheaper to produce pigs then than in the other half.  If you try, as is visualised in this Bill, to correct this tendency and say that, in the half of the year when the greatest number of pigs is produced, we will improve prices and that in the other half of the year when less pigs are produced&mdash;when the price for them is firmer&mdash;we will cut a bit of the price, are you not going to aggravate the position?  They have now found an economic level.  If you raise the level for the half year when pigs can be produced more cheaply <Col N="240" /> and give a better price, will not people go more into production during that portion of the year, but if you reduce the price in the other portion of the year when it costs more to produce them, will there not be less production?</P>

      <P>I am greatly entertained by the virtuous indignation of the Minister for Agriculture and one or two Deputies opposite at Deputy Dillon's proposals: that these past masters in all the arts of political propaganda should be moved so deeply by the display of what they regard as political cunning on our side of the House.  It is very gratifying indeed. Now let us admit, for the sake of argument, that, in the absence of restrictions on pig production, the proposals of Deputy Dillon would put an impossible burden on the Treasury.  Even so, I suggest that his amendments are valuable amendments: that they are worthy of our support, and that we are justified in supporting them and have nothing to be ashamed of in supporting them.  They are valuable amendments because they illustrate the principles that underlie Government policy.  The Government's agricultural policy consists in subsidising forms of agriculture for which the country is less suited at the expense of those forms of agriculture for which it is well suited: the forms of agriculture in which we have made our name.  The forms of agriculture that have built up our export trade are to be slowly bled to death.  Here is a case in point.  If the principle of subsidising the agricultural industry is a good one, there can be no logical excuse for refusing to do here what has been done in the case of other agricultural products and of assuring to the producer a satisfactory price. The fact that to do so would put too great a burden on the Treasury is no reason why we should not point to the failure of the Government to do so, because, in not doing so, they are inflicting injustice on a certain class of agricultural producers, and it is very <Col N="242" /> proper that the nature of that injustice should be illustrated by such amendments as Deputy Dillon has put down.</P>

He has proved that in practice and in theory. Deputy Belton says that he agrees with the principle but that he finds it impracticable, and I think he spoke rather derisively of Deputy Dillon's efforts to fix the price for slips, etc. After all, if you have Deputy Belton, who at one time was regarded, and rightly regarded, as your shadow-Minister for Agriculture, destroying the very theories you put forward, I think that in itself is proof positive of the very negation of the principles that you have so glibly proposed over there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not like to harp on the <i>tu quoque</i> principle too much.  I do not remember in an era when this House was not fortunate enough to have the services of Deputy Dillon, but when there were people in the House who advocated the <Col N="243" /> principles he now advocates, in other words, his predecessors, a time when the Cosgravian régime was in full blast and when pigs were fetching very bad prices&mdash;I was not fortunate enough to be on these benches to hear the wealth of eloquence and the flow of soul that emanated from our opponents&mdash;reading in the papers of those days, and I was rather a constant student of them, any jeremiads from the Government of that day about the prices of pigs.  I recollect that not so long ago, during the Cosgravian régime&mdash;perhaps it is not quite refined to use that phrase; &ldquo;in the reign of the previous Government&rdquo; would be the Parliamentary phrase&mdash;slips, as Deputy Dillon perhaps would call them, but ordinary bonneens as we call them in Wexford&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>We all know very well what happens in connection with most of those things.  We all know very well that once the farmer has sold his pig to the curer, everybody afterwards will get a reasonable margin of profit for handling it, except the producer.  Why should not we in these circumstances see that the producer gets a fair show?  That is all we ask for.  I thought this Bill was going to benefit the pig producers of the country but it appears from the discussion that has taken place that some Deputies will see to it that an economic price is not given.  What I would like to know is when somebody, whether the Board or somebody else, will make the price of pigs profitable and when they will not.  So far as I can understand it, there is no intention on the part of the Minister to make the price of pigs an economic price, with a reasonable margin of profit.  Is that not all that is asked?  Yet, the Minister refuses to consider that question. There is no reason why this amendment should not be debated as the other amendments were debated.  It is a reasonable thing to ask for and I certainly support the amendment. I will not go down the cross-roads talking about it.  So far as I can understand the position, from the discussion and from the statements made from the Government Benches, it is the intention that at times, if there is any possibility of an over-production of pigs, they will see that an economic price is not given and that pigs will be produced at a loss.  Is that the intention of the Bill?  There is certainly no credit to the Minister for introducing a Bill like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The fixing of prices is one of the main principles of the <Col N="247" /> Bill and I intervene in the debate simply because the fixing of prices will be a very important factor, so far as the south of Ireland is concerned, and, particularly, so far as the counties of Kerry and Cork, the two chief producing centres, are concerned. In Kerry the cost of feeding stuffs is very high, much more so than in other parts of the country.  When the fixing of prices is about to take place the cost of feeding stuffs should be one of the main considerations. Whether the price in Cork or in Kerry or Dublin is to be the index will be a very important matter.  The cost of feeding stuffs in Kerry, simply because it is not a grain-growing county, are higher even than they are in Cork and the retail prices in Cork are higher than in the midlands and other counties.  I suggest to the Minister that cognisance should be taken of that fact.  In so far as Kerry is concerned, some allowance should be made, otherwise the producers will be seriously affected.  We have no mills down there and offals are very expensive and that has a great bearing on the cost of production.  The Bill, as a whole, will be a great boon to the farmers.  We remember the time when pig buyers banded themselves together at various centres and fixed prices to the detriment of the producers.  That will be terminated by the principles outlined in this Bill.  No matter what may be said by the Opposition about this Bill, I believe it will eventually work out to the benefit of the producers, the farmers.</P>

      <P>I thought not. It is quite clear it does not.  Therefore, the point Deputy Flynn made is not met by the Minister's amendment. I was extremely surprised at the tone, the spirit, that was thrown into this debate&mdash;not by Deputy Moore; he avoided it, although he just got close to the border.  Who made the political speeches, even against Fianna Fáil, on this Bill?  Deputy Smith made a very strong political speech against Fianna Fáil.  The debate was going on, and suddenly the Deputy from Cavan, who ought to be interested in an economic price for pigs, butted in and raised all this heat about politics.  Unfortunately he led the Minister, who occasionally can be stimulated in that way, to follow his bad example.  There are difficulties, the Minister says, in doing what Deputy Dillon's amendment demands.  There have been difficulties in helping other industries, in helping <Col N="250" /> the wheat, the butter and the town industries that we have heard of, at the expense of the consumer.  You speak of the price being to some extent dependent on the foreign market. Yesterday we were discussing a Dairy Bill, under which we were precisely undertaking to do what it is now apparently high treason to suggest should be done in the case of this particular industry.  If this had not been done all round, if it had not been done in connection with the tariffed industries we have set up, if it had not been done in various other industries, I could understand the case made by Deputy Moore and Deputy Smith.  I could understand these Deputies pointing out the impossibility of making an industry or a price economic.  But this House, time after time, in connection with industries in the towns and even in the country, and even, as Deputy MacDermot has pointed out, industries that have proved less suitable to the country than the one we are discussing, has given its approval to the Government making these economic.  How, then, does it suddenly become pure politics to demand that the same thing be done for this important industry as Deputy Dillon demands in this amendment for an industry possibly more suited to the country than any of those that this House has supported at the expense of the consumer?  It is not quite correct to allege, as the Minister has alleged, that here the producer and the consumer are on the same footing.  They are not, because in the Bill as it stands the fixing of the quota is in the hands of the curer altogether, and the Minister knows that the quota will be fixed, to a large extent, on the terms of the profits.  If the Minister wants to put them on a level, I say that he should consider the case made earlier.  I say that in no spirit of controversy.  I am merely following the Minister's own statement that they are on a level, and it is quite clear that they are not on a level.  As Deputy Curran says, as far as the profit goes there is no doubt that everybody who deals with a pig from the time it is sold by the producer until it is sold in the shop to the consumer, is more sure of his profit than the original producer.  Unless there is <Col N="251" /> a much better case made against Deputy Dillon's amendment than has been made by the Minister, I submit to <Col N="252" /> the House that it is an amendment that ought to be supported.</P>

      <P>In page 53, line 43, Section 119 (1), after the word &ldquo;act&rdquo; to add the words &ldquo;to the first Board in 1935&rdquo;, and at the end of Section 119 to add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;At the second and every subsequent election the representatives of the pig producers on the Board shall be elected by the pig producers in accordance with an election scheme which shall be prepared by the Minister and, not later than June, 1936, be submitted for approval to each House of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I understood the Minister intended to accept the principle embodied in this amendment, but I am not satisfied that he has done it.  I think that it is a very important point, and I believe the Minister gave the Committee the impression that he did intend to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 62 would merely indicate the method whereby elected members were to be elected.  The principle has been accepted that certain members shall be elected.  It now falls to consider how they shall be elected.  Deputy McGovern, in amendment No. 62, suggests one method, and the Minister, in amendment No. 77, suggests another.</P>

      <P>My amendment is to the effect that at every election after the first election in 1935 the representatives of the pig producers on the Board shall be elected by the pig producers in accordance with an election scheme that shall be prepared by the Minister and not later than June, 1936, be submitted for approval to each House of the Oireachtas.  The Minister gave us to understand that he would submit a scheme.  He has turned down a scheme proposed by Deputy Belton.  Surely he is not going to turn down his own scheme?  This amendment proposes that the Minister should prepare a scheme himself and submit it to the Oireachtas.  I think he can find no fault with that proposal.  Then, of course, we can have something to say on the scheme when he brings it forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference between the two schemes is that in amendment No. 77 the Minister undertakes to have producer members elected from associations if they are formed.  In other words, I leave it to the producers themselves to form the associations. Deputy McGovern wants me to see that they are formed.  I do not think it is my business.  It is the business of the Farmers' Union, if there is one, or some such organisation, to form these producers' organisations.  If formed, then under amendment No. 77 they will be elected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider the question of registration? Deputy McGovern was against it today, but I do not see how you can get a proper register otherwise.  As to organising producers, the Minister would learn a lot if he got a hold of Middleton's pamphlet on German agriculture before the war.  He would see that even the Germans, who can so adapt themselves to organisation, could not organise the farmers voluntarily. They had to be brought into a semi-State organisation formed by the Government.  Unless the Minister takes up agricultural organisation he will never get any agricultural opinion worth having.  I do not agree that the best agricultural opinion is got by having <Col N="255" /> it organised as the mouthpiece of any Government.  I have as much experience as most men of building up organisations and I say that you will never get 20 per cent. of the farmers organised.  To be quite candid, I see no way between the two extremes, by the Minister nominating producers' representatives or by registration.  We have to choose between the two extremes. Personally I favour registration. I do not say that it is the best way but, if I were Minister, I would have registration so as to spread the responsibility.  The Minister would be well advised to consider the question of registration.  It is quite true, as Deputy McGovern stated, that there was a good deal of discussion in Committee as to the method of electing the first Board and the first representatives.</P>

      <P>I do not know if committees of agriculture are good vocational societies, unless the register upon which they are elected is changed.  As the House is aware, committees of agriculture are merely nominees of county councils and, in the present trend of political madness in local elections, county councils are a majority of one Party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit it.  I nominated committees in both the City and County of Dublin on a political basis. It is wrong, but it is due to the madness of the time.  That is not good for vocational work.  I would prefer, and I have for many years advocated agricultural committees from which could be formed an agricultural council on the lines of the German and Italian agricultural councils, elected at the bottom by agriculturists and not by anyone else.  I consider that county agricultural organisations to carry out <Col N="256" /> work for agriculture are more important than county councils.  I would be glad if the Minister would take some steps in the direction of agricultural organisation, and the formation of agricultural committees from a special register, prepared on an agricultural basis, and not to have every Tom, Dick or Harry voting for county councils and then nominating, on a political basis, agricultural committees.  What good are they for vocational purposes? Even though an opponent occupied the position of Minister for Agriculture I would prefer nominations by a Minister, in the interests of agriculture, than county committees of agriculture as at present nominated.  I do not think they are representative of agriculture or that there is good representation in that way.  What is wrong with registration when organising the pig industry?  Why not register pig producers?  It would be a big register if the owner of every bit of land, as well as those who are potential pig producers, were on it.  Why not register them and, whether they like it or not, make them take an interest in their business?  I see nothing wrong in that.  While Deputy McGovern is opposed to the registration of pig producers I would welcome it.  I would be delighted to hear objections to it. If a Minister for Agriculture, no matter who he may be, wanted to consider any question in relation to pigs and bacon, he would have a register which could be used for nominations to the Board.  He would have some organisation to refer to.  He has none now.  I was keen on putting my amendment to the test until it met with an accident on the way by getting into the line of fire and getting a bullet.  It was left on the wayside.  I should like to put to the test the question of registering pig producers.  I do not see any half-way house between the Minister and registration of all pig producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexHaslett" hpid="Mr. Haslett Mr. Haslett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a good deal of substance in the suggestion that there should be some scheme of election.  On the Second Reading the Minister, when challenged about the composition of the different Boards, and not <Col N="257" /> improving the position of the farmers, immediately retorted, and very truly, that there was no farmers' organisation from which to draw representation.  I felt rebuked at the time, because the Minister was right in what he said. There is a good deal to be said for representative election and registration is not beyond the bounds of possibility. No scheme that has been put forward for representatives of pig producers on any of these Boards is satisfactory.  I appeal to the Minister to give the matter his consideration, and to let us have some scheme of election by which those purely interested in pig production and agriculture will be represented. I am a member of a Committee of Agriculture and I say that all members of these committees are not interested in pig production.  They would not be suitable bodies from which to draw representation.  There are some very good members on agricultural committees, who take their work seriously, and try to carry it out impartially.  There are others who, as their business does not run along those lines, just simply do the work in a mechanical sort of way.  As far as members of agricultural committees are concerned that certainly would not be a satisfactory method of electing representatives of the pig producers to that Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I suggest to the Minister that it would appear that the scheme which he adumbrates in his amendment No. 77 is not going to prove acceptable to the people for whose approval he drafted it, because I recognise that amendment No. 77 was drafted in answer to representations which were made to him by the Special Committee. The amendment standing in the name of Deputy McGovern merely places an obligation on the Minister to produce an election scheme not later than June, 1936, and submit it to the House.  I suggest to him that perhaps it might be wiser to drop the outline which he has made in amendment No. 77, undertake to produce an election scheme before June, 1936, and consult his political opponents and other persons whom he knows to be interested in the pig industry as to what the best scheme <Col N="258" /> would be.  It may very well come to pass that by that time he will have come to the conclusion that it is necessary to extend the whole scope of this legislation and control the production of pigs.  Of course, the moment that stage is reached the whole difficulty about elections disappears, because every pig producer will have to be registered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether he has reached that stage or not it might be no harm at all to make a preliminary survey and register pig producers now, with a view to preparing the ground for what he might have to undertake under a later development of this whole system of legislation.  However, we might raise an endless number of circumstances that would have to be brought under review before the final decision was reached, and it is that very consideration that makes me incline towards Deputy McGovern's amendment, which postpones a final decision in the matter for some time, so that we might have an opportunity of turning the thing over in our minds and determining what is the most expedient thing to do.  I think the Minister would agree with me that amendment No. 77 is better dropped, because it probably does not commend itself unreservedly to himself, and it certainly does not commend itself to a number of other people in the House.  Amendment No. 62 leaves ample time for consideration and even for seeing the Bill in working order before he makes up his mind what scheme he will finally recommend to the House.  I suggest that he accept it and give everybody the assurance he wants.</P>

      <P>Yes.  The only difference between us is that I think they ought to organise themselves.  Deputy McGovern thinks I ought to organise them.  I do not agree that the Minister for Agriculture ought to be asked <Col N="259" /> to organise the farmers in a case such as that.  I think it is going altogether outside the functions of the Minister for Agriculture.  Sub-sections (1) and (2) of 77 are alternative sections.  The first one is that if the producers are well organised they will elect their members, but, if they are not well organised, under the alternative sub-section (2) we might at least get an organisation which would be able to submit a panel.  The real difference is whether the Minister for Agriculture should organise them or whether they should organise themselves.  I cannot agree to be responsible for organising them, because I am afraid it might be impossible for the Minister to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It merely says that they will be elected by the pig producers in accordance with the election scheme prepared by the Minister.  It is quite conceivable that the scheme prepared by the Minister would be that the county committee of agriculture would elect them.  It would not be a good scheme, but I think it would satisfy the terms of this section.  I have no doubt that, if the Minister accepts this, between us all we will be able, before the critical date, to devise some scheme which will give universal satisfaction.</P>

      <P>The Minister seems to misunderstand my amendment.  I do not want him to organise the farmers, but I want to be more definite as to what sort of organisation he is prepared to accept.  Taking any sort of organisation that may call itself an organisation, is he prepared to accept that as representing the pig producers? That is a point on which I should like to be clear.  Another matter is that they should organise themselves under some body elected for the whole country.  I should like to have each <Col N="260" /> part of the country divided into areas, and that the farmers in those areas should organise themselves under some scheme which the Minister might suggest&mdash;registration or something like that.  In any case I think it would be no harm to leave it over, and all parties may later agree.</P>

      <P>The only benefit from representation would be that the man acting would be responsible to somebody. If that somebody were not a continuing body, then they were really responsible to nobody.  I think, as Deputy Haslett has said, that some organisation with statutory powers would be necessary to meet the case. I think if the Minister thought out a plan of electing the agricultural committees on some other basis, directly responsible to the agricultural electors, that he would have an organisation which would fit this and any other purpose required.</P>

    <P>(2)  The Minister may by order (in this section referred to as a producer members (panel) order) direct that there shall be formed in the election year specified in such order and each subsequent election year a panel of a specified number of persons eligible for nomination by the Minister as producer members, that the persons whose names are to be entered in such panel shall be nominated by approved associations and committees of agriculture, and that the persons nominated by the Minister to be producer members to fill casual vacancies amongst producer members and to act for producer members temporarily unable to discharge their duties owing to illness or other sufficient cause, shall be selected from the persons whose names are entered in such panel, and such order may contain such provisions (including adaptations and modifications of this Part of this Act) as the Minister considers necessary for giving effect to such direction.</P>

      <P>In page 59, line 22, to insert at the end of Section 139 (4) the words &ldquo;and every order amending a price order shall specify the date (not being earlier than seven days after the date on which such order is made) on which such order is to come into force&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in a bit of a difficulty about this amendment and I have to move it in order to explain my difficulty.  I agreed at the special committee to put in this amendment but, on reconsideration, I do not think it is an advisable amendment. If we give seven days' notice of a price order and if we lower the price, it is probable that the curers will wait for the seven days before they buy.  If we raise the price, it is equally obvious that the farmers will hold their pigs until the seven days are over. The present practice of curers is to fix the price on Friday evening, so that it reaches the buyers on Saturday morning, and they can then buy for the following week.  In all probability the Pigs Board will have to adopt that practice of meeting on a Friday evening and letting the price come into operation on the following Monday morning. Deputy Dillon was particularly interested in this point.  If he would agree, I should like to withdraw this <Col N="264" /> amendment and, instead of seven days, say &ldquo;not earlier than the following Monday.&rdquo;  That would mean, if the Board adopt the practice which the curers have been carrying on of meeting on a Friday, that the new price would be sent out by wireless that night and would appear in Saturday morning's papers, so that everybody interested would know it by Monday morning when it would come into operation.  There would be no stoppage in the sale of pigs, because Saturday is more or less a dead day so far as pig sales are concerned.  I did give an undertaking to the Committee, but I should like to be released from that undertaking and to insert instead of the amendment the words &ldquo;not earlier than the following Monday.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I understood from the Minister that a flat rate was to be provided.  In dealing with the freight charges in Committee, I put the question to the Minister: &ldquo;From where,&rdquo; and he said, &ldquo;From anywhere.&rdquo;  I then said: &ldquo;It is a flat rate,&rdquo; and the Minister did not reply.  I understood that it was to be a flat rate.  In any event, it is only right that it should be a flat rate, because some districts are fortunate enough to have a factory, while others have no factory within 50 or 100 miles.  Under this Bill, they may not have the right to start a factory.  This Bill proposes to give a monopoly to existing bacon curers.  For that reason, those who are not in the fortunate position of having a factory should not be penalised.  I think that the amendment should be <Col N="266" /> accepted and a flat rate laid down.  I do not see why people who are at a distance from a factory and thereby at a temporary disadvantage should have that disadvantage made permanent and, in addition, suffer the penalty of an extra freight rate.</P>

      <P>They could divide it into areas and fix a flat charge for each area, but I do not think they could victimise a man because he was 100 miles from a factory.  They could divide the Free State into two parts&mdash; say from Dublin to Galway&mdash;and have a certain flat charge for every pig delivered, wherever delivered, above the line, and they could have a certain flat rate for places below the line. They might have some reason for making a difference.  It is very difficult, in the case of a Bill like this, to foresee what particular factors might have to be considered in fixing these freight allowances.  It might be well to give them powers to have different areas. Personally, I think that they will make one area.  The Board will consist of three producers and three curers, with an independent Chairman, and I think they are more than likely to have only one area.  They cannot possibly make a difference between a man who is 100 miles from a factory and a man who is one mile from a factory, because it would mean drawing circles around the factories and other circles around those circles.  I think it is a pity to limit the Board too much, because it is very hard to see what they might be up against.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that this Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of the Bill is to effect a number of miscellaneous amendments in the Road Transport Act of 1933.  The amendments are not connected, one to the other, and perhaps it will serve the purpose of the House if I merely indicate the scope of, and the necessity for, each of these amendments.  The experience which the Department of Industry and Commerce has had of the operation of the Road Transport Acts has made it clear that the amendments of the nature proposed in this Bill are necessary and desirable in order to facilitate the administration of the Acts.  The first amendment effected is in Section 2.  Under the Road Transport Acts, as they now stand, the carriage of merchandise, which is not the actual property of the owner of the vehicle in which it is carried, is not permissible outside the exempted areas provided for in the 1933 Act except under licence.  Cases have come under the notice of the Department of companies, in the same ownership or under the same management, where one of the companies has been in the habit of using its lorries for carrying merchandise which was the property of one or more of the other companies in the same group, but all under the same ownership or management.  It is proposed, by an extension of the definition of carriage for reward, to enable such companies to continue to carry merchandise, as they have been in the habit of doing in the past, without being in possession of merchandise licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would explain that to us a little more clearly.  The Minister spoke of a group of companies.  Would this be a group of companies all incorporated in the <Col N="270" /> same company, or would it mean individual companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It refers to companies in a common ownership and management. There were only one or two cases where it arose, and it would obviously be a hardship on the firms concerned that the practice they had been carrying on, where the lorries of one company carried the merchandise of the other company, could not be continued.  If the firms were owned by individuals, the difficulty would not have arisen.  It only arose in the case of companies under common ownership and management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 deals with a different point. When the original Act was being framed, any person who had received a licence as an existing carrier had, attached to that licence, a standard lorry weight which was the total of the standard weights of the lorries used by him in connection with that business during the qualifying period. When the Bill was in Committee, it was suggested here by Deputy Séamus Moore that it would be desirable and would make administration simpler if we had a minimum standard lorry weight, which, he suggested, should be two tons.  At the time, I did not consider such an amendment desirable, and I thought we could proceed upon the lines originally devised when the Bill was drafted.  Experience, however, has shown that Deputy Moore was right and that, for a number of reasons, it is desirable to bring into effect now the amendment he suggested at that time&mdash;that amendment being to permit of a minimum standard lorry weight of two tons.  There are 1,352 merchandise licensees authorised to carry for reward, and of those, no less than 1,000, or about 74 per cent., employ single vehicles, the unladen weight of which in each case is less than two tons, and of this 1,000, 202, or 20 per cent., employ vehicles of not more than one ton unladen weight. Many of the vehicles which were in use during the qualifying period, and in respect of which the standard lorry weight of each licensee was calculated, were subsequently replaced by others of greater unladen weight and also of <Col N="271" /> greater carrying capacity before the restrictive effect of the legislation was realised, and also because of the difficulty in securing replacements of exactly similar type, consequent on changes in the types of lorries manufactured. The best known example would be the case of the old Ford one-ton truck, which carried merchandise considerably in excess of that amount, but which is not being marketed now.</P>
    <P>Persons who are licensed in respect of vehicles of that kind had, and will continue to have, difficulty in replacing them by suitable vehicles of the same unladen weight.</P>
    <P>The position now is that there is no provision in the Acts to amend the standard lorry weights to enable such licensees, that is licensees who have replaced the lorries they had during the qualifying period with others of greater unladen weight, to operate the vehicles which they now hold.  That position is undoubtedly a hardship on many licensees who are depending upon these lorries for their livelihood, and it is proposed to allow a minimum standard lorry weight of two tons to enable such persons to continue in business.  In other words, any person with a merchandise licence can operate a lorry of standard weight of two tons, even though his existing standard weight is under that figure.  Similarly, in the case of licensees who have replaced the body of a lorry in use during the statutory period by a heavier body of Saorstat manufacture, it is proposed to include the increased unladen weight in the standard lorry weights.</P>
    <P>Under the Road Transport Act of 1934, the amending Act of last year, a licensee who replaces a vehicle by a new vehicle with a body manufactured in the Saorstat of the same carrying capacity as the old vehicle is entitled to an increase in his standard lorry weight to provide for the increased weight of the new vehicle, but a licensee who improves his old vehicle by having a Saorstat built body for the existing body is not entitled to have his standard lorry weight increased to provide for the increased weight of the vehicle consequent on the substitution of the Saorstat body.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>Did I understand the Minister that he is not entitled to have the increase?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is inserted to enable him to get the increase.  The amendment of the principal Act effected by Section 4 is a purely verbal one, designed to remove any ambiguity which might be thought to exist in the present wording and to make it clear that the intention is that the prohibition on carriage for reward applies only to carriage in mechanically propelled vehicles.  Sections 5 and 6 are necessary to facilitate the enforcement of Section 7 of the Act of 1932 and Section 9 of the Act of 1933 regarding the operation of unlicensed services by persons entering the Saorstát from Northern Ireland.  The proposals in these sections imposed restrictions on the importation of mechanically propelled vehicles used either for the carriage of passengers or merchandise and are not intended to prevent people from outside the Saorstat carrying on business freely within the Saorstat within the law.  These provisions have been found necessary merely to secure that the law shall be observed.  They arise from difficulties experienced in administering the Road Transport Acts.  Shortly, it has been found that our licensing requirements cannot be enforced against carriers resident outside the Saorstat without subjecting them or their passengers, or the persons concerned in the goods they are carrying into the Saorstat, to inconvenience and annoyance on every occasion on which they cross the frontier.  The summary jurisdiction procedure is not available against them as it is against Saorstat citizens and Saorstat companies, a summons cannot be served outside the jurisdiction. There is no desire to harass such carriers who, it is well known, are in the main anxious and willing to observe the law in the conduct of their business in so far as it brings them into our territory.  Certain operators, however, have shown a tendency to disregard, or misunderstand, the requirements. The Department of Local Government and the Department of the Revenue Commissioners are interested equally <Col N="273" /> with the Department of Industry and Commerce in this matter which has been engaging their attention for some time.  The matter has been examined and the machinery proposed in the Bill appears to be the most satisfactory for dealing with the position.</P>
      <P>Persons carrying passengers into the Saorstát in large vehicles with seats for more than six passengers will be required to obtain a simple form of import licence from the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  This licence will be issued on application and without question in the first instance to every applicant.  There will be no charge, and it will be of indefinite duration so long as the holder is believed to be reasonably endeavouring to comply with the law as to road transport licences.  The withdrawal of a licence from any firm will not be done hastily, but cases of apparent disregard of the law will be gone into fully and carefully with the firm concerned, and it is only when it is evident, after the fullest opportunity for satisfying the Department of Industry and Commerce has been afforded, that in most cases there has been a series of incidents which cannot be satisfactorily explained that the step will be taken of withdrawing an import licence for a period or permanently. This course will not cause the unexpected interruptions of business or inconvenience of third parties which the alternative methods of enforcing the law, such as arrests and detention at the frontier in suspected cases, would involve.  The import licence will be in addition to the ordinary Customs requirements, and also in addition to the whole of the licensing requirements under the Road Transport and Road Traffic Acts.  I want to make it clear that the machinery is not designed to confine non-Saorstát persons from carrying on legitimate business, but is designed to secure the observance of Saorstát laws, which will be used with the utmost care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the full scope of the Bill, and Deputies will note that the amendments proposed are various, but are not of major importance.  They arise <Col N="274" /> out of the experience of the operation of the Act during the past year.  Possibly, the future will reveal occasion for further amendment of those Acts. These are only amendments which have appeared necessary resulting from our experience to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It has long been a maxim of this House, and of every other legislature, that one cannot satisfactorily legislate for exceptions, but Section 2 of this Bill apparently resolutely sets its face against that principle, and in this case it is expedient to do so.  I think that on such an occasion as this the Minister should tell us what these exceptions are.  He has told us that there are associated companies, or groups of companies, but he will readily recognise himself that that is not very informative.  The board of directors of one company may engage in a variety of activities.  No question could arise under the original Act but that they were entitled to carry their own merchandise.  I do not understand how the Minister can justify two different persons carrying one another's merchandise for reward and still be made exempt from the provisions of the original legislation. Before the Minister asks us to make an exception of that character, I think he ought at least to illustrate one case of the many which he may have in mind, and, if he is reluctant to name any names, perhaps he would furnish fictitious names in order to illustrate the kind of case he has in mind which would justify this very peculiar exception being made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Section 3, I am very glad that the Minister seeks the powers he does seek in that section, because some cases have come under my own notice where men have either bought lorries which did not correspond with the licence they got under the original Act or found that they were unable to get lorries which would correspond with the licence.  All I will ask the Minister to do in that connection is to assure us that in respect of applications in his office which he was under a statutory obligation to <Col N="275" /> refuse during the last couple of years, he will notify the people concerned that he has now statutory power to grant their applications for a heavier lorry if they renew them.  I have one or two cases in mind of country boys who abandoned their hope of getting a lorry and went to work for other men because of the licence difficulty.  I remember being told, when I made representations in regard to the matter, that the Minister could not be of assistance, although he was willing to be if he could, because he had no statutory discretion in the matter.  He now will have that statutory discretion, and I should be glad if he would look up the cases in his office which he had to refuse, although reluctant, so that he may give the requisite consent to these individuals to get the heavier lorries now.</P>
    <P>So far as Sections 5 and 6 are concerned, they are extremely complex and we must merely accept the Minister's very specific undertaking that they are not intended for any ulterior motive but are simply introduced for the purpose of making administration of the law possible.  I should be glad if the Minister would give us some little more information about Section 2, and, when he is doing so, if he would inform us what exactly was the effect of Section 2 of the Road Transport Act, 1934, which is repealed by sub-section (2) of Section 2 of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that most people who have any connection with road transport will welcome this Bill.  Personally, I would welcome even more elasticity and more amendment than the Minister is proposing because the motor transport business is a developing business and just as the Ford ton truck or 30-cwt. truck developed in a very short time into the two-ton truck, so we find in other grades of vehicles the same thing taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter the remedying of which I would have welcomed, but which is not mentioned here.  It is in regard to the dislocation of transport due to other considerations than the Road Transport Act.  Certain changes were made with regard to the <Col N="276" /> importation of certain things which caused lorries to be laid up for a few months until distribution was adjusted within the Saorstát.  I have a case or two in mind of a transport company which was clearly in business and one of whose lorries was laid up for a little time.  There was great difficulty in getting around that.  The Road Transport Act is very rigid in that respect. While I welcome this amendment of the original Bill, I think the Minister could possibly have gone further in some other directions.</P>

      <P>The matter raised by Deputy Dillon in connection with Section 2 is, I think, easily understood. He asked me to give him fictitious names.  I will give him the case of a small group of people&mdash;perhaps of the one family&mdash;operating the Mullingar Motor Garage Company and also the Mullingar grocery store, general drapery store, corn mill or flour mill or something of the kind, as separate companies for business reasons, but owned by the same people and managed by the same people.  The practice in the past had been for the transport in the garage to carry the products of the store.  That became impossible under the terms of the Road Transport Act unless the proprietor of the garage claimed a licence as an existing carrier and, consequently, became subject to all the liabilities of the Act, which include the liability of carry merchandise for anybody who offered it.  He did not desire to become a public carrier in that respect but merely wanted to continue to carry his own merchandise in a sense, that is, the merchandise of the associated company which was in the same ownership and under the same management.  If the two concerns had been owned by the same individual, there would have been no difficulty at all.  It was only where they had, for business reasons, established separate companies and registered them as such, that difficulty arose and it is provided in this case, where that situation exists, that a merchandise licence is not required to enable the transport of one company to be used to carry the merchandise of the other.  I do not think it is of very <Col N="277" /> great importance.  There cannot be more than a few cases of that kind throughout the country and the effect on the general scheme of the Road Transport Act, 1933, is negligible.</P>

      <P>I do not quite understand why the Minister put in paragraph (a) of sub-section (1), because that provides for the case of a propelled vehicle owned by a person drawing merchandise, the property of such person.  What is the necessity for that paragraph if the cases are only as stated by the Minister?</P>

      <P>By paragraph (b).  The other point raised by Deputy Haslett does not really arise in connection with this Bill.  It is true that certain people had difficulty in establishing their claim to the standard lorry weight they put forward in their claim, because they had included vehicles which were not, in fact, in use or licensed for use during the qualifying period.  It was not intended that persons should get a standard lorry weight in excess of the total lorry weight of the vehicles in actual use during the qualifying period. That raised some difficulty, but there was no ambiguity as to what was the intention when the Act was being framed.  It was to give to each existing carrier a licence to continue as a carrier, using vehicles of the same kind as those he was actually using during the qualifying period, which was the period immediately preceding the passage of the Act.</P>

      <P>It was intended, if he was not a carrier during that period or was only a carrier in a restricted sense, that he should not be allowed to exaggerate the extent to which he was in business.  In giving him this licence we gave him a valuable property, a property which he can dispose of for cash.  He becomes one of a restricted number engaged in a particular business, knowing that it is the intention of certain other operators in that business to buy out this licence and consequently any success that attended his efforts to exaggerate the extent to which he was in the business by securing the inclusion of weights of lorries which were not used, but which would tend to increase the value of his business for sale purposes, had to be taken into consideration.  It was the function of the Department to see that that did not happen, and to give him only the licence to which he was entitled under the Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will note that the wording of Section 3 is definite.  On the day this Bill passes every one of these licensees has the right to operate a lorry up to two tons capacity.  On application his licence will be amended, but in fact his licence is valid from the date the Bill passes irrespective of the lorry weight stated on it, provided he is operating a lorry up to two tons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will find that there are at least a few cases in which this actually happened.  A man had a 30 cwt. lorry licence under the original Act.  The lorry broke down and he bought a new one and then discovered that the new one was a two-ton lorry and he was notified he could not carry on.  Representations were made to the Department.  They were sympathetically received, but the Department pointed out that the Minister <Col N="279" /> had no power to increase the capacity, whereupon the person concerned was obliged to dispose of the lorry.  In one case the man went to work for someone else, and he was labouring under the belief that he could not again get back to the business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>Our experience in the past has been that the issuing of statements has not helped to clear away the difficulties.  On another occasion in connection with road transport we broadcast statements, put up posters round the country, and inserted advertisements in the newspapers.  In fact, we sent out instructions to the Civic Guards asking them to tell the owners of lorries all about the Act, and six months later we had to amend the Act, extending for 12 months the period in which applications could be made.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, this year, as in former years, asked for suggestions which he said he would be very happy to receive and sympathetically consider.  I would like to draw his attention to a few places in the constituency of County Dublin where a good deal could be done by his Department through the medium of minor relief schemes.  Some of these matters have already been brought to the attention of other Government Departments.  I will first refer to the area about Shankill.  There, numbers of new houses have been built, but the county board of health have not connected them with the main drainage and water supply systems.  The houses are fitted for water and sanitary purposes generally, but there is no water supply available.  The board which helped to build the houses is unable to supply the necessary money to connect the houses with the main drainage and the water supply.  An application was made to the Minister for Local Government and, in reply to questions in the House, he said that if an application for a loan were made by the board of health to his Department he would be only too happy to sanction it.  The Minister for Local Government, and perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary, does not know that the board could not get such a loan.  That in itself would not only give some relief to the vast number of unemployed in that locality but it would be a work of public utility. These are very nice little houses with small gardens attached to them.  The sanitary system is a type of dry closets. The result is that the gardens are used for emptying into them the refuse of those dry closets.  If this continues year after year it is certain that some <Col N="281" /> kind of disease will break out in the locality.  The board of health is hopeless in the matter.  It has not the money available.  This would certainly be a most useful way in which the Parliamentary Secretary could expend some of this local relief fund.  There is another matter to which I wish to refer.  Coming further towards Stillorgan itself you will find that in that village, which is only a very short distance from Donnybrook, there are over 60 per cent. of the people unemployed.  There is plenty of work available for these in the way of development and improvement, not on the main road to Bray, but on the roads off it.  A good deal of employment could be given in clearing the sides of these roads and generally improving them.  The work about which I have already spoken at Shankill and this work at Stillorgan would give employment to all the unemployed there for at least nine months.</P>
      <P>Passing further north I would recommend to the Parliamentary Secretary, as a work of utility and also of ornament, a work which, I am sure, would appeal to his sense of dignity in our township.  Along the river Dodder and by its side for many miles there is a possibility of what could be made a very useful and beautiful work.  The expenditure needed would be a fairly large sum.  A beautiful boulevard could be built from Ringsend to Rathfarnham.  In no vicinity of the city could one find a more beautiful area than this if it were improved and developed in the way I suggest.  It would cost a good deal of money but it would be a work of utility and it would help to add to and show off the already existing beauty of this locality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a final suggestion I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to take into consideration sometime the canal banks in our city.  I take it that the responsibility for these banks and the keeping of them in order is at present on the Corporation.  I know that it is necessary that the tow-path should be kept in a certain rough way, but I know that a good deal of work could be given by the expenditure of a comparatively small sum of money so that <Col N="282" /> the very ugly sights along each of the canal banks could be removed.  I could mention a number of other cases in the County Dublin where work of this kind could be undertaken, but I am afraid that the sums required to be expended would be too large to be brought under this Vote.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to bear these schemes in mind and also to bear in mind that under this Vote what has been given to County Dublin is very small compared with the large taxation collected there and the amount paid in rates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>May I intervene for a moment?  It is for the benefit and assistance of Deputies that I do so.  If a Deputy wants a particular scheme to be considered, the best and most expeditious way of getting consideration for it is to send in the scheme in writing, and it will be considered fully and considered immediately. Deputies will not, in fact, further particular schemes by bringing them forward in this way, because they will take their turn with the existing schemes already suggested.  What I do suggest to Deputies is that out of the new order might come something of that kind.  As the Deputy is aware, the points put forward are simply conventional&mdash;a catalogue of things which could be done in his constituency. That catalogue could be repeated in every constituency.  The one new suggestion was his reference to the canal banks.  If Deputies will concentrate on trying to get things of more general importance rather than detailed works which they want for their own constituencies, I think the debate will be more useful.  I do give the House a definite assurance that the quickest, most effective and most expeditious way of getting any scheme for any constituency examined is to go to the trouble of putting it in writing and sending it in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nally</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few things which I want to bring to the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary. First of all is the number of persons unemployed in South Mayo.  According to the latest returns there are 8,000. I wish to make an appeal to the <Col N="283" /> Minister, and I would be glad if he would tell the House if there is any prospect of starting relief works in South Mayo for the relief of these 8,000 persons.  The works to which I refer are drainage works.  There are quite a number of bogs in that area where drainage is absolutely essential at present.  The position there is that in many of the bogs the turf cannot be cut and taken away through the want of proper drainage.  There is also work awaiting to be done in the matter of the construction of roads into some of those bogs.  Such work would very quickly relieve the existing unemployment there.  The Parliamentary Secretary has asked us not to mention any particular scheme, and for that reason I do not wish to mention any scheme in particular, but in South Mayo there are at least two dozen such schemes which would need to be looked after and which, if put under way, would relieve unemployment in the district to a very considerable extent.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will do something about drainage and about the drainage of the River Robe in particular. The position is, as I have already said, that we have 8,000 people out of employment in South Mayo. These people pay their rates and their annuities.  They are very honest people.  The number out of work will show that the people there are very poor.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary, when allocating money for relief works, will remember South Mayo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Seán Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, I must say that the Parliamentary Secretary has taken very great interest in the matter of relief works, but whether his interest has been in one particular line is doubtful. I know very well that he has done a great deal in the way of construction of roads into turbary and so on. Probably it may not be all his fault that many more public works are not going on.  I am sorry to have to call attention to the number of works needed in my constituency, but I think it will be found that that is general. First of all there is the question of the county boards of health.  I know that <Col N="284" /> the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister for Local Government and Public Health have had some trouble with the Galway Board of Health. Schemes for waterworks and sewerage have been before the Galway Board of Health for some time.  Every one of these schemes was adjourned for six months.  The six months have now expired, but not one of these schemes has as yet been put into operation.  I think a most useful way in the expenditure of money would be by way of waterworks and sewerage works for the small towns and villages of the country. Such schemes could be carried out in the small towns and villages of each county.  The work is very necessary, as can be seen from the returns of the number of fever cases in the different districts and the cost to ratepayers for their maintenance in hospitals.  If such schemes were carried out these outbreaks of fever would be reduced very much.  I should like to give one instance.  In the town of Athenry, from which I come, a waterworks and sewage scheme was carried out about 20 years ago.  Since then the population has increased very much.  Since 1913 a water rate of 5/8 in the £ has been paid in that town.  There are several townlands in that district paying 5/8 in the £ which have neither water nor sewerage.  At the present time we are in the position that we have a water supply for only four or five days in the week.  What is going to be the position there during the summer months?  There are several housing schemes being carried out there at present.  Some of these houses have cost close on £900 each, and there is neither water nor sewerage available for them.  There is a little industry about to be started there, but there is neither water nor sewerage available within a reasonable distance. That applies to several small towns in the country, and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to look into these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also ask that where Government grants are given for the carrying out of waterworks or sewage schemes, or where the board of health, out of the ratepayers' money, carry out such schemes and caretakers are needed to <Col N="285" /> take charge of them, that only qualified men should be put in charge of them.  Recently there was a vacancy for a caretaker for the Loughrea waterworks. The Galway County Council went to great expense in carrying out a new scheme there.  There were three applicants for that position who were examined by a board of qualified men. One of these three men was experienced in this work and passed this board of three qualified men.  The other two men were also examined, with the result that it was found that neither of them had any knowledge of the work.  One of these two men was appointed to the position, and the qualified man was thrown aside. Where there is a large expenditure of money in putting up big plants, certainly a qualified man should be appointed to take charge of the works. The man appointed in this instance was a motor driver, and knew nothing whatever about this scheme in a town with a population of over 2,000.</P>
    <P>In the town of Galway at present there is a good deal of building going on, but even with that amount of building work there are 4,500 unemployed. What will the position there be like within 12 months?  At the present time the only employment the people have there is in the building industry.  That is bound to slow up within the next 12 months, and if something is not done in the meantime the position will be very acute.  I would, therefore, ask the Parliamentary Secretary to look into the schemes put up by the Galway Board of Health for the provision of waterworks and sewerage, and see that attention is given to them.  It is work that is going to last and that will be of benefit to the health of the people.  It will also help the ratepayers by reducing the number of fever cases which have to be maintained in hospitals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the conditions existing in the town of Passage, which I think he knows as well as I do.  No town in Ireland I suppose has had so many ups and downs in latter years as Passage <Col N="286" /> has had.  At one time there was a thriving dockyard there, and afterwards the male population was absorbed by Ford's factory.  At the present time there are a very large number of people idle there.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary will agree with me that it is pitiable to see the number of people who are idle in that town at present. I am not going to ask about any schemes&mdash;let them outline their own schemes&mdash;but I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to do something to give employment in that little town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SydneyBMinch" hpid="Mr. Minch Mr. Minch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has asked Deputies not to put forward any conventional schemes, but to send in suggestions in writing, which will be taken in strict order of priority. The Parliamentary Secretary, I am sure, does not look upon this House as a mere confidence chamber.  The debates here are published in the Official Reports, and Deputies at some time or other want to be able to show that they have advocated claims placed before them by their constituents. Naturally they do not want to forego that right, even to meet the convenience of the Parliamentary Secretary. The Parliamentary Secretary must by now have very considerable experience of relief works.  He has been going around the country for the last two or three years, and, judging by the newspapers, he seems to have visited nearly every part of the Free State.  He seems to enjoy sightseeing in the West of Ireland, and they see more of him there than we do in the Midlands or in the East.  If we are unable to put forward schemes which would meet with his approval, the Parliamentary Secretary himself might be able with all his knowledge to give us some suggestions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with minor relief schemes, I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to remember the huge sums of money that were paid for the Barrow drainage.  I must say that the work has been a great success, and I desire to pay a tribute to the engineers, gangers, workmen, and to the general administration.  However, <Col N="287" /> unless very careful attention is given to the rivers that hinge on the Barrow, all that work will undoubtedly be nullified in the very near future.  If an appeal comes for a relief scheme, especially where unemployment can be relieved, every attention should be given to the question of putting men to work in and around the cachment areas where the Barrow has been drained, so that the good work that has been done there already will not be nullified.  That brings me to the position in the town of Athy, where the drainage of the Barrow was carried out efficiently and flooding relieved. There has been a repercussion from that work on the left bank of the river. About one mile below the town a grave position has been created by sewerage that the river in its old course more or less purified.  To-day that district has become, if not an epidemic area, an endemic area of diphtheria because of the changed situation.  If an appeal for relief work to deal with that menace comes from the town of Athy, I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary should take a careful note and give it his personal attention, so that conditions there may be remedied.  I expect that an appeal will be made at an early date owing to the urgency of the representations made by the local medical officer of health, the chief medical officer of health for the county and by the urban council.  The whole position hinges on the drainage of the Barrow.  If money can be granted for such work, it will add to the magnificent work that was done previously around Athy.</P>

I am Chairman of the Board of Health, which has not neglected social services or adjourned the question of dealing with them.  There are ten members on Galway Board of Health, seven being Fianna Fáil supporters, two belonging to the same Party as Deputy Brodrick, and one independent member.  When questions dealing with sewerage or pumps came up we decided to hold a special meeting of the County Council, so that all Parties would be fully represented, and decide what could be done. Some people wanted to have it both ways.  They wanted to have social services as well as other works.  The people who most strongly opposed the making of sewerage schemes and the sinking of pumps were members of Deputy Brodrick's Party.</P>

They were in charge of the county surveyors, and the manner in which the works have been carried gained the praise of all parties. The principal works carried out consisted of drainage, and the making of bog roads.  There was a very fine <Col N="289" /> return for the money expended.  The work was not done on a political basis. Every party got a fair share of the work.  As mention was made of Athenry, I may say that we have done more for that town in the past three months than was done in the previous ten years.  We reduced the rates and made the charges a county-at-large one.  When Deputy Brodrick says that the Galway Board of Health&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will.  The Deputy has a fair idea about it.  I do not think very much more can be done in Galway except in one end of the county.  I hope that some of Deputy Brodrick's suggestions in that respect will be carried out, and seeing that a certain section are biassed against that particular area, that we will get a grant from the Board of Works to enable us to carry out sewerage schemes that the rate-paying community refused to provide.</P>

      <P>I was rather glad to hear a Galway Deputy express such satisfaction with the work that has been done under this Vote in his constituency, because what struck me about the map down in the hall was that the marks indicating the works were far more prolific around the Midlands than around the Gaeltacht area.</P>

      <P>I would invite Deputy Minch to go down and look at the map. If he cannot get ten marks indicating works in County Longford for every one in Donegal or Kerry over the same area I would be very much surprised. At any rate it is notable that for one reason or another the works in Donegal, Mayo, Galway, West Clare, Kerry and West Cork, as indicated in the map, appear to be rather far apart in comparison with some of the Midland counties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Some Deputy asked why.  I do not know why.  That is exactly what I want to know.  It would certainly appear to me that the necessity for expenditure is at least as great in the Gaeltacht counties as it is in the Midlands.  I have had comparatively few complaints from Co. Kerry, certainly, as to the operation of this Vote, but there is one thing which strikes me on the general aspect of the matter and it is that this is a Vote which presumably we can look forward to having for at least ten, fifteen or twenty years.  It is not an Emergency Vote now by any means, and I think it would be to everybody's benefit&mdash; to the benefit of the Administration as well as of the persons who get employment under it&mdash;if its name were changed.  I think it is now entirely a misnomer to refer to it as relief schemes.  I think if this Vote were put down as a development Vote, or something of that kind, it would be far more proper, and would not have any of the nasty tang that there is about something which is called relief work. I do not know exactly what the limitation is to the size of the work that is being undertaken under this Vote. There would appear to be a limitation of £1,000 indicated under the Board of Works.  Viewing the matter as I do, I think it is a Vote which has come to stay.  Looking at it as a development Vote, it would be a better conception of getting value for money if we did not confine ourselves to small schemes, but took on a large scheme which would be of good public value, and distributed its cost over a period of say eight or nine years, doing the job bit by bit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have cases in mind which have been ruled out because of their cost.  It was said in one case that the particular work would cost £4,000, and because of that cost it was considered entirely outside what would be undertaken under this Vote.  That is so, if we look at the matter as we do at present, and if we must confine ourselves entirely to a couple of hundred pounds jobs, which are all very well in their way&mdash;drainage of bogs and all that sort of thing.  That is all very necessary work, which gives a great deal of employment, and does <Col N="291" /> a great deal of good, but I think we should not restrict ourselves to that. Where we get a sound proposition which has, from every point of view desirable aspects, we should not turn it down because of the fact that the cost runs into some thousands of pounds.  We should be prepared to sanction it from the point of view that we will spend say £500 on it this year and each year following until the job is complete.  There is no harm in mentioning here one of the works which was turned down; I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is familiar with it.  I refer to the Brida Pass road, in the Beaufort-Killarney area.  I understand that the cost of the work was estimated at £4,000, and it was, therefore, ruled out.  There was another scheme ruled out for the same reason, I think, down in the Waterville area, where the embankments along the Inny had burst, and it seemed to be nobody's business to repair them. The reason given to me for the turning down of the work was that the cost would have been too heavy.</P>
    <P>I think if we look at this Vote as a permanent Vote for development purposes we should consider the undertaking of schemes which will cost a good deal more than has been so far sanctioned under this Vote, allotting a certain sum annually until the whole job is completed.  I agree that attempting to undertake work of that kind in one locality or in one financial year would probably be undesirable, because this money has to be distributed as widely as possible.  I think the objection would be met if you sanctioned a job and said &ldquo;here is £400 for this year&rdquo; and allotted a further sum each year until the job is finished.  In that way, some of the suggestions made by Deputy Gearóid O'Sullivan could also be met.  Undoubtedly, it would appeal to any person who lives in Dublin if it were feasible and if money were available to develop some of the canal banks.  That could be undertaken in the way I suggest, if the work is done piecemeal rather than expending a large amount in any one year.  I think the test should be the value of the job when done, <Col N="292" /> and that a job should not be ruled out because the cost is too much to be undertaken in any one year.  The test should be the public utility.  When the proposed work has passed that test, I think it should be sanctioned as far as possible in its order of necessity and utility, and that if necessary the cost should be distributed over a number of years.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary when we may hope to get the report of the Inter-departmental Committee.  There is a growing feeling in my area that if a main drainage scheme were carried out that main drainage scheme might not give the usual employment, but that minor drainage schemes would give a much better return in the areas.  I am glad to be able to tell the House that there is a feeling among the unemployed there that they would prefer to be working rather than drawing unemployment assistance.  If this Departmental scheme were submitted to us we could look with more hope to getting a better return for the money spent on minor relief schemes.  I should be very glad if the Parliamentary Secretary would say when the report will be available.</P>

      <P>In case the Parliamentary Secretary may form the impression that members of the Labour Party acquiesce in the wage suggested by him, I may remind him that I have here annually protested against 24/- per week for men doing work under relief schemes.  They are working longer hours than men engaged on work under public bodies, and I do hope that the Parliamentary Secretary, for this year at least, will be the first to carry out the new policy which we have heard enunciated&mdash;that there is going to be legislation brought in providing for a week's holidays for men on certain work.  I have put it up to the Parliamentary Secretary on previous occasions that while at one time I was not prepared to prevent men from working for 24/- a week because they were in receipt of only a small allowance from home help, I should prefer to see the Parliamentary Secretary or the Government adopting a shorter-hour <Col N="293" /> week for the same rate of wages. I am protesting against the small rate of wages paid on the relief schemes.  The Minister for Finance announced in his Budget that he was anxious to get schemes for the development of tourist roads and that he was prepared to give grants and sanction loans to public bodies to make new roads connecting tourist centres.  I am sorry to say that the scheme put up by the County Council of Wicklow to connect West Wicklow with East Wicklow&mdash;a tourist centre&mdash;did not meet with the approval of the road authority, although the county council were prepared to pay their share of the cost.  I do not know if the Department of the Parliamentary Secretary is responsible, but one of the road departments has refused to sanction that proposal for a road to connect East Wicklow with West Wicklow.  We also put up a scheme for the making of a sea road from the Silver Strand into Arklow.  A number of men in the rural areas could be employed on that work in the winter time&mdash;men who have no other employment. The public bodies concerned were prepared, if they received a grant from the Relief Vote, to put up their share of the cost so as to give employment, as well as do a very useful work. A small grant was given by the Parliamentary Secretary for coast protection. As everybody knows, there is a good deal of coast erosion in Wicklow. I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to pay a visit to that place and see the work done&mdash;work which has withstood the storms and the northeast and south-east winds up to the present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>A large amount of valuable property was protected at small cost and, if a larger grant was given coming on to next autumn, a number of men could be usefully employed.  In the work of coast protection 75 per cent. of the expenditure is represented by labour.  The sand required is obtainable at hand.  In connection with harbours, the rates in Arklow are <Col N="294" /> very high and the result has been that the people of the town are unable to meet the cost of improving their harbour.  Some assistance should be given by way of special grant for that work.  The Parliamentary Secretary's Department will not give loans or grants&mdash;I may as well work this in now, because I was prevented doing so on the last occasion&mdash;where areas are unable to pay, or have not paid, instalments due.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should evolve a scheme similar to that which has been applied in the case of the farmers, and extend the periods of repayment, because people in the towns are paying back to the Board of Works loans obtained by their predecessors 40 or 50 years ago.  Not alone have they to do that, but they are, in some cases, paying penal interest, while the rates are 20/- or 22/- in the £.  Special consideration should be given, therefore, to the town dwellers.  Some of the bodies are paying up the old arrears, but the whip hand is being used by the Parliamentary Secretary in other cases, and if harbour boards, or other authorities, do not pay, they do not receive any grants.  Some scheme will have to be devised by the Executive Council to give assistance to the town ratepayers.</P>

I ask the Labour Party to take stronger action in connection with the <Col N="295" /> small wages being paid to the road workers.  These wages may appear all right in the Midlands, where farmers' sons are employed.  I notice that Deputy Victory has no complaint whatever to make.

I know several Deputies who do not go to the Board of Works at all and yet their areas get a fair share of the grants.  I do not think that I myself have been twice in the Board of Works.  I leave that to the officials and to the councils, who are the best judges as to where the money should be spent.  At the same time, I congratulate Deputy Victory on getting the largest share for his area.  As the midlands received the larger share of the grants out of this £350,000, I hope that the south-east coast will not be forgotten next time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The area which Deputy Moore, Deputy The O'Mahoney and I represent is one that requires special treatment. The people there have not engaged in a no-rate campaign.  They are paying their rates and they ask the Parliamentary Secretary to assist them.  They are not asking for wholesale free grants; they are prepared to make contributions themselves, if they get a proportion of the money, to develop the county for the benefit of the Government as well as of everybody else, because they are relieving unemployment by so doing.  If I did not protest against this wage of 24/- as I have done year after year, the Parliamentary Secretary might think that I was converted to his view.  I want to let him know that I am protesting and I hope that the Labour Party and other Deputies will take the matter up very soon and prevent, if necessary, a man working for 24/- a week.  I can guarantee that if I organised the men in my area the <Col N="296" /> Parliamentary Secretary would get very few men at 24/- per week.  They could get unemployment assistance or home help instead of working a 60 hour week at 24/- for the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

      <P>Deputy Nally raised the question of the Robe in Mayo, which he has already been assured is having the closest attention.  We hope to have work commenced there soon.  He also alluded to the fact that there are 8,000 registered unemployed in the area. More than two-thirds of these people are people with means.  They are not unemployed persons in the sense in which the phrase &ldquo;unemployed persons&rdquo; was previously used.  A good many of them are small farmers, but Mayo is one of the poor counties and that is illustrated by the fact that it is getting £21,000 out of the total for this year.  One Deputy mentioned that he does not come very often to worry me and yet discovers that his area gets its share of the grants.  The House may take it that the amount of worrying given to the Parliamentary Secretary by any Deputy has no relation whatever to the amount that goes into his area.  We use the Deputies and their personal knowledge for the purpose of learning more than we may happen to know about the incidence of poverty or distress in particular areas in their constituencies. The money is distributed, as far as is humanly possible, upon the basis of the most exact knowledge we can get of what is a fair distribution of it relative to the necessities of all the districts concerned.  I think that the House accepts that as the fact.  If that were not so, I would not have the impudence or the cheek to give you the amount of <Col N="297" /> information which is given in relation to the distribution of relief and which has never been given before.  In saying that, I do not want to seem to criticise those Deputies who have put forward proposals based upon that map.  I have used the figures I have given in order to put it into perspective, but I am asking the Deputies to go over that map and they may find that we have left out certain areas.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Especially in the Deputy's constituency, I suppose!  We took out all the electoral areas in the Free State and analysed them as carefully as we could with all the information at our disposal in order to see what proportion of a total grant of £100,000 should, in justice, go to each of these areas.  From that we made out a schedule allocating the money, but although we had in our possession some 9,000 schemes, sent in by different Deputies, there were literally dozens of poor areas in which there was no scheme and where we had to go down ourselves and find out a scheme.  It is for that reason that I am saying to the Deputies in the House that I will value their expert examination and constructive criticism of that map to enable us to do better than we have done in the past.</P>
      <P>From the map Deputies can see the general contour.  They will see that there is a dark and a light area, and as it goes from dark to light you go from poverty to comparative agricultural prosperity.  It is a map showing the agricultural valuation, on Griffith's valuation, that is to say, on a tillage policy valuation per head of the agricultural population.  Deputies may take it that when we come to distribute money, we try to distribute it in relation to such maps and such other information of a similar nature as is at our disposal.</P>

      <P>Passage West is a very poor area.  On this map we have analysed the different counties and local areas and Passage comes out as one of the poorest urban areas in the whole of the Free State.  We did give Passage a grant last year and we will try to give it grants in other years, but it will have to be done with regard to the fact that there are other claimants.  In this Vote we are not here to distribute an unlimited amount of money.  Deputies should bear that in mind.  We are here to examine to what degree we have efficiently and fairly distributed a limited sum of money, and that limited sum of money has to be distributed in the light of the fact that there were 142,000 registered unemployed, that there were 97,000 people who had a legal qualification under the Unemployment Assistance Act to say that they had a standard of living lower than a certain standard of living.  The House may take it, without any hesitation whatever, that that is as detailed, full and honest examination of the figures, in their territorial distribution, as we could get, and that the money was divided in that way so far as our information was available.  I think there are only about five small towns in the Saorstát at present which would be anywhere on a level with Passage West, and they will all have consideration on their merits.</P>

    <P>Deputy Minch raised the question of the Barrow.  I did appeal to Deputies not to raise particular questions unless they contained some general principle.

      <P>The Deputy can choose for himself.  The House will understand. Deputy Lynch raised a question of a kind that I think is very valuable in such discussion as this.  I agree with him that the time has come to change the name of this Vote from a Relief Vote to some other name.  We have changed the name of the Section which deals with it, from Relief Section to Special Works Division, and I agree that it might improve the position.  It might make for a clearer understanding of what the purpose of the Vote is, if the name were changed in that way. The real problem in Ireland, as Deputy Lynch will know in relation to his own area, is not sporadic, occasional, and cyclical poverty at all; it is endemic.  It is the poverty represented by the dark portions of that map, the poverty represented by the fact that the people are crowded on the bad lands and crowded in the places in <Col N="300" /> which economic life is extremely difficult.  Most of the relief money which goes into Gaeltacht areas goes quite independent of anything in the nature of what would ordinarily be called unemployment.  It goes mostly to people who, before special registration was introduced by this Government, were never regarded as employed people at all.  It goes very largely to poor farmers of the small farmer and cottier class, and I agree that perhaps it would be better to find another title and I shall consider the suggestion which the Deputy made.</P>
      <P>The Deputy suggested that we should take up the case of schemes of £4,000 and try to do instalments each year. Again, it is a question of the total amount of money in your possession.  If we were dealing with a £2,000,000 Vote and dealing with a £500,000 vote per annum then the maximum size of the schemes which can be tackled varies with that maximum amount.  For instance, in an area in which the allocation of money, relatively to other areas, would only be £100, it would be absurd to start a £4,000 scheme on the basis that we would do it in 40 years.  Would the Deputy take the standard we are working on?  We tackle a work which we may finish in two or three years.  If, for instance, we have in any particular area a scheme which costs £300&mdash; that we consider it is better than any other scheme and that the allocation for that district is £100&mdash; then we will spend £100 this year, £100 next year and £100 the year after. I think the Deputy himself will agree with me that one could not fit into any scheme of reasonable distribution the taking up of schemes of the nature of £4,000 in areas in which the annual contribution from the Relief Vote would be only a couple of hundred pounds.  As far as we can do it, we are attempting to do works in a continuing process from year to year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Everett spoke of coast erosion in Wicklow.  Coast erosion in Wicklow has a very long history. Brains, hope, effort and money have been wasted in the past in the attempts to solve that problem. <Col N="301" /> Structures that have been put up to stop the tide have been removed, without any hesitation by the tide.  The scheme which was tried in Wicklow was a well-designed scheme.  We are satisfied that up to the present it has been on a sound basis.  We put up, I think, about £500 originally for what one might call an experimental trial of it, but I cannot for a moment accept it that it is the business of a relief grant to complete work of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt they did, but this scheme as far as I can see will cost about £10,000.  While we are prepared to make experiments to prove the soundness of the scheme by a contribution of £500 in a particular year we certainly are not prepared to take anything like the major responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>So long as we are on those terms we would regard the work done at Wicklow as being useful work and work towards which we intend to contribute.  The Deputy also raised the question of Arklow harbour.  It is one of half a dozen sand problem harbours that we are dealing with at the moment.  They are very difficult harbours.  We are not at all satisfied that any money that could reasonably be spent in Arklow at the present moment would not be completely wasted money.  We are perfectly certain that expenditure on some of the works that have been proposed, and that have been strongly advocated, would be a complete waste of money.  There have been suggestions to build an extention of jetties and so on in places in which we know that it is absolutely certain that if you built a jetty you could not get either water or a ship to it.  The Deputy can take it that the problem of Arklow is under careful technical investigation.  The difficulty in all those cases is this, that you can lay out schemes that will deal with what you might call the steady trend and movement of the sand. You can work out a problem <Col N="302" /> and say that by the expenditure of a certain sum you can put up a breakwater which, for a period of five or seven years, will leave the harbour free, having regard to the purely normal movement of the sand, but then one night's gale from the wrong direction and the whole place is silted up no matter what you do.

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £22,757 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1936, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for this Vote is practically the same as that for last year.  There is a reduction of £574 in salaries of headquarters staff which is due mainly to the filling of vacancies by officers at lower salaries.  Against this the sum of £100 has been provided as a rough estimate of the cost of professional assistance in drafting Rules of Court under the Workmen's Compensation Act of 1934.  There is the regular increase to cover increments of salary.  Ministerial control of the various services of the Department of Justice, including police, prisons, court officers and so forth, is exercised through the staff for which provision is made in this Vote.  The District Court branch, which is shown separately, controls the work of District Court clerks throughout the country and checks the receipts of fines paid in the District Courts, the Circuits Courts and High Courts.  These amounted to about £9,000 last year.  In addition, a sum of approximately £1,485 was transferred to the Exchequer in respect of fees received in cash from the Dublin Metropolitan District Court.</P>
    <P>The Accounts Branch, also shown separately in the Estimate, is responsible for the payment of salaries and expenses of the Gárda Síochána, the prisons, District and Circuit Court staffs, Land Registry and Registry of Deeds and the Supreme Court and High Court of Justice.  All the accounts work connected with the activities of the Department is performed by this branch.  The only staff provided for outside Dublin is in the immigration office at Cobh.  A fulltime officer is required there to carry out the provisions of the Aliens Order, 1925, made under the Aliens (Restriction) Acts, 1914 to 1919.  He is assisted <Col N="305" /> by a part-time assistant with an inclusive allowance of £100 per annum in addition to the salary he receives from Vote 35 as District Court clerk.</P>
    <P>In addition to the provision of £1,627 under sub-head A (2) for the Film Censor's Office, expenditure in connection with this service is estimated to amount to £508, as shown in note (n) on page 110 of the Estimate.  Fees received in stamps, that is, the fees charged for film censorship, are, however, estimated to amount to £2,500, so that allowing for overhead charges, such as the time of staffs of various departments occupied with film censorship and the provision for insurance of films and machinery and consequential damage and so forth, the service is, in fact, self-supporting.  It has not been found necessary to increase the scale of fees since the introduction of machinery for the censorship of sound films.</P>
    <P>The items of expenditure provided for in sub-heads (b), (c) and (d) are self explanatory and do not call for any comment, except the increase of £97 in sub-head D which is due to the increase in a number of extensions in Government buildings, and particularly of the Gárda Síochána Accounts Branch.</P>

      <P>That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
      <P>We discussed a Supplementary Estimate for the Gárda Síochána on 13th March last.  A number of matters that mark the unsatisfactory administration of the Gárda Síochána were dealt with then and it was suggested that the matter would be dealt with at greater length when the Estimate for the Department was being dealt with here.  The Minister tells us that there is practically no increase in the Gárda Estimate this year as compared with last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the reason I move that the Minister's Estimate be referred back is that the moneys estimated for the Gárda Síochána are mounting every year and that, nevertheless, we seem to have nothing but increased turmoil in the country, an increasing number of undetected crimes, and particularly crimes where arms are concerned, and no attempt made by the Ministry to pursue this question of arms or to recover arms unauthorisedly held in the country, although they were very systematic and determined and sweeping, a couple of years ago, in taking up arms from people who had had certificates from the police authorising them to have arms.</P>
      <P>I drew the attention of the House, when we were dealing with the Supplementary Estimate, to the fact that the many spokesman of the Fianna Fáil Party, before they came into office, had pointed out the very high cost of the Army and of the Gárda Síochána, and indicated time after time that it would be possible to bring about a substantial reduction in the cost of both these forces.  I just gave one sample of these statements as epitomising the whole Fianna Fáil outlook.  That was the statement of the President at Ennis, as reported in the <i>Clare Champion</i> of 26th December, 1931, when, after dealing with the Army, he said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The cost of the Army could be reduced by £500,000, and the police, a lot of whose work was of a political character at present, could also be reduced and another £500,000 saved.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was in December, 1931.  The figures provided in the Estimates this year show that the actual expenditure on the Gárda for the year 1931-32 was £1,630,672.  In spite of the opinion expressed by the President and other members of the Party that that Vote could be reduced by £500,000, there was nevertheless an additional £32,000 spent in the first year of the Minister's office. The next year there was a sum of £75,000 more spent.  The amount of the Estimates for 1934-35 over the expenditure for 1931-32 was £146,000 and, this <Col N="307" /> year, the Estimate is £217,000 over the 1931-32 figure.  We have this increase year after year, jumping this year by £70,000, as the performances of the Ministry as compared with its promises and, as I say, we have nothing but increased turmoil and untraced crime from one end of the country to the other.  It is due to the country as a whole that the Minister should go more explicitly and in more detail into some explanation of the manifestations of police failure that exists throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister says the police have a difficult job and that they are trying to do it impartially.  I have no doubt at all that the very vast bulk of the rank and file and of the officers of the Gárda Síochána are endeavouring to do their work, but the force has been interfered with in all kinds of ways, and the force does not seem to be getting a chance. Take the position we have here in the City of Dublin.  On Easter Sunday, what the Government Party considered was a big national commemoration, was arranged.  The President attended in state at Portobello Barracks.  He arranged to travel in state from Portobello Barracks to the General Post Office where he was to unveil a monument to the 1916 men.  Arranging to travel in state from Portobello Barracks to the General Post Office for that purpose, he travelled by an unannounced route and, you might say, from the back gate of Portobello Barracks through all the back streets he could find, off the main thoroughfares of the city, down to the General Post Office.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to know from the Minister for Justice what was responsible for the President, on a formal and an official occasion, and travelling with all the entourage of State from an official ceremony in one of our principal barracks to a big national gesture, in the heart of the city&mdash;what are the circumstances which brought about the fact that he travelled by an unannounced route through the back streets of the City of Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The people of the country have set up institutions here which would warrant that the President of the Executive Council would be able to travel in the capital through any street in which he wanted to go. Those who are anxious for the dignity, the peace and the standing of our people and our country are entitled to know what are the reasons which prevented the President of the country travelling through the main streets of the city in a proper and dignified way when he was carrying out a high State function.  I want to know is the police force of the City of Dublin, the rank and file, in such a condition that they cannot assure to the President a dignified passage through our principal streets.  I doubt whether the Minister for Justice can say that is so.  If we know anything of the police in the city, they can and could secure that.  Was it the high police authorities of the city who, for one reason or another, advised the Minister that the President should travel through the back streets, or was it the Executive Council, the Minister for Justice or his colleagues, who decided to pursue that undignified course?  Will he tell the House why there seems to have been a disgraceful and a lamentable failure on the part of <Col N="309" /> the Executive Council to realise their responsibilities on Sunday last?  I am sure that otherwise they would not have allowed such an action to take place.</P>
      <P>The Minister must be aware that such forces of disorder as there are in the city can be nothing but encouraged to pursue aggression and to pursue disorderly lines when the President of the State and the police and the Army have to move out of their way and to pass through the back streets.  Will the Minister say who was responsible for that performance on Sunday and, if he was advised by the higher police authorities, on police intelligence, that there were reasons why the President should not pass through the principal streets of the city, will he tell us what these reasons were?  If such a condition of affairs from the point of view of disorderly bodies exists in this city that the President cannot pass in a dignified and orderly fashion through the principal streets, then the citizens ought to be made aware of their danger. If there is no danger, will the Minister tell us what other explanation there is, because the pursuit of conduct like that on the part of the President and his Ministers can bring nothing but disorder and destruction some time later on here in the city.  There was supposed to be a big national commemoration at the General Post Office. The citizens of the city were not allowed into the precincts of the General Post Office on Sunday.  There was a march past of military outside the General Post Office.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>What dictated that the citizens of Dublin could not take their places on the side walks of O'Connell Street, say, from Abbey Street to <Col N="310" /> Earl Street?  What were the reasons for it?  That is a thing on which we would like to have an explanation.  If we are paying increasing moneys yearly for the upkeep of a police force here we want to know, as the people whose money is being spent, what all this means.  On the other hand, as people who tried to set up a State here and to make it a State worthy of the Irish people and capable of protecting them against dangers internal and external, we want to see its institutions administered in a way that will not invite destruction and disorder.</P>
      <P>There have been other incidents in the City of Dublin that indicate that there are these forces of disorder.  To what extent the police are responsible for that, we do not know.  We do know that the Ministry of Justice was advised by certain cinema proprietors that they had been threatened by certain people in the city and told that they were not to show the cinema picture of the Royal wedding recently, and that in spite of the fact that the Minister had been forewarned it was possible for a crowd of disorderly people to enter the Savoy Theatre here and wreck a considerable amount of property and prevent the showing of the picture.  I believe that the police could have prevented that.  I would like to ask the Minister, when we are providing money for the police force, whether it was the police force that failed on that occasion, the rank and file of the police, whether it was high police officers in the city, or whether it was his Department.  We have seen that police officers on duty on a recent Saturday night could be shot at in Grafton Street, could be shot at outside the offices of the <i>Irish Press</i>, within ear-shot of armed detectives, and no one could ever be traced or charged in any way with these offences except people who were not there at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At any rate we know that there are forces of disorder in the State.  We know that the police have failed to deal with them.  We know in some cases it was the fault of the police but in other cases we can hardly blame the police without further information.  But what we are convinced about is that <Col N="311" /> there are sufficient forces of disorder in this country armed or unarmed to prevent the President of this State and his Minister going about their official duties in the most dignified and orderly way.  We ask the Minister for Justice, who is asking us to pass this Vote of nearly £2,000,000 for the Gárda, to say that the police are responsible for that. I do not believe that they are.  I believe that either on the high police officers or the Executive Council itself lies responsibility for this state of affairs. There is no doubt a certain amount of demoralisation has set in amongst the police.  We saw a certain class of demoralisation ourselves when the police were British forces here.  There was the type of policeman who when he saw very prominent Irish activists passing around the street would say &ldquo;Good morning boys.&rdquo;  That was understandable.</P>
    <P>There was the type of demoralisation that came later when the scum of the English cities and towns were sent in amongst the police in the guise of Black and Tans.  We have that type of demoralisation amongst the police in some parts of this country for the reason that the police force within the last year or two was diluted by the introduction into the force of people who were not of the kind that ought to be in the police force.  They were put into the force nearly two years ago on the excuse and by reason of the scare that this institution here was to be attacked by Blueshirts.  There was a fire started in the engine room here and that was the germ of the bright idea that enabled the Ministry to dilute the police force with a certain class of person that they thought would be useful.  It is commonly stated now that the Minister is clearing out some of these persons, but their presence in the force since they were brought into it has shaken the morale of the Gárda.</P>
    <P>We have had also another type taken into the force, a type that is used in a provocative sort of way.  I have had occasion to complain of the presence at a sale of seized farmers' cattle in Tipperary of a person in the garb of a <Col N="312" /> detective who was a Fianna Fáil candidate for Parliamentary honours in the very county in which the unfortunate farmer whose cattle were being seized was residing.  If it were necessary in pursuit of the law or in the carrying out of the administration to make seizures from farmers in the County Waterford who, for one reason or another, had not paid their land annuities or who had not paid their rates, it was a most disorderly and provocative act on the part of the police authorities to put prominently on duty in the sale of these cattle the man who a few months before had promised these same farmers, to say the least of it, very substantial increases in their income if he were returned.</P>
    <P>But you have another type of demoralisation brought about amongst the police force and that is the demoralisation brought about by political interference by the Minister at the dictation of Fianna Fáil clubs. There are parishes in different parts of the country where sergeants have been changed simply because they were carrying out their duty in an impartial and strictly fair police way.  The Minister said when I referred to these matters that he did not know to what I was referring.  That was on a previous occasion when I spoke of the superintendent being taken away from Longford at the dictation of the Fianna Fáil clubs in that area.  The Minister knows well that as a result of such dictation by member of the Fianna Fáil clubs he removed from Longford a police officer who, if he had been left there, might have prevented the development of a situation which has resulted in the murder of Mr. More-O'Ferrall.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesVictory" hpid="Mr. Victory Mr. Victory">

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be satisfied to start with Longford, because it would be worth having an inquiry into the administration of the police force in that area.  The Minister did not understand the references that were being made in regard to the change of the Superintendent in Longford. The Minister knows that the man whom Fianna Fáil dictation drove out of that area might have prevented the culmination of the Edgeworthstown crime, and he knows that that man who was removed from Longford had to be brought back to help in the solution of the problem of that crime. I put that case up to the Minister. This is only a sample of the type of interference that has demoralised the police force in different parts of the country.  The Minister makes a brave show here to say that they are carrying out a particular policy and that the police are acting in an impartial way. But I suppose there is hardly a police area in the country that would not give the lie to the Minister in that. The Minister may be changing now under pressure of the situation that he brought upon himself and that he has brought upon the country.  His action as Minister is amongst the things that have brought about that particular matter.  This state of affairs had been brought about because the Minister pursued the policy with which he started, the policy which he announced himself when he asked his followers to get &ldquo;that accursed crowd out of his way.&rdquo;  That is, to get the political opponents of the Government out of his way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of police administration and of the administration of justice that might be referred to.  On Easter Sunday the Minister allowed a collection to be carried out here in the streets of Dublin and in different parts of the country without the permit required by the police.  He allowed that collection to be carried out for a purpose which at any rate his own Party organ has stated was partly for purchasing arms for an illegal body in this country.  That <Col N="314" /> illegal body claims the right to use arms.  Will the Minister explain to us why he asks this House to vote year after year money for the support of the police force in this country and why he has allowed money to be solicited publicly in the streets of Dublin and other parts of the country for the purchase of arms which the Minister knows and which the Minister's Party organ, in cold print, admitted is going partly to be devoted to the purchase of arms which are to be be kept in an illegal way and to be used against this State?  Will the Minister further say why his Department, or at any rate the Executive Council, who keep such an eye on the Press, allows the Fianna Fáil Party organ to publish an advertisement, illustrated in the most modern way, soliciting funds for that organisation&mdash; funds which are to be used partly for the purchase of arms to be held illegally and to be used illegally&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Was that in the advertisement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It was in the editorial in the <i>Irish Press</i> and that editorial was written the day before the advertisement was put in.  If Deputy Donnelly is serious as regards his duty as a member of this House he will join me in asking the Minister whether it is the Minister for Justice himself or whether it is the police who are the delinquents in not following up that very grave breach of the law.  Men are charged before the Military Tribunal with sedition and with not answering questions and the Ministerial Press prints advertisements of a collection for the purpose of purchasing arms for their organisation.  The Minister surely must know that toleration of that kind of conduct by the police or by the Minister and his colleagues is breeding forces of disorder, and armed forces of disorder, in this country.</P>

    <P>The Minister is failing in another way.  As I say, there are cases being dealt with before the Military Tribunal at present and the charges are that the men did not answer questions or that <Col N="315" /> they were guilty of sedition four months ago.  But charges dealing with the most important thing that affects the peace and order of this country are being completely ignored&mdash;that they are openly proclaiming that they are purchasing and keeping arms and are training and are prepared to use arms against a Government in this country. That may be a charge leviable against the Attorney-General but I do not care to direct it against him.  If the Attorney-General is the person responsible for not pursuing charges of that kind, I blame the Minister for Justice for not having him sacked.  I ask the Minister for Justice whether he is the person responsible for pursuing trivial charges against certain people when graver charges lie to be pursued or whether it is the police who are failing to take the action that falls upon them when they ignore serious crimes.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been questioned here from time to time with regard to various offences committed from one end of the country to another by armed and masked men mostly at night.  We will take the Co. Kerry. Replying some time in February to certain questions, the Minister told us that an armed and masked raid on a Volunteer's house in Beaufort, Killarney, which took place on the 15th January last, had not been so followed up by the police that they were able to find who was responsible for it; that an armed and masked raid took place on a <i>Cork Examiner</i> van at Caherlaheen in September, and that the police have not been able to follow up that successfully; that an armed and masked robbery at Lyreacrompane Post Office in November had not been pursued by the police; that the exploding of bombs on the 14th December at Ballymullan Barracks, Tralee, had not been pursued by the police successfully; that an armed and masked raid on Mr. Murphy's house at Bedford, Listowel, in July last had not been successfully pursued by the police; that a number of houses were raided in Listowel area in June last by armed and masked men, and that that had not been successfully pursued by the police.  All these took place in County Kerry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="316" /> I should like to ask the Minister whether the order that the President of the Executive Council referred to some months ago that dumps of arms held by certain classes in this country were not to be sought out or searched for still exists, and does that apply to arms held by persons who are suspected of being, say, in comparatively recent months, Fianna Fáil supporters; whether the order applies to arms held by these men even though they have been used in connection with crimes, because the large number of occasions upon which armed and masked raids have been made, and persons injured and property destroyed, indicates that it is hardly entirely police failure to follow up these that is responsible. We do know that the President has enunciated that that was the policy of the Fianna Fáil Government and that they were pursuing that policy for definite reasons.  Does that policy still hold, and if it holds with regard to dumps, does it hold with regard to arms held by different people here and there in nearly every county?  If it does, what is the meaning of the policy being pursued by the Minister in bringing certain classes of people before the Military Tribunal on petty charges?</P>
    <P>I also have to complain of the partiality of the police in certain districts in pursuing offenders of one kind or another.  It was possible in January last for a young fellow to be found with a revolver at the fairgreen, Midleton, to be taken to the Gárda barracks and, because he was the son of a Fianna Fáil supporter, the local superintendent passed over the charge and took no notice of it.  It was possible for a telegraph pole to be cut in the Ballylanders area and Blueshirts interrogated about the cutting of it. It was possible, after all that, for all interrogations to be dropped when it was found that a Fianna Fáil supporter was responsible for it.  On the other hand, in a case I brought to the Minister's notice of the Carrolls of Bruree, a funeral of a member of the family was invaded and these persons were arrested in the grounds of the church and taken away from the <Col N="317" /> funeral, although know to be persons of exemplary character.  The funeral had to proceed without them while they were detained at the local barracks and a phone message sent to Limerick.  Then they were released on the understanding that they should report to Limerick that night.  They were detained there for 24 hours, although the police must have known that they could have nothing to do with the cutting of certain wires.  As I said before, all the local information was that it was supporters of the Minister locally who cut the wires that these men were said to be suspected of cutting; and they were cut by the Minister's supporters for the purpose of blackening the reputation of the political opponents of the Minister in that area.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate they are as black as the Minister or the Deputies could make them.  The Deputy was one of the persons who, on his own doorstep, as it were, was exhorted by the Minister in the early flush of his official office, to get the accursed crowd out of the way; and nothing has been left undone by the Deputy's supporters, or by such of their supporters as they have been able to squeeze into the police, so to blacken the reputation of their political opponents, that they might be tempted to hide their blackened faces. It would take more than the lying attacks, either of the followers of the Deputy or the Minister, or the more subtle insinuations that it is possible for the Minister to operate against political opponents, through some members of the force, to get the political opponents of the policy pursued in this country to hide their faces. Their faces are too used to the breeze. In connection with the Kilfinane area, I ask the Minister again, why it was possible for a whole string of events to take place in that area, and no endeavour to protect the unfortunate people from being subjected to these attacks.  On the 13th March, as <Col N="318" /> reported in the Parliamentary Debates, column 708, I said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I asked the Minister on the 27th of February whether he was aware that on the 30th of September last a body of armed men opened fire on the hall at Kilfinane during the progress of a dance; that on the 1st November last Patrick Creed's house was fired into; that on the 20th of January a body of men drilled publicly at Ballinlina, Kilfinane, carrying arms and firing rifle shots; that recently the houses of Mrs. Condon, Ballinanama; Miss Hayes, Ardpatrick; the Ardpatrick co-operative creamery and the Darragh creamery were broken into and robbed, and if it were a fact that in none of these cases had the persons guilty of the offence been charged by the police. The Minister for Agriculture, speaking for the Minister for Justice, said that in all these cases in which an offence had been committed in that area, he was satisfied that the police had done, and would continue to do, everything possible to make the culprits amenable.  In reply to a supplementary question, the Minister excused the police by saying that they were having a difficult time, that they were not idle, and that they had arrested 40 members of the League of Youth.  The Minister is driven to that type of statement to excuse the failure of the police to do their duty.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we have a vicious series of attacks made on people and property in that neighbourhood, and the Minister for Agriculture glibly answering, in the absence of the Minister for Justice, says that he was quite sure the police had done everything; that they were very busy, and had arrested 40 members of the League of Youth.  I asked the Minister with regard to another case that happened on the 27th of November last.  I said that at 2 o'clock in the morning the house of Mr. Barry in West Cork was &ldquo;knocked-up&rdquo;; that when the woman of the house went to the window a revolver was pointed at her, and a demand made that the door should be opened or that she <Col N="319" /> would be shot.  The door was not opened.  The raiders entered through a window and went to the bedroom, where they threatened to shoot the man.  They took him outside, threatened to shoot him, and then allowed him back to the house.  The following morning information were sworn against the parties who carried out that outrage.  Informations were sworn against two persons definitely, and further information was given with regard to others.  Did anything happen? Nothing happened for six weeks. Then there was an identification parade and three other persons were identified. Did anything happen then?  Nothing happened for another six weeks.  I do not know what happened since.  I do not believe anything has happened since.  The last thing I saw about it was that the case was before the District Court and was not gone on with at that court.  Whoever was dealing with the case&mdash;the Attorney-General or the police&mdash;asked to have it adjourned. Will the Minister say if it was the police were responsible for the delay during the first six weeks, or for the delay during the second six weeks?  If not, what instructions from the Minister existed that made it possible for nothing to happen regarding an occurrence that took place on 27th November last, about which the police had sworn information against two persons the following day?  Is it not an astounding state of affairs that a Ministry which was to reduce the police force, instead of reducing it, has increased it every year since they came into office.</P>
    <P>There was a charge brought later in February on the Supplementary Estimate to which there was no answer. At that time the Attorney-General seemed to suggest that there was.  I do not know what answer the Minister for Justice has to it.  Is it the police were responsible?  If so, what has happened to the police who were responsible?  What are the instructions that the police got to enable a happening like that to pass?  The Minister seemed to suggest in the reply he gave on the Supplementary Estimate, that the reason for the increase in the <Col N="320" /> Gárda Síochána Estimate is that the campaign against the payment of land annuities had not yet ceased.  As an ordinary person who reads the newspapers there are three things that may make it necessary for the Minister for Justice to have an increased police force.  Take the people he is most found of blaming&mdash;(1) the League of Youth, (2) the indignant farmers, and (3) the I.R.A., in which we can include Communists and every other category.  Will the Minister tell the House if he thinks these are the three bodies that make it necessary for him to inflate the police force?  Will he give the House an account, from his point of view, of the developments that have taken place on the League of Youth side; on the indignant farmers' side, and on the I.R.A. side, that have made these increased demands necessary?  We could very easily take up these headings to examine whether the Minister would be right or not in apportioning the blame for increased expenditure under one or all of them.  The Minister should do so.  He should have done it when introducing the Estimate.  We deny that the development of the League of Youth is in any way a cause for increased police activities.  The Minister's own policy developed the necessity for a spirit to arise amongst young and old in this country that they would show they were going to exercise their constitutional rights to meet in public, and to discuss public affairs in an orderly way.  It was the Minister's own policy and the policy of Deputy Cleary and others that made it necessary for the people of this country to show that they had that spirit in them. The spirit is what matters.  I was present when we saw one of the first examples of that spirit.  The President and the Fianna Fáil Minister can proceed to their meetings with horsemen and marching men&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>And when he gets down to a good old town with sound Republican traditions, like Enniscorthy, he can be driven to his meeting in an open carriage, with footmen wearing tall hats.  He can have all that.  I was present when some other people <Col N="321" /> of the country thought they could march to a meeting, but they were approached by the Superintendent of the police, who said he did not think it would be advisable.  It was obvious that there was a big hostile crowd of about 250 marching around the place, anxious to get into conflict with some other body like it.  I quite agreed with the Superintendent that what we wanted was a meeting, and that there was no necessity to form fours, stick out our chests and march to the meeting. All we wanted was to have our meeting there.  We did not march to the meeting; we went to our meeting, but the followers of the Deputies on the far side were not going to be baulked of their prey, and they marched down on the meeting.  If the handful of police had not been assisted they would have got as rough and brutal a treatment as some of the members of the meeting would have got.  That, you might say, was the beginning of the Minister's downright antagonism to what we now call the League of Youth.  It is the spirit that matters.  That spirit is there, and if it is a source of disorder in this country that the people of the country have the spirit that they are going to stand on the platforms which they fought to free, and that they are going to talk there about the things of which they ought to talk, then there is something wrong with the Minister.  However, I should like him to tell us in what way the number one class about which I have spoken&mdash;the League of Youth&mdash;is responsible for the increase in the Police Estimate.  I should like him to tell us again in what way the inflamed farmers of the country are responsible for it, and to tell us again in what way the body which is calling itself the I.R.A., and all the other various satellite bodies that hang on to it as a tail or float around it, are responsible. In asking us to pass here an Estimate which has gone up by leaps and bounds, contrary to what the Minister for Justice thought should be the case and to what he promised the country would be the case, a discussion of those particular matters is due to the House.  For those various reasons, <Col N="322" /> I move that this Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.  I do not think that the House should pass the Estimate in any case; nevertheless, I think the House is entitled to hear from the Minister an explanation of this great increase in the cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second this motion to refer back the Estimate.  About three or four weeks ago a series of arrests was made in this country&mdash; arrests of members of a body which the President of the Executive Council described as an avowedly militaristic body.  One morning the detectives set out to arrest one member of this avowedly militaristic body, armed with the usual paraphernalia of a warrant, to search at least for arms if not also for treasonable documents.  They were getting after the members of an avowedly militaristic body, and the repercussions of the discoveries that were made with regard to some of those arrests were shown in the entourage which surrounded the President at the Easter celebrations.  They went out to arrest a prominent member of this avowedly militaristic body.  On a search warrant procured on the oath of a detective officer, sworn before a district justice, they go to the house of an ordinary harmless citizen in this city, miles away from the residence of the wild Irregular whom they are going to arrest.  They come to that man's house at two o'clock in the morning.  He is roused from his sleep, and he asks what is the matter.  He is told they are a body of police to raid his house.  He asks if the search warrant can be read to him, and they state that it will be read to him when they get inside the house. He knows that the damage will have been done by that time, and reminds them that the guise of Civic Guards has been used previously in criminal activity in the country.  He asks them again to read the search warrant outside his house, or to state their authority.  At a certain point his wife takes up the negotiations with those people outside the house, while he goes to an upper window, opens the top such and blows several blasts on an ordinary police whistle.  What is the result? <Col N="323" /> Before the astonished eyes of his wife the police officers, who have come with a search warrant, break and run.  Of course, they think they are on the track of a wild Irregular.  They, presumably, think the police whistle is a signal for an ambush.  At any rate, they break and run.  Consider the feelings of the harmless citizen of this State, who sees that on any sign being made to the neighbourhood of trouble in their vicinity the crowd outside breaks and runs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It must have been a good weapon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was such a weapon as made the members of the Civic Guard, for whom we are voting money, run away.  Let the laughter subside for a moment.  Does Deputy Donnelly think that a crowd of people should come to a citizen's house at 2 o'clock in the morning, refuse to give information as to their authority, and indicate that type of timidity when very simple notice is given to the neighbourhood that there is something wrong at his house?  In the end I think it was somewhere about 4 o'clock in the morning that they got into his house.  Meantime they had gathered together again when they found that this man was not so full of guile and harm as the whistle seemed to indicate. He is taken to the Bridewell, and within half an hour it is realised that the search warrant obtained on the oath of some member of the Detective <Col N="324" /> Division has placed the wrong man, and that he is a harmless citizen. When that man writes to the Minister for Justice he gets an apology.  Will the Minister tell us if anything has happened to the people who blundered? The Minister, in his letter, admitted that they had blundered. Will the Minister tell us whether there was a disciplinary inquiry? Was there anybody sacked, or is this House being asked to vote money for the upkeep of people who can go out and swear before a District Justice that they have reasonable grounds for suspecting that there are arms and treasonable documents in a certain house; can mistake the house of a notorious Irregular; go blundering miles away from the proper house to an altogether different district of the city, and put a law-abiding citizen through the tremors which he must have been put through on that night when this gang assembled outside, because from the manner in which they behaved they cannot be described as anything other than a gang?  They may be good officers in their own way, but, if a mistake like that can occur, surely it is time for the Minister to tell us that some disciplinary action has been taken against the people responsible.</P>
      <P>Progress reported.  The Committee to sit again to-morrow.</P>
