      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle (for Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>

      <P>The claimant was summoned for examination by the medical inspector on 27th April, 1934, but did not attend.  Word was left with the local postmistress on the day previous that claimant would be unable to attend.  The shortness of the notice given by claimant did not permit of the inspector visiting the claimant at home.</P>
      <P>The medical inspector intends to inspect blind applicants in County Donegal in about three weeks' time, when he will examine the claimant at home.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that top grade sugar crystals are selling at 19/1½ per cwt. in Belfast, while the fixed price for sugar crystals in Saorstát Eireann is now 30/1 per cwt., and whether he will cause inquiries to be made into the reasons for this difference in price.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the price for sugar crystals is higher in the <Col N="1838" /> Saorstát than in Belfast, and the figures given by the Deputy are probably substantially correct for sugar bought in small lots by retailers.  The factors responsible for the difference in price were discussed at length, while the Sugar Manufacture Act, 1933, was in course of enactment.</P>

      <P>It is presumed that the Deputy wishes to know the total cost to the Revenue of granting the relief in question.  As relief may have been given in certain circumstances by way of allowance granted by local inspectors, the particulars of repayments alone would not necessarily give a correct view of the position.  In fact, no statistics bearing on the point are available at present, and the labour and expense of preparing statistics specially would not be justified.  As the first issue of capital in respect of which a certificate under the section was granted was not made until July, 1933, and as there were only two such issues, both of them small, prior to December, 1933, the cost of the concession was nil for 1932-3 and was negligible for 1933-4.  If the Deputy will repeat the question in, say a fortnight, I will endeavour to furnish an estimate of the cost up to date for the year 1934-5.</P>

    <P>In the various tables prepared for the Annual Report on matters relating to joint stock companies the registration fees paid by new companies were <Col N="1845" /> not separated from other company fees and an accurate segregation of the figures for the past five years would involve a considerable expenditure of time and labour.  It has been possible, however, to calculate that the fees paid by new companies on registration for each of the years 1930 to 1934 were approximately £600, £650, £1,000, £1,350 and £1,650.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether in connection with the building of houses for the use of persons to whom holdings are given on the division of an estate it is the practice in certain circumstances to do such building work by direct labour, and, if so, whether the rates of wages and other conditions of employment observed are as favourable to the workers as if they were employed by a person performing the work under a contract containing a Fair Wages clause.</P>

      <P>I propose <Col N="1847" /> to take the Deputy's two questions together.</P>
      <P>In certain circumstances the Land Commission find it advisable to carry out building work directly instead of giving it out to contractors.</P>
      <P>It is usual, in cases in which the Land Commission themselves undertake the construction of buildings, to carry out the work by part contracts according to the trades involved, the materials being supplied by the Land Commission.  The contract agreement binding each such tradesman contains a fair wages clause to protect the workers employed by him.</P>
      <P>Where it is not found possible to place part contracts and the tradesmen and labourers are paid at a daily wage, the rate paid is based on that obtaining locally and so compares favourably with the wages paid by building contractors in the district.</P>
      <P>When the Land Commission let building work wholly by contract, the contract documents signed by the contractor contain the usual Fair Wages clause.</P>

      <P>In connection with this Bill, I have a brief statement to make arising out of a question that was addressed to me on Friday last by Deputy Thrift.  This Private Bill, after passing the Seanad, was not proceeded with in the Dáil, as the Government undertook to introduce an alternative measure embodying the principle aimed at in the Private Bill.  Considerable alterations in the provisions of the Private Bill were found to be necessary and to involve complete redrafting. The consent of the Executive Council was secured thereto on the 2nd June, 1934, but in view of the somewhat complicated nature of the administrative problems to be dealt with under the Bill it was found desirable to supply the Parliamentary draftsman with the headings of legislation in the form of a draft Bill.  This draft Bill was finally sent to the Parliamentary draftsman on the 12th January, 1935, and several inquiries since made show that he has <Col N="1849" /> been unable to deal with the matter owing to priority being claimed for other legislation.</P>

      <P>I cannot see any reason why the Dáil should accept this Estimate.  The Governor-General receives a salary of £2,000 a year out of the Central Fund.  That appears to me to remunerate him amply for the duties he performs and to cover all reasonable expenses.  Those duties have been reduced to a very modest limit indeed, and are of a kind that could be performed by a junior clerk. Even such a formal matter as the representation of his Majesty the King on the occasion of the reception of new diplomatic representatives from foreign countries has been undertaken by the President of the Executive Council, and the Governor-General has been, to that extent, relieved.  I can see no excuse for proposing that, in addition to the more than adequate salary of £2,000 a year, the Dáil should accept an Estimate amounting to a further £2,000 for alleged necessary expenses.  I frankly confess that I do not regard the present occupant of the post of Governor-General as having been happily selected.  I have expressed the view before, and I have no hesitation in expressing it again, that it would be much more valuable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I defy anybody to suggest a reason why the Governor-General should be provided, at the public expense, with a private secretary, a chaplain, a motor car, an official residence and the wherewithal to keep up the official residence, in view of the fact that out of the Central Fund he has a salary of £2,000 a year.  I think that, in the condition in which the country is, with the type of Budget that we have before us and with the necessity that we are under of imposing taxes on the foodstuffs of the poorest of the poor, there can be no excuse for asking the House to accept this Estimate.  I submit that the country is receiving and is likely to receive no sort of value for the Estimate which the Government is attempting to push through this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the question. When we were in Opposition, and when the statutory salary was being accepted by the then occupant of the office of Governor-General, there was a further provision&mdash;this was in the year 1931-32, before we came into office&mdash;which brought the total amount to £25,655. We used to complain that that provision was quite unnecessary.  We have reduced that expenditure considerably. The expenditure proposed now is only one-sixth of what was provided then. If Deputies on the opposite side think that we are still making unnecessary provision, I should like them to argue that question.  Our attitude is that we have reduced the provision to the absolute minimum whilst the office exists, and that, if there is to be any further diminution, the proper thing to do is to abolish the office altogether.  As I was about to say when interrupted a few moments ago, if Deputies on the opposite benches assist, I think we might be able to arrange that in the coming year we would not have this Vote at all.</P>

      <P>If I could get any indication from Deputies on the opposite benches that their heart is behind their statements, I might come to the Dáil and explain it in full.  But I am afraid that the criticism we are getting from the opposite benches on this matter is not too sincere, and that, if those who are criticising the amount we are providing were over here, they would be moving a Vote, as in 1931-32, which would mean altogether an expenditure of six times the amount we are proposing.  Again I throw out the challenge that if they want to eliminate this Vote altogether, they should indicate their desire now to see the office abolished.  This is a very appropriate time to do it.</P>

I would like to make it plain that the attitude of the Opposition, in case there should be any ambiguity, is not that we are in favour of the abolition of the post of the King's representative in this country, but that we are in favour of reducing the financial provision for that representative to a figure that is more in proportion to the duties which he is allowed to perform under the present Government.</P>

The point is this, that unless the Governor-General performs functions other than he does, and which it is the policy of the present Government he should not perform, and, I think also the desire of the people of the country that he should not perform&mdash;that unless that is completely changed and we are to go back to the position of having something like a Viceroy&mdash;the Opposition will not vote for what would be regarded as suitable provision in the Estimate.</P>

However, from what Deputy MacDermot said they have shown no desire to do so.  I do not like to say any more at the moment, than that I hope the present Government will be in office when the next Estimate like this comes round again.  I expect it will be in office.  I expect the policy which we have adopted will continue to receive the support of the majority of the people, and if it does, I do not think we will be moving this Estimate. I agree with Deputies on the opposite benches that, in present circumstances &mdash;although the Constitution as it stands makes it necessary&mdash;you can hardly make a case, or give any good reason for a continuance of the Vote.

      <P>I move: That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration. Perhaps the best way for me to begin what I have to say about the President's Department is to make the few remarks about the Governor-General which I was not allowed to make on the last Vote, but which, I understand, are in order on this Vote. This Party is, of course, quite frankly in favour of continuing our membership of the Commonwealth and of accepting the Crown as the symbol of that free and equal partnership just as Australia, Canada and South Africa accept it.  So long as it is the customary thing for the Crown to have a representative in these countries, whether he is called a Governor-General, a Viceroy or by any other name that may be ascribed to him, we are content that such an official should exist in this country, and, if he does exist, we consider that he should carry out duties analogous to those carried out by representatives of the Crown elsewhere.  We are certainly not in favour of wasting the money of the people in providing a totally unnecessary establishment for a man who performs no duties except those of a rubber stamp.</P>
      <P>The Constitution does not come into question, because we are not contesting his salary, which is paid out of the Central Fund, but we suggest that, in view of what his duties are confined to, anything additional to that should be of a merely nominal character.  We cannot imagine what happens to this money we are providing under the Estimate just passed, unless it is used to accumulate a private fortune for the present occupant of the position.  I think it is very unfortunate that instead of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is all I propose to say on the subject of the Governor-General.</P>
      <P>About a year ago&mdash;I think it was on this Vote&mdash;the President of the Executive Council expressed a yearning to escape from the fever and fret of Irish politics to the seclusion of a South Sea Island.  I did my best at the time to encourage that project. I even had the temerity to suggest that he should invite General O'Duffy to accompany him, a suggestion which he appeared to receive with favour, but so far as I am aware nothing has been done to realise the scheme. Bearing in mind, as I do, what a lot of trouble would have been saved to all of us if it had been carried out, my first complaint against the Department of the President of the Executive Council is that, like so many other Fianna Fáil statements and promises, that particular one has not been allowed to achieve fruition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few days ago Deputy Norton, speaking here in the Dáil, suggested that former members of the Centre Party were really estopped from any effective criticism of the President of the Executive Council because of the fact that they had refrained from voting against him on the occasion of his election to that office.  That argument will not bear examination. Nobody played a more energetic part than the members of the Centre Party in attacking and exposing the fallacies and follies of the Fianna Fáil programme at the last election, and those of us who, in the previous election, stood as Independents took a similar line.  When we refrained from actually voting against the election of the President, we made it perfectly plain that it was not because of any doubt in our minds as to the undesirability of the principles and policy for which he stood.  We merely felt that after the decisive verdict&mdash;however obtained&mdash;which had, in fact, been given by the people of the country for the President and his Party, it would be an empty show to object to his taking over the office of President of the Executive Council.  Whether we were right or wrong in that point <Col N="1861" /> of view, and something can be said on both sides, at any rate, it is one which in no way debars us from continuing the criticism of his general policy which we were in the habit of making before his election occurred at all.  I propose, therefore, to-day to take a brief survey of the general point of view for which the President of the Executive Council in particular stands.</P>
    <P>To all the remonstrances which we urge in regard to the economic and moral deterioration of the country under the Fianna Fáil régime, the President is in the habit of replying: &ldquo;Oh, but think of the national position.  It is all very well to criticise us, but what have you to suggest except the surrender of the national position?&rdquo;  That being so, it seems incumbent upon us to consider a little more attentively just what that national position is which is regarded as imposing upon us such an obligation of reverence.</P>
    <P>I take it that the President represents himself to the people of this country, to his followers in Parliament, and, perhaps, to himself, as conducting a fight against Great Britain&mdash;a fight with a double object; firstly, the object of retaining in this country certain moneys which have been in dispute and, secondly, the object of establishing a Republic, of obtaining what he calls complete independence. Now I suggest that, when both those campaigns are examined, they will hardly be found to be sufficiently inspiring to justify any great sacrifices being made for them.  It is really doing the President a service to talk of the state of things existing between ourselves and Great Britain as an economic war.  I suppose we have to go on doing it, because neither the English language nor possibly any other language provides a vocabulary which is adequate to describe the peculiarity of the situation existing between ourselves and Great Britain. We are supposed to be conducting a financial fight with her; we are supposed to be refusing to pay moneys which we say are not due, and yet not alone does the Minister for <Col N="1862" /> Finance continue to place a considerable portion of the nation's money in British securities, in securities of the nation whom by definition we are trying to destroy, but in addition to that &mdash;much as he has shown that he does not desire to hear it&mdash;the President is, in fact, paying out hand over first the moneys which are in dispute.  He maintains that there is a tremendous distinction between paying something and having it taken from you.  If there is such a distinction I hardly think it applies in the present case, because it is difficult to imagine anything more voluntary and more deliberate than the form of payment which the President is in fact making. We are under no obligation to send our livestock to Great Britain.  We choose to do it because it suits us. We choose to do it knowing that in the act of doing it we are paying those moneys.  In a recent diplomatic triumph the President arranged not only that we should send more beasts to England than we had been sending before that arrangement was made, but that we should coax the English to let us send those beasts and to let us make those extra payments of money in the shape of tariffs, by granting them a monopoly in our market for the supply of coal.  Could anything be more fantastic if the fight on the subject of finance could really be described as a genuine fight at all? It is not a genuine fight.  It has got every possible mark of a sham fight, and it is absurd to suggest to the people of this country that there is something so glorious about that state of affairs that they have no excuse for objecting to the sacrifice of their fortunes and the fortunes of their children in order to prolong it indefinitely.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan suggested in the Budget debate that the crux of the situation on the financial side as between us and Great Britain was the unwillingness of our Government to appoint two representatives to negotiate with two English representatives. I am not sure that Deputy McGilligan is right in that, but I think, in view of the fact that the statement has been made, that the <Col N="1863" /> President ought to tell us whether he is or not.  My own impression is that, assuming two representatives were appointed on each side, they would be able to achieve nothing unless there was some change of heart on the part of our Government.  It is impossible to say things on this subject that have not in some form or other been said already, but I think it has to be repeated that no settlement of the financial dispute with Great Britain, even assuming that it can be altogether segregated from the political dispute, is conceivable unless the Government is prepared either to stop arguing about rights and wrongs and to try to cut the Gordian knot by making a cash offer, some sort of cash compromise, or else to go back to the original suggestion of arbitration. The President, judging by his speech a few days ago on the Budget, has given up the pretence that a fair arbitration could not be obtained unless a chairman was brought in from outside the British Commonwealth. What he now says is that an arbitration with a chairman chosen from inside the British Commonwealth would be a compromise of our national position.  It is just as well that the country should be clear that a fair arbitration, assuming that it was not regarded as a compromise of our national position, could undoubtedly be obtained with a chairman drawn from inside the British Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>The President can hardly be blind to that fact, in view of some of the visitors who have recently been here in Ireland from other parts of the Commonwealth. It must be very present to his mind that distinguished Irishmen exist in other parts of the Commonwealth who, if anything, would have a bias in favour of this country in the event of one of them being selected as Chairman of an arbitration board.  Apropos of these visits, may I just say this.  We heard a good deal of the amount of information and instruction about Irish affairs which the President imparted to our distinguished visitors.  I am wondering whether he received any corresponding <Col N="1864" /> information and instruction. I am rather afraid that when it comes to the question of information and instruction the President is one of those who think that it is more blessed to give than to receive.  But there certainly was information and instruction that it would have been valuable for the President to receive from such visitors as those to whom I refer.  He could have learned from them that perpect freedom and perfect equality are compatible with acceptance of the Commonwealth position and of the emblem of the Crown; he could have learned from them that there is an affection for this country widespread through the Commonwealth countries and that if we could see our way to take up our position frankly and cordially on a level with the rest, not only would we be regarded as being as free and equal as they are, but we would be regarded as on a still higher plane, as one of the two great parent nations which were responsible for the foundation and the building up of that Commonwealth&mdash;and that in no spirit of Imperialism, if by Imperialism is meant the imposition on the weak of the will of the strong, the exploiting of the poor by the strong, but in a spirit of partnership, in the spirit of a kind of minor League of Nations (to use a simile that was once used by the President himself), a spirit of co-operation for the peace of the world and for the advantage of all those free and equal members of a free partnership, terminable at will at any time by any one of them.  I hope some of these ideas may have been put before the President by people from overseas, and I hope that, if they were put before him, he will not close his mind to their value and importance.</P>
    <P>To return to the question of our financial dispute with Great Britain, I put it to the Government that unless they are prepared to make a cash offer and to stop any further wrangling about the rights and wrongs of the matter or, alternatively, are prepared to accept an arbitration with a chairman drawn from somewhere inside the Commonwealth, the financial dispute seems likely to go on for ever.  The provision <Col N="1865" /> of bounties, which the Minister for Finance described as transitory and exceptional, seems likely to go on for ever, and the paying of moneys away to England on a scale certainly not smaller than before the dispute arose, seems likely to go on for ever.  The President and his colleagues should really try to stop flogging themselves into a rage by a recollection of what they consider the misdeeds of a previous Government.  They talk as if Deputy Cosgrave, when he was President of the Executive Council, agreed to pay away large sums of money to England without a vestige of a legal excuse for so doing.  That sort of talk simply will not hold water.  I am not going to argue the legal case here.  I am not going to say that the Government have no legal case, but I do say that, putting it at its highest from their point of view, it is a legal question of difficulty and complexity. The fact that, in his correspondence with the President of the Executive Council, Mr. Thomas relies, not on the legal point, but on the agreement which was made with the Cosgrave Government, does not in the least suggest that the English are under the impression that their legal case is weak.  It merely suggests that the natural and primary thing for them to rely on was an inter-Governmental agreement.  Similarly, there is nothing at all sinister in the fact that when Deputy Cosgrave and his colleagues have sought to justify their action in agreeing to pay over the annuities and the other moneys, they did so by referring to the legal side of the case, because they were in the position of having to justify that agreement.  The British were not in the position of having to justify that agreement.  They could rely on the agreement without justifying it.  The Cosgrave Government had to justify it, and the talk of their making a better case for Mr. Thomas than Mr. Thomas was able to do for himself, is merely nonsense and, in so far as it has the effect of inflaming the minds of the Government and making them more adverse to a settlement it has been mischievous nonsense.</P>
    <P>The President affects to be at all <Col N="1866" /> times suspicious that we are laying traps for him and that our one desire is to discredit the Government in the eyes of the people of the country and get them out of office.  I wish we could get these ideas out of his head.  I believe there has never been an Opposition in any country with less greed for office than the present Opposition in the Dáil.  We honestly are not interested in that subject.  If the present Government would see the light, handle the affairs of the nation in a common-sense manner and frankly admit that changed circumstances have convinced them of truths they had not before realised, we would have no objection to seeing them continue in office indefinitely.  I wish he would try to give us credit for being sincere in the recommendations we have made on the subject of these various disputes with Great Britain.</P>
    <P>Now, to turn from the financial dispute to the other one&mdash;the supposed fight for a republic.  It is very difficult to imagine how anybody in this country can still get up enthusiasm for the Fianna Fáil fight for a republic. I repeat, without fear of contradiction, that since they came into office they have not got one inch nearer to a 32-county republic.  They confess themselves that it is futile to look forward to creating such a republic by force.  They confess that, not only does it appear impracticable to subdue the North, but that if we did subdue the North we should continue, so long as the Northern Unionists formed part of our State, to have to contend against a condition of turmoil.  If anything is to be done in the way of uniting this nation, it must be done by persuasion and by consent.  I put it to every fair-minded Deputy in this House that the North has gone a good deal further away from us in sentiment since the present Government came into office.  It appears to me that if only the Fianna Fáil Party had seen its way to accept the Commonwealth partnership three years ago, it is very possible that by this time we should be on the verge of national reunion. The amount of sentiment that has been excited by the Jubilee of the <Col N="1867" /> King would have given an extraordinary opportunity for reunion with the North.</P>
    <P>The President is in the habit of saying that opinions such as these, coming from a person such as I, have no weight, that they would have weight if they came from Lord Craigavon or one of his colleagues in the North. When the President says a thing like that, he is speaking very unreasonably because there is no use shutting our eyes to the fact that the Northern Unionists have their minds inflamed and diseased by racial prejudices, and we cannot expect conciliation and reason from them until we have eliminated the conditions which have created the disease.  I cannot quote any statement by individuals in the North that go to support the theories I am advancing, but I suggest that they are a matter of mere common sense.  The objections in the old days on the part of Northerners to Home Rule were based on two grounds.  They were based on the ground, in the first place, that Home Rule would be &ldquo;Rome Rule&rdquo; and, in the second place, on the ground that Home Rule would mean complete separation from the Commonwealth.  As regards the first, their theories have been completely exploded.  They meant, of course, that there would be religious intolerance in Southern Ireland, and nobody can contend that there has been anything of the kind.  There is no country that is more tolerant on the subject of religion than the Irish Free State.  Consequently, there remains nothing except the argument that self-government for Ireland means separation.</P>
    <P>It is highly unstatesmanlike and utterly futile for us to shut our eyes to the fact that more than a quarter of the population of the country are passionately attached to that Commonwealth. We have to face precisely the same problem they had to face in South Africa.  South Africa could not be made into a country until the Dutch and the British stock came together on the basis of complete self-government, complete freedom, complete equality, <Col N="1868" /> including the right to go out of the Commonwealth within the framework of the Commonwealth system, of which the symbol is the Crown.  I see no reason to believe that what happened in South Africa could not happen here also.  It is the same disease.  If we have any real desire to reconcile the people of the North and to bring about a united country, South Africa has given us a headline as to how it should be done.</P>
    <P>The President has often represented himself and his Party as standing for complete freedom, whereas, according to him, the Opposition stand for an Ireland continuing in bondage and liking, or pretending to like, that bondage.  That presentation of the case is the very reverse of the truth. No member of the Opposition wishes Ireland to continue in bondage.  Every member of the Opposition claims that Ireland has a right to decide for herself at all times whether it should belong to the Commonwealth or not. While we are in favour of the Commonwealth position, not merely on material grounds&mdash;though, God knows, the material grounds are important enough&mdash;but also, and, most of all, because we consider that the unity of Ireland is the thing that is best worth going for in Irish politics, at the same time we stand for the sovereignty and the complete freedom of the Irish nation.  We believe that the Irish Free State is completely free now and we consider our problem, not as a problem of freedom, but a problem of reconciliation, a problem of making Ireland into a country by bringing together the two stocks that have inhabited it for so many centuries.</P>
    <P>We are shortly going to have by-elections, and I am afraid that, therefore, the present moment is not an auspicious one for expecting an attitude of sweet reasonableness on the part of the Government.  I am afraid that it is a moment when they are only too likely to beat the loudest drums they have to beat, but, beat as loud as they like, I somehow or other think they cannot put a very creditable complexion on what they describe as their national policy.  It is certainly not apparent to me how they are making <Col N="1869" /> any progress towards what they say is their ideal.  A few weeks ago the President said that he and his Party could only conceive of complete freedom for this country in terms of a republic.  Why can they only conceive of it in terms of a republic?  The phrase seems to me to be nonsense.  But let us suppose that they mean what they say.  Are they making any headway even towards a Twenty-Six County republic?  Are they putting this country in a position where it will be able to stand the economic strains, which, the President says, it will have to stand in the event of a republic being established?  Are they building up any reserve fund to meet those economic strains?  It seems to me that, instead of a reserve fund being accumulated, everything and everybody is being taxed up to the limit, and the Government appear to be borrowing, indefensibly, for objects that ought not to be borrowed for. Instead of building up, it seems to me that they are pulling down and that, so far from the country being put in a continually better position to resist the economic strains of complete separation, the country is being put into a worse position all the time.</P>
    <P>If the President thinks in terms not of a Twenty-Six County republic but of a Thirty-Two County republic, what then?  If the British market is important to us, what about the North?  If we have to consider the British market for our agricultural produce, have not the North also to consider that market for their ships and for their linen as well as their agriculture; and is it not a fact that absolutely no progress is being made towards bringing about a state of affairs when this country as a whole, or even the Twenty-Six Counties, can afford the luxury of complete separation&mdash;even assuming, as I do, that the British would indulge in no retaliation if such a separation took place?</P>
    <P>The President has suggested that we are not sincere in saying that this country is not free to leave the Commonwealth of Nations: that we would threaten people at election times with all sorts of pains and penalties if they did leave the Commonwealth.  That attack on our sincerity is far from being justified.  At the last two elections, I, <Col N="1870" /> personally, stumped the whole country saying that we were free to leave the Commonwealth if we wanted to do so, and that I stood for that position and, not alone that, but that I stood for membership of the British Commonwealth of Nations because I stood for that position.  It suits the President's convenience to say that we are under compulsion to remain inside the Commonwealth: that we are in what the President calls a forced position.  I cannot prevent the President from going on saying that if he wants to say it. Perhaps the President believes it himself&mdash;because I believe the President to be capable of a great deal of self-deception in such matters.  Whether he believes it or not, however, he is not justified in saying that we believe it.  We do not believe it.  It has been made amply clear by statesmen in all parts of the Commonwealth that the Commonwealth could not continue to exist at all, in the light of the constitutional developments of recent years, but for the principle that each part of the Commonwealth has the right to secede if it wants to do so.</P>
    <P>The President may suggest that, in our case, the Treaty stands in the way. Personally, I do not think that the Treaty does stand in the way. I think that the Treaty, interpreted in the light of recent constitutional developments and in the light of the Statute of Westminster, does not stand in the way.  If, however, there was sufficient ambiguity as to whether the Treaty does stand in the way, I should be in favour of clearing that ambiguity up, and I imagine that all Parties in this country would concur in the desire to have it cleared up, if it needed to be done. However, it is not what the British say that matters, but what we ourselves feel and intend; and, so long as there is no subjection in our minds or spirit, I believe there is nothing that derogates from our dignity as a nation in accepting membership of the British Commonwealth. When we urge, as we do, acceptance of partnership in the Commonwealth and acceptance of the Crown as the lightest possible link that could be imagined for maintaining that partnership, we do so, not as bondsmen <Col N="1871" /> ourselves, nor as men wishing to impose bonds on others, but as freemen, as lovers of liberty, lovers of freedom, and lovers of equality.  The President argues that there is something incompatible with our history and tradition in such acceptance.  It might as easily be urged that it is incompatible with English History and tradition.  In fact it might more easily be urged in the case of the English people.  They have been commonly attacked for Imperialism in the past; for refusing to give freedom to other peoples.  In the minds of many English people, as a matter of fact, the Statute of Westminster seemed to be a break with English tradition and history, but none the less it has been accepted.</P>
    <P>New times and new circumstances give rise to new ideas, and there is no reason why our ideas and our minds should not take account of changed circumstances.  The President talks as if the history of this country dated from 1916 and as if the only general election that mattered was the general election of 1918.  I cannot understand the logic of such talk.  Were there not sufficient circumstances of exasperation at the time to make that general election a rather exceptional and abnormal election?  I would remind the House that the financial agreements, which the Government is so fond of attacking, between the Cosgrave Government and the British Government, were an issue in the two general elections of 1927. The people of the country certainly knew the effect of these agreements at the time.  Yet, the Fianna Fáil Party does not consider itself debarred from going back on those decisions.  Why should the 1918 election be the one election in Irish history that counts?</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is, taking Irish history as a whole, that the republicans amongst Irish Nationalists have been in a minority, a very decided minority, a minority of quantity and quality.  I have given a list of names in this House before to prove that and I do not intend to bother the House with these names again.  But I repeat that assertion that both in quality and <Col N="1872" /> quantity we can show a better list of non-republican Irish nationalists than of republican Irish nationalists up to 1916.  Conscription, the Curragh Mutiny just before the war and the special circumstances of the Ulster campaign against Home Rule happened to create a feeling of special exasperation in this country.  For some of that we ourselves were partly to blame.  The British were not solely to blame.  The Ulster threat of rebellion would never have reached the importance that it did reach but for our own representatives at the time.  I was a supporter of the Irish Nationalist Party, but I cannot shut my eyes to the fact that, owing to the prejudice in this country against anything like coercion, the Irish Nationalist Party put every obstacle in the way of the Liberal Government of that day taking any effective steps to nip that Ulster movement in the bud. So that for that the English were not solely responsible.  But I quite agree that there was a concentration of circumstances calculated to produce intense exasperation in this country during the years from 1910 to 1918. That exasperation led to extremism and that extremism took the form of republicanism.  But in those days no alternative was presented to the people such as is presented to them now.  It is not certain that even in those days of exasperation such an alternative as is presented to them now would not have been accepted.  But now, after all, the exasperation has passed and no excuse remains to us for not thinking over these matters tranquilly and calmly.  Surely we should not consider ourselves debarred from looking into these questions on their merits because of the general election that took place in 1918.  I appeal to the Government to reflect on them with less prejudice than they have hitherto imported into their reflections.  I appeal to them to believe that we, on this side, are not preoccupied with trying to dish them or trying to discredit them in the eyes of the country.  What we are preoccupied with is the happiness, prosperity, peace and dignity of our people.  If we are advocating, as we do, a perfectly frank and manly <Col N="1873" /> acceptance of the Commonwealth position, we do it for these reasons and not for any less worthy reasons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking the individual members of the different Parties to give voice to the opinions they formed; but I ask them to examine the position of the country at the present time and to compare it, as regards the general moral condition, speaking in the wide sense of the word, the material condition and the general tone of the country with similar conditions or conditions affecting similar things, say, 12 months ago, two years ago, or three years ago.  Can any Deputy say in his heart&mdash;do not mind what he says here or on public platforms&mdash; that he is satisfied with the development in the country's condition in any of these matters, that has taken place in the last three years and especially in the last 12 months.  Year after year we have seen more taxes put on the people and year after year the people feel that they are less able to bear these taxes.  Year after year we see less wealth, largely I do not say wholly, as a result of the policy of the Government. As a result of that continual draining of the wealth of the country evidenced in various ways that have been mentioned in the debates by the Deputies, there is less capacity on the part of the people to bear that drain. Year after year we have seen a decline not merely in the material condition of our people but, what is worse, a distinct decline in <i>morale</i> as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a distinct decline in hope, and I put it to the members in all the benches, whether they be Fianna Fáil, Labour or Fine Gael, to compare the position and look back and ask themselves: &ldquo;What is the attitude of the country now towards the future, and what was its attitude three years ago when the present Government took office?&rdquo;  I will admit that three years ago, when the present Government took office there was, especially on the part of their supporters, a great feeling of hope.  I believe that the propaganda of the Opposition, as it then was, was so successful that the supporters of the present Government did look forward to a period of increased prosperity and a strengthening <Col N="1874" /> of the national fibre.  I do not believe that the most enthusiastic supporter of the Government entertains any such feelings at the present day. By looking over those three years, I think you will get some idea of the failure of the policy of the Government to carry out anything like a satisfactory policy for the country.  Burden after burden has been put on the different classes and on the different industries of this country.  As burden after burden has been placed on them I think the country is less able to bear them. Sacrifice after sacrifice has been demanded, and for what?  I do not ask the President or the members of the Executive Council to tell us exactly how they mean to achieve their object. But I think the country would like to know what the object is.  Certainly, the Deputies on this side of the House do not understand it, and the supporters of our Party throughout the country do not understand what is the aim of the present Government.  The Republicans in the country do not understand what the Ministers are aiming at, and I doubt very much if the Fianna Fáil Party in the country know what is the aim of the present Government. It is not through lack of opportunity being given to the Government of explaining both what the aim is, how they intend to achieve it, and, after they achieve it, what good it will do. Plenty of opportunity has been given to them.  Again and again we have had expositions of Government policy, and I suggest that the principal result of these expositions has been to leave the matter a great deal more confused than it was before, until, as I say, I do not think there is any party in this country &mdash;Fine Gael, Republican or Fianna Fáil &mdash;that really knows what the Government are aiming at.  The only thing that is known is the sacrifice that is imposed for this illusion, for this myth, but as to what the illusion is, and what the myth is, the country is left completely in the dark.</P>
    <P>Could anybody, for instance, tell us whether or not the Government want a settlement with Great Britain?  There are statements, there are actions on the part of Ministers and the Government as a whole which would lead one to <Col N="1875" /> the conclusion that the Government did want such a thing.  Yet, if you take the whole policy of the Government, I do not think any other conclusion can be come to except this, that at no price will the Government have a settlement. There was a hope when the coal-cattle pact was concluded&mdash;everybody greeted it at the time, not for its own value but in the hope it really meant a definite embarking on a policy of settlement&mdash; that it was the first step.  It was as such that the pact was greeted and accepted by the country.  I am not suggesting that the settlement had no value.  It did do something slight to relieve the pressure of too many cattle in the country; it did ease the situation in the country, but it did no more than ease, and, as everybody knows, at considerable cost.  If the farmers had their situation eased, the country paid very heavily.</P>
    <P>If you take the bargain and put it by itself, was there any justification for it? Was it worth the price paid?  The only significance it could have had would be as a pointer, as an indication, that the Government were at last ready to enter on the way of negotiation, getting at the different points of the dispute between themselves and the British Government and, possibly, reaching a settlement of the various outstanding questions, and of the big ones particularly, I think any welcome it got at the beginning was got on the interpretation of what the step meant.  But the country has waited month after month, and it has certainly seen no advance in that particular direction. Even talk of a settlement has now disappeared. I wonder whether there will be a recrudesence of it in the next couple of weeks.  There generally is on such occasions.  I expect to hear in the various lobbies and halls of the House, and whispered through the country, that there is a good settlement coming at last.  We generally hear it in circumstances like the ones that are now upon us.</P>

      <P>That may be, but every follower of yours was very keen on spreading through the country and whispering around that a tremendously good settlement was coming at last in a week or a fortnight's time. You got various accounts of it; but there the rumour was.  In reality there is no evidence of such a settlement coming, and the coal-cattle pact stands by itself and on its own feet merely as an additional contribution by the taxpayers of this country to the British Exchequer and to our own Exchequer, and the means of securing employment for a number of British miners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there any policy in reference to our main industry taken as a whole? I am quite aware that the Government have determined at all economic costs to push the wheat policy and they are doing so.  But have they any policy for agriculture as a whole?  In their election statement they stressed the amount of agricultural produce that we were importing and they said they proposed to put an end to that.  The wheat policy is meant to be the contribution to the fulfilment of that promise.  Very good.  Generally, there are not many people present when an agricultural debate is on, but everybody who was present when the Minister for Agriculture was explaining his policy in 1933 knows that he made it quite clear that the wheat policy and the tillage policy meant an increase in the number of cattle.  He made that clear, and acknowledged it.  That was obviously the policy of the Minister for Agriculture.  It was a policy with some sanity.  The rotation of crops and the close connection that there is between that and the rearing of cattle made that necessary.  Not only did he acknowledge that, but he boasted that it was his policy, and always had been his policy.  It was merely the blindness <Col N="1877" /> of Party prejudice on our side that prevented us from seeing that.</P>
    <P>I am willing to acknowledge that that was the policy of the Minister for Agriculture.  But was he allowed to carry it through?  He was not, and he had to drop it.  He had to drop it because against his agricultural policy was the policy of the Executive Council.  That policy completely made nugatory the policy of the Minister for Agriculture.  Looking at the thing from the point of view of Government policy in general, I do not see what else he could have done than turn a somersault.  That same Minister, speaking from that same place nine months later, said the policy of the Government was more tillage and less cattle.  I give that as an instance of the complete lack of policy or of contradictory policies on the part of the Government.  The Minister on one occasion put forward an agricultural policy for the country involving an extended area for wheat growing and tillage in general, realising that that involved more cattle, and realising&mdash;in fact he stated it&mdash;that that meant finding a market for them. He said on that occasion that he had the market.  Nine months afterwards we had the same Minister going back completely on that policy.  Hampered as he was, not by the agricultural policy of the Government but by the general policy of the Government, what else could he do?  If his policy meant more cultivation, more tillage and more cattle how could he carry out that policy?</P>
    <P>There was great talk, at one time, about alternative markets.  There is none now, so far as our main produce is concerned.  That is acknowledged.  We may export a few cattle elsewhere, but, for the great bulk of them, there is no market outside this country and Great Britain, that is worthy of account. Hence, the Minister for Agriculture had to take on a policy of destroying the future wealth of the country. So the policy of calf-killing was adopted.  That has been tried elsewhere with disastrous results. It is within our knowledge that in the case of the Minister for Agriculture he was not allowed to carry out his policy, but had to <Col N="1878" /> sacrifice it to the political dispute between the Government and Great Britain.  The Minister must know, and the Government must know, through resolutions passed even by members of their own Party in the country, that they, too, are feeling the strain.  It is not merely our supporters who have said that.  Some of the Government followers, at their branch meetings, have passed resolutions to that effect.  No wonder!  They are bound to feel the strain and the more they are feeling the strain, unfortunately, the less the country is being put into a position to bear it.  There is no real pushing forward of any policy. There is a Bill here and a Bill there, but so far as any general policy for the country is concerned I see very little evidence of it in the behaviour of the Government for the last 12 months. They are hanging on to their statements, and to positions which they took up for strategical purposes. What I certainly fail to see is evidence of any policy.  There is simply a clinging on by Ministers to various shibboleths.  What is it all for?</P>
    <P>I was a member of the Executive Council of this State for six years. Never during the whole of that time did I see the slightest tittle of evidence of any desire, or hint at a desire, on the part of the British Government to suggest in the slightest way what our policy should be.  There were a number of questions between the two countries required argument and adjustment, but so far as our policy was concerned I never saw the slightest tittle of evidence that the British Government desired to interfere. And I suggest that the present Government have never found any such evidence but their experience has been the same.  I do not believe that they have found that there was the slightest desire on the part of the British Government to interfere in their external or internal policy.  I would like, therefore, to know what there is in the way of greater freedom that is suggested as the national policy for which we are sacrificing the moral tone, and material interest of the country.  I can understand some people saying we want a republic, and I can understand people saying we want a <Col N="1879" /> united country.  I can understand dissatisfaction on the ground of the disunion of the country.</P>
    <P>What advance has been made in that direction in the past three years or in the past 12 months?  Remember it was one of the great questions that was going to be solved by the Party opposite.  The head of the Government and the head of the Executive Council in this State allowed himself to go forward as a candidate at the last General Election in another State in another part of this country, and that was supposed to portend something.  Did it?  Did it mean anything at all?  Has it led to anything?  So far as a solution is concerned it has not.  No advance has been made in realising any of the aims the Government alleged they had before themselves, or any of the aims that they convinced the country that they had before themselves, and declared that they would be able to realise.</P>
    <P>Now as to the wealth of this country, I wonder how many people believe the rash statements of some of the President's colleagues that this country is exceedingly prosperous at the present moment, that it is enjoying an era of prosperity.  Do the supporters of the Government throughout the country believe that?  Do the members of the Ministerial Party find that their supporters in the country are convinced that they are in a flourishing condition, that they are quite satisfied with the policy of the Minister for Agriculture, with the prices they are getting and with the different burdens that have been put upon them?  There has been not only material loss.  That is not the only thing.  I feel that there is gradually growing up&mdash;and I always considered this one of the principal dangers&mdash;a feeling of despair, and that there is getting into the minds of the people the conviction that nothing they do, no matter how they work, can save them or their farms or the future for their families.</P>
    <P>Everybody will deprecate anything in the nature of disobedience of the law.  The law ought to be obeyed by every citizen of the State.  But let us <Col N="1880" /> remember that not merely is there a public duty on the part of the citizens to obey the law, but there is also the duty, and the very heavy duty, on those responsible for the administration of the law and the Government of the country, not to make the law intolerable for the people.  That seems to be forgotten!  It was always the tendency on the part of the present Government to take up the line: &ldquo;We have power to pass this law; we passed it; therefore we are justified in doing so.&rdquo;  Nothing of the kind.  It does not follow that because you have legal and constitutional power to pass a law that you are morally justified in doing so.  I admit the people are bound to obey it, but that does not mean that you are morally justified in passing it.  What are you doing at the present moment?  You are driving many classes of people into real despair.  Challenges have been thrown out.  They are the natural reactions to that state of affairs.  We have never countenanced anything like revolt against the law.  I ask the Government to realise that these are the natural reactions from a class that feel they are going to be wiped out.  Let Ministers try to put themselves into the position of farmers up and down this country.  Let them put themselves in the position of a farmer who asks himself: &ldquo;What is the future before me and my family? I have lived on this farm; my forefathers before me lived on it and cultivated it.  Now it no longer pays.  It has not paid this year.  Is there any chance of it paying next year or the year after?&rdquo;  What answer is such a man to give to himself?  He sees 60 or 70 head of cattle taken from him and his neighbours and sold&mdash;for what?  I admit that the present price of cattle is not high, but he sees his and his neighbours' cattle sold for a miserable fraction of even the price prevailing to-day.  Are Ministers surprised that there is resentment against the Government responsible for that particular state of affairs?  However regrettable&mdash;and any outburst against the law is regrettable&mdash;it is the Government must bear their share of the responsibility.  What <Col N="1881" /> are the Government doing&mdash;I do not say of set purpose: I do not know whether there are members of the Fianna Fáil Party who have of set purpose put before themselves the policy of wiping out, as an independent body, the farming class of this country; I should be slow to believe that any one of them would do it&mdash;but there are people outside the Party who have that as a set purpose.  But what are you actually achieving?  This is what you are achieving&mdash;wiping out that particular class; destroying the farming community as a body with some slight economic independence. In the better times these men were able to put by an odd pound this month and an odd pound next month. They had their little savings.  Now these savings are being eaten into, not to meet extraordinary expenses, not to provide a dowry for their daughters on the occasion of their marriage, but to meet the ordinary running expenses of the farm and of the family.  Now everybody knows, everybody who knows anything about the farmers of this country and about its history, must realise how that cuts into the very heart of the farmer.  There is nothing that he dislikes doing more than eating into the little savings that he has put by for the future of his family.  He sees it done this year; he saw it done last year, and he has no guarantee whatsoever that he is not going to see it done next year and the year after.  He sees no end to that particular policy of attrition so far as he and his work are concerned.</P>
    <P>I think that is a desperately serious state of affairs, and that at last the Government ought to wake up.  Not merely should they be conscious of the glory of the policy that they are putting before the country&mdash;I do not expect that at this hour of day they will see the futility of their aims&mdash;but they should at least be more conscious of the price that they are exacting from the ordinary individual in this country, and remember that price will have more than a bad material effect on the condition of the country.  I am convinced that we can recover from any serious material set-back.  If I look to <Col N="1882" /> the future with misgiving, as I do and have done for a considerable time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; it is not the material loss that I principally have in mind.  I think the destruction of morale a much more serious thing than even the material loss, however much the material loss is felt at the moment. But the material loss is going to contribute, and the sense of injustice that the farmer feels&mdash;a large number of them certainly feel that sense of injustice&mdash;is going to contribute to a loss of morale that may have a very serious effect indeed for this country, and from which it will be much more difficult, I fear, for the country to recover than even from the material loss.  The decrease of material prosperity, the breaking down of the morale of the country with the consequence of both&mdash; increased unrest&mdash;these three things combined form the picture which the Government have to show to the people of this country for their three years in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Was it strange that it should be acknowledged in this House last week and the week before that certain sources of revenue, certain taxes, had already reached saturation point; that if the policy of the Government is to be carried through other sources of revenue would have to be found?  Not strange for anybody who pays the slightest attention to the real condition of affairs in this country.  I want to make it quite clear that no class is going to escape from the imposition of extra burdens.  You have unrest amongst the farming community, and you have introduced a Budget within the last two weeks which must have the effect of creating unrest amongst the labouring classes in the towns. Why?  You have put up their cost of living; you have put extra burdens on them.  The necessities of life that they have to buy are dearer.  Consequently, their real wages will diminish as a result of the Government's policy of taxation, and that can only have one effect: labour unrest in the towns.  If the labourer wants not to increase, not to better his position but to keep it <Col N="1883" /> even as it was, owing to the fall of his real wages&mdash;I am not speaking now of his nominal wages&mdash;as a result of the taxation policy of the Government, that must lead to a demand for higher wages on his part, to industrial unrest and in loss to everybody: loss to the labourer and loss to the employer.</P>
    <P>I repeat what I said last Friday, that you cannot tax any class in the community and hope that the incidence of that tax will stay with one class.  If you increase the income tax it will gradually affect the whole community. If you tax the tea, sugar, butter and bacon of the worker it will affect the income tax payer.  That is inevitable in a complicated machinery such as our modern social machinery is.  The saddest thing of all, however, is, as I have said, the evidence of despair, and I am afraid that anybody who knows the country will find plenty of it.  Even among the supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party there are no longer the rosy hopes that they had three years ago. The members of the Party are themselves in the best position to know whether that is so or not.  Every person, be he member of this House or not, who knows the country can make up his mind on that.  He may or may not say that he disagrees with me, but let him decide for himself whether these rosy hopes are still there.  I have not the slightest doubt that, with the courage that always distinguishes him in this House, Deputy Donnelly will get up and say that the people are stronger than ever behind the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <P>That if they looked with hope to the future in 1932, it is with still greater hope they look to the future now.  I have no doubt that statements of that kind, which are easy to make, will be made.  But it is not what I say, or what Deputy Donnelly says, or what others say that will settle a matter of that kind.  Those who know the country are in a position to say whether there is the same element of hope now that there was three years ago.  The Government's <Col N="1884" /> lack of policy has driven the country along the road to despair.  The Government's lack of policy has killed hope in the country.  That is one of the principal reasons why I ask the House to support the motion to refer back the Vote.</P>

      <P>I support the motion to refer back, though I must say I have been a bit bewildered by the speeches I have just heard.  I agree with all that has been said as to how certain aspects of the Government policy&mdash;perhaps it is not so much Government policy in itself as the way that policy has been carried out&mdash;have leaned heavily upon the largest industry in the country.  Because it leans so heavily on the largest industry the repercussion is felt over the whole economic field.  While the economic situation is what it is, and while people throughout the country are suffering so severely I cannot for the life of me understand why gentlemen over there raise the Commonwealth flag to confuse the issue.  The people have to fight for existence now, and they are not concerned with the difference between a commonwealth and a republic. Go down to the man who is getting 3½d. for his milk and ask him does he stand for a commonwealth or a republic.  He would hit you across the face with his bucket.  People of leisure can shout about commonwealth and republic.  People of no responsibility can shout about a commonwealth and republic, but the people who are up against the hard, economic problem of paying their way and the problem, which has been spoken of here, of remaining in the homestead of their father and grandfather and ancestors are not concerned with the higher politics debated here.  Let those who understand the country bear this in mind&mdash;that what is keeping this economic wrangle going at the present time is that those who are suffering most are confused by the issue put before them, that one set of politicians stand for a republic and the other set stand for a commonwealth.  That is interpreted to the common people as one section of politicians standing for Ireland and the other for England.  That <Col N="1885" /> is what is keeping the majority of which Deputy Donnelly boasts&mdash;and it is there&mdash;behind the Government.  It is kept there because the Commonwealth flag is raised on one side.  I have no objection to this country being part of a commonwealth on terms.  But before we come down to discuss these terms, consider how the people of this country are going to live.  That is more important than any academic discussion as regards a republic or a commonwealth. The people who say that certain events precipitated 1916 and the election of 1918 are a bit wide of the mark.  Nineteen hundred and sixteen was not made in a night, in a year, or in ten years.  It was the natural growth of a movement which was there for a very long time and which took definite shape after the Boer War&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to criticise the President's Estimate and the President's policy, but the fault is on <Col N="1886" /> both sides.  Both sides are raising a hare which the country does not want to pursue, if they can get an opportunity to pursue the hare that will give them bread and butter for the time being.  I put down a motion to refer back the Vote for External Affairs. This discussion seems to anticipate that motion, in general terms, but I shall not go into details that would be more appropriate to the Estimate for External Affairs.  The conditions produced in this country by the withholding of the money payments to Britain&mdash;however desirable or undesirable it may be to withhold those moneys&mdash;do not seem to be appreciated by the President or the Executive Council.  In the debate on the Budget, the President admitted that the British were taking these moneys from us.  Would the President ask himself: &ldquo;From whom are the British taking them?&rdquo;  They are taking them from the agricultural community. The President was our negotiator leading up to the rupture with Britain. When I speak of the President I speak of him in that capacity, and I am not throwing personal blame on him.  He was the negotiator, and he failed in the negotiations when he allowed a rupture to develop.  An economic war was started between one country and another when, economically, according to the President's own formula, the ratio of strength was as 66 to 1.  The President was brave enough to pit the forces of the one against the forces of a country with 66 times the strength. The President knows that, in an economic conflict, the working of our finances is all-important.  He was aware that the control of our finances was vested in England when he allowed the economic conflict to develop.  He knows that central banking control is the key to economic development, industrial and agricultural.  The British had central banking control of our finances and have that control to-day. It would be as wise for the President to allow a military struggle to develop here without having a single ammunition factory in this country and our ammunition dumps under English control as to allow an economic conflict to develop in the circumstances that it did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1887" /> I should like to know in what circumstances the President thought there was the remotest chance of hoping to win the economic struggle, when Britain had control of all our sources of supply, all the ammunition so to speak.  The President says that we are called upon to compromise the national position.  The country would like to know how we have been called upon to compromise that position.  In the previous Estimate we were told that the Governor-General has been reduced to a point beyond which, if reduced any further, he must cease to be Governor-General.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>All the other members of the Commonwealth have Governors-General. Whether they pay them a few pounds salary more than we do is immaterial.  As each member of the Commonwealth has a Governor-General I should like to bring it to the President's notice that every one of them has central banking institutions. They are not bothered about a cipher, or a formula or a rubber stamp Governor-General because they have all the elements of nationality, control of their own banking, currency, credit, and finances generally.  I should like to bring to the President's notice what that means to Australia and New Zealand, competitors of ours in the British market.  Australia and New Zealand control their own currency and credit through their central banking institutions, and are independent of the Bank of England.  They are able so to regulate matters that their farmers have the 25 per cent. exchange advantage over us in the British market. They are able to get the same price as we get for butter in Great Britain, but when the pound goes back to Australia or New Zaland it is worth 25/- while here it is worth £1.  I should like also to bring to the President's notice the position regarding butter and how the country is facing it.  We have guaranteed 102/- for butter in the British market.  The price swings from 70/- to 76/- in the open market there.  When we send 1 cwt. of butter there we get <Col N="1888" /> 72/- for it, but there is a tariff of 20/- which reduces the price to 52/- and the taxpayers have to give exporters 50/-. How can the country stand it while such a situation is allowed to develop? It has developed as a consequence of the President allowing us to be forced into a conflict with a protagonist who is 66 times stronger than we are.</P>
      <P>When our economic resources were being so weakened with this economic conflict the President should have been able to appreciate that a change in the economic system, both industrial and agricultural, could not be successfully carried through.  There is no need to go into details to prove that.  The Budget of last week is living proof of it.  Taxes that produced almost £29,000,000 last year cannot be relied upon to produce £29,376,000 this year. Why?  As mediums of revenue, they cannot be relied upon to do so because the capacity of the country to buy is going down.  A very important thing happened during the year.  If there was one commodity in relation to which we could hit our opponents, it was on coal.  Real trouble had developed for the British Government in the South Wales coal mines.  On the one thing that was giving trouble to Britain the President gave authority for a pact, by giving Britain a monopoly of the market here for coal on condition that she would take cattle representing the value of the coal we took from her. The President is aware that the price of coal has gone up here, and that the quality has gone down.  Where does the advantage accrue to us?  Some 6,000 Welsh miners were put back to work and the British Government is not troubled with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Six thousand.  We must admit facts when we see them.  If we do not admit them we will be discredited. I was as much against the economic war as anybody, but I admit that the Government got a mandate for it the last time they consulted the people.  I take this opportunity of putting a proposition to the President. He got a mandate for the economic war.  Accordingly I do not agree with anybody saying that the Government must go and settle.  A policy of that <Col N="1889" /> kind is very little removed from: &ldquo;go and surrender.&rdquo;  Let them be right or wrong, the President and his Government have got a mandate for the economic war.  I put this to him&mdash;and it is a reasonable request, and one that I have reason to know was put to him through the channels of his own organisation&mdash;that having got a mandate, the fight must go on, but surely, if the fight is to go on, all sections should bear the burden fairly equally.  I put it to the President that when the £5,000,000 are being collected from one section of the community, which receives no compensation or indemnity for that payment, except the remission of about £2,000,000 in respect of land annuities, it is not fair that that section should be left to carry the burden. If the economic conflict is to go on, let there be an equal distribution of the burden.</P>
      <P>I think the President said here in effect that he did not admit the case I am making, but he admitted only last week that the British are collecting the £5,000,000.  Somebody must be paying that and I put it to him that nobody is paying it but the agricultural section of the community.  If anybody else is paying it, I am open to correction, but I have followed the statistics, export figures, etc., and while there might be anywhere from £100,000 to £200,000 of the £5,000,000 being levied annually off goods which are not directly agricultural produce, even that small amount would be negligible in relation to a sum of £5,000,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, especially when the Minister for Finance&mdash;and I think the President supported the principle &mdash;claimed that he was justified in borrowing for the bounties.  The bounties are being given by way of part compensation for the levies put on our produce by Britain.  These levies are put on in order that Britain may recoup herself in respect of the £5,000,000 I have mentioned.  Our Government gets that sum of £5,000,000, with the exception of the amount of the annuities&mdash;£1,500,000&mdash; which they have remitted.  I should <Col N="1890" /> like the President to make the case, which the Minister for Finance, I submit, failed to make when he claimed it was sound finance in those circumstances to borrow for export subsidies and bounties.  I want to remind the President that the story does not stop at the export.  If the President will study the statistics, he will find that our home consumption of agricultural produce is about the same as our export.  If the British tariff our agricultural produce to the extent of £5,000,000, there is a difference of £2,000,000 because £3,000,000 were given in export bounties last year; that is, in the aggregate, assuming that everything went down the line to the producer, there were £2,000,000 lost on the British market.  The President will easily see that the wholesale price of a similar quantity of agricultural produce marketed in the home market, went down by a similar amount, because the export price regulates the home price.  That would represent a net loss of £4,000,000 and I should like to hear from the President what set off there has been to that sum of £4,000,000.  I submit there has been none.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not even the whole story. Owing to this conflict, a quota system has been introduced and what agriculture has lost it is very hard to find out.  There has been a suggestion put up to the President before and he has turned it down.  I would put it to him again that if he has any doubt about the case I am making, the problem is surely big enough for thorough investigation.  Would he not consider it worth while to set up some tribunal of inquiry and see if agriculture can make the case before that tribunal which I am endeavouring to make here?  That is a perfectly reasonable request, and it is a request which, if it was put up in principle by the smallest trade union in this city or country, the President would investigate, and if a <i>prima facie</i> case were made, would, I have no doubt, set up a tribunal to investigate it.  Why not set up a tribunal in relation to a big problem of this kind, the repercussion of which has been responsible for loss of life and which has turned, <Col N="1891" /> I am told, the town of Fermoy into an armed camp.</P>
    <P>The President, owing to the neglect of this phase of the problem and owing, in my opinion, to his closing his ears to reason and not giving it the sympathetic, or even the business consideration it should have got, has to tax the people in this year's Budget in respect of an increased army vote and an increased police vote.  We have a special squad going around the south of Ireland daily, seizing the cows of people who cannot find money because of the neglect of this part of the problem brought about by the President's failure to make a good settlement when he raised the matter with the British Government three years ago.  Even if these people are in the wrong&mdash;and I do not admit they are wrong; I am convinced they are right, to the extent that it is a case of self-preservation, and when it comes to a case of self-preservation with me no law made in this House would control me if I could get away with it&mdash;they are driven to it.  The President has sources of information at his disposal and I am sure he has made inquiries as to the records of those people.  Are those the people for whom we had to remit land annuities two years ago?  I submit that they are not.  Are they the people for whom we had to fund land annuities?  I would say they are not. They are people who always paid their way.  They were the enterprising section of the farming community. Why does not the President make inquiries in this connection?  We have arrived at a situation where, in a dairying district, the court messenger and a special police squad go around and seize cattle.</P>
    <P>For the sake of argument let me concede all that the President believes of the people to whom those cattle belong.  Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that they are altogether wrong; that the Government has treated them well and done its duty by them, but let the President consider the problem which exists.  Their rolling stock is being collected at the point of the bayonet.  It is being sold <Col N="1892" /> at sheriffs' sales where no citizen of this country will go to buy it.  Not even the President's followers in Munster will go to any cattle sale either in Fermoy or Clonmel to buy their neighbours' cows.  Police have to be sent down specially by the Minister for Justice to buy them. They are then dumped in a special old ranch at the foot of the Carlingford mountain, Ravensdale Park, and got over the Border somehow.  They are bought at scrap prices.  If those people are to have their stock sold out this year how are they going to face next year?  What will pay the annuities and the rates to the Cork, Tipperary and Waterford County Councils next year?  Is not that a big enough problem staring the President in the face?  No matter what the Government may believe of those people it is no explanation of that situation to say that a conspiracy has been on foot.  If the President goes across the midlands what will he find?  He will find the same thing there in a more acute form.  I do not see any midland Deputy here.  The part of Ireland which has been hit hardest is the midlands.  Agricultural produce can be cashed in the south.  The milk which is produced daily can be turned into money daily, but across the midlands nothing can be turned into money daily and, consequently, the people are in desperate straits there.</P>
    <P>On Saturday, I visited what is perhaps the best land in Ireland&mdash;the land of East Meath.  All that land can fetch in the open market is from 25/- to 30/- per Irish acre for 11 months.  That is land&mdash;I do not know whether or not the President will appreciate this&mdash;which is capable of fattening two batches of store cattle in the summer months.  That land will fetch only 25/- to 30/- per Irish acre.  That is the economic value.  I doubt if in the last 150 years it was of such low value.  I am sure it was not, because if it were, none of the land in the country could pay rack rents.  I ask the President to consider those matters.  Does he not consider it worth while to have them investigated? Would it not be worth while <Col N="1893" /> to discover whether agriculture is a paying proposition&mdash;whether it is really holding its own?  If it is not holding its own all the industrial development about which we are hearing so much is going to be scrapped. It must be scrapped, because it cannot survive when agriculture is bankrupt. The social services which the Government claim to have instituted, which I admit they have instituted, and which it is necessary to preserve in this country, cannot be preserved unless industry is able to support them, and the basic industry in this country is agriculture.</P>
    <P>I want the President to understand that if I have criticised his policy and outlined the position which exists as a result of the economic war, I have done so for the sole purpose of bringing that position to his notice, and not for the purpose of exposing any weakness on our part.  Whenever I get an opportunity, either in this House or outside it, to vote for a settlement of the economic war, I am going to do so, but I do not want to say to the Government here: &ldquo;You should settle the economic war at any price&rdquo; when that Government has a mandate for the economic war from the people.  Consequently, at the present juncture, I did not think it was wise to have a suggestion made here to-day that the Government should make a cash offer to Britain.  Our stand in this conflict&mdash; when I say &ldquo;our&rdquo; I mean that we must all fall in with the majority view &mdash;is that the whole payments should be remitted.  My way of carrying on the fight then would not be to say publicly that we should come down from that plane and make a cash offer.</P>
    <P>I would say that the idea of settling by arbitration was a foolish idea from the start, and although it got a kind of recommendation to-day from a previous speaker, I hope it will never be introduced as a method of settling this dispute.  I do not care whether the chairman of that arbitration board or court comes from within or without the British Empire.  If we appoint a certain number of representatives to look after our case in that arbitration court, and the British appoint an equal number of representatives, some foreigner&mdash;<Col N="1894" /> whether from within or without the Empire&mdash;being put in the chair, what is the position then?  When it is an arbitration we must rely on our specific claim, and it must be the whole of that claim or none of it.  We must get 100 per cent. or nothing&mdash;and from whom?  Is it from our representatives? Of course not, because their force and voting strength there will be balanced by the British representatives, and it all rests with the man in the Chair, who may be a foreigner.  I do not care whether he is inside or outside the British Empire.  To suggest that we should now, after all the suffering in this country during the last three years, submit our claim to the jurisdiction of one individual would, in my opinion, be madness.  If we are going to face the situation as reasonable people let us face it by conferring with the British, having an equal number on each side. It does not matter if they put one of their own men in the Chair.  We are not bound to agree until we are satisfied.  If the British offer us 50 per cent, we can consider whether we will take it or not.  They can offer us 99 per cent., and we can refuse it or take it, whichever we think is best.  I see no way for settling this, with any chance of benefit to this country, except by negotiation and conference.  The idea of arbitration should be ruled out. I do not believe you will get any sensible man in Ireland to agree to arbitration. The day we agree to arbitration we agree to lose our case, and I hope that after all our suffering we are not going to throw away our case now.</P>
    <P>A good deal has been said about the unity of Ireland.  Deputy Donnelly has boasted, and I think Ministers also have boasted, that notwithstanding the criticism of Government policy from the Opposition Benches, the country prefers the Government to the Opposition. There is something in that, but the something can be boiled down to this, that the country is not getting a chance to decide.  I appeal to members of the Opposition to give the country a chance, just as I appeal to the Government to give the country a chance. Do not start waving before a hungry country the flag of a Republic or the flag of a Commonwealth.  Give the <Col N="1895" /> country a chance to decide on the economic issues, and you can rely that the country will give a verdict that will stop what is going on.  I know the country fairly well, and I know that the sentiment and the patriotism of the country are being preyed upon in the present conflict.  No matter what trouble and suffering the agricultural community are put to, if they are faced with one alternative, and over that alternative is raised the Commonwealth flag, then the majority of the agricultural community will be prepared to suffer on.  That may ultimately break up the country, and therefore I suggest that we have less talk about republics and free states.</P>
    <P>Those who were associated with the old Sinn Féin movement should remember that the place that that movement will occupy in history is now being tested and if, having won what is comparative freedom&mdash;to use the words of the late Mick Collins, &ldquo;freedom to achieve full freedom&rdquo;&mdash;if the whole position is not going to be prejudiced, let the Opposition as well as the Government give the country fair opportunity to decide the economic issue that is before the country, and do not allow that issue to be confused by bringing in matters that are not germane.  In other days a great Irishman was prepared to accept something for the country that he did not believe in 100 per cent.  The position the Free State finds itself in to-day is a nation within the British Commonwealth of Nations.  I could understand people who do not believe in any association with the British Commonwealth of Nations raising the matter and seeking a justification to get out, but for the life of me I cannot see why anybody who wants to remain in the British Commonwealth of Nations should look for a decision to stay in or stay out. We are in it and we will remain in it until we opt out, and where is the sense of people who want to force the issue as to whether we will stay in or go out?  It is for those who want to get out to raise the question.</P>
    <P>If the Government are really sincere in their declarations about an all-Ireland republic, good luck to them.  I <Col N="1896" /> do appreciate their commonsense in not forcing that issue just now.  I hope when the elections are on that have been mentioned here or any other elections in the future while this terrible economic crisis exists, that economic issues only will be put before the people.  I do not see why political issues should be brought in here.  They only confuse the other issue.  The country does not want them brought in. The country is only waiting for an opportunity to give a straight vote on the economic position.  It is up to both big Parties to give the country that chance.  Of course individuals can have any opinion they like, but I do not see why the people should be asked to vote on an issue to stay in or go outside the Commonwealth when they are not looking for such a decision.  Besides, if such a decision is taken, it will bring us nowhere.  Individuals may have their own opinions on it but it is not for any man, or body of men, to say how far the nation should go, or that it should go no further.  Whether a Party claims to be republican or Commonwealth, the ultimate decision remains with the people and their right to self-determination cannot and will not be determined by anything that is done or by any issue fought out at a by-election.  I am quite satisfied that if the confused issues that are being put before the country were clarified and, if the country got a chance of voting for or against the way in which the Government is prosecuting the economic war, the Government would be defeated by a two to one majority, but political trickery confuses the issue and the country is not getting a chance of a straight vote.  I submit that it is equally the responsibility and the duty of the Opposition, as well as of the Government, to give the country that chance.  In conclusion, I should like to impress on the Vice-President the necessity, if the economic war must go on, the necessity for having the burden of that war equitably and fairly distributed amongst all classes of the people.  If he believes that it is so distributed, I am quite satisfied it is not.  I am not asking the Vice-President, or any of his colleagues <Col N="1897" /> to accept my view but I do ask them to note that the case has been made repeatedly both inside and outside the House, for an investigation of the problem.  If he agrees to that, I am quite satisfied that he and the Executive Council will have done all that can be reasonably expected from them in the circumstances.</P>

      <P>This is a motion to refer back for reconsideration the Estimate for the President's Department.  I have only to look at the very first item in that Estimate to be satisfied that any Deputy who votes fairly and equitably will decide on that one item alone that this Estimate should be referred back for reconsideration. That is the item which gives a salary of £1,500 per year, free of income tax, to the President of the Executive Council.  My submission to the House is that the President of the Executive Council is not worth £1,500 a year, with or without income tax.  My submission is that the President of the Executive Council is not worth a farthing to the people of this State. Further than that, my submission is that the President of the Executive Council has caused a loss of millions per annum to the people of this State. He is head of the Executive that is now in office and he is responsible for the whole policy of every one of his Ministers.  When I look round every single Department of State at the present moment, I can find nothing except incompetence, incompetence which is having a most grave and serious effect that will last not merely for our time, but I am afraid for many years to come, after this ill-omened Executive have ceased to occupy the positions which they have shown themselves so completely unfitted to occupy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I turn first to the Department of Justice.  When the President was in Opposition, good heavens, what a champion he was of human liberty. What a champion he was of the right of the individual to live his life, free from molestation of any kind!  I remember how vigorously he used to denounce coercion and how he used to produce the long litany of Act after Act which had been passed to coerce <Col N="1898" /> the people of this country.  When the history of modern times and administrations comes to be written I doubt if any name will be written in blacker letters than the name of President de Valera.  People may talk about Balfour and his régime.  But people will talk in stronger terms about de Valera and his régime.  I do not intend to go through at any length the activities of the Department of Justice and the inactivity of the Department when they should have acted.  I shall just select a very few items from which a conclusion can be fairly drawn as to how this Department is being run at the present time.</P>
    <P>The Department inherited a police force as fine as any police force in any country in the world.  They have demoralised many men in that force and they have brought in new men who are an utter, entire and complete disgrace to the force.  Thank goodness, the bulk of the Guards are still reliable men.  The bulk of the Guards are men who are willing to do their duty but there are others who, with the connivance of the Ministry of Justice, are breaking the law and breaking it with impunity.  They are breaking the law to this extent, that they are manufacturing crime in this country.  By their attitude they are driving men who, two years ago, would have loathed the very name of crime into actions which are breaches of the law.  I said I would give a few instances.  Commandant Cronin was fired at in Thomastown, Kilkenny.  The evidence was clear and strong that he was fired at by these members of the new branch of the Guards.  I put question after question on the matter in this House.  I pointed out how strong the evidence was, how the firing could have been done by nobody else, but the answer I got was that it was Commandant Cronin himself who, within a few hundred yards of a number of Guards, staged this attack upon himself.  We were put off with that.  There was no police inquiry. The man was fired at, the charge was made, the evidence was produced, but there was no inquiry.  We have had worse than that.  We have had an incident which I have alluded to previously in this House.  We have had Guards <Col N="1899" /> not merely firing at Commandant Cronin but firing at short range, firing to wound and firing to kill.  We have had the bloodshed in Marsh's Yard.</P>
    <P>What is the result?  Is Cork quiet? They have tried everything.  They have tried shooting.  They have tried coercion of all kinds.  They have gone, in my judgment at any rate, so far as to tolerate murder, as they say, to preserve peace and quiet.  Is Cork quiet? Is Cork peaceful?  Is Cork orderly? That policy has always been, and always will be, a complete failure.  If this country is ever going to be a flourishing State, it will be because every citizen of this country is determined to obey the law, and that will never be unless the law is fairly administered, and unless the Guards are the first to maintain the law and not amongst the most grievous breakers of the law.</P>
    <P>However, I will leave out the Guards, because I believe that the bad elements can be driven out of that force when a proper scheme of reformation begins.  I shall go on now to speak about what the Minister himself is tolerating in his Department.  I made, Sir, on, I think, the Vote for the Department of Justice, as grave a charge as could be made against that Department.  I charged the Minister for Justice with a breach of his own personal honour.  I charged that the Minister for Justice, in order that he might bring a certain case before the Military Tribunal&mdash;and I gave the full particulars, which are to be found in the Reports, although I am not going to repeat them now&mdash;gave a false certificate. What is the answer of the Minister to that charge?  There is no answer.  I brought a charge of issuing a false and fraudulent certificate&mdash;and I do not think that any more serious charge could be brought against a Minister who is entrusted, by statute, with the high responsibility of government, particularly a responsibility affecting the liberty of the subject&mdash;to give special powers to the Military Tribunal which they have not got. What is the answer the Minister has to give?  He has no answer.  The charges were made, and the Minister <Col N="1900" /> cannot even deny them in his reply on this House.</P>
    <P>I mentioned, in connection with another case, where the Minister for Industry and Commerce had given a false certificate.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce may have given that false certificate in all ignorance, I shall assume; but no such excuse can be put forward for the Minister for Justice in a case such as this.  Article 2A of the Constitution is an Article which gives very special powers.  That Article should be administered, as it was administered under the last Administration, with the greatest strictness and the greatest care, and with due and punctilious and scrupulous observance of the very letter of the law.  That is not being done now.  Under that Article of the Constitution, there is power for the Guards to put a certain very limited number of questions, but that must be done <i>bona fide.</i>  It is not being done <i>bona fide</i>, now, however.  Men are being arrested; let out; arrested again on alleged suspicion; let out again; harried, harassed, and worried, and life made generally intolerable for them.  I have been told by one man&mdash; and I believe him&mdash;that in one month he was arrested and let out 12 times. I hold that that is an abuse of the law. I have been told&mdash;and I believe&mdash;of the case of a man who was a witness, being questioned by third degree methods for eight hours.  I hold that you have, through the President, the Minister for Justice, and the Department under the Minister's control, a third degree method which would disgrace New York.</P>
    <P>This is the Administration that used to talk at one time about the liberty of the subject&mdash;about the right of Irishmen to live freely in their own country. There was another thing that struck me&mdash;and this touches the Minister for Justice himself&mdash;the Military Tribunal has heard and adjudicated upon a huge number of cases, but although the Executive Council have not only the power but the duty to investigate every single case of a sentence passed by that Tribunal, and have, not alone the power but the duty to see that <Col N="1901" /> there is no miscarriage of justice in any of these cases, yet anybody who takes up the newspapers and reads the evidence contained therein will see that man after man has been sentenced on evidence which is utterly and entirely illegal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; but if the Court of Criminal Appeal refused jurisdiction and did nothing when the appeal was pending before it, I would have my analogous case.  I charge the Executive Council with this&mdash;that they have not in one single instance carried out their statutory obligation of revising those sentences.  I know that a certain number of men convicted by the Military Tribunal were let out. <Col N="1903" /> They were let out by the order of the High Court or because the circumstances in their case were exactly the same as in the cases in which other men had been let out by order of the High Court.  But of their own volition the Executive Council have done nothing.  So much so that the Department of Justice, as the net result of its policy, is having this effect that instead of encouraging the people of this State to be law-abiding citizens, it has by its policy and by its tyranny driven men who would, a few years ago, loath to be thought law breakers, into becoming law breakers.  I will pass now from the Department of Justice and I will deal, just for a moment or two, with the President's other Department, that is the Department for which he is more especially liable&mdash;and that is External Affairs.  As Minister for External Affairs we have got&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is a separate Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware it is a separate Vote but I am working it in with my general economic criticism.  What I am going to deal with is the Coal-Cattle Pact, and I am working that in with the general economic criticism of the whole policy of the Ministry.  I will say that the President negotiated the Coal-Cattle Pact, or under his aegis at any rate it was negotiated with Great Britain. While this country rang again and again from platform after platform with the cry that there must be no truck, no dealing with Great Britain, no treaty of any kind with Great Britain, we have this pact negotiated. We were told, again and again, that there was to be no pact of any kind, and one of the devoted supporters of the present Administration, Deputy Corish, the poor man, reiterated that under no circumstances must there be any conciliation with the British. And his speech was published in the very same paper that announced that the treaty of the Coal-Cattle Pact had been entered into.  Now that pact has been criticised.  Its benefits are unilateral.  We know, so far as agricultural persons are concerned, and <Col N="1904" /> we know so far as those who rear or sell cattle in this country are concerned, that the Coal-Cattle Pact has been no use.  The enlarged quota has been of no use.  The prices in our local fairs have not risen because of that quota.  As a matter of fact, they have been lower after the negotiation of the pact than they were before. Go down to my own constituency and you will find really good two-year-old bullocks being sold for £4 each.  We, therefore, have this pact which is of benefit to Great Britain but of no benefit certainly to the agriculturists of this country, whatever benefit it may be to those chosen, spoilt children of the Government who are happy enough to do a flourishing trade directly or indirectly either by exporting cattle on the licences they get from the Government or selling these licences.  It may be that this system has enriched them, but it certainly has been of no use to the agriculturists or producers of cattle in this country.</P>
      <P>The President who some time ago would have no truck and no dealing at all with England was able to negotiate this Coal-Cattle Pact. There he was in his usual form, always in the wrong, everything by turns and nothing long.  One day he is incapable of dealing with England at all, of having any negotiations with England and the next day he is able to have this Coal-Cattle Pact carried through.  If he is able to carry out this Coal-Cattle Pact why should he not be able to go the whole extreme?  If he is able to do a small thing why not do the big thing? The principle at issue is exactly the same.  If he is able to do the small thing in negotiating this Coal-Cattle Pact why not do the big thing in negotiating a lasting settlement of the whole economic war which is a thing this country requires?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me for a moment turn to what Deputy Belton said about the economic war and the talk about the Commonwealth and the republic.  So far as my views are concerned I look upon membership of the Commonwealth, as against having a republic as a mere matter of form.  We have now all the liberty that the country <Col N="1905" /> could desire.  The form of Government which makes for the economic prosperity of this country and the greatest harmony with our neighbours, without which that prosperity cannot be fully developed and secured, is the form of Government I support.  In my opinion, that form of Government is here and now the British Commonwealth of Nations.  I regard with terror what would be the economic condition of this country and, above all, what would be the economic condition of my own constituency, Mayo, if the English market were closed not only for Irish cattle and Irish farm produce but if it were also closed for Irish labour.</P>
    <P>I charged the President in my Budget speech the other night with wasting money in the Army Vote on his Volunteer Force.  The President gave, I think, the most childish answer which has ever been given by any Minister in this House.  He said the Volunteer Force was required because if there was a great European war and one of the great Powers was determined to invade and capture this country, the Volunteer Force and the Army would be there, sufficient and adequate to defend the shores of our country.  Surely, that is absolutely ludicrous.  The regular Army consists of about 6,000 men and the Volunteers, untrained, probably would be just as dangerous to the regulars as they would be to the enemy.  How on earth could they repel an invasion by a foreign country with a fleet of aeroplanes, a fleet of battleships and an expeditionary force of 50,000 or 60,000 men?  The thing is absurd.  If any great Power wished or was allowed by other great Powers to invade this country, although I believe our regular Army would fight as well and as skilfully as any army of a similar size, or any men similar in numbers chosen from any other army, it would be absolutely absurd to think that our Army, helped or not helped by the Volunteer force, could repel an invasion.  That this so-called Volunteer force&mdash;because it is that anomalous thing a Volunteer force that is paid, which is a contradiction in terms&mdash;would be any use if <Col N="1906" /> there was a foreign invasion here is simply a childish bit of rhetoric only suited to a Fianna Fáil nursery.</P>
    <P>Let me come to another branch of the present Administration&mdash;the Department of Finance.  The Estimates for this year are up by £6,750,000 over the Estimates for the last year that the Cumann na nGaedheal Government were in office.  We hear from the Government Benches, and from their devoted and attached, but now seemingly very unhappy adherents in the Labour Party: &ldquo;Oh, yes, there has been all this taxation, but think of the extra social services which the people are getting in return for all this taxation.&rdquo; Take all the social services, unemployment assistance, free meat, free milk and everything else, and put them together, be as generous as ever you like about them, and you cannot make them tot up to £2,000,000.  Is it a good thing, even from the labour point of view, or any other point of view, that this country should be taxed to the extent of £6,750,000 extra when only £2,750,000 at the outside&mdash;to give figures against my own argument &mdash;can be said to be spent in extra social services?  Where is the other £4,000,000 going?  Going in sheer, absolute, and entire waste; going to show up the incompetence of this Administration, which was to cut down expenditure, and could clearly see how expenditure could be cut down, by £2,000,000, but who now put it up by £6,750,000, nearly £10,000,000 over the Minister for Industry and Commerce's estimate in his famous speech at Castlebar.  That is all supposed to be a proof of the economic skill of the Executive Council over which President de Valera presides.</P>
    <P>That leads me to the branch of this administration in which I am most concerned, that is the reactions of this Budget, with its extra taxes upon tea, sugar, flour, tobacco, and what are the necessaries of life, upon those in whom I am most interested, the persons who form the majority of the voters in my constituency and who sent me here to represent them&mdash;the ordinary people of the country.  I have sympathy with the speeches made in this House from day <Col N="1907" /> to day as to how some farmers are suffering here and large farmers are suffering there.  I have deep sympathy with the farmers who are suffering, no matter what may be the extent of their farms.  But I feel a far deeper sympathy with the persons who are suffering the worst of all, and those are the small holders, the country people of Connaught and Munster.  Those are the people whose means of livelihood has been taken away.  Those are the honest working people who wish to earn their living by honest labour, and many of whom are now being driven to what they would have considered to be a disgrace two years ago, to live on charity and to suffer the demoralisation which springs from the receipt of public charity.</P>
    <P>Thank goodness that demoralisation has not spread in my own constituency as it has spread, I know, in other places.  Not merely supporters of this Party but supporters of the Party opposite and of the I.R.A. have gone from my county in their hundreds this year to earn an honest wage in England rather than live upon charity in this State.  They have preserved their manhood; they have not degraded themselves; and all the Government's policy, because it must be the Government's policy to degrade and demoralise the people of this State, has, I am glad to say, as far as my constituents are concerned, been a failure.  But there are houses from which no worker could go; there are houses in which the old age pension is not sufficient to keep them alive.  There are houses in the poor districts up in the wilds of the mountains, and there the more you get west the worse the destitution becomes.  I wish some members of the Executive Council who sit in Merrion Street and never leave it except to go out and address some political meeting, or some members of the Fianna Fáil Party with open minds would go round the mountains of Mayo and learn what is happening there.  I do believe that then there would be some change in the Government policy.  But though I believe, and I admit it, that the Fianna Fáil Administration are politicians first and politicians last, I do not believe <Col N="1908" /> any politician, no matter how strong his political views might be, could see with indifference the suffering which the policy of this Government is bringing on the very poor in the mountainy villages and the lowland plains where the holdings are small in my county and in counties similarly circumstanced.</P>
    <P>If ever there was an Administration which found a country flourishing, prosperous and contented, and turned that country into a poverty-stricken, discontented land, it is the Administration sitting opposite; they have done all that just in the space of three short years.  They found a land irrigated with a great stream of money, the result of our export trade and various branches of agriculture and especially live stock.  They have succeeded in cutting off that great source of supply. They boast of it, and have gone round with their watering cans to some little area under a wheat scheme, and to some little area under a beet scheme promoted at the expense of the people. But they have hit all the principal sources of prosperity in this country. They are driving the farmers, large and small, but especially the small farmers, to destroy their cattle.  They are driving them to till their land without manure because they have not the money to buy manure.  They are driving them to poverty and impoverishing their land in a way that it will take many years to recover from. With all their shifts and all their efforts, with all their little temporary expedients, and their system of living from hand to mouth, this Government have failed even for the short years they have been in office, exhausting capital as they have done, to keep up anything like the standard of prosperity they found in the country when they took office.  For that reason and because they are an incompetent Administration, as I said in the opening of my speech, I think that at any rate £1,500 a year, free of tax, which is being given to the President of the Executive Council is the worst expenditure of money that has ever been made in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Some time ago, while Deputy Belton was speaking he deprecated <Col N="1909" /> the dragging in of academic points.  I was inclined to agree but, later on, I found him accepting a completely diabolical principle with regard to the Government having got a mandate for the economic war.  He seemed to think that if a Government had a mandate for an economic war, irrespective of whether that proceeding was for the good of the country or not, they were justified in going on with the economic war.  I opposed this Vote before because I thought that the whole Government position, and the principles which the Government accepted are fundamentally wrong.  The President has never stated clearly how he regards his own authority.  It will be remembered that, only a few years ago in this House, he said that certain people outside&mdash;that is to say, people whose method was murder&mdash;could claim continuity until 1925 when he meant until 1926.  When he took office here he tried to make an apparent change. He consistently argued that the authority his Government existed on was the sole reason that he got the support of the majority of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This implication, that if another constitutional form existed here and that a Government was subsequently elected on some other form than a majority that Government would not have authority seems to be a very academic point.  But let us see how it works out.  If the President precipitated what is called the economic war which imposes appalling injustice, first of all on the people of the country, and secondly, in a very special way, upon a special class of the community, his only attempt to justify that would be his republicanism, and by taking up the ground that his majority would justify such a course.  His argument has always been &ldquo;we have the support of the majority.&rdquo;  Right and wrong appear to him to be mere matters of quantities of votes.  Note how that works out.  He and his supporters going through the country upon which they impose poverty and demoralisation and ruin, think they can justify that by taking shelter behind the principle that they have the majority <Col N="1910" /> of the people at their back.  I do not recognise the right of any majority to impose injustice upon me.  Note the effect that this doctrine has already had.  Not so long ago the Minister for Industry and Commerce got up and talked about the Jamesons and Granards, as if they were doing something illegal in this country.  If they are acting illegally in this country then it is the Government's duty to make operative the process of law against them.  If they are not acting illegally, but are law-abiding citizens, they have the same rights as any other member of the community, and the Minister who gets up and talks about the Jamesons and the Granards is simply prostituting his position.  He apparently assumes the Government has authority to deprive the Jamesons and the Granards of their rights. They have no such power, and these people have their absolute rights the same as any other member of the community.  The whole note that the President has inculcated, not only in his own Party, but, evidently, in Deputy Belton as well, is a very solid foundation for a régime of injustice, and people have good reason to realise that fact.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not hear what the Deputy said.  The President goes round the country and says he is a republican but he adds that he has not declared a republic because it would inflict grievous injury upon the people of the country.  That is a peculiar doctrine.  The President first says he has authority to provide for the well-being of the people.  He asserts himself desirous of changing the form of Government here and in the same breath he asserts that such a change would inflict bad conditions upon the people.  That is to say, if I may interpret him, his desire would be that the authority of the Government is to be used to injure the people whose happiness he is bound to secure.  In order to put up a spurious case he pretends that national sovereignty gives one an absolute position.  He talks about getting <Col N="1911" /> complete freedom.  If we have not got complete freedom now, and if we are to follow the President's words, I can assert this: that neither this country nor any country in the world is ever going to have complete freedom.  He is holding out an impossible position to the people of this country.  He untruthfully says that the Treaty or the British are keeping us from that impossible position, and he uses that argument as an excuse for imposing hardship and demoralisation on our people.</P>
      <P>One of the chief, and most obvious, evil deeds of the Government has been the precipitation of the economic war. The members of the Government, including the President, went around this country telling the people that we had a legal right to retain the land annuities.  Sometime after the Government had been in office, I asked the Attorney-General, the legal adviser to the Government, in this House if he, as a competent, responsible lawyer, would advise the Government that the probability was that if that legal case went before any conceivable international tribunal, a decision would be given in our favour.  The Attorney-General got up and tried to dodge the question by saying that, of course, anyone would realise that there can be two sides to any question.  Now my point was this: there may be two sides to a question, and there always is when a case goes to court, but the job of a lawyer who is paid for his services is to consider the two sides and to advise on probability.  I asked him would he advise that in all probability an international court would decide in our favour.  He refused to give a positive answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, it is quite clear that there are two sides to that question.  One is, that it is probable that an international court would give a decision in our favour, but it is more probable that it would give a decision that would not be in our favour.  Then, that first probability is probably not right, but probably wrong.  The Attorney-General, the legal adviser to the Government, has refused to answer <Col N="1912" /> that question in this House.  The implication of his reply was this: that the probability is that if that case were tried by any international tribunal the decision would be against this country, and yet the Government have stated again and again that they have a legal claim to retain these moneys. I think there was a slight play upon words there.  You can put up a legal case upon nearly any point.  That was quite irrelevant to the situation, because the only thing that could be taken from the President's advice to the people of this country with regard to the legal position of the land annuities was this: that it could be taken as practically certain that any impartial, international tribunal would grant that we should be completely exempted legally from paying the amount of money involved.  Remember that afterwards the President went over to England and more or less&mdash;rather less than more, possibly&mdash;offered to have that case tried by an international court.  At a later stage, as Deputy McGilligan mentioned last week, other proposals were put forward: that two representatives of the Irish Free State and two representatives of Great Britain should sit around a table and see if an agreement could be come to. So far as the public heard, that came to nothing, because the President refused to negotiate unless he were allowed to retain the disputed moneys, and that the British, during the undefined term that the negotiations were going on, ceased to collect the annuities.  As far as one can interpret the President's attitude it was this: that he felt, or wanted it to be understood that his feeling was, that there was a certain inequity in the fact that the British should be collecting the land annuities in the form of tariffs while those negotiations were going on, and in that way rather prejudging the case.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of this year the public were made aware of the fact that negotiations had taken place between Irish representatives and the representatives of Great Britain on an analogous matter&mdash;the matter of a quota&mdash;but while those negotiations were going on the tariffs continued to <Col N="1913" /> be collected by the British.  The negotiations ended in an agreement, but that agreement did not carry with it a cessation of the tariffs.  It created a situation in which the British will collect in the totality of tariffs, a larger sum than had been paid previously.  From this almost exact analogy it is quite clear that whatever principle caused the President to refuse negotiations in 1932 no longer applies.  He himself, by his own action, has refuted any principle that he may have maintained at that time.  Only two weeks ago the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Hugo Flinn, when speaking here asked time and again what we could get?  Now, if we got up and said that we could guarantee, that by negotiations, we could get the British to agree that they should claim none of the moneys that are being collected through the tariffs, we know the dishonest, blackguardly and artificial case that would be made from the opposite side as it was before.  It would be said that our claim must mean that we were, in an underhand way, in communication with the British; that we had guarantees from them; and that the British were agreeing to do that in order to get this Party returned to power instead of the arch-patriot, President de Valera.  If, on the other hand, our answer was that we did not know, Deputy Hugo Flinn would then ask: &ldquo;What is all your argument about then?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think the case that is unanswerable is this: it is clear that in 1932 it was possible for the Irish representatives and for the British representatives to negotiate on the question at issue out of which the tariffs arise.  The President clearly has no principle which makes it impossible for him to agree to such negotiations.  It is therefore clear, inasmuch as even he cannot deny that the present position is inflicting hardships on the people of this country, that it is his duty, which he cannot escape, to find out now if the British will agree to do what he himself refused in 1932.  By his own subsequent action he has shown that, without any principle being at stake, he has wantonly committed the people of this <Col N="1914" /> country to suffering and loss from 1932 to the present day.  It is clearly his duty even at this late hour, to try to remedy that situation.  We cannot get up here and say what the results of those negotiations may be, but we can say this with reasonable certainty: that on any case based upon our inability to pay, on the economic position of this country as well as on the mutual interests of this country and Great Britain, it is eminently probable that the results of such negotiations would be, if not the complete exemption of this country from the payment of those moneys at least exemption from payment of a substantial part of them.</P>
    <P>I could not get up here and make any firm promise that a substantial part of this payment would be reduced, but I can say this: that unless the British Government has changed its mind since 1932 the President, without in any way departing from his principles as revealed in the Coal-Cattle Pact, could go over to England and negotiate.  He could fight his case there.  If he did that he would be in a position to know what exactly are the terms the British Government will agree to.  He could then come back and let the irish people be the judges as to whether it was desirable that the terms offered were such that they should be agreed to.</P>
    <P>His action on the Coal-Cattle Pact clearly and wantonly, without any principle being at stake, committed the people to the three years' suffering involved in the economic war.  It used to be said very often in this House long ago, that the job of the Opposition was to oppose and that the job of the Government, incidentally, was to govern.  Personally, I do not recognise that the job of the Opposition is to oppose.  On any point on which I thought the Government was right I should feel it my duty to agree that they were right.  That situation rarely arises, because there is a certain unity in the whole of Government policy which is based on entirely wrong principles, so that practically every aspect of their policy is contaminated.  While it is not the job of the Opposition to <Col N="1915" /> oppose, it is certainly the business of the Government to govern&mdash;and to govern according to law.  In this House we had a disgraceful spectacle, a situation that brought dishonour on the whole Irish race, when the head of a Government selected by the people and having its authority from God to govern and to maintain the reign of ordered society, got up and said that he was not going to be so foolish as to try to take arms from the I.R.A.  The mere holding of arms by the I.R.A. is illegal and against the law of this country.  Other people are not allowed to hold arms without a permit or a licence.  The President got up, as head of the Government, and said he was going to prostitute his position and give a certain section of the community a favoured position by making the law inoperative against them when they broke the law.  He knew at the time that these arms were held, not as another man might hold them, because of having them under previous circumstances, but for a set purpose.  That purpose was to use them against the people in an attempt to overthrow social order.  The head of the Government got up and said he was not going to enforce the law regarding the possession of arms against these people.  One of the contemptible arguments he brought forward was that the I.R.A. had its roots in the past.  Yet, within the past couple of months, he has used his organisation and his newspaper to argue the opposite and to prove that the I.R.A. has not its roots in the past.  To put up a specious justification for the prostitution of his position and for his disregard of the law, he claimed that these murder gangs had their roots in the past.  When it does not suit him, he organises all his forces to deny that they had their roots in the past.</P>
    <P>Not only does the President not apply the law against these people but, within the last week, what have we had?  We have had two cases, so far as I have observed in the courts in which police officers were fined for attempting to deprive the people of a right guaranteed to them by the Constitution. It is perfectly clear that <Col N="1916" /> these police officers were acting under instructions.  The Government which, on the one hand, permits people whose method is murder and whose aim is anarchy to be immuno from the operations of the law, on the other hand, orders the forces of the State to break the law for the purpose of depriving the people of a right guaranteed them by the Constitution.  Is it any wonder that the law is in contempt in this country under these circumstances? Ministers get up and denounce us.  The President, with a shamelessness that I did not expect even from him, used the word &ldquo;sabotage&rdquo; with regard to our actions.  Ministers get up, with a marvellous fund of righteous indignation, and denounce us for, as they say, advocating non - payment of land annuities, thereby causing disorder in the country.  Who is responsible for disorder in the country?  The Government, by its inaction, both positively and negatively.  Negatively, it has refused to make the law operative as it should be operative and as it was urgently required to be operative for the safety of the lives and property of the citizens and for the maintenance of that social order which the Government exists to maintain.  On the other hand, the Government has flouted the law and ordered its servants to break the law in order to deprive citizens of rights guaranteed to them by the Constitution. Then members of the Government have the shamelessness to get up in this House and complain&mdash; quite untruthfully&mdash;that we have tried to promote lawlessness.  There was no need to do that.  Time and again, in my constituency unfortunate farmers have come to me to know what they should do.  They told me that they were running, and had run, their farms for a considerable time at a loss, that they could take stock off their lands to meet the demands of the Government, but that, in doing that, they would be disposing of the means of production to which they looked for a livelihood for themselves in the future.  On every occasion, I told them that I could advise nothing else than that they should go and sell these cattle which they looked on as their future means of production, to meet the demands of the <Col N="1917" /> Government.  When I did that, I was still satisfied in my own mind that the Government had no right to make such a demand, that they had no legal right to this money.</P>

      <P>The general body of annuitant farmers were the owners of their land.  In owning the land, they owed certain sums which had to be paid to the people who advanced the money to buy the land.  They were the owners of the land and were responsible for that debt.  The money is now being taken from the farmers by the body that acted as intermediaries for paying the people to whom the money was legally and morally due&mdash; that is to say, to the people who advanced the money for the purchase of the land.  The Government in this country did not own the land.  In 1933, the Government passed a law here which stated that as the farmers in the past had to pay back the money advanced to them by certain people, in future they must pay their annuities to the Government.  The annuity, to the farmer, was the method of paying back the money advanced to buy his land. That was money due to a creditor in relation to the farmer's land.  The Government has come along and said: &ldquo;In regard to the land that you occupy, that you or your father before you bought, that you have been paying for for 20 years or 40 years, and that you are still paying for, we now enter a claim to that land and, irrespective of your former ownership&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I talked about the Government's disregard of the law that exists.  By the law, a man who has been convicted by the Military Tribunal cannot be employed for seven years after the conviction in any office in which he is paid out of public funds, whether they be out of Government funds or out of local authorities' funds. That is the law, unless the conviction has been quashed or unless there has been a free pardon given.  In the case of a free pardon, a man may then hold office for which he draws pay from the date of the free pardon.  In the case of a conviction being quashed or annulled, then it would be from the date of the conviction.  As far as I remember, the Government took office in February, 1932, and their first formal act was to release men who had been sentenced according to law.  It is against the law for public funds, either of local authorities or of the Central Government, to be paid to men in that position.  For three years the Government has been illegally paying a man who to my knowledge was convicted. That is dealt with in the Public Accounts Report of last year.  For three years the Government has been misappropriating public funds by making payments to men that the law has decided cannot be paid out of such funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter was not reported on by the Public Accounts Committee, but is general knowledge.  Properly and appropriately when the Government took office one man was released.  That was depicted as an act of mercy, inaugurating a régime in which the I.R.A. and those who had been previously <Col N="1919" /> enemies of law, would automatically become law-abiding and valuable citizens.  The Government released one man and with the minimum delay made him an income tax collector.  As an income tax collector, it seems to me he is paid out of public funds, either central or local.  If that is so, then the Government has broken the law, and is misappropriating public funds for the purpose of making money available to a man whose only distinction was that he has been a consistent enemy of the law.  Here we have a Government which has never properly defined its own conception of its authority.  The only clear statement we had, I admit, was before they took office, that a gang of gunmen outside are the legitimate Government in this country.  We have a Government which orders its officials to use force to deprive citizens of rights that the Constitution guarantees to them, a Government that holds back the power of the law and refuses to let it operate against organisations which are known to be enemies of order and peace, a Government that uses public funds to subsidise men who have been convicted as being public enemies, a Government that does that, contrary to the express law in the matter; a Government which by its own admission in the coal-cattle pact has wantonly brought about a position in which it condemns the farmers to misery, and which has produced demoralisation, rather than negotiate or find out at least what settlement could be obtained.</P>
    <P>The Government started the economic war and the spurious policy of making this country self-supporting. The argument was for economic self-sufficiency. The only argument I heard in favour of it is that in conditions of war that would be a desirable position. No country in the world puts itself during peace in exactly the form it would be during war.  War in every country is necessarily and rightly recognised as an abnormal condition, which might inflict special hardships on the people.  Apparently, we have to disregard all the natural features and to organise ourselves as if for the rest <Col N="1920" /> of the time we were to act exactly as we would require to act in the abnormal conditions of war.  The policy of the Government with regard to the economic war, and with regard to self-sufficiency&mdash;if a proper case were made &mdash;we could face up to.  An interview in the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> by the President on one occasion was to the effect that a condition might be reached when the people might have to accept a lower standard of living.  If this country is going to live as an economic self-contained unit it must necessarily move backwards into some form of barbarism.  This country does not produce minerals that are vitally necessary for the form of civilisation as we know it.  If this country is to live as a civilised European country it must necessarily import from outside, and must pay for imports by exports.  If the people are to try to organise their lives so that they would live exclusively on the products of this country they must depart from the standard of European civilisation.  The President never had the courage to go and tell the people that.</P>
    <P>The economic war means also that we must move to a lower standard of living.  It is quite clear that if we are to try to build up industries under the shelter of tariffs, the very fact that tariffs are found necessary, means that the cost of production here is rather higher than the cost at which we could buy the goods at the ports.  For that reason, tariffs have to be put on to allow the prices to be higher.  The Government has, at the same time, a sort of agricultural policy, under which farmers grow wheat and are given a subsidy to do so.  What does the subsidy mean?  It means that the cost of production of wheat here is at a figure that to sell it to provide payment for other things would mean a price which it would not be feasible to ask the people to pay.  It is notorious that wheat can be bought much cheaper at the ports, if allowed in free.  On the one hand, the farmers are ordered to grow crops which, when they are grown, have cost so much to produce that they cannot be sold at a profit.  A profit must be given to farmers in the way of a bounty out of <Col N="1921" /> the public purse.  At the same time with regard to tariffed industries, that means that consumers must be prepared to pay more for goods manufactured here than they would have to pay if these goods came in free.  If, at one time, I could buy a pair of boots that came in here for £1, and if, for an Irish-made pair, I am asked to pay £2, under these circumstances it is obvious that I would have only one pair where I had two before.</P>
    <P>The economic policy of the Government is that the farmers are paying £5,000,000 to England where previously they paid £3,000,000, and then they are ordered to produce crops which are uneconomic because they cost more to produce than they are worth; at the same time the tariffed industries mean that the cost of production here is such that the goods produced could not be sold at the price at which they could be imported.  Where is the money to come from?  If a manufacturer makes his goods and they cost more than they could be bought for at the ports, if they were allowed in, and if the farmer produces goods on which he can only get a profit by getting a bounty from the Government because the cost of production is more than the goods are worth, what are we living on?  It is quite clear, in those circumstances, that we are living upon accumulated savings or capital.  It is only a month or so since the President went around speaking of the splendid financial condition we were in and stating that all the gloomy prophets were wrong because there was a sum of £9,000,000 a year coming into this country from outside in the way of dividends.  That is quite true.  The £9,000,000 dividends represent accumulated savings.  The farmers are producing wheat and beet at a cost which means that the production is only profitable by the operation of bounties; manufactures are being carried on which are only possible because the Government has, as one might say, farmed out taxation to manufacturers.</P>
    <P>The Government gives bounties and the Government gives subsidies.  Where does the money come from?  Nobody in this country, except in odd cases, is really producing economically, so far <Col N="1922" /> as I can see.  We are able to carry on for the very reason that the President pointed out, that in previous times, before the Government came in and, to a large extent, even before the previous Government came in, people in this country had amassed savings which were largely invested outside the country, and a sum of £9,000,000 a year comes in in the form of dividends.  The President says that that is our splendidly strong financial position, but it is quite clear that at the moment the big industry of agriculture, carried on uneconomically, is living on its capital. When we reach that position, clearly we should tighten our belts, but there is this peculiar situation that in the case of a man working at a weekly wage and, when he is in work, drawing his £2 a week, he can spend that £2, but if he is out of work and ceases to get that £2, he has of necessity to cease to spend that £2 a week.  In the case of farmers, it is rather different.  A farmer works with a certain capital in the way of stock, land, instruments and so on.  He has a certain reserve of capital behind him.  If his farm ceases to make a profit in a given year, or even if it shows a loss, he does not have to sit down and tighten his belt to the limit.  He is in a position to live for some time upon his capital, although, by doing so, he is creating a situation which will deprive him of the means of production in the future.</P>
    <P>We, at the moment&mdash;the farmers and the people who are assisting this country so enormously, as the President boasts, by bringing £9,000,000 in, in dividends&mdash;are living on our capital, so that, as capital is a fixed and finite amount, it means that unless that situation ceases, we are bound, at the end of some unnamed time, to reach a point at which that capital ceases to exist, and if that capital ceases to exist, we cannot have industries producing goods here at a greater cost of production than they can be bought for at the ports and we cannot have farmers producing wheat which costs more to produce than the price at which it can be bought at the ports. Then, we shall have to face up to the realities of the situation and, so far as I can see, it would be much better for <Col N="1923" /> the Government to do that now, when there still remains some proportion of the accumulated savings which existed when the Government took office.  It would be better to do that now by a certain bold pronouncement of the Government that everybody has to tighten his belt, including the Government, and that we have got to recognise that the heroic and patriotic policy of President de Valera means merely that the Irish people have to move to a lower standard of living and have to move rather outside the general standard of European civilisation in the name of high patriotism.</P>
    <P>That seems to me to be what the Government would do, if they were honest, but every aspect of Government policy, practically every speech from the Government Benches and, preeminently, those speeches made by Fianna Fáil Deputies through the country when there is an election on, have one mark in common and that is the mark of utter disregard for truth and for honesty.  Time and again, Deputy McGilligan from this bench has read out the promises with which Fianna Fáil went to the country.  They got in and then come along and say &ldquo;We have a mandate for this and we have a mandate for that.&rdquo;  The Government has been elected to use its authority and its power for one purpose and one purpose only, and that is to promote the welfare of the people of this country.  It has consistently and, I think&mdash;I do not want to interpret motives&mdash;largely for the purpose of saving the President's face and covering up certain undesirable features of his past, committed this country to a régime which means inevitable ruin and not merely financial and material ruin, but, as every symptom indicates, moral ruin also.  In these circumstances, I think that if Deputies in this House accepted their responsibility, which is to come here and to be guided by only one thing&mdash;what the welfare of this country requires&mdash;it would not be only our Party would vote against this Estimate, but every other Party, including Fianna Fáil, and even something worse than Fianna Fáil, the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan had some very severe remarks to make with regard to it in his Budget speech the other evening, and I suppose that Deputy Fitzgerald is now satisfied that he has disposed of any little shred of claim which that policy had before he spoke.  What occurs to one listening to these speeches is that if they are correct or well-founded in theory, how is it that the countries of the world can carry on, every one of them being based on economic nationalism and a much more thorough economic nationalism than anything we have arrived at up to the present?  I wonder what is Deputy Fitzgerald's opinion, for instance, of the Premier of France, who boasted a few years ago&mdash;not merely said but boasted&mdash;&ldquo;We are giving our farmers more than three times the world price of wheat&rdquo; and, I think, he said &ldquo;We are proud to do that&rdquo;?  So far as I remember, it was a statesman who is at present prominent in France &mdash;Monsieur Laval&mdash;who said that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, how is it that Italy manages to exist?  How is it that in every paper and in every magazine one takes up there are such glowing encomiums with regard to the success of the Mussolini policy of self-sufficiency? Deputy Fitzgerald, I am sure, has read many a time from very reputable writers praise, and glowing praise, of Mussolini's success in making Italy self-contained with regard to wheat production.  I think he has aimed at making Italy self-contained with regard to many other things as well; and it is rather curious too that in America, where they have had all this experience before them, they aim, when the crisis comes upon them, to do much the same thing.  If all this is mad economics, why is it that no country seems to have discovered that it is mad up to the present?  Why is it that we must be the first country to abandon it, and if we do abandon it, I wonder with what countries we will <Col N="1925" /> trade, because even England, which is, I suppose, the sanest of the countries from Deputy Fitzgerald's point of view, seems to be going ahead very rapidly on that line of uneconomic prices, uneconomic production and self-sufficiency, with regard to agriculture at least, as far as possible.  Surely, the Marketing Boards and surely the quotas that have been instituted are not based on free trade theories? These attacks are, to me at all events, very unconvincing.  When Deputy Fitzgerald accuses us of going out and making false statements at election time, I wonder is he quite satisfied that he and his own colleagues stick closely to the truth in every statement which they make?  They speak about the moral depravity which has overtaken the country.  Have they evidence of that?  We hear the word &ldquo;decay&rdquo; mentioned very often.  Is there strong evidence that there is decay in the country?  Certainly as far as country towns are concerned, the competition between those towns to get a share of the industrial development which is proceeding does not indicate that the people are altogether in despair, nor does it indicate moral depravity.  I think Deputy Fitzgerald must have some experience of that industrial feeling. As a matter of fact, to my mind, it is almost a danger, because so many towns are looking for those industries, and are so intensely concentrating on getting industries for themselves, that I can see a lot of disappointment ensuing.  Because of the mass production basis on which industries are being organised it is obvious that a great many of those towns must be disappointed. Whether or not I am right in predicting that disappointment, the competition between the different towns does not support Deputy Fitzgerald's claim that they are becoming demoralised.</P>
    <P>With regard to the country, some of us who are not altogether mad with Party feeling have not met with much of this despair or decay with which Deputy Fitzgerald and Deputy O'Sullivan seem to be so familiar.  On the other hand, we can see a considerable amount of growth.  I think, for instance, that if statistics were furnished <Col N="1926" /> showing the number of people who have applied for grants for the improvement of their houses during the past two or three years&mdash;and that is a fairly good test&mdash;they would not indicate that the small farmers are desperate with regard to their future, or have not the means to do anything for themselves.  On the other hand, those statistics would indicate that they are very hopeful with regard to the future.  From my experience, I can say that there is amongst the people a very big appreciation of the efforts of the Government to help them to improve their own lot, which, to my mind, is one of the best tests as to whether or not the Government is deserving of confidence.  The test is that the Government should show the people not that it is going to do things for them, but that it will help them to do things for themselves.  That is the real test as to whether or not a Government has fulfilled its duty.  To my own knowledge there are many thousands of families in this country who are very appreciative of that type of effort on the part of the Government. When Deputies opposite declaim against the folly of growing wheat and all that sort of thing, they should remember&mdash;even assuming that they are right&mdash;that they are acting as a damper on the feelings of some of the best people in this country; the people who remember the time when tillage was a great deal more widespread than it has been in recent years, and who have always yearned for a return to that state of things; the people who regard the growing of crops, particularly the growing of food for human consumption, as the mainstay of farming, and who, even if it were economically wrong, would wish that it should be continued.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied at all events that those denunciations of that particular item of Fianna Fáil policy are absolutely opposed to the spirit of the best farming in the country.  Deputy Fitzgerald referred to the farmers not being allowed to produce what they like, and not being allowed to produce crops that would pay them.  I wonder what crops would pay them, other than the crops which the Government <Col N="1927" /> is inducing them to produce?  At one time there was a fair quantity of oats exported from this country.  It was a rather spasmodic business.  The market was never a certain one. Sometimes France took a fair quantity of oats, sometimes England took a fair quantity, but, generally speaking, the market was by no means certain for even two years in succession.  I wonder would anybody contend that there would be a chance of such a crop finding sale at present?</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Bennett will have to admit that so far as the efforts to increase the acreage of wheat in this country have gone they have been rather successful.  I admit that nature has helped the situation.  I admit that the climate of these years has been particularly suitable.  At all events it will be admitted, I think, that up to the present the farmers who have experimented in that way have not regretted their efforts.  And I make the Opposition a present of this fact: that in my experience people who are political supporters of that Party are the principal leaders in that movement.  In certain districts, at all events, they have shown great enthusiasm, and I am sure a great many of them would not support what Deputy Fitzgerald has just said, or what other speakers say from time to time on the same subject.  I do not think all those prophecies about the coming ruin, about moral decay, and so on, have any real support in the country. I am certain they are not founded on fact.  I do not know why it is that Deputies should prophesy evil in that way.  Telling the people that they are in a very dangerous position is not going to help them.  I think it would be more truthful to tell the people that they are having much the same struggle as every other people in the world are having, and it would be only <Col N="1928" /> the plain truth if they were told that the Government here is giving them as much help, at least, in that struggle as any other Government in the world is giving its people at the present time.</P>
      <P>It will be admitted, at all events, that the Government here did not run away from any problem which confronted the country.  Whether their solutions are right or wrong, they have at least attempted to find solutions. Again, I say, that in my experience that fact is very widely appreciated, particularly among the farming community. There are farmers who are prepared to take a much more broadminded view of present problems and present conditions than those who attempt to speak for them here.  In my opinion, it would be a great deal better if an effort were made to concentrate on the real problems of the country, on questions which, on this side of the House as well as on that side, are admitted to be problems, rather than on decrying every effort which is being made by those in power. Deputy O'Sullivan made a remark to-day which I think he has already made during the Budget debate.  He made the remark that high taxation, whether it was good or bad, had repercussions generally; that the effect of a tax was confined to no particular section of the people; in other words, that all taxation is bad.  Certainly all taxation is unpleasant; we could all do without it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real logic of Deputy O'Sullivan's point, which he has repeated more than once, is that there is room for cutting down general expenditure with regard to government in this country.  In the Budget debate the Minister for Industry and Commerce challenged Deputies opposite to show in what line expenditure could be cut down.  If they cannot do that it is useless for them to protest against high taxation.  Have they attempted to do that?  I doubt if any attempt has been made in that direction.  Surely that is the real task?  I myself think there are certain things that could be corrected.  For instance, I am very much afraid the Civil Service is growing too rapidly. <Col N="1929" /> There should be a very big effort made to keep the Civil Service within its present dimensions&mdash;at all events, not to allow it to extend beyond its present dimensions.  I feel that when the people are depressed, when they are in difficult circumstances, there is one thing that will irritate them and that is the feeling, even if it be not correct, that there are too many officials and too many people living out of their labour.  That is one matter that might be considered by the Government. With regard to the general denunciation of their position, with regard to the criticism that has been heard here to-day, I have not found it the least bit convincing and I have not found it in any way helpful with regard to existing circumstances.</P>

      <P>I would like in the first place, to congratulate Deputy Moore because he has had the courage to break the silence that has been over the Government Party all day long. He is the first man who has had the courage to attempt a few words in defence of the President's Estimate. Not a single Minister of the Executive Council, when the policy of the Executive is under consideration, would sit in those seats opposite and not one Minister would made in to say a few words in defence of the President.  Deputy Moore alone rose in defence, whether it is a case of fools rushing in where angels dare not tread or angels coming in and the fools staying away; at all events, I congratulate him on his courage. His sincerity I doubt, because he finished up a very interesting speech by telling us, with an appearance of honesty and sincerity, that he deplored the growth of the Civil Service, that he thought there were too many officials and that they were costing too much money.  But the gist of his statement was in defence of the President's Estimate.  I wonder if he saw, within the last couple of hours, a Supplementary Estimate being circulated in connection with one Department for which the President is responsible, indicating a vast increase not only in the cost of that Department but in the numbers of officials? <Col N="1930" /> Assuming, as I would like to assume, that the Deputy was sincere and honest in his utterance, I would invite him to give evidence of his sincerity and honesty when he is casting his vote.  One of the afflictions under which this country is suffering is a deluge of dishonest insincere phraseology.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cooney agrees with me&mdash;he is one convert. But Deputy Moore is not one of those with whom I would associate either the one or the other, and, if he really meant what he said, then I invite him to follow it up in the one way in which he can demonstrate that he meant what he said and that is by his vote.  We have before us to-day the President's Estimate.  The House is called upon in connection with that Estimate to express its approval or disapproval of the policy that has governed this country for the last few years.  The outstanding characteristic, and the one fact that more or less dwarfs every other political activity is that that particular régime has been marked by three years of an economic war abroad and a political war at home.  The installation of this Government was marked at the very beginning by a bitter war with our customers and purchasers abroad and another bitter war at home against citizens of this State who had the courage or the audacity to suggest that this country had got to be governed along the lines that govern every country in the world, and that was by developing and extending its trade rather than, out of pique or for the sake of saving any politician's face, cutting the connection between our country and its markets and expecting to rear a healthy or a happy people in squalid, miserable isolation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>And because there were people in the country who had the courage to preach that gospel, whether it was right or wrong, the mob was first unloosed and incited by Government spokesmen and the Government Press until that mob was brought to a standstill.  When the mob had ceased <Col N="1931" /> to be a factor in stifling free expression of opinion and when the mob had ceased to be a useful weapon in intimidating the political opposition in exercising its democratic rights, then we had Government brutality that was never previously equalled in the long history of this country.  We had a misuse of the law and we had abuse of the powers given to the Executive under the law; so much so that prominent political opponents enjoy their liberty to-day merely because we have a free and independent judiciary in the country.  The leader of the political organisation opposed to the Government was illegally and irregularly slammed behind prison bars and only an appeal to the courts over and above and outside the Executive Council secured the liberty of that individual and subsequently we had the same individual and many of his companions and associates assaulted by the officers of the Executive Council, so that there again it was only through having an independent judiciary in this country that justice was done.</P>
    <P>Do not let us forget that the independence of that judiciary was challenged and tampered with by the present Executive Council, and when the Second Chamber proceeded to exercise its rights to step in between the ferocity of the political junta in power and the people who are looking to the Oireachtas as a whole for fair play and protection, then that Second House had got to go.  That is the particular policy, the particular type of activity and expenditure that Deputy Moore wants us to support.  I am not surprised that the main part of his remarks dealt with Italy rather than Ireland.</P>

      <P>I should like it to be more intelligible.  However, Mussolini, I think in the opinion of all is a very great man.  He has fulfilled a number <Col N="1932" /> of functions and held a number of positions during his life, but I think this is the first time that he found himself in the position of a red herring. He was introduced into this debate by Deputy Moore in order to take the minds and thoughts of the people here off conditions at home, and to divert their attention abroad.  The economic war and the political war at home has brought one result or set of conditions which must be clear to everybody who goes through this country with his eyes open or with any powers of observation. The period of office of the present Executive Council has been marked by economic depression, financial distress and rapidly growing unemployment, through the folly of the economic war. We have associated with these conditions prevalent and growing disrespect for the law, in practically every county of the Saorstát.  We have that disrespect for the law because of disrespect for the law on top, and because of the provocative measures deliberately initiated by the Executive Council in dealing either with those who have had the courage or the foolhardiness to criticise the path that the Executive is going, or to resist by any of the democratic measures, the foolish onward march of the Fianna Fáil folly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had directed from the top, disseminated through this country by the Government official organ, an attempt to brand as renegades, weaklings, and traitors, everyone belonging to this Party, or outside it, who suggested that this miserable economic squabble should be settled by bold negotiation. We had the cry of &ldquo;traitor&rdquo; levelled at every man who suggested that the responsibility that was on members of the Government here in this country was the same responsibility as was on members of the Government in every other country, that their first and most sacred responsibility was to step between their people and financial loss and distress, and that there was responsibility on members of the Government when difficulties arose between this country and any other country to grapple with these difficulties in a courageous, open, manly fashion, and to settle by negotiation international <Col N="1933" /> difficulties.  Because we suggested that, we had a deliberately inspired campaign to brand the political Opposition as renegades and traitors. We had the last shot in that particular campaign fired by the President in person last week, when he had the audacity to stand up in this House and charge the political Opposition with national sabotage.  When we want to meet a master in national sabotage, we would like to see the President of the Executive Council.</P>

      <P>Is it the act of a traitor to suggest negotiation when difficulties arise?  Were your own representatives in Ottawa traitors when they engaged in negotiation? The President, in referring to the economic war last week, said either a <Col N="1934" /> lot too little or a lot too much.  Of course, he trotted out the cheap phrase of &ldquo;Surrender.&rdquo;  It is a poor type of leader who has got to rely on that type of cheap phrase in order to wring a cheer from his followers.  It is a poor type of leader who has to rely on that type of cheap politics in order to defend the national position.  It is because of that poor type of leadership that this Vote is being opposed to-day.  A traitor to suggest negotiation !  Negotiation means surrender! Now, there have been negotiations and the men who engaged in them were not traitors.  There have been offers made and there have been provisional agreements reached.  Will the man who condemned secret diplomacy and backdoor agreements and asked that international business should be done in the broad light of day let the unfortunate people of the country know what the provisional agreements were and what was the maximum thing on offer? What were the agreements that at least convinced his own Ministers that a satisfactory settlement had been arrived at? Does not the President know that it is unjust to the people of this country going through the mill and facing loss day after day&mdash;that it was unjust to them to leave them in the position of apparently having no alternative between abject surrender and carrying on hopelessly forever?  Does not everybody know that there have been negotiations open and secret, that there had been offers more than once; that there have been big enough offers to convince even members of his own Executive that a basis of agreement has been reached?</P>

The President himself in referring to the Ottawa negotiations some 12 months afterwards, in order to blood a meeting down in Ennis and in order to play his part in inciting his followers against the political Opposition made use of a statement there that Mr. Thomas stated in Ottawa that there was no necessity to settle with the Irish Free State as the Blueshirts of Ireland would settle with that Government.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cooney is more interested in redshirts.  As far as they are concerned there is no difference between the A.C.A. and the Blueshirts. We have this economic war apparently to last as long as Fianna Fáil lasts; apparently no further effort is to be made by any Minister on behalf of this country to bring that dismal folly to an end.  In a spirit of pique or because of the reckless phrases uttered in the past, the main part of our population, the basic industry of our country is to go rapidly to the wall.  Deputy Fitzgerald finished up his speech by saying that we were living on capital.  I believe we are long past that point.  The population of this country has ceased to live on capital. In the main it is living on credit and on the Irish Sweepstakes both of them built up in the face of Fianna Fáil opposition by the predecessors of the present Government.  We have economic war resulting in loss and distress and arousing once again the old feuds, bitterness and hatreds.  We have a stranglehold from abroad on the main industry of this country and we have financial losses inflicted on the farming industry.  We have counties in Ireland with all the array of war machine guns, armoured cars and posses of armed men in the uniform of the State going around.  For what?  To <Col N="1937" /> seize and sell the goods of Irish farmers, to seize the land and evict the owners.  We have no better occupation to which to turn the servants in the uniform of the State than that. And while their attention is taken up with that and while the full weight and strength of the armed forces of the State are directed in such a way, we have the growth of evil; we have the growth of an armed organisation in this State, the growth to such an extent that this illegal body is prepared now to stand up openly and defy the Executive Council of this State.  We have ample evidence day after day of weakness and inactivity on the part of the Executive Council in dealing with such people, but activity and ferocious activity in dealing with the men that the economic war situation is preventing from paying their way.  Abroad the only effort and the only attempt made to rectify the appalling situation is evidenced by the Coal-Cattle Pact.  I saw where some Deputy of the Government Party quoted me as having welcomed that particular pact.</P>

      <P>What does it amount to and where do we see any continuity in Government policy?  When the 5/- per ton was imposed on coal coming <Col N="1938" /> from Great Britain into this country every Deputy opposite defended that up and down the country by saying that that tax was imposed to keep British coal out of this country.  We had a tax of 5/- per ton to keep British coal out of this country, and then we made a pact that if so many extra head of cattle are taken across the water we would take £1,000,000 worth of British coal.  By act and by pact we compelled this country to consume that £1,000,000 worth of British coal.  By a Government pact we make them do it, but we keep on the 5/- per ton in order to keep the coal out of the country. Or did you change your mind without telling the people?  Was your financial distress so acute that you went and mortgaged the coal trade of this country to Great Britain in order to saddle, in a left-handed way, £250,000 extra taxation on the hard-pressed and over-taxed people of the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is to be regarded as an indication of the direction in which you are going to go under the President's rule, what does that mean if you follow it a little bit farther?  It means that for every extra beast you want to get into the British market you will mortgage another little bit of the trade of this country.  Remember, you had a right to an unlimited market without tariffs, without any mortgage on your independence or your trade.  The people who talk about national independence have driven this country backwards very much on the independent path. The independence you had, in the legislative sense and in the trade sense, you have surrendered through the Fianna Fáil policy, by pact, to the outside country, and all for a contemptible fraction of the trade which you deliberately threw away.  I suppose you will be consistent, and for each bit of the trade which you threw away, and which you desire to get back, you will mortgage more and more the trade of this country and you will whittle away, by one pact after another, the real independence of this country.  So that if we are to learn from the past, by the time the present President's rule has gone another two years we will be a country that has lost <Col N="1939" /> its trading independence, a country in pawn to Great Britain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I followed Deputy O'Higgins's speech, as I always follow the speeches of the Deputy, with great interest.  I tried to find out the excuse for his working himself up to such a pitch of indignation about the application of the word &ldquo;sabotage&rdquo; to Opposition Deputies.  We heard that resented a couple of nights ago by Deputy McGilligan, and we heard it resented very much by other Opposition Deputies.  But I would ask Deputy O'Higgins to spend a little time in the Library some time during the evening, as I have done, and get hold of the newspaper files of about 12 months ago, when the great campaign was being waged against the Government throughout the country, when we were being swept out of office, under the leadership of a wonderful leader, to whom everybody on that side of the House was offering incense at that time. If he consults the files of any newspaper he likes to choose and then comes back here, I wonder will he find himself in the same indignant state.  Would he not be able, even with his prejudices against the President, to find some justification for the word &ldquo;sabotage&rdquo; being used in reference to the Opposition to this Government for the last 12 months?  Responsible Deputies on the other side of the House have gone to their constituencies and, in dealing with matters affecting the economic war, deliberately and point-blank told their supporters to pay no annuities and to pay no rates while this economic war is on.  That note has changed considerably of late.  There are more ways than one of sabotaging a country, more ways than one of putting a knife into a Government that is in office.  I do not think that since An Saorstát was established any Executive Council had to face the same difficulty and the same type of Opposition meted out to the present Executive Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>President de Valera is a most impossible man!  He will not do anything that the Opposition wants.  Not only is he impossible to the Opposition but, judging from what one reads in the <Col N="1940" /> Press of other countries, he is impossible to them, too.  He is impossible to anybody who is an enemy of this country.  He is impossible to people who sought to put over a deal of this kind.  He is impossible now, as Deputy O'Higgins suggests, because he will not arbitrate on this economic war. During the whole course of the discussion on the economic war I never said that any Opposition Deputy who suggested that there might be arbitration was a traitor to his country and all the rest.  But I think Deputy O'Higgins would be well advised, when reading the newspaper files of the period, also to consult the records of this House.</P>
    <P>There was a debate on the Vote for the President's Department last year, and quite a number of Deputies at the end of that debate had a more enlightened idea as to how matters stood than they had previously.  I think Deputy Belton will agree with me in that.  There is a document in existence which nobody knew about for nine years.  It was signed in February, 1923, and nobody knew about its existence until a dispatch came from Mr. Thomas on 9th April, 1932.  Nobody knew about that document in connection with the economic war until the President produced it here during the debate on the Vote for his Department on the 8th June, 1934.  I am quoting from Volume 52 of the Official Reports of the Dáil.  The other parties to this quarrel want arbitration, too, perhaps, but there are certain conditions.  One of the conditions, and the main condition, laid down is that the present Executive Council must first recognise as fundamental the document signed in February, 1923.  It will be found in Volume 52 that the President said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This is the precious document.  I brought it as an exhibit here.  I will show it to you, and if you have a smile left, you will smile when you see it.  Here is the document which is the basis of the British claim and which is so formal in its character that it could not be brought for ratification before Parliament.  This is the document whose terms are hidden away since 12th February, or whatever was the date on which it <Col N="1941" /> was signed in 1923.  We never got hold of it until we heard of it as the fundamental document to which Mr. Thomas referred in his despatch of the 9th April, 1932.  This is the document which is the thing that is standing in the way; this is the contractual obligation which is standing in the way and preventing us from being able to sit down with the British.  We are prepared to do it, but they will not do it unless we accept this document as binding.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is from the President's speech in a debate in this House 12 months ago on this subject.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins suggested that the President refused at any time or under any conditions to have anything to do with arbitration. That is not so.  I hold I am in order in reading that speech as a proof of the fact that certain limitations were placed by the British, which prevented the Executive or the President entering into negotiations until these limitations were removed.  That is the only sense in which I quoted from the President's speech of 12 months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins went on to say that in the last three years the President and his followers and supporters in this Party have spent most of their time in inciting mobs all over the country to prevent Deputies opposite from getting a hearing from their constituents. Another thing he said was that whenever the Seanad stepped in to prevent something from going through, we wanted to abolish the Seanad by way of vindictiveness for the action they had taken.  He also said that we were afraid to enter into an arrangement for a settlement by bold negotiations.  This is my answer as regards incitement to mobs.  I have never, in the whole course of any campaign on past occasions, or up to the present moment, countenanced such a thing.  I defy any Front Bench Deputy or Back Bench Deputy opposite to point to any speech, or definite remark, made at any time or place, or where <Col N="1942" /> any such action was taken that could be interpreted as an incitement to mob law by anyone in this House.  I defy the production of one such sentence from speeches made by Deputies on this side of the House.  I have a number of newspaper cuttings and went carefully through them.  After I had read them myself I had intended to read some here in this House.  I am sorry Deputy O'Higgins is not in his place.  I meant to read extracts from a speech delivered by him in the town of Edenderry on an occasion when he was accompanied by his former leader, General O'Duffy.  I do not intend to read it now in the Deputy's absence; indeed, I do not think it would serve any useful purpose.  All my colleagues, so far as I know, have always pleaded for the right of free speech.  We did that at previous elections and we will do it again because we know we have a good case.  I was certainly surprised to hear Deputy O'Higgins make use of these arguments, because the grounds for them do not exist.</P>
    <P>There were times, not 12 months ago, when things were pretty hot in the rural districts.  I remember going to Wexford about ten months ago to address a meeting.  Talk about expressions as regards leaders!  I saw expressions posted upon walls and painted on the roads about the President that would not be tolerated in any country in the world.  We know who is responsible for that kind of thing. Thanks be to goodness that form of abuse is dying out.  If Deputies opposite consider that they have been badly treated at public meetings or that mobs interfered with them, they should remember that there is a limit to human patience.  When one goes to particular constituencies in counties and finds, staring at them from the dead walls, these kinds of things, there must of necessity be some reaction and there may be trouble and disturbance in districts where these things occur.</P>
    <P>With regard to the abolition of the Seanad, I did not think Deputy O'Higgins would have referred to that, if there was anything else that he could go after.  At the last general election the question of the abolition of the <Col N="1943" /> Seanad was part of our programme. It was put to the people as part of our great programme that had to be carried out, and it is being carried out, and will be absolutely completed before we go out of here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am.  Of course, the Deputy is in a better position now, as his horse won at the Curragh.  Now, with regard to the general policy of the Government, the Fianna Fáil Party, as a whole, is responsible for the creation of this Government, and there is one thing that it will be remembered for and that it deserves to be remembered for. When that Government came into office and the present Executive took control, no matter where one went throughout the country there was a spirit of despondency and despair.  I frankly and candidly admit that a great factor in making the present Government the Government of the State, was the unpopularity of its predecessor.  They had been ten years in office and the people wanted a change.  If there is one thing more than another that the <Col N="1944" /> organisation that is responsible for the creation of this Government deserves to be remembered for, it is for the killing of the spirit of despondency and despair and the inferiority complex that they found in existence all over the country.  What do you find now?  You will find the people in the towns working on sound industrial lines and in many of them manufactures established. There is, as Deputy Moore said, competition between towns and cities for the initiation of industries. Deputy Morrissey would hardly go down to the town of Thurles and tell the people there that it was a bad thing that this Government came into office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy wants to have it both ways.  If he were to take the views of all the inhabitants of the town, I do not think the Deputy would get many people to agree with him.  An effort is being made now to develop the resources of the country, to try and do things that years ago were looked upon as impossible, and to create here the means by which the country can be permanently made self-sufficient. Deputy Fitzgerald said this evening that the farmers should not grow wheat.  He said it was uneconomic to do so.  In saying that, the Deputy was cutting right across the whole economic policy of the man and the men who laid the foundations of the movement that was largely responsible for the establishment of this institution. He was cutting across the principles laid down by the greatest economist that this country has ever produced or, possibly, ever will produce.  Arthur Griffith, by his works and his writings, preached the wisdom of growing wheat.  He pointed out to the people how much could be done if only we had that mentality firmly established in the country.  Deputy Fitzgerald, at one time, was a student of that great man.  Yet, he has the audacity to stand up here and tell the farmers that they cannot grow wheat. He says it is uneconomic.  He passed from wheat to industry, and said that we cannot have industry protected by <Col N="1945" /> tariffs because that, too, in his opinion is uneconomic.</P>
      <P>According to Deputy Fitzgerald we cannot grow the food that we consume or manufacture the articles that we require for our daily needs.  Was in any wonder that after ten years of a Government with a mentality of that kind&mdash;Deputy Fitzgerald was a member of it&mdash;we found a despondent and a despairing attitude, a menial outlook all over the country at the time that the present Government took over the reins of power?  That mentality is being rapidly dispelled, and if there is one name, amongst all others, that will live and be remembered in this country &mdash;the name of one who did a man's part in bringing about that state of affairs&mdash; it is that of the present Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He has worked night and day to dispel that mentality, and as the President said the other night when speaking on the policy of the Government, he has used all his initiative and every instrument that was at his hands in order to perfect industry of all kinds here.  Yet Deputy Fitzgerald says that it cannot be done. The facts and the figures are against him.  Articles are now being manufactured here, almost all of which used to be imported before the present Government came into power.  For instance, the quantities of boots and shoes coming in are now practically nil. The Deputies who sit on the Opposition Benches ought, at least, consult the figures and the statistics that are avail able before they get up and make the nonsensical statements we heard from them this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney was in an entertaining mood this afternoon. What seems to worry him most is that in his opinion almost every decision given by the Military Tribunal should be upset the next day by the Executive Council.  The Deputy occupies a rather peculiar position in this House. I have been wondering if other Deputies think of him in the same way as I was during the time that he was speaking.  No. 1, he is an ex-Minister: No. 2, he is a Deputy of this House and No. 3, he is a senior member of the Irish Bar.  When he fails at the <Col N="1946" /> Bar he comes to the Dáil, and when he comes to the Dáil and can get no consolation he falls into a reminiscent mood.  He thinks of the grand and happy days we had in this country when he was Minister for Justice, of the time when Deputies, if they complained of assaults committed on some of their constituents, were met with the reply that they were not assaulted at all, but had been kicked by somebody's cow.</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton rather surprised me this afternoon by his contribution to this debate.  He said that as a result of the Coal-Cattle Pact 6,000 colliers had got back to work in South Wales. I accept the Deputy's figure because otherwise I am sure he would not have quoted it.  At the same time, that is hardly justification for the wholesale condemnation of that pact which we have heard from the other side of the House.  I have not said at any time that bonfires should be lighted because of it.  I did not say that in my constituency and I am not saying it here. I do say, however, that a very insidious type of argument is being used all over the country by Opposition Deputies.  They have said again and again that the President is an impossible man; that he will not listen to reason; that he could get a good settlement with England if he tried to, but that he always wants to be at loggerheads with England; that he does not want to have peace; that he prefers to live a life of discord and of battle and to be perpetually fighting with England.  They have been saying all that.  They have said that no matter what occurred the President would have no settlement.  When this Coal-Cattle Pact came along and their arguments had been exploded&mdash;that the President was unreasonable and that he would not have a settlement&mdash; they attacked it and said that it was a bad thing for the country.  If the Government had not come to that particular agreement the President would have been described again as an impossible man.  It does not matter what he does, from what angle he approaches a question, some section of the Opposition is always ready to find a <Col N="1947" /> flaw in what he does.  I remember that at a few election meetings&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I tried to deal with that side of the President's character, which seems to annoy some of the Deputies opposite, and to point out how thankful some of them ought to be, in the sense that he was a little bit stubborn on many occasions.  If he had not been it is quite possible that a lot of the gentlemen now sitting on the benches opposite and in a position to bark here would not be here at all; that if, on a famous occasion, the President had only accepted a certain settlement, a lot of the nonentities now barking here would not have the opportunity of doing so.  Deputy MacDermot's opening speech this afternoon was reminiscent of the attack on the Budget, which was made by the six big guns of the Opposition.  He started off in a style that does not make very much appeal to Deputy Belton by praising the Commonwealth programme.  According to him, it is quite possible that if we conduct ourselves we may get into the Commonwealth at some time or other.  Unfortunately for Deputy MacDermot we have always had, and will have, a number of people here who cannot see eye to eye with him.  The Deputy seems to think that some day or another we will have to declare a Republic for the Twenty-six Counties, that it will have to be the policy of the Government.  If I understood him, he seemed to suggest that it should be done immediately. I do not think that anyone sitting on these benches requires an exhortation from Deputy MacDermot as regards his attitude towards a Republic, much less the members of the Executive Council.  I am ready to admit that there are some sitting on the Opposition Benches who feel the same way.  At the opportune time, when it is thought that a declaration of <Col N="1948" /> that sort is desirable financially, commercially, economically and nationally, then the men who have had charge of this movement for a long number of years will hardly hesitate to select the moment to make it or the language in which the decision will be given to the public.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacDermot also said that the economic war could be finished by a cash offer; in other words, that by the payment of a lump sum to England we could settle the economic war right away.  He said, when speaking on the Budget, that there were quite a number of people on the Government Benches who were always saying that England owed Ireland a considerable amount of money.  I do not know whether he qualified that by saying that he did not believe it himself.  I would give this advice to Deputy MacDermot: that in his spare moments he should look up a statement that was made by the late Michael Collins. I am sure that none of those sitting with him will repudiate it.  I do not see how they could.  I am sorry that Deputy MacDermot is not here, but the statement made a long time ago by the late Michael Collins was to the effect that from the date of the Act of Union up to the outbreak of the Great War, England had successfully robbed Ireland of the sum of £400,000,000 in overtaxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder would that authority be good enough for Deputy MacDermot. At the end of all these years and of all the talk about the financial relations between the two countries Deputy MacDermot comes into an Irish assembly&mdash;new blood&mdash;and tells us that the only way we can get the economic war settled is by paying a big sum in cash to the British Government.  Then it would end.  I presume the Deputy would go a little bit further and, if we were foolish enough to hand over that sum in cash we might at the next General Election see the real plan for which Deputy MacDermot is standing. The issue then might be made clear&mdash; perhaps a little bit before its time&mdash; whether or not this country would go into the Empire as one big Dominion. Put that as a policy against complete <Col N="1949" /> separation, and I wonder how Deputy Belton would vote.  I think that he would be with me.</P>

      <P>As we said on the Budget, we stand whole-heartedly behind our own programme&mdash;the programme which was before the people at the last general election.  There never was a more satisfactory time for by-elections.  We shall be going to Galway or County Dublin next Sunday and the succeeding couple of Sundays. When these two by-elections are over, the Government Party will be stronger in this House than they are now. Before Opposition Deputies go any farther in this nonsensical policy of advising the people not to pay their annuities and then passing in behind their backs and paying their own annuities, they ought to study carefully all the consequences of their actions. This is our common country.  No matter what Government is in office&mdash;whether it be drawn from the Deputies opposite or from the Labour Party or from the Centre Party, if anybody can conceive that Party as a Government Party&mdash; wheat will have to be grown to feed the people, the people will have to be clothed and housed and the resources of the country will have to be developed.  Another Government might put their programme in different phraseology, but they will have to give the inhabitants a chance to live.  That is what this Government has tried to do since it came into office.  That is what we are trying to do now.  As we started on that line, we shall continue on that line.  As the President said, there may be changes in certain Votes in the course of twelve months from now, but twelve months from now, I am confident that we shall have made the same progress as, if not more than, we have made in the last two years and that the country will be better as a result of our term of office.</P>

      <P>During the course of Deputy Donnelly's speech, you, A Chinn Chomhairle, had to remind him that he was not addressing an election meeting.  The Deputy, apparently, <Col N="1950" /> decided to get into training for the by-elections campaigns and he gave us a few samples of what he is going to tell the people of Galway and County Dublin.  Deputy Donnelly is probably the ablest politician and is, certainly, the ablest political organiser on the Fianna Fáil Benches. To him is due, to a large extent, the fact that Fianna Fáil are now the Government of the country.  The Deputy should mark the difference between the Dáil and the cross road.

      <P>It would be unkind to let the Deputy continue under that impression.  I am sure that Deputy Donnelly does not believe, for one moment, that the memories of the people are so short that he can get away with a statement like that. Then, we were told that Fianna Fáil had rescued this country from despair and despondency, that in 1932 the people were simply on their knees in despair, conditions were so bad and prices so bad, particularly for agricultural products&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>They looked to the Fianna Fáil Party to save them.  Without accepting for one moment the Deputy's statement about despair and despondency, we must admit that the people decided in 1932 that they wanted a change.  They decided to put Fianna Fáil into office on the promises made by that Party and, particularly, by the President himself.  Whatever else Fianna Fáil may be short of, they are never short of promises.  Does the Deputy believe that there is not more reason for despair and despondency in country and town now, notwithstanding the factories, than there was three years ago?  Does the Deputy believe that the farmers who are getting from £2 10s to £3 for yearlings and, in some parts of the country, for two-year-olds, are dancing a jig in excitement because Fianna Fáil is still in office?  Does the Deputy consider that the 125,000 unemployed are getting that chance to live which, he says, Fianna Fáil is to give them?  I should like to hear, when the President is replying, what proposals he has to put before the House to absorb the huge number of unemployed in the country.  I should like to remind Deputy Donnelly and the President that there are over 30,000 appeals for unemployment assistance held up in the Department of Industry and Commerce, and that the people concerned are without work or assistance. Can we have a statement from the President as to what is going to be done to meet that situation?  Can we have a statement whether the Government are going to carry out the promises made three years ago regarding the despondency and the despair and unemployment&mdash;that Fianna Fáil had a plan, and that it was comparatively easy in the words of the President, to solve unemployment?  What about the promise of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that unemployment would be abolished, and that so many avenues of employment would be opened up, that we would not have sufficient workers to fill the jobs that <Col N="1952" /> would be going?  Let us hear a little about that?</P>
      <P>Then we had Deputy Donnelly telling us of a visit he made to Wexford, and about what he saw written with white-wash on walls and roads.  The least Fianna Fáil says about the white-washing the better.  I saw expressions on walls and roads about the President that I did not agree with, that I was personally opposed to.  I do not believe in that sort of thing.  I do not believe in making attacks on any man in a personal way or on a man's private life.  I remind Deputy Donnelly&mdash;perhaps he knows it&mdash;that very often these things are done by people who have not much sense of responsibility.  Perhaps that applies more strongly to the Deputy's side than to any other side.  During his studies in the Library, when reading newspapers and reports did the Deputy go back to statements made within the last three or four years by a person who was supposed to be a responsible member of this House&mdash; the Minister for Finance&mdash;about ex-President Cosgrave?  Does the Deputy remember references to Carey and Pigott?  Nothing dirty enough or filthy enough could be found in Irish history that was not said of the ex-President.  Does Deputy Donnelly stand over such statements coming from the Minister for Finance?  Does he think that was a good headline to set supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party, or that such expressions should be used by any Deputy, especially by one occupying the front benches?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy might have approached this very important Estimate in a more serious way.  He is quite capable of dealing with it in a serious way.  I am afraid the Deputy was getting into his election meeting style rather than his Leinster House style. I suggest that after the next three weeks, or week-ends in Galway, he will come back convinced that there is much more despair and despondency now and that as long as the present Government is in office, and, in particular, as long as the President occupies his position, there is very <Col N="1953" /> little hope for this country.  Fianna Fáil was able to keep up the hearts of its supporters, and even of those who did not agree with them on what was said at the last election: &ldquo;Return Fianna Fáil and the economic war will be settled.&rdquo;  They were hoping from day to day and from week to week that it was going to end.  They are now convinced as every person is convinced, except those who believe, apparently, that the President can do nothing wrong, that there is no possible chance of the economic war coming to an end while this Government remains in office.  I am afraid the Government have succeeded in what they set out to do, to kill the live stock trade.  That seems to have been the declared intention of several members of the Government.  Unfortunately they have succeeded to a very large extent.  Yet we were told in a speech by Deputy Maguire on Sunday that when the term of office of the present Government comes to an end, the people will look back to the 1935 Budget as a land mark of the progress and prosperity of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest to Deputy Morrissey talking about the bad conditions in the country.  It is not too far to cast our minds back to the conditions that prevailed from 1929-1932.  When I cast my mind back, I remember that there were fairly long adjournments of the Dáil at that time and there were holidays of three or four months' duration. During these three or four months, I had come to Dublin every fortnight with my pocket full of writs that had been sent out by the Land Commission, asking for time to pay on behalf of the prosperous, well-off farmers in my area that we have been told about.  The farmers had the English market then.  The market value of what they sent to it from 1929 to 1931 had been reduced by £13,000,000 yearly.  While farmers sent over more produce they got £13,000,000 less for it in that market. The then President went over to England in 1931 and asked for a moratorium on a quarter of a million. He was told to go back home and to <Col N="1954" /> get the money, and he did so.  That is the gentleman who at the election in 1933 came along and offered a 50 per cent. reduction in annuities.  I thought he was going to let the farmers have their holdings free, if they did not pay.  That was the condition of affairs at that time.  When we hear of agreements we would like to know on what authority that offer was made.  What communication had the Opposition at that time with the British Government which entitled them to get up on public platforms and to offer the people a reduction of 50 per cent. on the annuities?  We were told the last communication they had with Great Britain was when they asked for time for a payment of a quarter of a million, and would not get it.</P>

      <P>I am dealing with a statement made within the last half hour. It was also made as far back as 1922. Deputy Morrissey spoke about unemployment, about despair and despondency.  I saw plenty of it in my constituency in 1932.  I saw mills sold in despair by the millers of Cork County to Messrs.  Rank of Liverpool. I saw gentlemen removing the machinery.  Mills that were working at quarter time then are now working overtime.  In addition mills that were closed when the ex-Minister for Industry and Commerce was in office are now working overtime.  On the pledges we gave the people we got employment for men who were walking the streets of Midleton.  The men were walking about idle, they were eating flour made from wheat grown by foreign labour, and were living on the dole, or less than the dole.  We had a benevolent Cumann na nGaedheal Government then, that told them that they might die of starvation, that it was not the duty of the Government to look after them.  That was the condition then.  To-day those men are employed and are eating Irish milled flour which is produced from Irish grown wheat. We had a Minister for Agriculture at <Col N="1955" /> that time who stated at Mooncoin on one occasion, after looking up at a rainy sky: &ldquo;Lovely weather for growing wheat.&rdquo;  Deputy Fitzgerald is still sticking to the same old story.  It reminds me how an old terrier sticks to a bone long after the meat is scraped off it.  Deputy Fitzgerald does not want wheat yet, but the Irish farmers this year have grown 200,000 acres of it, where only 26,000 were grown in 1932. That is a big change.  Surely those farmers are not all fools?  Those 200,000 acres represent £2,000,000 in the farmers' pockets in the form of a market which they had not in 1932, a market in which they can get a price and in which we can see that they will get a price, and a market which is not dependent on whatever price is ruling in the English market.</P>
      <P>We have heard a complaint about the charge of sabotage from Deputy Fitzgerald and from others who followed on the same lines.  Deputy Fitzgerald stands up and denies the charge, and then devotes the following ten minutes of his speech to advising the Irish people that the annuities are not legally or morally due to the present Government and should not be paid.  We have them down the country, month after month and week after week, at the same game and very few of them having the pluck to stand by those whom they have duped and fooled.  We have them saying down the country: &ldquo;You ought not to pay; it is immoral and it is wrong.&rdquo;  That is the kind of game that is going on, and these are the gentlemen who, when the squad calls to them, pull out a cheque book and write a cheque after telling their neighbours: &ldquo;I would not buy them back; I would leave them go.&rdquo;  The poor neighbour sees his 30 cows sold for £30, while this gentleman who gave him that advice writes a cheque for his annuities and his costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the kind of gamble we have through the country and that is the kind of sabotage we have through the country.  It is the very self-same sabotage that we had in July, 1932, when Deputy Norton went over to London <Col N="1956" /> to see if he could find any way, in conjunction with the Labour Party over there, of bringing the economic war to an end.  We had Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney standing up here, on the very night on which Deputy Norton was in London, and saying: &ldquo;We should decide to hand over this half-year's annuity, anyway&mdash;it could be handed over without prejudice&mdash;before there are any negotiations.&rdquo;  That was from a responsible man on the Cumann na nGaedheal Front Bench.  He was followed by another gentleman, Deputy Blythe, who has now taken his departure to the happy home, the Seanad. He made the very same statement immediately afterwards, that, before any negotiations were entered into with Britain, we should hand over the half-year's annuities to Britain and then make our case to get it back.  If you ever heard of any fellow getting anything back from John Bull, you are very green.  That is the kind of gamble that was worked here on the very night on which Deputy Norton was in London, and, on the day after, Deputy Norton was met with that very statement coined and prepared over on those benches.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we had Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney talking about the Department of Justice and the manner in which justice is being administered to-day as compared with the happy time when he was O.C. of the kicking cows.  If there was one man responsible for turning the Civic Guard force and respect for law and order into a farce in this country, it was Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney. He comes here with his crocodile tears for the small farmer and his statement that he was milking his cow and got a kick from the cow, when he got a belt of the butt of a revolver across the poll.  That is the kind of ridiculous statement we had. It was rather amusing to listen to Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney.  One would think that there was no farmer evicted during the ten years Cumann na nGaedheal was in office; one would think that none was badly off and that everything was prosperous.  I remember, when I arrived home from jail in 1924, I was met by the income tax collector.  For what?  For income tax that was due in 1919 to the British, and, by jove, they collected that income tax, and collected it with two lorries of Free State military with rifles.  Then they come along and talk about the outrage of collecting annuities.  We can cast our minds back to the kind of justice there was in this country for ten years; to the questions that were asked in the Dáil about incident after incident and to the answers that were read out of a book, like a gramophone record, with the same story for all of them; and we can remember when the Deputy, plainly and simply, and putting no tooth in it, stated that his idea of an efficient Civic <Col N="1958" /> Guard was a man who had been fined £2 for assault.  That was his test of efficiency in a Civic Guard&mdash;that, once a Guard had been fined £2 for assault he was eligible for promotion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only pointing out that if there is any laxity in the Gárda at present, which I do not admit, it is due to the bad training they got during that period.  I will not go any further into it.  I think I have covered all the matters I stood up to speak about.  It is calculated to try one's patience to have to listen to Deputies talking about the manner in which those negotiations were conducted, when we know the sabotage that was going on and the sabotage there was behind the scenes; when we hear them talking about justice when we remember the kind of justice they gave; and when we hear them talking about the well-off farmers and when we remember how well off they were.  I have often been told that I had cheek, but mine would not be a patch on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Much has been said on this Vote, Sir, and I do not propose to follow the example of any of the Deputies here by drawing up old sores. I prefer, when dealing with this Vote, to refer to the situation which exists at the moment in this country.  There is no doubt that the Government since it came into power, has, through the President and the members of the Executive Council, done much which has undoubtedly reacted to the benefit of the people in general.  I am not so narrow-minded as not to admit that the starting of industries or anything else which would tend to the material benefit of the people always commands my support.  Whilst giving the Government credit for all those things, I must, in justice to many of the people whom I represent, offer a little criticism of certain aspects of the policy which is pursued by the present Government.  I think it was about this <Col N="1959" /> time 12 months, when the Vote with which we are at present concerned was being discussed, that the President made use of the following words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We are going to hold what we believe to be our own, and if outside people try to coerce us and to make us suffer then we have only to make up our minds to bear that suffering.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As far as my knowledge goes nobody tried to coerce the people of this country, and I should like if the President would tell me on what occasion coercion was used by the British Government or the British people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to suffering, with all respect to the President I might put this question to him: Has he suffered as a result of the economic war?  Has any member of the Executive Council suffered as a result of the economic war?  Has any member of the Fianna Fáil Party suffered as a result of the economic war?  Has any member, even of the Opposition, myself included, suffered as a result of the economic war?  Have we made any sacrifice at all as a result of the economic war? I maintain that we have not.  In order to be fair, just and honest, I think it is up to anybody who advocates the continuance of this war, to give proof that he, too, has suffered.  My criticism of the Government policy is that it is only a section of our people &mdash;it happens to be a fairly large section &mdash;that has suffered.  Mind you, I represent a people who have been remarkable for their independence of opinion and thought and action; a people who have always been remarkable for their hard work, and who are not given to complaining unduly.  I do not think there is a Deputy in this House who receives less correspondence than I do in regard to complaints, and that is a very good sign of the character of the people whom I represent.  Hence it is that I, at any rate, am convinced that there must be many decent, hard-working people suffering uncomplainingly in this country as a result of the policy pursued by the present Government in <Col N="1960" /> regard to the continuation of the economic war.</P>
    <P>Three very respectable, hard-working farmers came to me within the last week.  One said to me &ldquo;I have 70 cattle, Mr. Coburn, and I could get an average of £12 per head for them if I could get a licence to export them.&rdquo;  Those 70 cattle would, therefore, have realised £840.  The second man was a farmer who had 50 cattle. They happened to be of a better quality, and were valued at £14 per head, or £700 in all.  The third had 20 finished cattle, and the average price which he said he could receive if things were normal was £17 per head, or £340 altogether.  I submit to the President that those are three specific instances of the sufferings inflicted as a result of the economic war.  Those people did not complain for any political motive.  They just told me their story in their own way, and asked me if anything could be done.  Leaving out what happened in the past, does the President consider it fair to pursue a policy which inflicts hardships on a very large section of our people?  It is very pertinent to ask whether, if suffering can be avoided, it is right or just that that suffering should continue?  That is my chief grievance against the policy of the present Government.  I would not criticise their policy so much if I were convinced that there was no possible solution of this very vexed question.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go over the whole history in regard to the question of the annuities.  It is sufficient to state that in my humble opinion it would be possible for the President to make a settlement that would be honourable to the peoples of both countries.  It may be news to the President and to the members of the Fianna Fáil Party &mdash;they may have forgotten the fact&mdash; that on the occasion when the President introduced his motion in regard to the retention of the annuities I voted for that motion, not because I believed the annuities were not due but because I was convinced at that particular period that it would be right, proper and just to have a reexamination of the financial clauses of the Treaty.  I just make that passing <Col N="1961" /> reference in order to convince the President that the members of the Opposition, and the people who are against his policy in the country, are not the narrow-minded bigots that one would suppose them to be if one were to pay attention to the speeches delivered here this evening.</P>
    <P>I want further to remind the President, lest he might not be aware of the fact, that, notwithstanding what has been said on this occasion, he receives a great deal of co-operation from his political opponents all over the country.  That being so, I am very strongly of the opinion that the President should do all that lies in his power to bring this economic war to a successful conclusion, because on the cases I have cited it is inflicting severe hardship on a very large section of our people.  Unless I am mistaken, or unless I have misconstrued some of the speeches that the President has made in the past, I am inclined to believe that this dispute with England is not confined to the annuities.  I am of the opinion that the President has brought in the whole national question.  If that is so, let us have it definitely, and I, for one, if it is necessary, from the point of view of upholding our national prestige, will be ready to support the President or any other President.</P>
    <P>At the moment I cannot see why the whole national position should be brought up in view of recent events. The President is well aware that men in the past set out to establish the freedom of this country.  Having fought valiantly and long, they had perforce to make a Treaty, and, following the Treaty, the Free State was established.  The President went into Opposition.  I am not going to refer to the events that occurred after the Treaty.  In after years the President felt that it was in the best interests of the people that he should enter the Dáil.  He did so, and, after a year or two, he became the President of the Executive Council, the man entrusted with the responsibility of government.  I think that in <Col N="1962" /> justice and in honour he should admit that to establish a Republic in this country now is an impossibility.  In the light of past history he should at least recognise the fact that it is not possible.  I would like to inform the President that there is an old saying that the man who cannot accept defeat can never hope to win a victory.  That seems to be the case with the President.  He thinks that he has not been defeated.  I do not say it in any spirit of bravado, but I do assert that the President is not in a position to establish a Republic in this country either now or in the near future.  Therefore, in my humble opinion, it is nothing short of criminal to start a supposed war with England which inflicts hardships on a very big section of the people of this country without any hope of bringing that war to a successful conclusion.</P>
    <P>It is a well-known fact that as a result of people being unable to dispose of their cattle, certain unpleasant incidents have taken place.  It is a matter of principle with these people in connection with the question of annuities.  References have been made that these farmers who are not paying annuities can go round in motor cars. That may be so, but I would like to remind Deputies who make those observations that if a man, through hard work and thrift, saves up money, he is not obliged to throw away that money.  If he is prevented within a given year from earning sufficient to pay his outgoings, then I hold it is a gross injustice to compel that man to draw on his reserves.  That is especially so if, as a result of a policy pursued by the Government, he is prevented from making sufficient to pay his outgoings within a given year.</P>
    <P>With regard to cattle, I would like to put it to the President that all the cattle seized in the South of Ireland, so far as my knowledge goes, are being exported across the frontier.  Since the quota regulations were introduced it goes without saying that before these cattle can be exported to Northern Ireland the people who export them <Col N="1963" /> must have licences.  I would like to ask the President, in view of the suspicion that is growing in the country in connection with the distribution of licences, to explain how it comes that the people who buy these cattle can get the necessary licences to export them.  The reason I am asking the President to deal with that aspect of the situation is this, that if the people who own the cattle were assured that they would get licences, possibly there would be no necessity for the seizures that are taking place.  In the interests of the peace of the district in which these seizures are taking place, I think the President should, in all fairness, in cases where it is proved that people cannot get rid of their cattle and because of that fact cannot pay their annuities and rates, see to it that they at least should get the same facilities in regard to licences as the people who buy the cattle are getting.  That is not hearsay; I am giving facts that cannot be contradicted.  No cattle can be exported now without a licence, except they take an odd hop, step and leap across at night without asking permission.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the situation to which I would like to draw the President's attention.  I refer to the present policy in regard to the employment of Irishmen in Great Britain.  This is a very important point, because no later than last week three men who have large families came to me.  They found employment in shipping circles in Great Britain, but recently, as a result of a subsidy given by the British Government to assist British shipping, in consequence of the conditions imposed by the Government in the granting of the subsidy, owners of British ships are compelled to employ Englishmen as far as possible and our Irish nationals have lost their employment because of that.  Surely the President must realise that he has some little responsibility for the position of his and my exiled brethren across the sea.  There are men who have earned a living for the past thirty or forty years over there.  What applies to three or four men to-day may equally apply to-morrow to thousands, <Col N="1964" /> and I would impress on the President that he has a responsibility to those people, especially those who, while working in Great Britain, still have their homes here in the Free State. They send their pittance home here to keep their wives and families, more or less enriching this country as a result.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, I am not one who likes to criticise the Government purely for the sake of criticism. At the same time I do not agree with many speakers on the Government Benches who argue that things have improved so much in this country during the last year or two and that it was never in a more prosperous condition than at present.  As I stated in the beginning, I am always prepared to give any Government credit for any legislation that will redound to the benefit of the people, but I should like to tell Deputy Donnelly and a few other Deputies, who talk about employment and so forth, that the official figures contradict them more thoroughly than I can.  The one remark I should like to make is that some Deputies seem to lose sight of the fact that although you may start people in work in certain industries as a result of a certain policy, the same policy may possibly result in putting other people out of work.  It is a well-known fact all over the country that men who formerly employed six men are now doing with five or four or three.  Of course, the dismissal of two or three men here or there is not remarked, but there is a great furore raised in the Press if a little factory employing 15 or 16 men is closed.  I should like to remind Deputies that two and two makes four, and that these twos and fours here and there soon run into hundreds and perhaps into thousands.</P>
    <P>I think it will be admitted that certain aspects of the Government's present policy have been responsible for a great deal of the unemployment that prevails.  I hope the President will endeavour to evolve a policy that will react favourably on the people in general.  There is no doubt that whilst some new industries have <Col N="1965" /> given increased employment, people have lost employment in many other ways.  Whilst the Government may have done much in creating fresh employment, I hold that, owing to our geographical position, for many years to come the country must have an export trade.  That is absolutely essential for the one great industry we have here, namely, our agricultural industry.  The mere fact of having good relations with England need not deter us from pursuing our internal policy in so far as the creation of new industries is concerned.  I just mention that fact because there seems to be an idea in this country that if we made a settlement with England to-morrow, that settlement would possibly mean the closing down of a great many factories that have sprung up for the past two or three years.  I think that is a fallacy.  I think it is only right and proper that the President should make the position clear in so far as he can dispel such opinions from the minds of our people.  Unfortunately, propaganda such as that has been carried on by many supporters of the Government and will I suppose be carried on at the coming by-elections.  I think it is a most dishonest type of propaganda. It does not necessarily follow that if a settlement is come to with England, such a settlement would be detrimental to the development of home industry.</P>
    <P>As regards the general position in the country, there are signs I think that we are getting back to normal in so far as peace is concerned.  That is due to a large extent to the fact that Fianna Fáil are now in power and that greater co-operation is being given to the Gárda Síochána than was given at the time they were in Opposition. I hope that state of affairs will continue.  One can see that there is an inclination for greater co-operation between the forces who are entrusted with the preservation of law and order and the general body of the people.  Notwithstanding the fact that references have been made to speeches delivered by members of the Opposition down the country, I think <Col N="1966" /> that, on the whole, no member of the Opposition, or for that matter no member of the Government, deliberately goes out of his way to create trouble in the country.  I suggest that it might be possible, and it would be to the best interests of the country, for Deputies to refrain from referring to such speeches.  Everyone of us wants the country to do well and I think it is bad policy on the part of anyone here to refer to what happened years ago.  Possibly we have all been sinners in that respect.  Let us rather look to the future.  After all, it is not the waters that have flown past but the oncoming waters that drive the mill.</P>
    <P>It will require the co-operation of all of us to get out of the position in which we find ourselves and in which other countries find themselves too. The economic conditions which confront as are not peculiar to this country.  We find them throughout the world at the present time.  Possibly if there was less said in the way of making popular appeals to the people it would be better for all concerned.  I do say that I can pride myself on the fact that on the occasion of every general election I made it a point to tell the people that no Government could completely solve the unemployment question.  I think the President will give me credit for that. I shall certainly go out of my way on future occasions to put that point of view to the people.  I know the difficulties that are in the way and I know that it is quite impossible for any Government to bring about a complete solution of the unemployment problem.  The best that can be done is to reduce unemployment as much as possible.  As to the best means to attain that object, there are differences of opinion, but there is no difference of opinion as to what is responsible for part of the unemployment. I repeat once more that our present relations with Great Britain are responsible for a great part of it. I do not say that in any slavish spirit but I think that the English market is essential to enable our farmers to get an economic price for the surplus <Col N="1967" /> agricultural produce, which they must export now and for many years to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion on this Estimate has wandered over a very wide field.  That perhaps was inevitable, having regard to the fact that it is the practice to avail of the discussion on the President's Vote to deal with the whole of Government policy. Consequently, we had speeches dealing with the position of agriculture, unemployment, the state of law and order, taxation imposed by the recent Budget, and with other matters arising out of the activities of one or other of the Government Departments.  The majority of these matters of course could be more adequately discussed upon the various Departmental Estimates. But it is perhaps no harm that this opportunity is available for the House to consider Government policy as a whole.  One, however, has been struck by the diversity of the speeches made by the Opposition Deputies. Very few of them appeared to be framed with any specific purpose in view.  In fact there was a remarkable inconsistency between the various speeches, an inconsistency, however, which we have become accustomed to expect in the public declarations made on behalf of the Opposition Party.  We have been criticised because the price of beet is too low and because the price of sugar is too high.  We have been criticised because the price of wheat is too low and also because the price of flour is too high.  We have been criticised because more adequate provision has not been made for unemployment. Particular reference was made to those whose claims for unemployment assistance are still under consideration. We have been criticised also because of the taxation necessary to provide the existing scale for the unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not, I know, in order for me to turn this discussion into a criticism of the Opposition, but if we were to have an opportunity of a general review of the Opposition policy as we now have an opportunity of reviewing generally Government policy, the discussion would not take very long because very <Col N="1968" /> few people in the House and very few members of the Opposition are aware of the policy of their Party.  That fact is very obvious from the speeches they make here on general subjects.  They can perhaps occasionally combine to adopt a common attitude upon a particular matter arising out of proposals for legislation, but when the general question of Government activities and Government policy is raised and they have been given an opportunity of explaining their outlook upon national affairs or their ideas as to how national problems should be tackled, it is remarkable that they have no positive or constructive suggestion of any kind to put forward or no common basis from which to work.  We have had a very glaring example of that fact in the discussion on the recent Budget.  The policy of the Government has been attacked on the ground that it involves a level of taxation which, in the opinion of Opposition Deputies, is too high.  It has been explained to them so often that they must have grasped it by this &mdash;that there is only one method by which taxation can be reduced and that is by reducing expenditure.  If we are to maintain a sound financial system; if we are to maintain national credit; if we are to conduct national affairs upon correct principles then expenditure approved by the Dáil must be covered by revenue secured by taxation or from some other source. The whole purpose of the taxes that are imposed upon the people and the whole purpose of the financial legislation which we discussed here last week is to provide in this year the revenue required to cover expenditure anticipated this year. Time and again the Opposition have been challenged to indicate one single item of Government expenditure in respect of which they think economies can be made.  They have been asked to name one Government service which they want abolished or one Government service on which expenditure should be reduced.  They failed to do it.  Their failure to indicate a single direction in which the reduction of expenditure should be sought has destroyed their whole case and made all their arguments <Col N="1969" /> about the Budget appear ludicrous and futile.  Is their failure to suggest a single method by which expenditure could be reduced, to name a single service which they want abolished or a single service which they want restricted due to inability?  Is it due to political incompetence or is it due to moral cowardice?</P>
    <P>Members of the Party opposite have had long experience of government; they were members of the Executive Council of this State for a much longer period than the members of the present Government and, consequently, we must assume that they learned something of the methods of government during these years.  And if, therefore, they should fail to support their pleas for reduced taxation by suggesting or advocating reduced ex-expenditure, then we must conclude that their failure is attributable to moral cowardice or to an unwillingness on their part to commit themselves to any definite policy in respect of national finances.  They can make no impression upon the public mind; their whole case against the Budget is going to prove to be no more than mere verbiage; it has no real significance for any individual unless they can put behind it some positive proposal. Taxation cannot be reduced unless expenditure is reduced.  What expenditure do they want reduced?  Which of the Government services do they want to see abolished?  Is it unemployment assistance?  Is it the old age pensions? Is it the provision of housing for the working classes?  Is it the widows' and orphans' pensions scheme? Is it on the Vote for expenditure for the relief of the unemployed?  By abolishing these services we can reduce taxation.  Do they want them abolished?  They have not told us. They were challenged, time and again, on that point, and always they sang dumb, although every leader of that Party, now a member of this House, spoke in this discussion; and so, faced with that challenge, they want to avoid it.  In so far as we have any indication of their policy it is one that is going to involve much heavier expenditure than anything this Government has attempted.  Their recent Ard-Fheis <Col N="1970" /> published a declaration of their intentions. They were going to derate agricultural land, a scheme which would cost the Exchequer £1,250,000, which must be got by increased taxation and which cannot be got from any other source.  They were going to provide old age pensions at 65, a scheme which would cost anything from £2,000,000 to £3,000,000, which must be get by increased taxation.  Apart from a few generalisations, these are the only two things we know about their policy.  They have not said that they are going to abolish any existing Government service.  They are not going to reduce expenditure&mdash;at least, they have not told us that they are going to reduce expenditure upon any of the schemes for the amelioration of the condition of the poorer people amongst us, but they are going to provide old age pensions at 65 and derate agricultural land in addition and, therefore, place upon the Exchequer an additional burden to the extent of £3,000,000.</P>
    <P>At the same time, if there is any sincerity in the declarations which they made here last week they are going to abolish a number of existing taxes.  They are going to abolish the tax on tea, the tax on sugar, the tax on wheat, the tax on tobacco and the Corporation Profits Tax.  They also advocated a reduction in several other taxes.  We want them to tell us how they are going to do it.  On behalf of the Government, I am nearly in a position to give them a guarantee that, if they tell us how they are going to do it, we will consider very sincerely indeed the adoption of their plans. They are going to increase the expenditure by £3,000,000, and at the same time abolish a number of existing taxes.  How?  We invite them to tell us how.  The public are entitled to know; the members of the Dáil are entitled to know and the members of their own Party are entitled to know. They cannot expect to get away with a mysterious silence upon that point.</P>
    <P>It may be that they are making the old mistake which they always made as a political Party&mdash;trying to avoid doing the unpopular thing.  They told us here, as members of that Party have <Col N="1971" /> told us this afternoon, that they are glad to see industries being established, but on every occasion when proposals designed to produce the establishment of new industries are brought before the House they vote against them because they think it is the popular thing to do at the moment.  Certain people are going to be inconvenienced by the new measures; certain existing trade arrangements are going to be upset; so they seek momentary popularity by voting against those measures.  But when the new factories are brought into existence and ceremonies in connection with the openings take place they will be there, every one of them, in their own constituencies, as the occasion arises.  They will be there to make speeches saying how glad they are that these developments have taken place and how they cooperated with the Government in producing them.</P>

      <P>I have heard a member of that Party speaking at a function associated with the opening of a tobacco re-handling station saying how glad he was that that development was taking place and how it was the policy of his Party to promote that development, when the only positive declaration which we had from one of its leaders upon the whole tobacco policy was the statement of Deputy Hogan, that he would as soon think of growing bananas in this country as growing tobacco.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The criticism of the Government which Deputies attempted in this discussion has had no effect and no force behind it, because they do not know where they stand themselves.  There is only one possible method by which people can be got to substitute Government policy by another policy and that is by telling them what the other policy is.  If it is a proper policy, we might even accept it ourselves and then we would have a united Dáil supporting it.  If Deputies opposite, on their past record, expect either this House or the country to give them a blank cheque to get into office to do <Col N="1972" /> what they like, they are very much mistaken.  They found out that mistake before.  They thought they could get away with a blank cheque policy in 1932, but they failed.  In 1933, they tried to be a little bit specific as to their policy, but then they could not get the different sections of the Party reconciled upon the major issue and, consequently, they met defeat again. At the local elections in 1934 they were again defeated, and they are going to be defeated again in 1935.</P>
    <P>They will never have the slightest prospect of making any impression on the political life of this country again until they are able to agree as to what they stand for and tell the country what they stand for.  Of course, at present any effort to force agreement might be disastrous to the Party, but in the course of time Deputy MacDermot will, I am sure, have succeeded in impressing his own point of view to a sufficient extent upon the Party organisation to get it adopted as the official policy, a point of view which regards any desire of the Irish people to secure their national independence as a sort of poison in our system.</P>

      <P>It is bunk.  I said it is bunk.  The whole country said it was bunk on many occasions.  Members of his own Party think it is bunk; but I did not expect Deputy MacDermot to agree so easily.  We have had a lot of discussion about the condition of the farming community and also a speech from Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney about law and order.  I think Deputies opposite have a damn cheek to be talking about law and order.  Members of that Party in various parts of the country are, day after day, and week after week, engaging in lawless acts; not merely lawless acts directed against members of the Government Party but against the machinery of the State.  Groups of members of that <Col N="1973" /> Party have blocked roads by felling trees across them; they have torn up railway lines for the purpose of wrecking trains; they have cut down telegraph and telephone poles for the purpose of stopping communications. They have engaged in these activities on a fairly wide-spread scale in many areas.  Then they have the colossal impudence to come here and criticise the Government because they have not maintained law and order in every part of the country.</P>
      <P>The Government are faced with a rather difficult task in maintaining the rule of the law here, and in that task they are getting no co-operation from the Party opposite.  On the contrary, the Party opposite are the main source of disorder.  When, the other day here, the word &ldquo;sabotage&rdquo; was used in relation to the activities of the Party opposite, members rose in indignation to protest against that word being applied to their work.  What is it but sabotaging?  Are they not trying to sabotage, not merely the ordinary machinery of government, but the national policy decided upon by the people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Who started the campaign for the non-payment of annuities?  Members of the Party opposite.  Deputy Desmond Fitzgerald this evening supported that campaign in a speech in which he stated that there was no moral obligation to pay them.  That is utter nonsense&mdash;bunk, as Deputy MacDermot would describe it.  It is that type of nonsense which has produced the campaign.  You have men like Deputy Wall, who went round telling his neighbours not to pay their annuities, and when these neighbours came to him and told him that they had been notified that the sheriff was coming to seize their cattle and asked his advice as to whether they should even then pay the annuities, he told them not to do it.  These poor men, looking to him for guidance, let their cattle be seized and sold at a fraction of their value.  But when the sheriff came to Deputy Wall he paid his annuity; he did not sacrifice his cattle. He let these poor men involve themselves in very considerable loss in <Col N="1974" /> order to support the campaign of his Party, but he was not going to suffer himself.  He paid in full, and Deputy Holohan paid in full.  Not merely are these sabotaging the national policy and machinery of government, but they are sabotaging their own Party.  If the members of the organisation of the Party opposite can have any faith in men like Deputy Wall and Deputy Bennett, and the conglomeration of gentlemen on the Front Bench opposite, seeing the campaign they are carrying on, and that it is only producing the contempt of the public, then they are more gullible than I should have thought they were.  We have accounts and reports coming from all parts of the country to the effect that all decent men are leaving that organisation in disgust, and men of the other type are leaving it for another reason.</P>
    <P>Agricultural conditions here are depressed; they are depressed in all countries.  The whole cause of the world depression which commenced in 1929 was the collapse in agricultural prices.</P>

      <P>Improvement in the condition of agriculture is not going to be an easy task, and it is not going to be made easier by the wrecking tactics of the Party opposite and of Deputy Keating.  What are we doing about it? The first step in the direction of improvement is to secure increased prices for those agricultural products for which we can make certain to provide a market here at home.  The number of these products is not few and the amount of these products is not inconsiderable.  Beet is one of them, but there is no use growing beet, or any other form of agricultural produce unless you can, at the same time, guarantee to the farmers that they will get prices that will repay the cost of production and give them a profit. Where we see that there is a prospect of continuing loss in any line of production <Col N="1976" /> we are wise in advising farmers to get out of that line and to go into another.  Are Deputies opposite going to co-operate in that?  We can provide a market for 80,000 tons of beet&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>You cannot give a fair price to the farmers for their beet and at the same time get the world price for sugar.  The price of sugar in this country is lower than in any other country except Great Britain.  The reason it is lower in Great Britain is because there is a free market there into which the sugar producing countries of the Continent are dumping their sugar.  We could buy Continental sugar delivered at the port of Dublin at 7/5 per cwt.  On no basis could we produce sugar in this country at even double that figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Not even treble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We could produce it at a little more than double the present price when our factories are fully working and are properly run in. The price last year is no indication of what the price will be in the future when our factories are working to the full extent and with full efficiency. Up to now the factory buildings were not completed and the workers were still in training.  In the future a very much lower cost will be possible.  But no matter how low the cost, or how efficiently the factories are run, if we are to pay the price for beet that we are paying we could not possibly produce sugar even at double the price that we could import sugar from abroad.  That imported sugar is subsidised and the price of that sugar to the consumer in the country of manufacture is double the price that it is being sold for here at the moment. <Col N="1977" /> The same applies in respect of wheat.  We have guaranteed the farmer a price of 23/6 a barrel for his wheat.  I remember when the economic committee was set up by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government in 1929, we spent weeks discussing whether it would pay the farmers to grow wheat at 30/- a barrel.  The then Minister for Agriculture expressed the opinion that it would not pay the farmers to grow wheat at 50/- a barrel.  The world price at that time was 30/- a barrel; now it is 15/- a barrel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, 15/-; it has gone up.  We are guaranteeing the farmers 23/6 per barrel.  It is not a good price.  Farmers could reasonably demand any time a better return for their labour than 23/6 per barrel.</P>

      <P>Not at all. Will the Deputy then go round misleading the people?  Will he come here asking Parliamentary questions, calculated to deceive, as to the price of flour?  We cannot give a fair price for wheat or beet to the farmers unless we are prepared to pay a fair price for the produce of the beet or wheat.  We are giving the farmers a price for butter considerably lower than they got a few years ago.  The farmer is getting a price for butter to-day that he would not accept a few years ago, yet that price is 30s per cwt. above the world price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

      <P>Deputies come here and try to prove that as regards beet, wheat and butter the prices to the producer are too low, and at the same time criticise the Government because the consumer is paying more here than has to be paid by consumers in Northern Ireland or in Great Britain.</P>
      <P>Of course he has, and the great advantage which we in this country have is that we are able to so organise the market here that we can get the consumer to pay more than the consumer in Northern Ireland or Great Britain has to pay, and, consequently, can give an economic price to our farmers for their products.  There is practically only one commodity in respect of which it is difficult to do that-cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies opposite, and Deputy Coburn in particular, spoke as if the British decision to quota our cattle had something to do with the economic war. It had nothing to do with the economic war.  When the British Government placed a quota on our cattle they at the same time placed quotas upon all classes of beef imported into Great Britain, dead as well as alive.  They did that in pursuance of their own agricultural policy.  I read here for Deputies the terms of the communication which the British Government sent to Australia and New Zealand. They gave the Governments of those countries the choice between a more restricted quota or a levy.  It would, <Col N="1979" /> perhaps, have been open to us at any time to have made representations to the British Government for the purpose of getting our quota increased, as other Government did, but without success.  On a fair allocation of the British quotas, the number of cattle which we would have sent to Great Britain in this year would have been 150,000 less than the number that we will send.  We could not complain against the quota allotted to us by the British Government on the ground that it was unfair when compared with the treatment given to other countries.  We could not have argued on that ground. We went to the British Government and made a deal under which we agreed to take an increased quantity of British coal in return for which they increased our quota for cattle by 150,000 head.  Are we to take it that the Deputies opposite do not want that?</P>
    <P>Deputy Coburn, and other Deputies, came here to-day and contended that some farmers were being hard hit by the fact that they could not get export licences.  They told us about individual farmers here and there who had cattle on their hands for which export licences could not be obtained immediately.  How many additional cattle would those farmers have left on their hands, for which no licences could be issued, if the Coal-Cattle Pact, which the Deputies criticise had not been made?  As it is, we will have no surplus cattle in this year.  At the moment we have a temporary surplus, but in the next month or two at the outside it will have disappeared, and at the end of that period the situation will have considerably improved.</P>
    <P>The economic war is not entirely a matter of the land annuities.  Members of the British Government have made that clear time and again.  They told us that there were political adjustments to be made&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;before they were prepared to consider the termination of this economic blockade against us.  The <Col N="1980" /> Deputies opposite know what these political considerations were: the removal of the Oath of Allegiance from the Constitution and the other constitutional changes that were effected, and the known desire of the people of this country to get rid of these limitations upon our national status and national freedom.  These are the political considerations that the British Government have in mind, and it is for the purpose of enforcing their will upon us in respect of these matters that they are maintaining the blockade. The Deputies opposite need have no illusions about that.</P>

      <P>It is not going to be an easy matter for us so to reorganise our economic life that similar action, taken in the future, will not have the same effect for us as it has had over the past two or three years.  We have to get ourselves into the position that we will not be at the mercy of whatever Government in Great Britain thinks fit to use that weapon against us for the purpose of enforcing its point of view in any matter in dispute between us.  Deputy Coburn told us that a settlement of the economic dispute with Great Britain need not necessarily involve the closing down of the new factories that have been opened.  How does the Deputy know that?  If that weapon used by Great Britain could bring us to our knees on one issue, has the Deputy any grounds for being so sure that a Government in Great Britain, under pressure from British manufacturers, would not use the same weapon for the purpose of getting us to abandon our policy upon some other issue?  The Deputy cannot be sure of that, and in fact, if we were to give in now; if we were to admit defeat in the face of these tactics, to haul down our flag and abandon our position, it is almost certain that at some future date there would come into office a British Government that would be tempted to use that weapon, knowing its effectiveness, in order to secure the fulfilment of its policy where its policy came into conflict with ours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies opposite surely realise <Col N="1981" /> that this country cannot afford to be beaten in this dispute.  If we are beaten in this dispute, then our so-called freedom is a mere mockery because it will not be capable of being utilised effectively for the purpose of securing the creation in this country of the economic conditions that all Parties profess to desire, although the sincerity of the professions of the Party opposite are open to grave doubts.  Deputy Morrissey told us how perturbed he was about the position in respect to unemployment.  We are all perturbed about that position.</P>

Deputy Morrissey, as I was saying, said that he was greatly perturbed about the position in respect to unemployment.  We all are, but there is unemployment in more countries than this.  In fact, the percentage of our occupied population which is unemployed is considerably less than the percentage of unemployed in the majority of European countries.  I admit that there are one or two countries which, because they succeeded in time in doing what we are trying to do now, are in a better position than we are; but the great majority of countries are in a much worse position, taking the number of unemployed in relation to the number of people occupied.  I think it would be no harm if the Deputies opposite would occasionally take advantage of the publications that are put within their reach in the Oireachtas Library for the purpose of informing themselves <Col N="1982" /> about conditions elsewhere.  If they did so, they would find that there are a number of countries in the world facing the problem of unemployment, tackling it perhaps by different methods&mdash;some of them not tackling it at all&mdash;but everywhere they have all met with less success in that campaign than we can point to here.  In fact, a number of them have not been able to arrest the growth of unemployment at all, particularly countries like France, despite the fact that in those countries they have adopted very risky and questionable financial expedients.</P>
      <P>When speaking here on the Budget, I asked the Deputies opposite if any one of them could name&mdash;I gave them five minutes to think it over&mdash;the Governments of six countries in the world which could point to a succession of balanced Budgets over the past four years.  They could not, and they cannot do it.  Not merely have many countries failed to balance their Budgets, although they have tried to do it, but a very large number of them did not even try&mdash;Italy, France, Sweden, Japan and the U.S.A.  They did not even face up to the effort to provide out of revenue the money which they were expending upon Government services and, particularly, services designed to relieve their unemployment situations.  We here can point to increasing employment, to decreasing unemployment and to balanced Budgets.</P>

      <P>By study of all the available statistics and by the knowledge of the situation which comes to any person in my position who keeps in touch with developments throughout the country.  There is increasing employment.  In the tariffed industries alone, there are 25,000 more people employed now than there were in <Col N="1983" /> 1932.  In addition to that, there has been a vast increase in employment in building.  It is, I think, generally recognised by economists that for every two persons you put into productive work you put one person indirectly into some other class of work.  In fact, the figures which I quoted here last week show that, in the twelve months preceding March of this year, the number of people who got employment in insurable occupations exceeded by 95,000 the number of people who got similar employment in the twelve months of 1931.  These people were not employed for twelve months but they were employed in insurable work at some time during that period.</P>

      <P>Whatever the period was, there were more employed.  The figures are not conclusive proof of the actual number of people now in employment, but they do show the trend of development in this country. Year after year, the figures show increasing numbers employed in consequence of the various measures adopted by the Government and now in operation.  Behind these measures, designed to increase employment and which are increasing employment, we have put the bulwark of the Unemployment Assistance Act.</P>

      <P>The Unemployment Assistance Act is not a method of dealing with the unemployment situation which we like.  On every occasion on which we can take a man off unemployment assistance and put him into work, we are glad.  The smaller the expenditure upon unemployment assistance becomes, the better we shall be pleased.  A large number of those in receipt of unemployment assistance are not persons who, in the past, were regarded as unemployed at all.  Two-thirds of them are persons who have parcels of land or are the sons of land holders.  In the past, these people were not generally regarded as persons seeking and available for industrial <Col N="1984" /> work.  They have been brought on to the unemployment register through the operation of the Unemployment Assistance Act, which is a scheme not merely for assisting the unemployed but also for assisting the underemployed. It has been the normal state of affairs in this country for many years that a large number of people were under-employed&mdash;were engaged in occupations that did not yield them the standard of living we think suitable for the inhabitants of this country.  These people are being helped towards that standard of living by that scheme.  It is a scheme which is costing us a very considerable sum of money.  The estimate for this year is £1,300,000, and I want Deputies opposite to remember that they voted against the provision of that money.</P>

      <P>It was carried by the House unanimously.  The Government Party voted for it.  The Unemployment Assistance Bill was designed to deal with conditions which were the result of those ten years in which not only were industrial opportunities neglected, but the agricultural industry was brought into a parlous state. Deputy Corry told you something that it would be well to bear in mind.  The value of agricultural exports declined between 1929 and 1931 by £13,000,000. In these two years alone, the farmers lost £13,000,000, because they had been, for ten years, continuously advised and forced by our predecessors to concentrate in their production upon a limited range of commodities designed for the British market.  Ten years ago, anybody could have foreseen the circumstances under which Great Britain would decide to provide for herself a larger proportion of her requirements in agricultural goods.  If there had been a Government alive to its duties and opportunities then in office, we should have had in operation various measures designed to increase production in other forms of agriculture for the purpose of lessening the dependence of agriculturists upon one market into which they were trying to send a limited range of perishable products and getting whatever price the purchaser thought fit to give.  In 1931, the purchaser thought fit to give us £13,000,000 less than was given in 1929. Deputies opposite talk about the decline in agricultural values which has taken place since then, but they will find nothing as drastic as the slice in the return our farmers got for their agricultural products over these two years.</P>
