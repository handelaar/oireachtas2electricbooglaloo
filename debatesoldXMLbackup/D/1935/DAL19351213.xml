      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That it is expedient that a tribunal be established for inquiring into a definite matter of urgent public importance, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) Whether any, and if so what, hardships and abuses arise or are capable of arising under the existing law governing the letting on occupation tenancies at occupation rents of houses and parts of houses in cities, towns and villages where the house or the part so let is used by the occupier thereof wholly or partly as a dwellinghouse, and (b) if any such hardships or abuses are found to arise or to be capable of arising, what additions to or amendments of the said existing law are practicable and desirable to remove or modify such hardships and abuses or to prevent the same from arising.</P>
      <P>The terms of this motion are clear. It asks the Dáil to approve of a tribunal to inquire into certain matters with regard to the rents of occupying tenants.  Various representations have been made to me from time to time, particularly within the last six or 12 months, regarding the grievances or hardships suffered by certain town tenants.  I have asked at various times that particulars might be furnished as to the hardships complained of.  It was only within the last three or four weeks that such instances or examples were furnished to me.  Between 200 and 250 cases of alleged grievances have been furnished to me.  While I have no evidence except the statements furnished by the organisations, I regard the matter as one of some importance and sufficiently urgent to be inquired into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies will note, the terms of the resolution restrict the scope of the inquiry to what is commonly referred to as the problem of the ordinary occupying tenant.  The proposed tribunal will consist of a representative from the Department of Justice, a representative from the Department of <Col N="2677" /> Local Government and a representative from the Valuation Office, with either a judge or senior counsel to preside over it.  They will have full powers to inquire into this matter, take evidence on oath and compel the attendance of witnesses.</P>
    <P>There is an amendment submitted by Deputy Norton.  I do not know what case he is going to make for it, but at this stage it appears to me that I cannot accept the amendment.  It would widen the inquiry in a way that would delay any report one would expect to receive within a reasonable time.  The second part of the amendment is one, I am advised and informed, that even if we were to get some of the information the Deputy proposes to elicit&mdash;that is under part (c) in the amendment&mdash;it could never be regarded as accurate and it would hold up and delay the inquiry very much.  I might say also with regard to paragraph (b) that the vast majority of complaints I have received&mdash;there may be one or two things that Deputy Norton has in mind&mdash;but the overwhelming number of complaints that I have received are covered by what is set out in the motion I have put down and do not refer to the subject matter dealt with in Deputy Norton's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before paragraph (b) to insert two new paragraphs as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(b) the extent, if any, to which unduly high rents are being charged for building sites and the effect thereof on house rents;</P>
      <P>(c) the extent to which rents for housing accommodation in cities and towns are paid out of moneys provided under the Unemployment Assistance Acts and as home assistance, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My object in moving this amendment is to widen the terms of reference of the tribunal which has been proposed by the Minister.  In order to appreciate the terms of reference of the tribunal it is necessary to study very carefully the provisions of paragraph (a) and, if Deputies do that, they will have no hesitation in realising that, so far as the Minister is concerned, he <Col N="2678" /> has drawn the terms of reference in a very narrow way and the scope of the tribunal's inquiries, according to the Minister, must be limited to the hardships and abuses arising or capable of arising under the existing law governing the letting on occupation tenancies at occupation rents of houses and parts of houses in cities, towns and villages where the house or the part so let is used by the occupier thereof wholly or partly as a dwellinghouse.  The overriding consideration in the terms of reference is to limit the inquiry to the hardships and abuses arising or capable of arising under the existing law. I suggest that is putting on the terms of reference a very narrow interpretation and it is going to limit enormously the task of a tribunal of this character.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that if he were to accept the amendment it would prolong the inquiry.  Surely that is not intended to be a serious argument against the amendment?  If the Minister had set up a tribunal of this character in 1932, when his Government assumed office, they would have had a report from the tribunal in 1932. But the Minister did nothing in 1932, in 1933, or in 1934 and now on the 13th December, 1935, the Minister tells us he is in a hurry to get the report of the proposed tribunal.  He is in a hurry now after four years.  He wants to narrow the scope of the inquiry because he wants the House to believe he is in a hurry, having done nothing in the last four years.  Surely the humour of that kind of opposition to this amendment strikes the Minister. If the Minister were really in a hurry to get an inquiry into this whole problem, he could have set up this tribunal four years ago, and if he did not take that course during that period, he is scarcely entitled to come into the House now and say, &ldquo;I slept on this matter for four years, and recently woke up, and I discover I am in a hurry to have this inquiry and I will limit its terms of reference in the narrowest possible way.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think the House ought to listen to that kind of opposition to an amendment of this kind.  I do not agree with the Minister that the acceptance of the amendment will <Col N="2679" /> unduly prolong the inquiry.  One portion of the amendment asks that the tribunal, which is going to deal with the hardships of tenants from the standpoint of their position under the law and from the standpoint of the well-known grievances from which they suffer, should be asked also to ascertain the extent, if any, to which unduly high rents are being charged for building sites and the effect thereof on house rents.  Does the Minister deny that the efforts of the State to provide houses for persons living in slums or insanitary dwellings or in overcrowded conditions have given land in many cases an unreal and fictitious value? Land which some years ago might be purchased at prairie prices has now, because of the efforts of the State to provide houses for its citizens, to provide them with good housing accommodation, assumed a value which it never formerly had.</P>
    <P>The community and the State have created for that land an enhanced value on a new basis.  Because the community requires houses to satisfy its needs, it must, compulsorily, be held to ransom in order that those who hold the land can obtain any value they attach to it.  So far as utility societies are concerned they must take any land they require at the landlord's price because they have no means of having a fair value put upon it by any tribunal.  The local authorities can acquire land for building houses but the price is fixed by an arbitrator.  But, as is well known, and it must be pretty well known to the Minister for Justice, and better known to the Minister for Local Government, where a local authority requires land and the matter has to be dealt with by arbitration, there seems to be a kind of prevailing opinion that since it is the local authority that requires it, the land can be had at a pretty fair price. But the Minister must know that in respect of land required for house building purposes, a most unreal value is attached, and there is nothing for it but to pay the price because it is not possible for the local authority or the builder or the utility society <Col N="2680" /> to secure the land at a lower price. I have no hesitation in saying that in the last three years, particularly in cities like Cork, and other cities and towns throughout the country, there has been an unhealthy gamble, from the community point of view, in regard to the buying of such land. That gamble has resulted in the tenants being required to bear an impost which is most unfair upon them, but it is necessary if they are to enter into occupation of houses of that kind.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister would have made himself aware of the prices paid for land for this purpose in Cork by the Cork Corporation, and in Dublin by the Dublin Corporation.  I wish he would ask some builders about the prices they were compelled to pay for land here in the City of Dublin.  We are in the position, and Deputies know the fact, that there is a gamble in land for those purposes and that tenants have to bear the impost.  The Minister for Justice is setting up a tribunal and he proposes to exclude from the terms of reference any inquiry but the simple one as to the unduly high rents that are paid by tenants.  I cannot understand on what ground the Minister bases his objection to the proposals in my amendment.</P>
    <P>It must be well known to the Minister, as it is well known to members of his Party, and to members of all Parties in this House, that there has been an enormous inflation in the value of land in recent years for building purposes.  Here we are setting up a tribunal to deal with the housing problem to some extent.  Is it not obvious that matters such as those set out in my amendment should be inquired into by the tribunal so that we might get some information as to what is being done and so that the tribunal would be able to make some recommendation as to the growing evils of that character?  With reference to paragraph (c) of my amendment, I am seeking to extend the reference so that the tribunal might inquire into &ldquo;the extent to which rents for housing accommodation in cities and towns are paid out of moneys provided under the Unemployment Assistance Acts and out of home <Col N="2681" /> assistance.&rdquo;  I venture to say that there is not a Deputy in the Fianna Fáil Party representing Dublin but knows that large amounts of money provided for employment assistance and for home assistance have found their way into the pockets of landlords, and particularly slum landlords, for filthy and insanitary slums that the lower animals, much less human beings, should not be housed in.  If I had my way I would make it an offence for any slum landlord to demand rent for insanitary dwellings.  It is bad enough for people to be compelled to live in insanitary dwellings and basement cellars; but that landlords should be allowed to extract rent from these people in these circumstances is something that I do not understand.</P>
    <P>This House passed the Unemployment Assistance Acts and the Home Assistance Act, and the obvious desire it had in making these contributions was to assist men, women and children in periods of enforced idleness, to procure the necessaries of life so far as the limited benefits given under these Acts could provide them.  But there might as well have been a section in the Act stating that, so far as 30, 40 or 50 per cent. of these grants were concerned, they should be paid to landlords for housing accommodation. It is well known to members of the Fianna Fáil Party, particularly those who are members of the Dublin Corporation, that a very large portion of unemployment assistance benefit and outdoor relief has found its way into the pockets of landlords who provide filthy accommodation.  I would like to hear Deputy Cormac Breathnach upon this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely Deputy Belton knows that numbers of people are condemned to live in one and two rooms in Dublin.  Surely he knows of the filthy blocks of slum tenement dwellings that exist in various parts of this city, and that have been condemned as insanitary. Does the Deputy not consider it right and proper that we should raise our voices in protest against the amount paid in unduly high rents for accommodation of that kind?  I thought that Deputy Belton would have supported me in my demand for an inquiry into these matters.  But, whether the Deputy knows it or not, it must be known to a number of Deputies representing this city, and especially to those Deputies who are members of the Dublin Corporation, that a very large proportion of the moneys paid by the State, in the form of unemployment assistance and home assistance, finds its way into the pockets of slum landlords, thereby thwarting the original purpose of such legislation, and, in my opinion, constituting a very great evil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State proposed to secure these people against want and destitution, from the point of view of food and clothing, but the people who have gained most since the Unemployment Assistance Acts and Home Assistance Acts were passed, are the slum landlords. The tenant now has a weekly income, a very small income, it is true, in the shape of unemployment assistance benefit.  He had not that income previously in many cases. He now has a regular weekly income from the State, and even though it is small, the one person who has exacted his pound of flesh, the one person who has been able to collect his levy, the one person who has been able, as Deputy Belton would say, to impose his sanctions, is the slum landlord.  His rent is a safer income to him now than it was before the Unemployment Assistance Act was passed.  I want to ascertain the extent to which that particular evil prevails, the extent to which this House, by passing the Unemployment Assistance Act, has helped the slum landlords by making it possible for them to collect their rents through the medium of the unemployment assistance benefit provided <Col N="2683" /> by this House.  There is a well-known tradition, particularly with working-class people, that they measure their income in a peculiar manner.  They say they have £1 per week, and after 4/-, 5/- or 6/- has been paid in rent, they have only 14/-, 15/- or 16/- left.  Deputies, I am sure, are familiar with the type of letter they get from people who say that their income is very small, and that by the time they have paid rent there is only a certain small sum of money left to buy all the necessaries of life and clothe the children.  Showing that amongst tenants there is a strong disposition to pay rents out of any kind of income which they get.  The rent seems to be set aside; that must be paid at all events, and every other article of domestic requirement must be found out of what is left.  As a matter of fact, the attitude of working-class tenants towards rents has been one of faithfully observing many of the unfortunate bargains they entered into. I for one, do not appreciate that kind of honesty in dealing with some of the gentlemen who are charging exorbitant rents for slum and insanitary accommodation, but the fact remains that there is with working-class people a long tradition to pay the landlord first, and try to provide all the necessaries of life out of what is left.</P>
    <P>If there is that fidelity on the part of tenants towards the paying of rents, if there is that ingrained desire to pay tribute to the landlord in the first instance and try to get food afterwards, then we ought to know to what extent fidelity of that kind is being utilised by the landlords to try to exact their pound of flesh through the benefits provided by the State under the Act to which I have referred. Those are evils which exist.  Those are problems which exist.  Those are abuses which exist.  If the Minister does not know that, I am sure the members of his own Party know it. The Minister cannot have made any very exhaustive inquiry as to the extent of those evils in this and in other cities; otherwise I feel that he would gladly accept an amendment of this kind.  The object of the amendment is to ensure an inquiry comprehensive <Col N="2684" /> in character, to give the State a picture of the evils which exist, and I would strongly urge that the Minister should consider and accept the amendment. It is put down to help to get a proper inquiry into the problem.  It is put down to assist the Minister in getting that inquiry.  It is put down for the purpose of ensuring that those evils will be investigated so that the State may have information on the extent to which those evils exist, and be able to provide a remedy for those difficulties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather sorry that Deputy Norton moved those amendments or put them down, not because I am not in agreement with the amendments, but because it seems to me that he is rather playing into the hands of the Government by helping to confuse the real issue and the main issue, that is, the question of the rents paid by tenants, particularly the rents he has stressed so much&mdash;the rents paid by the tenants in Dublin. As one who has had some years' experience of town tenants' organisations in this country, I have no hesitation in saying that this motion on the Paper in the name of the Minister is a completely and absolutely dishonest motion.  It is an attempt to put off the whole matter, and avoid what is, I admit, a very difficult problem.  I would invite any member of the House who is interested in this matter to compare the wording of this motion on the Paper with the terms of reference of the Meredith Commission of 1927-28. Word for word it is the same, except that the Minister uses the word &ldquo;abuses&rdquo; in the motion instead of the word &ldquo;anomalies&rdquo; used in the original terms of reference.  Deputy Lemass, as he then was, speaking in this House on the Landlords and Tenants Bill, 1931, said: &ldquo;The Town Tenants Commission was set up not to rectify the grievances of town tenants, but to meet the exigencies of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.&rdquo;  I think those words, if you substitute &ldquo;the Fianna Fáil Party,&rdquo; meet the situation perfectly. The Minister at one time claimed to have personal interest in this matter of the town tenants.  I am informed that on one occasion he himself was chairman of a town tenants' branch.</P>

Instead of legislation we get the old dodge&mdash;when you are up against a difficulty, postpone it.  That is the Government's way out of it. This is a question of sending the fool further.

      <P>The Deputy is full of sympathy for the town tenants when he is down in the towns of his own constituency, and so is every other Deputy on the far side.  Here you are up against a straight problem, and I contend that in this report of the Meredith Commission, a report on terms of reference at least as wide if not wider than the terms of reference now before the House, you have all the information you need if you want to act on it.  I suggest that you do not want to act on it.  I suggest that the Minister was treating the matter flippantly when he suggested to a deputation of town tenants that they should go back, make up their own minds, and let him know what they wanted.  If the Minister is not satisfied with the Town Tenants Commission report of 1927, will he read the speeches made by his colleagues, and particularly by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, on the Landlords and Tenants Act when it was going through this House, and the speeches made on the Rent Restrictions Act.  Let him read those for Deputy Donnelly.  I again quote from the Ard-Fheis: &ldquo;Mr. Leonard said the majority of town tenants thought the Government was not sincere in considering their demands.&rdquo;  That was one of the truest things said at the Ard-Fheis.  He went on to say that 300 cases of hardship had been submitted to the Minister.  They thought the Government were not sincere in considering their demands; even their own supporters do not believe in their sincerity.  A resolution dealing with the question of town tenants was turned down by the Ministers at the Ard-Fheis.  Fairly strong pressure was exercised afterwards when the delegates to the Ard Fheis had recovered from the shock of Ministers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Lemass, speaking in 1930 on the Increase of Rent and Mortgage (Restrictions) Bill, said, &ldquo;They would support the passage of the Bill but he regretted the necessity for doing so as he had hoped that by this time legislation dealing with the position of town tenants would have been introduced and passed by the Dáil.&rdquo;  Apparently, the Minister for Industry and Commerce thought five years ago that there was sufficient evidence available to justify the introduction of a town tenants measure.  If there is one problem in this country outside the rent problem or demands and claims with which the Government should be conversant, they are demands of the town tenants.  Remember that the town tenants of this country have been clamouring to have their demands met, not since the present Government came into power, but for the last 30 years.</P>

      <P>For at least 30 years, and the Government cannot get away from the fact that they did make a definite promise and obtain a very large measure of support from town tenants as a whole.  I have no faith in this motion, because I believe this motion is largely intended to send the fool farther.  The Minister's only excuse for setting up the Commission is that he has not sufficient information. I venture to suggest that he is not going to get information which will be any more useful than was given before the Meredith Commission.  If he wants any further information he could not go to a better authority on the <Col N="2688" /> matter than the present Minister for Industry and Commerce.  If he wants to do something for the town tenants, there is a very eminent legal gentleman who has lately been appointed a judge in this country, who was very conversant with the position of the town tenants.  I would suggest his name for the consideration of the Minister as chairman of this tribunal.</P>
      <P>This tribunal is not going to be even, from the point of view of the town tenants, nearly as valuable in regard to its personnel as the Meredith Commission. A tribunal! It is an Interdepartmental Committee, a Committee composed of officials to be presided over, we are told, by a judge or a gentleman of legal standing.  The whole thing is camouflage.  Whatever the Government may think about it, or whatever members sitting behind the President may think about it, the tenants of this country know that quite well.  If they do not know it now, they may wake up to the fact in two or three years' time that they will not get any Town Tenants Bill that will be of any use to them from the present Government.</P>

      <P>Deputy Morrissey has told us that he has years' and years' experience of the town tenants' organisation, and he has told us that the town tenants have been clamouring for. I think, 30 years to have their grievances remedied.  He has expressed, apparently on behalf of his Party, an attitude of opposition to the Minister's motion, and yet not one hint did he give as to what fault he had to find with the motion.  He did not hint for a moment what particular grievance of the town tenants this motion will not cover.</P>

      <P>Why could not the Deputy mention at least one particular point in that report that he requires the Government to deal with and that is not going to be dealt with by this Commission?  Why could he not at least point to the defects of the Landlord and Tenant Act of 1929 or what it was that was left undone by the Land-lord <Col N="2689" /> and Tenant Act that he thinks should now be done?  Presumably Deputy Morrissey would agree that the method of dealing with this matter will be by taking up every existing grievance where the Landlord and Tenant Act left off, by suggesting additions to the legislation that was then enacted, and by dealing with the grievances that were not then dealt with.  All Deputy Morrissey has done is to talk round and round the subject.  Not a hint has he given us as to what he himself has in mind or what the Town Tenants' Organisation has in mind with regard to their grievances.</P>

      <P>The organisation supported by Deputy Morrissey adopt the extraordinary method of coming to the Minister and saying: &ldquo;We have undoubted grievances, we have overwhelming grievances, but you will have to define them for us.&rdquo;  That is a new method for a national organisation to adopt, and naturally any Minister would find it very hard to take them seriously.  They have great resources. They get considerable support from the country, and I am prepared to believe they have substantial grievances, but I have always been at a loss to know why they could not pay a competent person, a lawyer, or some other qualified person, to define these grievances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Morrissey has resorted to the good old method of Cumann na nGaedheal when they used to say that Fianna Fáil told the farmers that they would never have to pay their annuities, and that they should not pay their annuities.  He uses the same method now when he states that the Fianna Fáil Deputies told the country that when Fianna Fáil got office they would undoubtedly institute a Purchasing Bill for town tenants.  There are no facts to support that statement, no facts whatever.  It is just as unreliable as their dishonest and very contemptible statement that Fianna Fáil told the farmers they <Col N="2690" /> would never have to pay the annuities.</P>
      <P>I thought that the speech of Deputy Norton was largely a speech which dealt with a very bad social problem of this country rather than a speech designed to make a case for the amendment of the Minister's motion. He mentioned, for instance, the extent to which rents are paid out of moneys provided under the Unemployment Assistance Act.  I think we are all pretty satisfied that there is a good deal of that going on, but how it would affect the town tenants' problem is another question.  My own opinion is that it is a question that would not be relevant to a town tenants commission. It is a problem in itself&mdash;a problem that can be dealt with apart from the general question.  How far a commission could go into that matter, unless they took a sort of census of every town and city in the country and of the means of each family, I do not know.  I do not know that the information gained would be very valuable, and even if it were correct at the moment it was ascertained, it might be much less correct by the time the commission had reported.</P>
      <P>The amendment further asks that the Commission should report as &ldquo;to the extent, if any, to which unduly high rents are being charged for building sites and the effect thereof on house rents.&rdquo;  There again there is not much information required.  We all know that the building boom of the last few years has increased the rents of sites, but I would rather think that is a separate problem also.  Further, I am sure there is nearly sufficient information available already to suggest a solution, if any solution be practicable. It is not a question on which I think the Government should spend money in getting information, seeing that the facts are already pretty familiar to most people.  On the whole, I, at least, am satisfied that no case has been made against the motion, and Deputy Morrissey certainly has not made the shadow of a case for opposing the motion put forward by the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

      <P>I certainly do not see that any harm could be done by having this inquiry, provided that there were <Col N="2691" /> definite limits to the time it would occupy.  If it is simply for the purpose of taking the matter up, a matter on which the Government is pretty well informed at the present time, then it would be, as Deputy Morrissey said, a case of sending the fool farther.  If a limit were put to the time that this inquiry would be allowed to continue its investigations, then it would serve a useful purpose.</P>
      <P>I understand there is a limit to the time for the discussion of this matter, and I will not go into the matter, therefore, in the way I otherwise would.  There is a lot of talk about the price of sites having gone up, and the increased rents that imposes.  If you fix the price of sites what happens? Pals will get them, and there will be another grievance.  Sites at present are let in the open market to the highest bidder.  I am sorry the Chairman of the Corporation Housing Committee has left the House, but there are members of the Corporation here who are aware that at present the Corporation have 200 or 300 acres of land within the City of Dublin advertised for building purposes.  How are we to dispose of that land for building purposes except to the highest tender? If there is any other way of doing it, let us know.  Deputies Breathnach and Traynor are here, and they know that as well as I do.  By a matter of accident, I happen to be Chairman of that Committee, and I see no other way of handling the problem except in that way.  If people give too much for the land, they give it with their eyes open, and it is their funeral.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Deputy Norton should have modified his statement when he talked of people living in insanitary dwellings in the city and throughout the country.  I do not know about throughout the country, but surely we all admit that there are people living in dwellings in the city that we would not have them living in if we had the wherewithal to build houses and build them quickly.  But, to say that there are people living in insanitary dwellings in Dublin suggests that the medical authority of the city is not doing his duty.  If we accept that <Col N="2692" /> for the sake of argument, what is the next step?  We want money to build houses.  Does not Deputy Norton, the Minister for Finance, and everybody here know that the whole problem of housing is a question of £ s. d.?  If this tribunal is going to be of any use&mdash;practically all that they are asked to inquire into we know already &mdash;the material matter to inquire into is, where will we get sufficient money at a fair price to tackle this housing, the next thing will be a shortage of plasterers.  I hope Deputy Norton will not come along then and say, &ldquo;We will not allow plasterers to be brought into the City of Dublin.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Norton is making a mistake in asking for the widening of the scope of this inquiry to include the whole question of land values, for this reason, that the tribunal as proposed to be constituted, is bound to give the major part of its attention to the appalling scandal of slum rents in the city.  The Deputy may say, &ldquo;Why not go farther afield?&rdquo; What has resulted already from commissions that inquired into that question? Deputy Morrissey went back as far as the Meredith Commission. What about the Campbell-Bannerman Commission?  We have been fighting on this subject of slum rents in the City of Dublin for 40 years and we have got nothing done yet.  The President will remember that in my salad days of long ago, when I was a law student, I asked him to do me the honour of speaking at an inaugural debate which we had on the question of the slums.  Public business made it impossible for him to attend on that occasion, and Mr. Gavan Duffy <Col N="2693" /> took his place.  I may say that Mr. Gavan Duffy was, perhaps, the most enthusiastic person on the platform for my view&mdash;and I depart from orthodoxy when I say this&mdash;that slums are a problem which ought to be disposed of without counting the cost. I suppose I shall be regarded henceforth in the public life of this country as financially unsound, but I take the view that you ought to dispose of the slums and count the cost afterwards.</P>
      <P>It is just because the Minister for Finance, and indeed the Executive Council and the Fianna Fáil Party have not that kind of courage, that they do not get the general support which they are always clamouring for. They will embark on an economic war without counting the cost.  I am not going to refer to that further, but I want to make this differentiation, that that is embarked upon without counting the cost, just as the Kaiser in Germany, the Duce in Italy, and the dictators of some other countries will launch a nation into war without counting the cost.  But surely, as the President knows, and as we all know, more people are dying in the slums of our big cities and in big cities in England and other countries from bad housing than are killed in many wars. If the Executive Council of any Government took its courage in its hands and asked all sides to help them in marshalling the resources of the community to dispose of slums, they would get what help they wanted.</P>

In fact it will emerge that we cannot house the poor of Dublin or any other considerable city at an economic price.  It will require some kind of State subsidy or municipal subsidy to house the poor of this city or any other city as we want to see it done.</P>

      <P>I move the amendment in my name.  After the President's speech, I wonder whether it is necessary for me to make a speech in favour of the amendment because the President has proved it up to the hilt.  Every word that fell from him shows his conception of what this tribunal is to be.  He spoke of a question of interpretation and then of deciding it by votes.  We already knew it was his idea of how a question of this kind should be decided, but never has he so blatantly and callously acknowledged it as here to-day.  That is to say, that the question of the interpretation of this constitution and of the rules is to be decided by a definite Party vote in which three people are already pledged to find one decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Our view is that this is a matter to be investigated. The President's view of the matter is that it is not to be investigated. Let us consider the argument he has given.  He holds strong views on the question; therefore, the matter is not to be properly investigated because he holds strong views.  Let us get down to realities, and the only realities are his strong views.  That is the whole gist of the case made by the President. I was rather attracted by the naïveté of the opening of the President's speech.  He said, as usual, there was nothing to be said.  For once he was quite right.  He said <Col N="2698" /> nothing in favour of this particular motion of his, but every word that fell from his mouth was directly against the motion that he has proposed to the House.  I do not think he uttered a sentence that would induce any decent-minded person in the House who wants a proper consideration of an important question to vote for the motion which he has proposed.  A legal argument was, he claimed, at issue, and for that purpose he has put on he says two men learned in the law as advocates to argue his position. There is a question involved, and one of the things he makes up his mind to do is to see that the case on the other side, as far as he can prevent it, is not put before that tribunal.  He deliberately takes steps to ensure that and comes to the Dáil to confess that that is the purpose.  I think it is quite fitting that a motion of this kind should come from the President the day after he moved the resolution in regard to the Seanad.  If we wanted any proof of what the President means by parliamentary government we had it in his conduct yesterday and what he said to-day.  Because the Opposition exercises rights given them by the Constitution, that is obstruction! Will the House and the country not realise that any criticism&mdash;even the slightest&mdash;of the President's wishes is &ldquo;obstruction&rdquo;?  Have we ever had a clearer example than the President gave of that?  The plea that the motion was a matter for investigation finished up by saying that it is a matter of voting.  That is the President's conception of a committee of investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know now what he expects from any committee of investigation. It is a matter of weighing evidence no longer, but a matter of voting.  That is his conception of parliamentary institutions&mdash;not discussion, not debate.  Deputy Donnelly, I see, is in full agreement with every sentence, with every half sentence, I utter.  He knows that the view of the Party is that parliamentary institutions are not for examination or discussion, but merely for voting generally, without having listened to the arguments on one side or the <Col N="2699" /> other.  That is the President's view of these institutions.  That is the view of a section of the House.  We saw the President yesterday proposing to save democratic rights by suggesting that there should be another stage after the final stage of Bills, or something of that kind.  It was quite typical of the quarter from which it came.  That suffices to safeguard the whole democratic position! To-day he comes here and deliberately packs this body. In the old days there was a great deal of comment in this country about packing&mdash;the packing of juries.  Was there ever a more deliberate attempt at that, or a more cynical acknowledgment, than we have here to-day in connection with a tribunal and a jury, in which he takes up and breaks every precedent of this House?  Why?  To prevent even the case, as far as he can prevent it, really being made in that tribunal.  That is the whole aim.  He wants members learned in the law! As an amendment we propose that the precedent followed in every case by this House should be followed, and that representation should be given to the different Parties.  Why has the President departed from it?  Because the President has strong views on the matter! That is democracy! The ordinary rights of the House are to be trampled upon because the President has strong views on this matter! That is the precedent that is now being set up.  After the Second Chamber, as far as he has been able to manage it, has been abolished, we have next a taste of the medicine the country is going to get.  No rights for the minority, no matter how well anyone puts their case&mdash;their case is not even to be put. Our proposal is that we give to that committee the services of one learned in the law.  We propose the name of Deputy Costello instead of Deputy Geoghegan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We want views put up and investigated.  We think there is a case to be argued, a very serious case.  We took it for granted that the Article was not put into the <Col N="2700" /> Constitution without some purpose. There was a reason for putting it in. Therefore, we think this matter should be properly investigated.  We want it investigated to the full.  We want everything, one way or the other, put before the Committee and argued.  We do not want to have the rights of the Oireachtas swept away.  These rights are in the Constitution.  The rights accorded to the minority are there by the Constitution.  It was decided that a certain number of names were necessary, and these names had to be got. There was an absurd argument put forward that because we took the preliminary step, as we were bound by the Constitution, one of our Party cannot be put on.  The Minister holds the same views as to what committees ought to propose.  Evidence is of no account.  It does not matter.  It is a mere matter of voting.  Vote first and give evidence afterwards.  Make up your mind first and look at the evidence afterwards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing is arguable that the President disagrees with.  Will he not recognise that is his whole case?  He will destroy every institution and destroy every safeguard so long as he does not agree with it and <Col N="2701" /> so long as other views do not fall completely in with his.  That is the whole difficulty.  Safeguards are swept out. This is a distinctly bad precedent, particularly bad in view of the events of the last few weeks.  But there is no hesitation about doing it.  This Government has set up bad precedent after bad precedent because they are irritated; because they dislike certain things without giving them any consideration. As to the consequences of these precedents, the Executive have no case, they must be supreme.  The one and the sole principle on which they stand! Parliament&mdash;what does Parliament count for?  A minority! What does a minority count for?  He showed yesterday that there was no regard for the rights of minorities, that his conception of majority rule was that he was not to be criticised.  Do we want a better illustration of that attitude than the matter we are now discussing? As this is a matter on which the ruling of the Chair is questioned, I must say that there is no compliment to that ruling in the line now being followed by the President.  I ask those members of the House, who are not committed to the view that the only thing that counts in a Parliament is voting, to consider seriously before committing themselves to a principle of this kind. I doubt if the House is fully aware of the danger of setting up precedents of this kind.  Apart altogether from any other consideration, merely from a desire to protect Parliamentary institutions, I would ask the House, if there is any sense of decency left in a large portion of the House, if there is any respect for this House as a body as distinct from a House merely to register the wishes of the Executive Council, not to accept this motion, not to try to steam-roll everything, and not to give evidence day after day of their contempt for Parliamentary institutions, while apparently preserving them in form; because that is what the House is being asked to do, as far as this House can manage it.  The House is in essence being asked to pack the jury.  We cannot go further than that.  The President says it is not a question of argument and it is not a question of consideration&mdash;<Col N="2702" /> why he puts two lawyers on the Committee to waste their valuable time, I do not know&mdash;but a question merely of voting.</P>

      <P>You have ruled on that, Sir, and may I hope that I shall be permitted to proceed without further unmannerly interruption from Deputy O'Sullivan and inane interruption from Deputy Dillon?  I was saying that the Deputy whose name has been proposed by the Opposition for membership of this committee was the principal legal and constitutional adviser to Deputy Cosgrave's Government from 1927 to 1932.  During that period he was responsible for many amendments to the Constitution.  I assume that before these amendments were brought into this House, the then Government had the opinion of the Attorney-General and I presume that they would not have ventured to disregard the opinion of that Attorney-General if he had informed them previously that the amendments which they proposed to make would be invalid and <i>ultra vires.</i>  Yet, within the last two years, the Attorney-General who advised the Government from 1927 to 1932 that this Oireachtas was competent to make these numerous amendments to the Constitution, subsequently appeared in court and argued that the Oireachtas had exceeded its powers under the Constitution when it made those amendments. This matter which this committee is to be set up to consider is, as Deputy O'Sullivan says, a matter of primary Constitutional importance.  Surely, whoever else we may put on that Committee, we ought not to put on it a lawyer who has shown himself so variable, so uncertain in his opinion, so disreputable in his advocacy and so ignorant of the Constitutional law of <Col N="2705" /> this State as Deputy Costello has shown himself to be.</P>
      <P>If there were no other reason than the exhibition which Deputy Costello has made of himself from time to time in the courts, I should still say that the Dáil would be unjust to itself and unjust to the State if it, for one moment, accepted him or any of his Front Bench colleagues as fit to sit on a committee to investigate so abstruse a constitutional point as will come before this committee.  Deputy O'Sullivan has said that, in proposing to put upon this committee two lawyers, the arguments of one of whom have been accepted in the courts upon the fundamental constitutional issue as to whether the Oireachtas had power to amend the Constitution or not&mdash;had been accepted by the courts as overbearing those put forward by Deputy Costello&mdash;the other being an eminent senior counsel, and, with these, the leader of the Labour Party, who has not prejudged this issue by either signing a petition or asking other people to sign a petition, we were abusing precedent. If I had been as unmannerly and as inconsiderate as Deputy O'Sullivan habitually shows himself to be in debate, I should have interrupted him and asked him to cite a single precedent that covered this matter.  The burden of his speech was that we were violating precedent.  The fact is that there is no precedent for what it is proposed to do now.  This is the first time on which it was necessary to convene a committee of privileges.</P>
      <P>The majority of this House is entitled to lay down precedents.  In this matter we have a freer hand, I think, than in most other cases, because this will stand as a decision which will be unique of its kind.  Within a comparatively short period we have every reason to anticipate that things will be so ordered that this question of a Money Bill will never arise again in the form in which it has been raised here.  Accordingly, we shall be doing no violence to the assumed rights of posterity if we put on the committee three persons who, at any rate, have not indicated by their signatures that they have anything else than an open mind on this matter.</P>

      <P>I object to the suggestion of both the President and the Minister, that everybody who signed the petition in question has prejudged the issue.  There is, obviously, no logic at all in that statement, because the petition does not contain any statement of our views; it merely asks that the issue be determined. I may as well say quite frankly that if I were the judge to determine the issue as to whether or not the Bill was a Money Bill, I should say, on my present information, that it was a Money Bill.  In signing the petition, I have done nothing inconsistent with the holding of that view.  It is a matter which is, admittedly, open to doubt, and I see no reason why it should be considered improper to ask to have it determined.</P>
      <P>I must confess that I have listened to this debate with considerable amusement. I should have been greatly impressed by the moral fervour of Deputy O'Sullivan on the subject were I not absolutely certain that, if the positions were reversed, the Front Bench of the Opposition would be doing exactly the same thing.</P>

      <P>The President has taken what he calls a realistic&mdash;what I call a cynical&mdash;view of the situation. He says the matter will be, in fact, determined by a Party vote.  Of course, it will be determined by a Party vote, and the legal qualifications of the persons on the Committee are really of very little importance.  The only advantage, from the Party point of view, of having a man with high legal qualifications on the committee is that his opinion may possibly carry greater weight with the general public than the opinion of a layman would. The President has, I must say, this excuse: there is a majority against him at present in the Seanad.  I have no doubt he believes that even if he, in an access of virtue, had sought to constitute a non-Party representation from this House, the Seanad could not be depended upon to exercise an equal degree of virtue, and that it was possible the Seanad might select three <Col N="2707" /> representatives who could be relied upon to take a particular view of this issue.  As a matter of fact, I think that the President has been rather more generous than, knowing him, we might have expected him to be in putting Deputy Norton on the committee. He might have put on three staunch men and true of the Fianna Fáil Party, whereas he has included a Deputy who spoke very strongly, and voted with all his Party, against the particular Bill that is now in question. Looking at the situation &ldquo;realistically,&rdquo; I do not think that the President has behaved too badly.</P>
      <P>The whole incident is an admirable illustration of what I was trying to prove last night&mdash;the undesirability of having a Second Chamber constituted on Party lines.  The proceedings of this committee will, I have no doubt, be conducted on Party lines, just as the proceedings of the committee inquiring into the Wicklow mining lease have been conducted on Party lines, and the reports will be issued on Party lines.  It is just as well that, instead of working ourselves into a high state of moral indignation, we should realise what the Party system is, especially when that Party system includes the Second House as well.  It is not for me to draw the moral that the few &ldquo;just men&rdquo; who exist in the Irish Constitution in either House sit upon the Independent Benches.</P>

      <P>I think that when Deputy MacDermot reads the report of the speech which he has just delivered in the Official Report next week it will cause him to blush.  The question whether this Bill is determined to be a Money Bill or not is of comparatively small importance.  What is of importance, however, is that something is going to be done here to-day just because President de Valera is in a temper and because there is not anybody on his benches with the independence of mind which would make it worth while to make any representation founded on justice to them.</P>

When you set them up first, they are naked and unworkable, and you proceed to make them workable by establishing precedents as the occasion for using each section of the Constitution arises. Now, I put this question to some of the Fianna Fáil Deputies.  They disclaimed any desire to co-operate in any way in making the Constitution of this House or of the State a success, and then they changed their minds and came in.  I put it to them now to ask themselves: Was there not, in their absence, a Parliamentary instrument fashioned which gave them ample protection for their minority rights when they came into the House?  Did they not find the Committee of Public Accounts, with a Chairman drawn from the Opposition presiding over it?  Did they not find that every precedent that had been established in their absence secured to the minority in this House ample representation and, very often, representation larger than their actual numbers seemed to justify, on every Committee that this House was called upon to form?  The reason for that is quite simple.  The Committees of Procedure or Privilege, or matters of that kind, are designed primarily to protect the rights of the minority against the will of the majority.  The procedure understands that, on the floor of the House, the minority will be prevailed over in matters which are contended for between the two main Parties, because it is right that the opinion of the majority should prevail in matters political.  That is the purpose of this House.  But then you come to matters of our essential rights.</P>

      <P>Then you come to matters of our essential rights as Deputies of this House, and then the opinion of the majority should carry no more weight than that of the minority.  The late Government did realise that, whether you trusted the <Col N="2709" /> Opposition or not, unless you adopted that attitude towards them, parliamentary institutions could not survive at all, and unless you were prepared to assume that they were going on to the Committees of the House, discarding their political convictions and joining hands with their political opponents so that parliamentary institutions might be properly run, then parliamentary institutions could not be carried on at all.  It is hard for anybody who feels the same reverence for these parliamentary institutions as I do, to listen to Deputy MacDermot's consistent sneers at the capacity of his own fellow-countrymen in regard to the carrying out of parliamentary institutions.</P>

      <P>I am not going to be drawn into any altercation with the Deputy.  He may do it for the purpose of gratifying President de Valera or securing his goodwill, but I think he does President de Valera a disservice; he does the Leader of the Opposition a disservice; he does himself a disservice; and he does the country a disservice, in suggesting that the people of this country are so debased that we cannot carry on parliamentary institutions with the same detachment and real solicitude for individual liberty as they are carried on in every other country in the world.</P>

      <P>I have sat on Committees of this House repeatedly in various capacities and I have found, as a general rule, that I was able to state my case and that Deputies as a whole conducted themselves with a reasonable degree of justice and fairness to the minority on the Committees; and that, where you got an obstreperous Deputy who forgot that he had been transferred from the rough-and-tumble of the floor of the <Col N="2710" /> House&mdash;which ought to be rough-and-tumble&mdash;into the sphere of a Committee concerned with liberties, I have found Fianna Fáil Deputies turn on their own colleague and point out to him that that kind of attitude was not defensible on the Committee: that they had got to remember in the Committee that a Deputy of the minority had certain privileges that he could not expect or ask for on the floor of the House.  So that, the conduct of Irish Deputies who are so much despised, is not so deplorable in Committees as some of our colleagues seem to think.  It is not my experience, and I have had a pretty wide experience of Committees of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the President that the issues joined between the Parties here are not of fundamental importance.  Our proposal is that the ex-Attorney-General, the present Attorney-General, and the leader of the Labour Party should constitute this committee.  The Minister for Finance makes a point which does not appeal to me very much but which may appeal to the President.  In matters of this kind, the question of whether Bills are, in fact, Money Bills or not will not arise again so long as the President can sustain his abolition of the Seanad.  Therefore, he has no reason to apprehend that he will be over-ruled or that the Chair will be over-ruled in a matter of this kind in the future, so far as he is concerned. Quite apart, however, from this particular issue of a Money Bill, this fact is going on record: That the first precedent to be established by a Fianna Fáil Government&mdash;and remember this is the first unprecedented constitutional situation that the Fianna Fáil <Col N="2711" /> Government has had to deal with&mdash; the first precedent you are going to establish, the first committee, the constitution of which the Fianna Fáil Government is going to ordain, is going to be the first packed committee of this House in the whole history of the State; and, while in the particular issue that is going to be judged here, it does not very much matter, the precedent that is going to be established and that is going to be appealed to is going to do infinite damage to parliamentary institutions in this country, and it is going to lend colour to what seems to me to be the detestable doctrine that the Deputies of this House are so base and so incompetent and so unworthy of parliamentary institutions that you could not set up parliamentary committees because you could not find men in this House to man them.  That is not true.  I speak as one who has never been on a Committee of this House, except as a member of the minority, and I never experienced on a Committee of this House the kind of tyranny or dishonesty that President de Valera and Deputy MacDermot apprehend is the common rule.  It does not exist.  But why go out and publish to the world that parliamentary institutions have become impossible in this country because we are all debased and corrupt?  We are not.  The rational and sensible thing to do in a committee, over which the Chief Justice of the State is to preside, to decide a very complex question in law as to whether a Bill certified as a Money Bill by the Ceann Comhairle is a Money Bill or not, and the construing of a paragraph in the Constitution, is to have on that committee the Attorney-General and the ex-Attorney-General and then a non-legal Deputy who will represent the cross benches in the House.  Deputy Norton is not the only Deputy who would have done that.  An Independent Deputy would have done it as well.  It was natural that the contribution of the Government would be the Attorney-General; that the contribution of the Opposition would be the ex-Attorney-General, and that from the cross benches in the House there should come a Deputy who would <Col N="2712" /> represent the minds of the non-legal members.  When two Deputies here make a case for a committee to be set up their Party ought to be represented on that committee by at least one Deputy.  I do not attach so much importance to improving the representative capacity of the committee. We can leave that out.</P>
      <P>We are interpreting the Constitution and on that committee there should, from the Government side, be the Attorney-General and, from the Opposition side, the ex-Attorney-General. From the cross Benches a Deputy reasonably representative would be found.  Surely such a committee would do this House more credit than the proposal that we should have two members from the Government Benches and the third the leader of the Labour Party.  The leader of the Labour Party would be acceptable to me as a representative Deputy of the cross benches, not that I do not know him to be a politician for whom I have no respect.  But I always found him, as I found members of the Fianna Fáil Party, concerned for the rights and privileges of the House and prepared to take a certain stand as a member of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the President on this matter, which in a sense is a trivial one, not to slander the House with the imputation that we cannot carry on parliamentary institutions.  I appeal to the President to dissociate himself from the suggestion that if the ex-Attorney-General and the Attorney-General, practically the two heads of the legal profession in this country, sit down together they will deliberately betray their profession and give, as their opinion on a point of law, an opinion that they honestly believe to be false.  There is no responsible Deputy in this House who believes that will happen.  It could not happen, and I appeal to the President to associate himself with us in taking the view that it will not happen and so set clear before the other countries of the world that we are following the ordinary decent course in a matter of this kind; that we are reposing our confidence in Deputies of the House no matter whence drawn; and that we are <Col N="2713" /> doing that in the knowledge that the particular Deputies will have as their primary, and in fact only, concern to construe faithfully this Article of the Constitution.</P>

We have a witness who slept on the same bed for quite a long time and he tells us what the real mentality of the Opposition Front Bench is.  He was intimate in their councils.  He knew what considerations influenced their minds.  He knew what limitations, moral or otherwise swayed them in deciding to do or to leave undone something.  And he says exactly what I say&mdash;and that is that every word of this unctuous self-righteous rectitude that we have had from the Front Bench is carefully organised hypocrisy.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy MacDermot, I hate scurrility, but I hate hypocrisy more.  The only thing to the credit of the Deputy to-day is that he has scarrified hypocrisy when he knew it was hypocrisy.  What else is it?  A packed committee.  We are told by <Col N="2714" /> Deputy Dillon that this is really a very nice House made up of very gentlemanly people, that they would not think of packing a committee.  They never did.  The whole tenour of the atmosphere of this House in relation to committees is, according to Deputy Dillon, that we do get a perfectly fair committee.  I have sent down to the Library for Deputy Dillon's speech on the setting up of the Wicklow Mining Commission, which Deputy MacDermot, with a knowledge of what his Party meant and thought when that Committee was set up, has characterised. But then they say that this House always set up fair committees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>And that also is irrelevant. But the actual position is that I was discussing what Deputy Dillon had said, and I was comparing it with his practice.  His practice was to say that that Committee which as you, Sir, said was selected by the Committee of Selection and was approved of by this House, was a packed committee.  He said it was packed because we put on it the late Minister for Justice in the Cumann na nGaedheal Government. Some packing indeed! You know that sort of sawdust that is put in between <Col N="2715" /> goods to prevent their getting scratched.  And then we are told we are not going to pack committees.  Let us have a committee which consists of three people to investigate a matter in relation to a Bill, and two of those three people will be people who have voted against the Bill which this House has passed.  That is what I call being real fair.</P>
      <P>Then, as to the qualifications, the unimpeachable honesty of the representatives who are suggested for the purpose.  The late Attorney-General, who proved in relation to the Public Safety Act that he would talk to any brief so long as he is briefed.  And they are briefing him in this matter, and then they say: &ldquo;Do not pack the jury.&rdquo;  Deputy Dillon said this ought to be a rough and tumble.  Well, he may be reminded of that on a future occasion.  He says the suggestion is that the members of this House are so base, incompetent and unworthy that no committee can be set up.  What is he suggesting at the moment but that the Committee that we have set up, consisting of the head of the legal profession, the late Minister for Justice of this Government and the leader of the Labour Party are so base, incompetent and unworthy that they are not to be trusted as the representatives of this House in expressing the will of the House and the opinion of the House in relation to a matter of that kind?</P>

I know of no court into which I would go with a greater assurance that the verdict would be in accordance with the evidence. I must say this is the most cheerful funeral I have been at for a <Col N="2716" /> long time.  I have heard of funerals in Ireland called sod picnics.  There was a sod picnic on one occasion when a very charming young lady went to the funeral.  When she came home her mother said: &ldquo;Mary, how did you enjoy the funeral?&rdquo; She replied: &ldquo;Mother, it was lovely.  I sat in the car forninst the husband of the corpse, and he squeezed my hand and said: `Mary, you are the belle of the funeral.' &rdquo;</P>

The comimttees which have been set up by this House have already been criticised. <Col N="2717" /> I am merely dealing with that point.  I would very much like to find in relation to these committees, such as the Wicklow Committee, the Larkin Committee and this committee, machinery which would leave questions which were questions of law clear from any Party considerations.  But so long as the machinery is what it is, we have to live within it.  Deputy MacDermot has told you that if the President were to have set up another kind of committee than he contemplates, the Seanad, which he was not prepared to go into the Lobby to vote for or against last night, would have packed that committee itself.  What are we to do?</P>
      <P>Somebody may find machinery sometime which will leave decisions of this kind free from all Party considerations. I hope they will.  But until they do, as long as committees are made up of Party men and are voted on by majorities in the House, then this sort of thing is going to occur.  The committee which has been set up is a committee which is representative of the knowledge and experience of this House, and until some committee can be proposed which is in itself more representative of that experience, I cannot see how we can agree to alter the committee which we have.  I would ask that some machinery should be set up in relation to all these inquiries which in future may take place which will keep the matter clear of difficulties of this kind.  But we are living in the present and we have to abide by it.</P>

At the beginning of the Irish Ireland Movement 30 years ago, the stage Irishman was attacked by Irish societies all over the world.  He was driven out of Buenos Aires, New York and various other American cities.  I was one of a party 30 years <Col N="2718" /> ago that broke up a show in West London because of misrepresentation of the Irish character.  Here to-day we have in an Irish Parliament a gentleman, who, I believe, was born in Liverpool, telling us about the sport at an Irish funeral.

      <P>So, here we are in a House composed of people chock full of prejudices.  Now, if this provision <Col N="2719" /> in the Constitution is worth anything, and the President feels that this will be a matter of voting and not a matter of right or wrong, one of counting heads, and if he is afraid&mdash;I do not know whether he said this or not; someone said it and it is not contradicted&mdash;that the other House may put up three against him then he is right in taking the precaution to have a vote on it.  Why should he have any fear upon that when he has a majority in this House?  But if the provision of the Constitution, as understood by any of us, is that this machinery was to be set up, presided over by the Chief Justice, then we should have a proper interpretation of the matter submitted to that committee.  Surely, the position here is such that there is no ground for the fears of the President that the other House might put up three persons opposed to the President. Could there not be an understanding that there will be 50-50, and let the matter be investigated?  If not, there is a good deal in what Deputy Dillon said in this House, and what was said in the Seanad, that we are incapable of dealing with the matter on its merits.  I think we could get something by a gentleman's agreement &mdash;whether gentlemen in this House or in the Seanad.  I think we should have a 50-50 arrangement presided over by the Chief Justice.</P>

      <P>Perhaps that was not contemplated in the Constitution.  In the case suggested it would then be in the hands of the Chief Justice with two law officers, namely, the present Attorney-General and the ex-Attorney-General. Let them argue the case and have a proper interpretation of the Constitution.  If the President is convinced that there is nothing to decide, then he need not be afraid of an impartial tribunal and a trained judicial tribunal.  If the President rejects the suggestion to have the matter decided by a trained impartial tribunal, presided over by the leading judge in the country, then he is not easy in his mind as to whether he is on the right road; and the country <Col N="2720" /> will not be satisfied that the President himself is satisfied that an impartial decision will come his way.  However, I suppose nothing that may be said about the matter will alter his views. Again, I emphasise that anyone who reads the debate here to-day will not take Deputy Hugo Flinn as a typical Irishman because he is not an Irishman at all.</P>

I understood the Opposition was anxious to have a debate on the motion for the adjournment, and I suggest we are spending a tremendous lot of time on a matter that will ultimately be decided by a vote.</P>

      <P>My contribution will be very brief indeed.  There appears to me to be gross inconsistency on the part of the Government Deputies on this matter.  Firstly, the President has prejudged the whole matter.  Notwithstanding that he tells us he has appointed two learned legal gentlemen, he says that it is votes that count. That is a little inconsistent.  Indeed, the whole thing is inconsistent. With regard to something Deputy MacDermot said, it is evident that his flirtation with the Government Party is not reciprocated by Deputy Flinn. I suggest what the President should do with regard to the speech made by Deputy Flinn, is that he should have it printed and sent out to the people of Ireland with the President's best wishes for a happy Christmas.</P>

      <P>There is a very important matter before the House; and that is the suggestion of three persons <Col N="2721" /> to act on a committee for the purpose of inquiring whether the Guarantee Fund Bill is a Money Bill or not.  The President, I am informed&mdash;I was not in the House at the time&mdash;has selected Deputy Geoghegan, the Attorney-General and Deputy Norton to act as that committee.  As an ordinary layman, not knowing much about the law, though sometimes I read a good deal about it, and sometimes take an interest in it, I put this question to myself: What are the reasons for the setting up of this committee?  The first reason that occurs to my mind is this: that certain doubts have arisen&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we not discussing the personnel of the committee?  Are we not discussing whether the men selected are efficient for their job?  I intend to prove that one or two of them at least are not fit for that job.  The mere fact of having to set up a committee is proof of their inefficiency. Deputies laugh, but this is no laughing matter.  I am prepared to discuss this question here or anywhere else with the great President&mdash;the great &ldquo;I am&rdquo;&mdash;and with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance. I am prepared to discuss it in accordance with the viewpoint of the ordinary man in the street&mdash;the view after all which counts.  I am proposing to argue that were it not for the fact that the Government has what I may call handymen lawyers there would be no necessity for the setting up of this committee. In case some Deputies may not understand the significance of the term &ldquo;handyman,&rdquo; I would explain to them that a handyman is a man who undertakes to do work which in ordinary circumstances would be done by a qualified tradesman.  The only thing about the handyman is this, that he does not get the same pay as the qualified tradesman; neither does the man for whom he does the job expect as good a job to be done, simply and <Col N="2722" /> solely because he does not pay as much.</P>
      <P>I am arguing here to-day that the Attorney-General&mdash;I say this without offence; he is a very nice lovable kind of gentleman&mdash;is in the same position from the legal point of view as the handyman is in from the work point of view, because it is as plain as A.B.C. that if the job had been done right in the first instance the Louth County Council and the Cork County Council could not take the action they have taken with any hope of success. It is because of the bad job done by the law officers of the Government, for which they receive the wages that are paid to fully qualified tradesmen&mdash;I submit that it is only handymen's wages they should receive&mdash;that we are here to-day discussing the personnel of this committee.  I agree that it is a very important committee.  It is to decide whether a Bill passed through this House by the very small majority of six is a money Bill or not.</P>
      <P>Leaving politics out of it altogether and looking at the position as I see it, from an honest point of view&mdash;of course, I cannot have the same degree of honesty as the gentlemen over there, but sometimes we do show signs of honesty&mdash;I would say that there is one man who should be put on that committee, and it is the ex-Attorney-General, who is familiar with the legislation which has been passed in this legislative Assembly all down through the years from the very first year that this Assembly was established.  Of course, I am quite aware that the members opposite did not know much about the law at that time, and did not have much respect for the law during the first few years.  I can understand that, and of course from their record up to the moment I could not hope that they would yet have the necessary respect for the law.  They are only doing their apprenticeship still. But I think that the President must admit that the man who occupied the position of Attorney-General in the late Government for a period extending over eight or nine years should be included in this committee, if he wants to convince this House that he is really in earnest about having a properly constituted committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2723" /> Of course, the President himself says there is no necessity.  The President is the be-all and end-all of these things.  He never made a mistake in his life.  But they say the man who never made a mistake never made anything.  The President states that there is no necessity.  Whether there is or not, I think he must agree, in view of the reasons I have given, that &mdash;I say it without offence&mdash;he does not seem to have fully qualified lawyers advising him at the moment. I am prepared to argue that here or outside.  He has not fully qualified lawyers, and it would possibly be in his own interests, as well as in the interests of the institutions of this State, if he would sink his feelings and appoint on that committee men who have proved themselves to be lawyers of the first degree&mdash;not handymen. That is what I would respectfully suggest to the President.  Possibly there will come a time when many of the budding lawyers over there&mdash;Deputy Carty, Deputy Cleary, and others, who hope that some day in a few years time they will earn a few cheap pounds under Government patronage&mdash;will possibly show signs of having a greater knowledge of the law than the present law officers.  The position as I view it is that we are paying from £1,200 to £1,400 a year to law officers who have proved beyond doubt in the last few weeks that they do not know their job, and who, as the result, have put this House to very considerable expense in the printing of Bills which would not be necessary if the law officers carried out their duties in an efficient manner.</P>

      <P>Of course, from the beginning, with perhaps the exception of a single speech, every Deputy who is in the House knows that this is all pretence.  All the arguments put forward on the other side were all pretence. They were not believed in by the Deputies who made them.  This is a committee provided for in the Constitution to be set up in certain circumstances, and anybody who knows anything about the Constitution knows that the circumstance it was really meant to deal with was where there would be an attempt on the part of this House to deprive the Seanad of certain privileges.  That was really the fundamental function of this, because if by a wrong decision of the Ceann Comhairle he certified a Bill as a Money Bill he would to that extent be depriving the Seanad of its right to amend or delay the Bill over a considerable period.  It was admitted that the Government and the majority Party had a right to get their work done quickly, and that that work was not to be stopped by a Second House over a considerable period.  It was generally recognised that it was right to remove Money Bills from the power of the Seanad to delay them over a long period.  It was in case there might be an attempt on the part of the Ceann Comhairle&mdash;who might originally have been elected as a member of a Party&mdash;to deprive the Seanad of its functions, by certifying as a Money Bill a Bill which was not a Money Bill, that this provision was made.  The idea was that there would be three members of this House against three members of the Seanad, and the Chief Justice was not to have a vote except in a case where there was equal voting. Everybody who is not pretending knows that the present manoeuvre is not a question of that sort at all.  It is a purely Party manoeuvre in my opinion.  I may be wrong, but I think all the circumstances justify that suspicion on my part, and it is on that suspicion that I am acting, rightly or wrongly.  I believe that the whole thing is a Party manoeuvre.  This is considered a particularly good time when the Seanad is about to disappear, and when a good deal of inconvenience will be caused in the case of an <Col N="2725" /> important matter by delays of this kind.  It is my duty, as one who is responsible for seeing that Government work is done, to see that manoeuvres of that sort will not be successful if I can prevent it.  I am acting strictly here in accordance with my right, and with the right of the Government, and the right of the majority.</P>

If there are people, like Deputy MacDermot, who signed it and who say that they have not done so in that sense, I am not going to act on that assumption.  I am not going to take any chances in the matter so far as I can avoid them. This is going to be settled by votes. The Chief Justice will not have a voice in the determination of the issue unless there is an equality of votes, just the same as in any other matter.  We think we have a right to nominate these members.  The word &ldquo;elected&rdquo; is the word here, and I am putting forward the names of these Deputies.  The Party Whips, as far as we are concerned, will be on in the selection, because there is no question whatever that we could not allow a Party manoeuvre, such as we conceive this to be, to succeed in the matter.  I do not think it is necessary to say anything further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When the House passed to other business I was speaking on this motion.  It is certainly not the desire of this House to hinder or impede the Minister in taking any steps which he thinks will facilitate him in removing a great evil; nor is it the desire to take occasion to paint the horrors of the tenement dwellers of this city or any other cities.  They are familiar to any Deputy who has interested himself in that question.  On all sides of the House there is unanimity of purpose to abate that evil.  But I urge on the leader of the Labour Party that he ought to drop his proposal, because he is going to obscure the main issue, the really pressing evil, which is that of the tenement conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a commission in 1897 under Campbell-Bannerman.  We had another in 1914 under Birrell.  We had another in 1927 under Judge Meredith. This is the fourth.  That is self-evidence of how difficult it is to get anything done.  The prime purpose is to end the abuse of tenement rents. Let us not imagine that we can go into that question and simply strike 5/- or 6/- off every tenement rent in Dublin, though we might do that to-day. By attempting to grapple with a delicate problem of this kind in that <Col N="2729" /> way we might precipitate much graver evils which would require more urgent treatment, if that were conceivable.</P>
    <P>What I want the Minister to do is to face the inescapable fact that you cannot deal with tenement rents until you do away with tenement houses. No rent is justifiable for the class of rooms in which the poor of this city are at present housed.  Some rooms that people live in are not worth a penny a week or a penny a year. There are many families in this city living in basements which have been condemned as unfit for human habitation years ago and in which it is illegal to live.  The Corporation is doing its best to put an end to that.  But, when they come to a family in a basement room and say, &ldquo;You must be out of that this day week,&rdquo; they are met with the reply, &ldquo;Where will we go; is it any improvement to take us out of a basement to put us on the kerbstone&rdquo;? Is it any improvement to take a united family out of the poorest basement room and split it up in the Union? The Corporation, naturally, is driven back to the deplorable confession that it is better to leave people in these loathsome basement rooms than to take whatever measures they are physically able to take under existing circumstances.  What we want to do is to wipe the tenement house out.</P>
    <P>I want this tribunal to concentrate on that issue because when the tenement rent issue is fully examined it will be driven home to every reasonable man that there is only one solution of the question, and that is to abolish the tenements.  I do not believe there is any permanent ameliorative step you can take in respect of tenement rents, because if you fix a rent of 2/-, 1/6 or 6d. and go into the room you will be forced to the conclusion that the room whose rent you have just fixed is not worth anything, because it is not a proper place for human families to live.  That is the real kernel of the problem.  Let this Commission focus attention on that.</P>
    <P>I think the Meredith Commission in 1927 sat at a difficult time.  Perhaps this House was not fully representative at the time and there may have <Col N="2730" /> been difficulties and doubts in its mind. Let this Commission sit in this knowledge, that it is an authoritative Commission commanding the confidence of all sides of the House, and that whatever it recommends as necessary to be done to get the people of this city and the other cities out of tenement houses all sides of the House will co-operate in putting the recommendations into effect.  That is a Commission that will be able to do a job of work.  We will tell them beforehand that we are ready to do anything and everything necessary to get the people out of tenement houses and to go straight ahead, not with the desire to be extravagant, but with the desire effectively to abate the evil.</P>
    <P>Spread the reference into a wide discussion of the taxation of land values and a whole lot of other contentious political questions and the Commission is still-born, because it knows that whatever recommendations it brings in on these highly contentious questions it will simply be for the purpose of having them tossed to and fro across the floor of this House, grave and legitimate and proper dissension arising between Parties in this House on the issues raised, and that the report of the Commission will go into the limbo where hundreds of other reports have gone.  Confine it to one point, tell them in advance: &ldquo;Your personnel commands our confidence as people competent to solve the problem; that being so, tell us what you think it is necessary to do and we will do it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That Commission is going to get results.  It is going to get people out of the slums and to abate the detestable evils that exist.  When that is done, and that is the urgent thing, let us sit down then and discuss Henry George.  There will be plenty of time for discussing Henry George when we are all dead and buried, and I think there will always be cracked brains in this country, and in every other country, to discuss Henry George, Major Douglas and every other freak in the world with a bee in his bonnet so long as there are deliberative assemblies in existence.  These gentlemen, with their theories, may be all right or they may be all wrong. <Col N="2731" /> I think they are all cracked.  The fundamental thing that we should all be agreed on is that we now have a chance of doing something, and doing it in quick time, to take off the shoulders of the Lord Mayor and Corporation of this city and of the other cities and towns in the country, the intolerable burdens that are resting on them at the present time.  We have the opportunity now of doing that promptly and effectively.  Let us do that job now.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Leader of the Labour Party to withdraw his amendment, but in no sense to abandon his intention of submitting it on another occasion.  But let us have a unanimous vote now that we want a commission to consider the problem of these town tenants, and let us have a recommendation from that commission as to what is necessary to be done. Let us be unanimously in favour now that we will be ready to do whatever they tell us to make an end of that abuse, and that whereever we will get the money we will undertake to find it: that even, if necessary, we will end the economic war in order to find it.</P>

      <P>The appeal that Deputy Dillon has made to Deputy Norton to withdraw his amendment does not come with any force from him because it is only a week or ten days since, in this House, he advocated the total removal of all existing rent restrictions. The reason he gave for that was that he believed the existing rent restrictions, limited as they are, were holding up building work in the country and keeping down the price of house property.</P>

      <P>Will the Deputy allow me to intervene for a moment?  I do not want him to be under a misapprehension. I earnestly meant that I want unanimity on the proposal I have put to the House.  The Deputy may have honestly misunderstood me.  The point that I made on the Expiring Laws Bill was that I wanted the provision in the Rent Restrictions Acts, which provides that if a tenant can prove that it is more inconvenient for him to be put out than for the landlord to do without the house, removed, <Col N="2732" /> because I thought it was defeating its object by postponing building.  I wanted the Government to tell us when would the housing schemes that are going forward all over the country have reached the point when it would be legitimate to remove the Rent Restrictions Acts, because I believed that when these Acts were removed the Government would get from the private builder a much bigger volume of assistance in solving the problem than they are at present getting.

      <P>The appeal that has been made, coming from a Deputy who advocated the removal of the existing rent restrictions, does not carry any great force or conviction to the Deputies sitting on these benches.  I admit that there is urgency in the matter of facing up to the question of the rents charged by slum landlords in our cities and towns.  There is a necessity for that, even from the point of view of educating the Minister and his colleagues in regard to that particular matter.  I heard the Minister for Justice state here that a certain interDepartmental committee made it clear, from the information made available to them, that the average rent charged for rooms was about 3/-per <Col N="2733" /> room.  We had the statement made in this House by the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, when he sat on the Opposition Benches and when speaking on the Landlord and Tenant Bill of 1931, that the rents charged to the occupiers of slum dwellings in this city were as high as 17/- and 18/- per room.  I submit that there is a need for educating the members of the Ministry in regard to this particular matter.  I agree that it is a matter of great urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The members of this Party welcome the establishment of this tribunal if for no other reason than that of getting more information and so as to enable us to deal with this pressing problem.  Are we to understand from the Minister for Justice that the establishment of this tribunal is merely a step taken for the purpose of evading the Government's obligations in regard to the long-promised town tenants Bill?  There is no doubt whatever that President de Valera, previous to the 1932 General Election, gave a public pledge in a public place that one of the first Bills to be introduced by his Government would be a town tenants Bill.  Are we to understand that the setting up of this tribunal marks the extent to which the present Government are prepared to go at the present time, and that they do not mean to fulfil the promise they made to introduce a town tenants Bill during the lifetime of this Dáil?  I am prompted to put that question and to ask for a definite reply, because of a statement that was made last week at the Ard-Fheis by the Minister for Finance.  Resolutions were sent forward by various branches of the Fianna Fáil organisation throughout the country, and these were opposed by the Ministry.  The Minister for Finance went so far as to state quite definitely that there was no intention, on the part of the Government, to bring in a town tenants Bill because in his opinion&mdash;I suppose it is the opinion of his colleagues also&mdash;to do so would be to injure the public credit.  I would like to hear a further explanation of that from the Minister for Finance, and, in his absence, from the Minister for Justice as to what the <Col N="2734" /> Cabinet mean by that particular statement. How can they justify it?</P>
    <P>I have read some articles on this matter which have been written by a leader writer on the <i>Irish Times</i> newspaper, as well as articles which have been published in some other papers.  I have come to the conclusion that the gentleman who writes the leading articles for the <i>Irish Times</i> has a big say in shaping the financial policy of the Government. His words are actually repeated parrot-like, as happened, for instance, in the case of the Conversion Bill, by the Minister for Finance.  I do not know whether that gentleman has converted the Minister for Finance to his point of view, or whether the reverse is the case: that he has been converted to the point of view of the Minister for Finance.  Certainly, the point of view of both is not the point of view that was held by the Minister for Finance when he sat on the Opposition Benches in this House, when he and his colleagues made promises in connection with the town tenants Bill.  If Deputy Dillon was serious in speaking on this motion, I would put this question to him: what is there to prevent this tribunal from bringing in an interim report as soon as possible in connection with the matters set out in paragraphs (a) and (b) of the motion, and then let the commission continue their work in the manner outlined in the amendment suggested by Deputy Norton?  There is no reason why the commission should not be asked to bring in an interim report dealing with the subject matter of the proposals put forward by the Minister, then continue their activities and bring in, at a later date, a report or recommendations based on the amendment suggested by Deputy Norton.  I should like, however, if the Minister would make the point of view of the Cabinet quite plain, once and for all, as to whether this is an attempt to evade the public pledges, given by the President and his colleagues, to introduce, during the lifetime of the present Government, a town tenants Bill, making provision for the reasonable claims put forward by town tenant organisations.</P>

      <P>Yes.  A point made by Deputy Morrissey was that there was no necessity for any inquiry like this, as all the particulars were available from the report of the Meredith Commission.  The Deputy also stated that there was no difference in the terms of reference in the motion and the terms of reference of that Commission. If they are compared it will be found that there is a difference, and that what the Meredith Commission was asked to investigate was the general question of the relationship between landlords and tenants.  This motion deals with a more specific problem which is considered an urgent one, one that has been discussed in the House.  Reference has been made to promises made to introduce a town tenants Bill.  It seems to be regarded by some Deputies, and also by some town tenants organisations, that it is quite a simple thing to introduce such a Bill.  Since I went to the Department of Justice that was put to me from time to time, and I think it was fairly reasonable that I should ask those who came forward asking to have such legislation enacted, to make suggestions so that they might be considered. I have been trying for a good while to get suggestions from people who claim to be representatives of the town tenants.  I asked them to submit cases showing hardship, and not vague cases that might exist.  I know that there are two or three towns where there are extraordinary anomalies, where, I agree, hardships exist.  I asked the organisations to submit examples showing where these hardships exist. I think that was perfectly reasonable. <Col N="2736" /> It is only within the last four weeks that I got them.  On going through them I saw that they would be of no assistance to the Commission or anyone else.  The particulars could not be described otherwise than vague, and without following them up, and inquiring into all the circumstances, no one could say whether there was hardship or not.  It took all that time to get these from people who claim that grievances exist.</P>
      <P>I undertook that as soon as these cases were submitted they would be impartially examined by the Departmental Committee.  Its recommendations were of very little, if of any, assistance.  The only one was the recommendation that it might be easier to separate the valuations.  At the present time people in tenements can go to court and get the valuation segregated in order that they might come within the provisions of the Increase of Rent Restrictions Act.  It was suggested by the Departmental Committee that an easier, a cheaper and a more direct way might be brought about.  They pointed out that they could only go on the basis of what was before them, by examining the Meredith Report and the evidence submitted, as well as the law as it existed.  They pointed out that without evidence being submitted and witnesses examined they were not in a position to make any further recommendation. We have not been neglecting or shelving the question.  It is quite simple to come here and say that a Bill should be brought in to deal with the position of town tenants, as if it was quite a simple problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>When that commission was sitting there was no claim that purchase provisions should be brought into any Bill.  At present town tenants throughout the country are claiming the right to buy out their houses.  As far as the evidence went &mdash;do not mind the recommendation&mdash; before the Meredith Commission, some witnesses suggested that preference should be given to occupying tenants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  If the Deputy examines the evidence he will find that that was as far as the evidence went.  There was no evidence given before that commission that a scheme should be brought in whereby tenants could buy out their houses.  To-day the claim is made that there should be a scheme put in operation whereby tenants could buy out houses and own them.  That is not an easy problem. I know parts of the country where small house landlords are very much poorer than some of the occupying tenants.  It may be true that in certain cases landlords are living out of the country, and that they are peculiar people.  I have cases in mind where some people have nothing to rely upon except the little rents they get from four or five houses.  If Deputies look into the matter in their own areas, they will find cases like that.  It is all right to talk about extortionate rents, about people living out of the country, and about money going out, but there are two sides to the question.  This motion is not brought in as anything final to deal with this problem.  It is not being brought in for the purpose of shelving <Col N="2738" /> it, or as a stop-gap to further legislation. It is meant to deal with what has been represented to me as an urgent problem, and is only an instalment, leaving the door open when this is disposed of, to look into other matters.  That is as far as I can go.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not the Ard Fheis decision.  The Ard Fheis decision was about ground rents. Deputy Norton in the amendment asks about the high prices being charged for building sites affecting house rents. I do not claim to know everything about this, but from what I have seen and from inquiries I have made as to the position around Dublin, where building is going on, I understand what happens is that some gentleman may own a holding or a portion of land which at one time was not as valuable as it is to-day by reason of the city spreading out.  I know of one case where two acres of land were sold for something like £3,000.  Undoubtedly, the spread of the city and the building going on has increased values, but, so far as the examples I have seen are concerned, it does not relate to high rents.  I have in mind certain estates convenient to Dublin, and, as I am informed, what happens is that the houses, when built, are put up for sale at prices like £900, £1,100, and £1,200: a deposit is paid and the rest is paid by instalments, but you cannot relate it to rent.  There may be exceptions to that, and there probably are, but so far as building by speculative builders is concerned, that is what is being done.  They dispose of the houses in the great majority of cases and do not let them for rent.  There are ground rents, but, as we all know, they are very small in connection with the building that is going on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of the matter which has to be looked to.  It is that one has to be very careful not to do anything that will discourage the speculative builder.  I have to be very careful that something I might do in my Department is not going to hold up <Col N="2739" /> the policy of the Local Government Department in going ahead with housing.  No matter what anybody says, there is one solution, and one solution only, for this tenant question, and that is the old matter of supply and demand.  If there was not trouble in that respect, there would not be talk about uneconomic rents and competition would adjust itself.  If any action were to be taken by the Government that would frighten people from speculative building.  I am afraid it would have a reaction which would not be very good for the people whom you are trying to serve in the matter of housing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I know.  The Corporation has to deal with that other problem of building for the poor so far as the city is concerned.  There again the only solution is building and more building, houses and more houses.  The slum problem is a difficulty in this city, but one which I believe the Corporation are doing their best to deal with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was suggested here that I was misinformed in regard to this price of 3/- a room.  There were two clearance areas made in the City of Dublin, one being around Gloucester Street and that district, by the Corporation, and the average price for those two areas was 3/- per room, as shown by the statistics in the Department of Local Government.  There are, I know, exceptions.  I know that there are cases in which 17/- has been paid for a room.  We do not dispute that at all, and, in fact, we have received letters about it, but in those two clearance areas&mdash;the only place in respect of which we could get statistics &mdash;as shown by the statistics in the Department, the figure was 3/- per room.  That is where I got the information from.  There is a difficulty there in that many of these slum landlords will, if they are interfered with, probably put us in a difficulty and bring about a position in which these houses will be allowed to remain vacant.  They have put up the case <Col N="2740" /> that it is all right to charge 3/- or 5/- for a room, but that they only get the rent once in three weeks, because tenants go off and leave arrears.</P>
    <P>There is no solution for that and there can be no solution found by any Government in the nature of a rent adjustment except a temporary solution. Nothing along the lines of settling rents can be anything but temporary. The one and only solution is to get the people out of the houses and into decent houses, and I think that is being done as well as it can be done by the Corporation and by the Local Government Department.  This proposal will deal with extortionate rents, and I hope we shall have the report in a very short time and that we will get some means of dealing with the problem.</P>
    <P>With regard to the other suggestion in paragraph (c) of Deputy Norton's amendment that the tribunal should inquire as to the extent to which rents are paid out of moneys provided under the Unemployment Assistance Acts and as home assistance, that would entail a good deal of trouble, delay and difficulty. I do not believe that when you had got all the details you possibly could get, they would be anything like accurate or capable of quotation with reliance.  I am not prepared to accept the amendment.  I think the motion I have tabled is urgent, or at least it deals with a more urgent problem.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;I think it has contributed very considerably to a continuance of the housing shortage in the country.  I am wondering when will the time come when the removal of those restrictions on rents will become <Col N="2741" /> possible as well as the removal of the restriction on ejectment proceedings which provides that if a tenant can prove that it is more inconvenient for him to move than it is for the landlord that he should remain indefinitely in another man's house provided he pays the agreed rent. The result of that proviso is that a great many people who would be building houses, and thereby helping to relieve the housing shortage, are not building.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the form had better be gone through of moving the adjournment in the usual way.  It is manifestly impossible for anybody to deal adequately with the situation that has arisen and with the matters that should be brought under the notice of the country at a period of Recess, but in a word I should like to draw the <Col N="2742" /> attention of this House and the country to something that is happening which may have repercussions which are unexpected.  Taking it as generally accepted by the rational Deputies of this House that the economic war ought to be brought to a close, I should also like to direct the attention of the House to another cause of stress under which the agricultural community, the consuming public of this country, is suffering.</P>
      <P>It arises from a combination, not of tariffs generally, but of the kind of tariffs which the Fianna Fáil Government have been enacting since they came into office.  It arises from the kind of schemes for which the Fianna Fáil Government have been responsible since they came into office.  Few Deputies realise that the receipts from Customs and Excise have increased by £1,750,000 since Fianna Fáil came into office.  The people paying these Customs and Excise duties are the consuming public, who are, to the extent of 85 per cent., agricultural workers and small farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me bring before the House an example of the ordinary Christmas purchases of a small farmer&mdash;purchases which will be made in tens of thousands of cases between now and Christmas Day.  These purchases will consist of 1 lb. of tea, a stone of sugar, 2 lbs. of currants, 2 lbs. of raisins, 1 cwt. of flour, and 4 ozs. of tobacco. That is a typical Christmas purchase made by a small farmer's wife in the congested areas.  A labourer could not afford as much as that.  This bears much more heavily on the agricultural labourer than on anyone else.  A lb. of tea will cost 2/-.  That is cheap tea. There was a time when country people paid 4/4 for their tea.  They do not pay that now.  They take tea costing from 2/- to 2/4.  That tea, if from Java or Ceylon, carries a tax of 6d.  A stone of sugar costing 3/9 carries a tax of 3/-, if you allow for the incidence of the beet sugar charge, plus Excise tariff. Two lbs. of currants carry a 2d. tax, and 2 lbs. of raisins carry 2d. more by way of tax.  A cwt. of flour at a price of 15/6 carries 4/6 for wheat bounty. Four ozs. of tobacco cost 2/8, of which 2/- is tax.  That parcel of goods will <Col N="2743" /> cost the farmer's wife 25/11, and, of that 25/11, 9/10 is going into the Exchequer in taxes.</P>
    <P>Now, let us take the case of the agricultural labourer, who is earning, in many parts of the country, £1 per week.  Let us assume that poverty compels him&mdash;and only poverty&mdash;to buy half what the farmer buys and do with that amount.  No matter how numerous his family, they will have to do with half the amount that fills the farmer's basket.  Assuming that that be true, his bill for the week's groceries is 13/- and, out of that sum of 13/-, 5/- goes into the Exchequer. That man has 20/- per week and he has got to pay rates and rent for his cottage.  Nevertheless, he has to pay 5/- in tax to the Government on his food.  Let us remember that that is on his food only.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the additional expenses. I was in a country shop not long ago, standing beside the wife of a man who had just come home after spending the harvesting season in England.  These are homely facts which seem a little ludicrous in this atmosphere, but they are the kind of things that are happening in the houses of the people at the present time.  This woman wanted three pairs of sheets for the beds.  She said quite frankly that times were bad, that her husband had just come back from England with a little bit of money and that she wanted the cheapest sheets she could get.  She was told that the cheapest would be blay, twill sheeting at 1/3 a yard.  &ldquo;If that is the cheapest I can get,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;there is nothing more to be done; I shall have to take them.&rdquo;  She took five yards for each pair&mdash;that was 15 yards of sheeting&mdash;and the bill came to about 18/9.  When she paid the bill, it suddenly dawned on me that that woman, out of that 18/9, was paying 5/- tax because there was 33? per cent. duty on the sheeting she was buying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand this matter and the Deputy does not.  The tariff <Col N="2744" /> is calculated on the cost price and not on the selling price.  One tries not to overstate a case.  I want to state the bare facts, which the Government themselves must know to be true.  That man had to go to England, and he had just come home that morning to meet the bills his wife and family had run up.  He had to buy some things to keep the house decent and clean, and, out of that miserable purchase of the cheapest sheeting, his wife had to pay 5/- tax.  I think that the industries of this country reflect credit on the country.  I think that the confectionery, jam, furniture and boot industries and such enterprises, which are now manufacturing stuff as cheaply as it could be bought anywhere, should be a source of intense pride to us.  I think that the men who put up these factories and promoted these industries deserve well of the country.  They are a source of pride to the people, but if they are going to be confused with the sort of activity which puts on the shoulders of the poorest people an intolerable burden, then these men are going to be lumped together in an indictment of which they are not deserving.  The sound, economic industries of this country ask nothing of the consuming public.  They are giving them good value for their money, and all they want a tariff for is to prevent dumping or unfair competition, designed by continental, American or British firms to wipe them out and subsequently to exploit the Irish market.  These men prove what I say by the commodities they are offering.  There are boots being made in this country as cheap and as good as could be made by Bata of Czechoslovakia.  There is furniture being made here as good as could be made in any part of Great Britain or any other country.  Confectionery is being made as good as any that is made in London, and is not costing the people any more, except in so far as the manufacturers have to pay an additional duty on the sugar required for the manufacture.  So far, however, as the confectioners are concerned, they are not asking any more than outside manufactures.  So far as the woollen merchants are concerned, I say our woollen merchants do not want a tariff <Col N="2745" /> because they have nothing to fear from foreign competition.  The Irish woollen mills are producing better woollens than are being produced in Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These industries were built up on a moderate tariff.  The manufacturers had to build up their organisations in the constant knowledge that they had to be reasonably competitive or foreign manufactures would flow in over the tariff wall.  These tariffs gave a chance to the manufacturers to go around to their men and say: &ldquo;There must be no lying down on the job.  We are able to do the work but there must be no lying down behind a 100 per cent. or a 75 per cent. tariff.  You have got to turn out the stuff and, if not, there is a Government in office which will come down like a hundredweight of bricks on us if we attempt to exploit the buying public.&rdquo;  Can we say that the present Government is applying that test to the tariff problem?  It is not.  It is placing terrible charges on the poorest section of the community.  It is bringing into odium honest men&mdash;the industrialists of this country, who do not want tariffs of that kind but merely want the opportunity to show the world that they can produce certain classes of merchandise as well as, and perhaps better than, any other country.  Therefore I say that the present tariff policy of the Government is injuring not alone the consuming public but the manufacturing class itself.  The President and every responsible Minister knows that there are individuals sheltering behind tariff walls of 100 per cent. and 75 per cent. who are not giving value to the people of this country for what they are getting.  That is not right and it is introducing an element into debates here which is obscuring the merits of industries brought before us.  There are industries in the setting up of which we should all be glad to co-operate but we feel profoundly that a reckless tariff system which puts a tariff on one commodity on Monday and on a raw material on Tuesday without any regard to the repercussions which one tariff may have on another is perfectly worthless <Col N="2746" /> from the industrial point of view. Deputies will say that the Minister for Industry and Commerce would not impose a 75 per cent. tariff if it were not necessary to establish an industry.</P>
    <P>I am bound to draw the attention of the House to this fact: that you can use, as an excuse for putting on a tariff, a little workshop in a back street; but these returns show what those tariffs are producing.  They are the Finance Accounts of Saorstát Eireann, and the tariffs at present in force and the excise duties combined are producing £1,250,000 more for the Exchequer than they were producing for the Exchequer this time five years ago.  One cannot blame the Minister for Finance, when he is at his wits' end to find money for folly, co-operating and conspiring with the Minister for Industry and Commerce to silence Opposition criticism of that kind of excessive taxation by saying that these tariffs are not designed as taxes but that they are designed to protect Irish industry; but when the Opposition criticises these tariffs, the accusation is made that they are trying to sabotage Irish industry.  I say that that is dishonest.  I say that it is doing a disservice to industry in this country and a disservice to the people of this country, because they are being made to couple in their minds the sufferings and privations they are enduring with the promotion of Irish industry.  I say that a good standard of living for the people of this country is not inconsistent with the promotion of Irish industry.  The promotion of Irish industry is not inconsistent with a higher standard of living for every worker in this country.</P>
    <P>It will be admitted that we are bound to have differences about individual tariffs&mdash;whether one tariff is better than another and so on&mdash;but we need not have any argument on the fundamental principle that we all want Irish industry to thrive and prosper and progress, and that we are all prepared to use the tariff weapon with that end in view.  We will not stand, however, for the use of tariffs for the <Col N="2747" /> purpose of taxing the food and necessities of the poor, nor will we stand for the false argument that any impatience with a tariff of that character is an attempt to sabotage Irish industry.  I urge, therefore, on the Government that, between now and next February, they should reconsider their attitude on this whole problem and approach it <Col N="2748" /> in the future with more thought for the people who are suffering as a result of these indiscriminate tariffs and with a more rational disposition towards the whole problem.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 2 p.m. until Wednesday, 5th February, 1936, at 3 p.m.</P>

    <Title>Question.&mdash;   Written Answer. - Ex-Prisoners' Allegations of III-treatment.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. P. Smith Mr. P. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether his attention has been called to the allegations of ill-treatment made recently by ex-prisoners from Arbour Hill Prison, and whether he will cause these allegations to be investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Aiken) Minister for Defence (Mr. Aiken)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the allegations to which the Deputy refers.  I have already caused a minute and careful investigation to be made into them, and am satisfied that the charges of ill-treatment are completely false.</P>
      <P>During the months of June, July, August and September two groups of prisoners made demands which they were warned could not be conceded. They followed up these impossible demands by refusing to leave their cells, by refusing food for a few days, and in a few cases by attacking their guards.</P>
      <P>The first group demanded among other concessions a wireless set and a swimming pool; the second group demanded a wireless set and food to be served to one of them by a prisoner nominated by him.  The second group later withdrew the application for the wireless, but one of them refused to accept food for a few days, because he was not waited upon by his own nominee.  The refusal to take exercise was started by the first group in the first week in June, but they gave it up after a few days; the second group unfortunately carried it on until the third week in October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since then the prisoners are accepting the prison conditions which were <Col N="2670" /> open to them all the time and are now taking exercise, receiving visits and writing letters in the normal way. During those months, however, the prisoners caused a lot of unnecessary hardships to themselves and trouble to the prison authorities, and all for concessions which neither themselves nor their friends outside believed to be justified.  This is proved by letters which I shall quote.</P>
    <P>In addition to refusing exercise a number of prisoners barricaded themselves on two occasions in their cells. Towards the end of the period, when the prisoners saw they were getting nowhere with their stay-in strike, some of them became violent and assaulted their guards, with the result that a couple of the prisoners received minor bruises, and two of the guards were so injured that one of them was on sick leave for a fortnight, and the other for three days.  Some of the prisoners were found to have sharpened table-knives into the form of daggers, and consequently as a precaution all the prisoners participating in the trouble were deprived of their knives.  The minimum of force was used where resistance was offered.  The most violent of the prisoners were punished by the forfeiture of remission of sentence which can be earned by good conduct, and two of them were given bread and water for three days.  All the prisoners who used their cell furniture to barricade their cells were deprived of furniture, with the exception of bedding, for one month.</P>
    <P>The complete artificiality of the recent troubles in Arbour Hill and the deception of the general public which is being attempted by those outside who call themselves friends of the prisoners is, perhaps, best indicated in the prisoners' own words.  The following are extracts from a prisoner's letter dated 3/6/35:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...Hoping this finds you and Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; and all at H.Q. in good health the same apply to all in here.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But on the other hand all is not well as our leader, Mr. &mdash;&mdash; is continually drifting from one trouble to another.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The latest has now started on <Col N="2671" /> Thursday.  Number one is, and you will be surprised to hear of it, that he is working under the orders of the so-called leader of I.R.A. prisoners, &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, the name must be fresh in your memory since the meeting in &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.  And it is known to all of us in here that Mr. &mdash;&mdash; and the name mentioned spend hours together in concultons the result of those meetings has placed us in a very critical position.  We have now received orders which is as follows:&mdash; receive no visits, write no letters do nothing regarding the general cleaness of the prison, do no washing, clean no lavatorys, draw no coal and to say all, do nothing.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This is a protest brought about by the so-called I.R.A. and Mr.&mdash;&mdash; has stood in with them in this demand and is playing up to them...</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I would ask you in the interests of organisation and its members in here and of those who will have to come in that this man, Mr. &mdash;&mdash; be relieved of the position of our leader at once, and some one with a little brains be put at the head of us in here...</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These are the demands made:&mdash; (1) is a radio set to be installed in here, (2) the daily papers every day, (3) a swimming pool, (1) a handball alley in the compound; are these demands made by any sane man.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I understand if these are not granted within two days, which expire to-day, drastic action is to be taken.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The following are extracts from a letter written by another prisoner, dated 17/9/35:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...We were forced into this rather `unconventional' protest by the exigencies of the situation here. Unfortunately the way things developed a large number of the men here presented me with an ultimatum that unless I ordered all men to stay in cells&mdash;tantamount to an order to refuse food&mdash;they themselves would go on `strike' indefinitely in sympathy with me.  Needless to say, I didn't want this kind of `sympathy'...</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In order, however, to avoid the <Col N="2672" /> spectacle of some of the men going on hunger strike for an indefinite period, i.e., till I came off it, I compromised on the thing and agreed to a strike for not longer than four days or, rather to an order to the men not to remove the barricades of their cells for four days.  I exempted certain men due for release.  Everything went off well but without any change in the position...</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With regard to the `suggestion' that the present methods should be discontinued, I must claim that by virtue of my being on the spot, I am the most competent judge?  In any event the vast majority of the men would take an order to go on exercise now very badly, their attitude is that having stuck this confinement for 16 weeks, they must stick it to the end.  I know, of course, that H.Q. only suggested the calling off of the protest.  Suggestion or otherwise, however, it must continue now to the end.  Particularly on the `recognition' end, any concession on the parcels issue would satisfy their pride...</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...You know that my views on this thing are not so definite (parcels and other privileges) as &mdash;&mdash;'s but I feel that the men who have started and carried on before I came here are entitled to have their views considered. The actual confinement itself is no great discomfort to me, personally, as it gives me a certain seclusion and privacy that I would not otherwise have...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The following are the conditions available to the prisoners in Arbour Hill:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  Food.&mdash;Same as for serving soldier, and in addition a supper consisting of ½ pint milk, 4 ozs. bread, 1 oz. butter, and also allowed to purchase food.</P>
    <P>2.  Clothes.&mdash;Allowed to wear their own clothes and boots and get in all the clothes they want, and as occasion arises a prisoner in need of any article of clothing is supplied with same at the discretion of the Governor.</P>
    <P>3.  Books.&mdash;Allowed the books in library and allowed to purchase books.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2673" /> 4.  Tobacco.&mdash;Allowed to smoke at all times and purchase tobacco and cigarettes.</P>
    <P>5.  Exercise&mdash;Free association and exercise from after breakfast until 9 p.m. in the summer period and 8 p.m. winter period except when at meals.</P>
    <P>6.  Education Classes.&mdash;Allowed classes under qualified teacher for 4 hours per day.</P>
    <P>7.  Visits.&mdash;At least one visit per month, and additional visits when necessary.</P>
    <P>8.  Letters.&mdash;Allowed to write one letter per week and to receive all letters addressed to them.</P>
    <P>9.  Games.&mdash;Handball, weight-throwing, table tennis, draughts, chess, cards, etc.</P>
    <P>There are two large school rooms in which the prisoners can read and play games when classes are not on.</P>
    <P>10. Laundry with basins and drying rack.</P>
    <P>Baths&mdash;Shower, hot and cold water.</P>
    <P>A large number of prisoners and ex-prisoners of all sorts availed themselves of these conditions during their term of imprisonment.  I am glad to say that all the prisoners in Arbour Hill have been availing themselves of these conditions and have been behaving in a disciplined manner for the past two months.</P>
