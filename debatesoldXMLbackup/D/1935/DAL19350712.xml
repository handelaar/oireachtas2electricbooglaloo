      <P>At the adjournment last night I paused to deal with the charge which Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney had put in the forefront of his indictment of me, and which I had seconded in my reply. The charge made was the most serious <Col N="474" /> in the attack that the Deputy made upon my administration.  A more serious charge could hardly be made against a Law Officer, a charge that he was utilising his position, to take advantage of the type of Tribunal set up under a special Act, and a special Article of the Constitution, and taking advantage of the fact that they were laymen, to introduce and to produce against witnesses arraigned before them evidence which was not legal evidence.  The Deputy spared no words in framing the charge.  He charged me, he said, with endeavouring to have men convicted against whom he knows there is no legal evidence; with endeavouring to secure a conviction by fair means or foul.  It would fray tempers when such a charge was made.  I never had such a charge made against me before by any individual.  Such a charge was never made against me by any defending counsel in any case since I came into office.  Why should the making of such a charge be reserved for the protective and privileged atmosphere of this House?  If such a charge is to be made, why is it not made before the Tribunal itself?  This was not a momentary ebullition.  It was a coolly calculated and planned attack.  He made that the spear head of the attack. It appears to be his attack wholly. No one followed him, and none of his colleagues adopted the attitude he adopted, in the ridiculous pretence that he sought to persuade, even Deputies on these benches, that I was a monster in human form.  So concerned was he with the iniquities I perpetrated in this matter that he actually expressed sympathy with the unfortunate members of the I.R.A. who, he says, are languishing in jail as a result of charges and of the presentation of cases against them on evidence that is not evidence at all. He went on:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I charge him with actually succeeding in getting verdicts which he and everybody else knows cannot be sustained in law.  I charge him with obtaining verdicts through his counsel and having men sent to prison in cases in which, if he properly <Col N="475" /> discharged the duties of his office and did it fairly and honourably, he would enter a <i>nolle prosequi,</i> because there was no evidence against those men.  He should not allow the Military Tribunal or any court to convict any persons who, in law, have committed no crime or against whom, in law, there is no evidence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I quoted the rest of what the Deputy said last night.  To that particular charge he devoted the greater part of his speech.  As I stated last night, while one might be quite prepared to listen to submissions or suggestions which might more appropriately be made elsewhere, and which could quite properly be made here as interpretations placed upon certain sections of an Act of the Oireachtas, it is certainly startling, to say the very least, to find a man who occupied the position of Minister for Justice, and who was a member of the first Government that was in office when this Act was put into operation, making a charge like that.  When I looked up the records I found that the practice of putting in statements made by prisoners was entered upon from the moment the Article was put into operation.  I made reference to particular things last night.  I see by one of the morning newspapers that I did not overhear an interruption in which the Deputy accused me of twisting. I do not know what exactly there was in what I said to suggest that I was endeavouring to twist in any way.  What I said was that interrogations of prisoners were put in evidence, as a matter of course, by the prosecution under the régime in which the Deputy was Minister for Justice.  In one particular case&mdash;the only case in which I have a file&mdash; Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney endorsed on the file the statement that he would grant a certificate.  Subsequently, the case was tried and the certificate was produced.</P>

      <P>Surely the Attorney-General admits that a certificate has nothing to do with evidence. It certifies as to the nature of the crime and not as to the guilt or <Col N="476" /> innocence of the person charged or the weight of evidence against him.</P>

      <P>The Deputy made an allegation in this House against me, that I had embarked upon a wholly new procedure, that I had done something which was an outrage upon justice, and that I had not performed my duty properly.  When I look at the file, coming from his office, I find under his hand evidence that, when he was Minister for Justice, the precise thing he charges me with having done was done.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy would accept my statement that <Col N="477" /> Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has abused the privileges of this House and made a charge against me, which charge, if true or correct, should be made against my predecessor in office when the Deputy was Minister for Justice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am to be attacked for doing something that was done from the very first day the Article was put into operation, I should, at least, be allowed an opportunity to reply.  In this case the accused, a man named Driscoll, was charged with an attack upon an I.O.C. bus.  There were a number of offences charged&mdash;conspiracy, unlawful and malicious damage to a bus, the property of the I.O.C., unlawfully and maliciously cutting telegraph wires, possession of firearms, the possession of firearms with intent to endanger life.  There was a whole array of charges, numbering six.  For some of the offences charged, a certificate was necessary and that certificate was given by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney when he was Minister for Justice. That certificate, as I mentioned last night, states that the acts constituting the offence were done for a certain purpose.  I made the point last night &mdash;I do not know whether Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney grasped it or whether he still adheres to the escape which he seeks to make&mdash;that when a Minister is giving a certificate that the acts constituting the offence are done for certain objects, it is presumed&mdash; I should presume, at all events&mdash;that he reads the file and satisfies himself as to what the acts were.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very difficult for a Minister to certify what the acts were unless he also knew what the facts were.  In this case, my suggestion is that the sole evidence against the prisoner was the statement he himself made in answer to interrogations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not said that.  What I said was that I did not weigh the evidence against the prisoner.  I decided whether, in my judgment, the crime was one which came within the wording of the Schedule to the Act.  The guilt or innocence of the accused or the weight of evidence against him, I did not and would not consider.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is endeavouring to evade the issue. He made a very specific charge against me.  He is evidently attempting to shove responsibility on to my predecessor and to the senior counsel who prosecuted and who happens to be a member of this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>The evidence was his answers to the interrogation. The interrogation was very long.  It <Col N="479" /> consisted of a large number of questions and I do not suppose I need read the whole of it.  If the Deputy has any doubt, he can have the file. It begins as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;What is your correct name? What is your address?  What is your occupation?  Do you remember the evening of July 11th?  Do you remember being in Ardfert?  Did you hire a motor car there?...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;and so on, taking the man down through the course of his movements on that evening.  It continues:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Before going to Connors, did you go anywhere else?  Did you go to the post office?&mdash;Oh, begor, I did.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall try to make it short and will only read as little of it as I can.  I do not want even to appear to take up the time of the House, but I think it is only fair that I should get an opportunity of disposing of the charge that has been levelled against me.  The interrogation proceeded:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Were you ever in the I.R.A.?&mdash;I was.  When did you sever your connection with it?&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;and so on; and the main part of the statement on which the charges were based was as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;When we came to the village, I struck the bus on the road with a hammer.  I think the sledge went into the garage where the other bus was.  I opened up the bonnet and struck at the place where the wires were all connected.  I did not want to damage the engine, as I only wanted to put the bus out of order. We came back to the car...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;and so on.  That was the statement in answer to interrogation in which the man incriminated himself.  At the trial Mr. Vincent Rice&mdash;now Deputy Rice&mdash;<Col N="480" /> prosecuted; and I will say this for Deputy Rice: I defended several prisoners when he was acting as State Prosecutor, and he was an eminently fair prosecutor.  He was always fair. Mr. Rice called the inspector who tendered the statement made by the prisoner, in which he described the damaging of the bus.  I am now reading from the <i>Irish Independent</i>, which, I observe, this morning omits altogether any part of the answer which I gave last night to this charge levelled by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney against me, to which charge it gave such prominence in its issue the other day.  I am reading from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of the 22nd January, 1932:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Inspector O'Mahony tendered a statement made by Driscoll, in which he described the damaging of the bus and the severing of the wires.  He acted, he said, as a result of an order he received a week before the Guards' Sports.  Accused stated he was accompanied by a man called Hegarty.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The whole statement is given here verbatim as it was made, and it was the only evidence, as far as I can see here on this file of those particular charges in connection with the particular attack upon the bus.  Has the Deputy anything to say now?</P>

I quite fail to appreciate how, if I have acted improperly, unfairly and unjustly towards prisoners in putting in statements made by them, the result has anything to do with that charge against me.  If that is an improper, unfair and illegal thing to do.  I do not see what the result of the case has to do with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I brought evidence to show what was on the file, in which I was going to show that leading counsel for the Government at that time had gone to the Tribunal and put in as evidence against the prisoner the statements he made in the course of his interrogation, and, merely in order to show up the Deputy and the dishonesty of his attack on me the other night&mdash;which, like all his other attacks, was made without considering the facts or seeing whether they rested upon a sure basis &mdash;I mentioned the fact that his name was on this file as giving a certificate. That does not matter one straw to my charge against the Deputy, but it does show the Deputy up to the House, I think.  It does show the value of such attacks by the Deputy when, not alone was he the Minister in charge of the Department of Justice but actually the Minister who gave the certificate in this particular case.  That is why I referred to it, and when the Deputy tries to play about with it and with the basis on which the certificate was given, he knows that that is not relevant to the charge I am making against him.  Now he asks me what was the result of the case.  I do not understand what he means.</P>

All <Col N="483" /> I can do, evidently, is to try to show the House the value of the criticism the Deputy makes.  Now the Deputy asks what is the result.  I said that the result does not matter, and it does not matter.  The result is no defence for me.  If I attempt to obtain convictions by fair or foul means, and do not succeed, that does not lessen my dishonour.  The result in this case, however, was a conviction.  I do not know whether the Deputy took a chance shot and hoped that he would be able to get away with it, thinking that I was afraid to come to the result. I did not refer to the result because, in my opinion, it does not matter to the charge levelled against me and to the charge that the Deputy must make against my predecessor in office and against Deputy Vincent Rice&mdash;against whom I make no charge and never made a charge.  The prisoner got six months' imprisonment.  Deputy Rice was a fair prosecutor in that case. Acting, I suppose, on the instructions of the Attorney-General, and with the approval of the Government, he offered the prisoner an alternative of entering into recognisances.  The President announced that Driscoll had been found guilty on all charges&mdash;guilty of every single one of them.  The President announced the verdict and asked the prisoner if he had anything to say. Here is what Driscoll said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I want to say, Sir, that I would be as prepared as anybody to give any sort of undertaking, but I find that it is impossible for me to live owing to the action of the C.I.D. down in Kerry.  It has been one mass of blackguardism for the past two or three years and any undertaking I would give, I could not possibly keep if they continued to adopt the attitude they have adopted towards me.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>At this point, Mr. Rice intervened and said that</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;never on any occasion had Driscoll made any complaint or alleged ill-treatment by the Guards.  Driscoll remarked that several complaints had been made to Chief Superintendent Kelleher at Tralee when he was ill-treated, <Col N="484" /> and it was due to the action of the superintendent that it was stopped.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The foregoing is from the <i>Irish Independent</i> report.</P>
    <P>If that is not an exposure of dishonest criticism, I do not know what can be.  There are other matters to which time might, perhaps, be more profitably devoted, and I do not wish to take up the time of the House by driving home the arguments which seem to me to spring clearly from the facts I have given to the House.  This debate has been made by the Deputy an indictment of me.  I am charged here with abusing my trust and behaving in the manner which I have described, and I think I am entitled to reply.  I will attempt, however, to glance at the other charges which he made, and say what I have to say in answer to them as rapidly as possible.  He passed on to make a charge not against me but against the Minister for Justice.  He went on to refer to what he said were brutalities charged against certain members of &ldquo;Colonel Broy's new recruits.&rdquo;  One of them was so indecent that he could not in any circumstances refer to it in the House.  Having made that statement alleging that those brutalities had been committed, and let that get across, he said he was not going to go into the matter because the Attorney-General was not responsible for the Guards, and, secondly, because legal proceedings had been taken.  I certainly cannot understand how a Deputy can put off all decency and sense of fair dealing when he comes into those benches.  He himself states that proceedings have actually been taken.  I am aware that proceedings have been taken, but I do not know the nature of the charges.  All that has been served on the Guards is a charge of assault.  I was aware that proceedings had been taken against certain members of the Gárda Síochána, and now I gather from what the Deputy has said that they must relate to what he has stated there.  I cannot reply on anything that I know about those charges.  All I have been told is that they are strenuously <Col N="485" /> denied.  Is it fair or is it proper that when they are about to have a suit brought against them alleging appalling brutalities&mdash;the Deputy would not soil his tongue by mentioning them in this House&mdash;&ldquo;Colonel Broy's new recruits&rdquo; should have a further stigma added to their name by the Deputy in this indecent manner?</P>
    <P>Then he went on to deal with charges about a fraudulent certificate.  He said that a fraudulent certificate had been issued by the Minister.  He made that charge two or three times in this House in connection with a case in Kerry, a case which I referred to last night, where the Deputy would not appear before the special tribunal.  He appeared in the High Court and endeavoured to have the proceedings at the tribunal stayed, and when the accused were brought forward again before the tribunal he did not appear there.  In the Cork case, as I already pointed out, he went down to Cork and spent six or seven days in endeavouring to obtain a verdict from the Cork jury.  In this case, he went to the High Court, and having failed in his application he brings his grievance here.  He has already brought this case out three or four times, and demanded an explanation.  He demanded an answer from the Minister for Justice as to his having given a fraudulent certificate.  He actually attacked the President about it.  I do not want to take up the time of the House by going into the details of this case.  Perhaps an opportunity will be given, if the matter is to be raised, to go into all the facts.  The facts briefly are these, that a man named Clifford was arrested and submitted to interrogation by the Guards in connection with shots which were fired at the house of a water bailiff named John Murphy.  The house of John Murphy had been fired into on Christmas morning, and this man was arrested and interrogated in connection with it.  He gave evasive answers in reply to some of the questions, and did not answer others which were put to him, but after a day he called the Guards and made what he himself describes as a free and voluntary statement.  In this statement he tells the story of the <Col N="486" /> attack upon Murphy's house.  First of all, Murphy is a water bailiff, whose appointment has been sanctioned by the Minister for Justice; he is an officer for the administration of the fishery law.  This man tells how he conspired with two other men to go to Murphy's house at night, and to bring him out.  Here is what he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...As a result of that conversation myself and the two men decided to give John Murphy a fright.  The plan we decided on was that we would put a light on the bank of the river at Bealaw Bridge. We expected the light would draw John Murphy to the scene, and we would then fire shots over his head. We decided on meeting at Bealaw Bridge on the night of the 23rd December, 1934, and do the job.  I told Martin Quirke and Jeremiah O'Sullivan that I had a shot-gun and two cartridges at my house at the time, and that I would use them on the job.  The shot-gun and cartridges are the property of Daniel Keas, Glencar.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he tells how he met those men again after 11 o'clock Mass on the 23rd December.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I asked then why they did not come to do the job on John Murphy last Friday night, and Martin Quirke told me he had to mind the river with the other water-bailiffs, and that he could not get away.  Martin Quirke is a water-bailiff.  Martin Quirke, Jeremiah O'Sullivan, and I then decided to carry out the job that night at about 12 midnight, and arranged to meet at a height on the road at the Beheshiel side of Bealaw Bridge.  About 12 midnight on 23/12/34 I slipped out of my own house.  I had the shot-gun and cartridges referred to with me.  I walked down to the height on the road near Bealaw Bridge.  I met there Jeremiah O'Sullivan, Dreenagh, and Michael Quirke of Drombreine, Lickeen.  They had no firearms.  I asked the two men why Martin Quirke did not come, and they told me he could not get away.  Michael Quirke, Jeremiah O'Sullivan, and I <Col N="487" /> then walked to the house of Michael Breen, Droumlahort, who is a water-bailiff also.  We went in to his window and Michael Quirke called him and said: &lsquo;There is a torch down on the river.&rsquo; We called there just to see if John Murphy was inside with Breen.  We walked from Breen's house along the road to John Murphy's house at Dreenavagh.  We went to Murphy's door and rapped on it.  Michael Quirke rapped and shouted: &lsquo;There is a torch on the river.&rsquo; Murphy did not answer. Michael Quirke and I then went out on the road opposite Murphy's house, and Jeremiah O'Sullivan went around to the back of the house.  I then put the shot-gun to my shoulder and fired two shots at Murphy's house.  I was standing about 60 yards away from the house when I fired.  I aimed the shots at the wall between the kitchen door and the kitchen window.  I only fired the two shots.  Quirke or Sullivan did not fire any shot.  We walked up above the house then and crossed a pathway together until we went about 100 yards from Murphy's house.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The gentleman who made that statement is the person in whose interest this charge is made in this House&mdash; that a fraudulent certificate was given on certain charges to bring him before the tribunal.  He was brought before the tribunal and was defended.  First of all, an attempt was made to prevent the tribunal from dealing with the case.  That attempt failed; he was brought before the tribunal, and defended by counsel.  An objection was made to that statement, but the tribunal overruled the objection.  The moment the statement was allowed in this man withdrew his plea of not guilty, and entered a plea of guilty, which was accepted.  He entered a plea of guilty to the charge of possession of firearms.  No certificate at all is necessary in connection with a charge of possession of firearms. There was a charge against him of conspiracy on which a certificate was essential, but he pleaded guilty to the <Col N="488" /> charge of possession of firearms.  It was perfectly open to the tribunal to try in that case without any certificate at all.  This man was a water bailiff, a man engaged in the administration of the law, and I fail to see how the Deputy can say that I am any Minister was stretching his conscience unduly in certifying that an attack upon a water bailiff at that hour was an attack upon the administration of justice.  Possibly the Deputy may feel that there is something to be said in favour of that argument.  But he got up here and charged the Minister and me with bringing charges based on a fraudulent certificate.  There is the case which the Deputy wanted to prevent going before the Military Tribunal.  This man, I should say, was a member of the Blueshirt organisation.  The Deputy strained every effort to prevent the man being tried before the Military Tribunal.  I make no complaint of his doing that.  It was his job and he was entitled to do his best. Am I to be blamed for bringing that man before the Military Tribunal&mdash;a man who pleads guilty to that charge and who admits that every word he said in his statement to the Gárda was true and correct.  But on three occasions this House has listened to excited denunciations of the Minister for Justice in the course of these debates for perpetrating the injustice of having this man tried and sent before the Military Tribunal.  Was there any miscarriage of justice about that?  Does the Deputy admit or deny that, or does he say that the man who admits a charge such as that, and who does not deny the statement he made was correct and pleads guilty, should not get his deserts?  Is it playing the game for the Deputy to come in here and abuse the privileges of this House by levelling charges against the Government based on cases such as that?</P>
    <P>I think I have said enough about Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney at the moment.  I will just deal with these exciting matters by endeavouring to answer some of the queries which have been put to me by other and more reasonable Deputies.  Deputy Morrissey raised the question of counsel in <Col N="489" /> these cases, but he did not make a violent onslaught on me.  He raised the question whether in a number of cases senior counsel had been engaged by me and he inquired about the fees they had been paid.  I presume the case he referred to was the only case in which senior counsel were engaged &mdash;that was the case in which the validity of the XVII Amendment to the Constitution which has given so much trouble here was challenged in the courts.  This was a case which raised issues of tremendous importance.  It raised issues as to the validity of certain amendments to the Constitution, which would have the effect, if the decision had been given on the main grounds on which the case was brought, of sweeping away other amendments as well as the XVII Amendment, and I felt, as I am sure anybody who happened to fill the position of Attorney-General for the time being would have felt, and must have felt, that it was my duty to exhaust every effort to have these amendments of the Constitution held valid.  They were made by this House.  They were not made when we were in office, though some others of them were. They were however enactments of the Oireachtas and even though they were objected to by us and though this particular XVII Amendment was not in any sense our child, I felt that it was my duty to defend it as best I could.</P>
    <P>In the particular way in which it arose there were three cases, I think, in which the same point was raised and the three of them went on together. They were counsel in the three cases. I did not know in which the Constitutional issue was to be fought and I grouped them in one.  The counsel were paid higher fees than usual.  I think the fees on the brief were 75 guineas.  There appears to be some suggestion made by Deputy Morrissey that this was done after we had succeeded in the Supreme Court.  I am in a position to deal with that.  The regulations under which my office works do not allow me to pay a fee of more than 25 guineas without a certificate from the Department of Finance. But before the case began, in view of <Col N="490" /> its importance and of the issues involved, I submitted to the Minister for Finance that in view of these issues special fees should be allowed to counsel, and the Department of Finance consented to the payment of 75 guineas on their briefs.  This was long before the cases started at all.  Whoever gave the Deputy the information was quite wrong in this matter.  It was quite wrong to say that it was because these cases went in favour of the State that these special fees were allowed to counsel.  Four counsel were employed on behalf of the Government and the fees they were paid were fees that had been taxed by the taxing master who allowed these fees. Anybody who has any experience of the courts will know that these fees were eminently reasonable.  Now as to the number of counsel, although there were four employed only two senior counsel were allowed by the Taxing Master and the defence were called upon to bear the fees of the two additional counsel.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not exactly say now what it was, but if the Deputy wishes information on it I will get it for him.  These proceedings were brought by the prisoners Ryan, Cantwell, and some other man.  They were not proceedings instituted by us. We were not responsible for the proceedings, but we felt that it was essential that they should be defended and defended with vigour.  If the Deputy looks at the current issue of the <i>Law Reports</i> he will see the judgements reported there and also see what may possibly surprise him.  If the Deputy thinks it strange that so many counsel were engaged by the State he will see that engaged on behalf of the prisoners were five senior counsel and two juniors.  I understand that he has some grievance because there happens to be four appearing for me of whom one <Col N="491" /> was a junior.  Deputy Morrissey asked me some other questions, and there were some points raised which I do not know that I should deal with at the moment.  They can be raised again if Deputy Morrissey thinks them of sufficient importance.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton raised another matter.  He made a protest against charging prisoners with refusing to answer questions.  The Deputy must realise that this particular article was designed to meet certain conditions.  I need not go into them in detail, but one of the particular difficulties which it was designed to deal with was the possibility of the whole countryside closing down and the impossibility of obtaining evidence against prisoners. For that reason, I presume the Government has embodied in the Act a section which makes it an offence to refuse to answer questions.  That is not a form of prosecution which I like to bring, but there it is and there are certain cases in which I have brought charges for refusing to answer questions put by the Gárda.  He says that I ought to elect not to bring a charge for refusing to answer questions.  That would have the result of probably making the particular section of the article, which is designed to obtain information from persons under the statutory threat contained in the Act, futile and ineffective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where prisoners are believed to have been connected with certain crimes, where they refuse to answer questions, and where the law, as it stands, which I am often challenged here with not administering sufficiently in accordance with its terms, creates an offence, unless there are circumstances which justify me in not proceeding, I feel it is my obligation and duty to proceed. If I feel that a prisoner, who has refused to answer questions, is doing it for some motive, and has not been connected with the incidents in respect of which he is being interrogated, in that case I feel justified in exercising discretion and not proceeding against him.  But if prisoners adopt the attitude that they will not answer questions, there is the law which is being <Col N="492" /> disobeyed and I cannot, except in exceptional cases, justly not proceeding against them.</P>

      <P>I am not going to be cross-examined further by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney.  I have always attempted, despite all that he has said against me, to administer the criminal law fairly, justly and with leniency.  There is nothing that I would prefer better than to put an end to the operation of this Article, and I think the President and everybody else has made it quite clear that it is quite distasteful to us to have to use the powers conferred by that Article.  They are extraordinary powers which the Chief Justice, in his judgement in the case I referred to, criticised very severely from the point of view of what were the accepted principles of the ordinary law.  The Chief Justice referred to this part of the Article and said it alters the ordinary law for the protection of the citizen in one <Col N="493" /> important respect.  He went on to deal with it, pointing out that it did depart from the ordinary law.</P>

      <P>As Deputy McMenamin raised this question, I thought I should deal with it as I understood he was anxious I should <Col N="494" /> deal with it.  I am not desirous of taking up any more time than is necessary to deal with the essential matters that have been raised.  I understand the Deputy is suggesting what Deputy McGilligan pointed out, that it seems to be recognised that this form of legislation is becoming a normal accepted part of the machinery of the law where certain steps might not be taken.  I am only concerned with the administration of the article as it stands.  It certainly has its defects, but it has now been in operation sufficiently long for everybody to understand its terms, its effects, and the powers given under it, and it is quite easy for persons who want to escape its ill-effects to avoid offences with which it is intended to deal.  It would be much more helpful if, instead of discussing the way in which we have to deal with these, the precise way in which a police officer should approach a prisoner, the method of interrogation, and the machinery to be adopted in the presentation of a case, if Deputies would try to induce some people, who are apparently determined on continuing to produce disturbed conditions in an organised way over wide areas in the country, to cease these operations and let us have done with these forms and types of prosecutions.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burke, in his speech, told a humorous story about the Maguires, which seemed to suggest that I had some particular edge upon Cork.  I am afraid that Cork has some particular edge upon the Government. Cork has certainly brought the heavy hand of the law upon itself, but does anybody who looks at the situation not agree that the Government went as far as they possibly could, and that I went as far as I possibly could, to induce the people there, and in other parts of the country where organised crime is being committed, to obey the law and adopt some other method of forwarding their interests than organised and determined interference with the machinery of government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the first large batch of prisoners dealt with before the Military Tribunal, a large number were Cork <Col N="495" /> men.  The tribunal dealt with them with extreme leniency and actually let them go on their undertaking to behave themselves in future.  We hoped, as a result of that, that there would be a cessation of the campaign of outrages which had gone on for some months before October.  That happy result seemed to have been achieved, and for a couple of months we had more or less peace.  But, in recent months, everybody knows that there had been a recrudescence of this trouble and that very serious outrages have been committed.</P>

On the 25th of May a number of young men from the Ballincollig area were arrested&mdash; Cornelius O'Connell, Patrick O'Connell, Jack Delaney, Joe O'Leary and Patrick O'Leary.  These men were arrested and detained in the Bridewell in Cork and they would not get permission to attend Mass on the following Sunday.  In the British days, under the old Protestant ascendancy, that permission would be granted; it remained for our own Government to refuse it.</P>

      <P>I want to ask some questions arising out of this Vote.  For instance, what is the explanation of the increased sum for the Zoological Society, the society having charge of the Zoological Gardens?  Is the Minister satisfied that that society is doing its work properly?  There have been general complaints to the effect that it is an ill-kept place and that it is anything but a credit to the city or the country.  It is not an asset to the Phoenix Park.  No one knows exactly what the purpose of the institution is, whether it is an aid to the study of zoology or whether it is meant to provide recreation for children.  I do not think the Vote should be passed without some explanation.  I think we ought to be told something about the attitude of the society and as to whether or not any check is kept on its activities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Alton</NameTxt>
      <P>I protest against the statement made by Deputy Moore, which, I think, was made in ignorance and uttered in malice.  The Zoological Society is one of the institutions in Dublin of which a person who knows anything about it would be very proud. It is kept going very largely by the self-sacrifice and contributions of individuals. The grant from the State is appreciated, but it ought to be largely increased.  A sweeping statement uttered in ignorance was made by Deputy Moore to the effect that it does not contribute to science.  That is entirely untrue.</P>

I do not want, however, to enter into the merits or demerits of the Zoological Society.  I assume, since Deputy Moore was moved to raise the matter, that he must be rather dissatisfied with the position as it exists.  I am quite sure he would not raise the matter out of malice. There must be a public-spirited motive behind it.  Deputy Moore is not a person accustomed to oppose vexatiously grants of that sort.

      <P>I think it is appropriate that a Government that acted in the way it has done for the past week, as regards the Estimates, should now be treating this great industry of agriculture in the way it is doing.  The only thing I pointed out is that the Government wanted to blot out discussion.  We wanted a full debate with the explanation of the Minister for Agriculture before us, so that we could criticise it.  We are given four and a half minutes, and two minutes is taken out of that by the irrelevant observations of the Minister for Finance.  No time was wasted by <Col N="505" /> us on the closure motion.  Everyone will admit that it was a most fruitful discussion, and ranged over the various items which the Minister tried to closure.  I do not think the Government have any reason to be satisfied with the course of that discussion. Having brought the principal industry in the country to a state of bankruptcy. I think it is fully in keeping with everything the Government have done, and fully in keeping with their whole policy of agriculture that they should try to burk full discussion of that subject in this House.  What is the situation?  We have the Minister for Industry and Commerce speaking of his tuppenny-ha'penny industries, and we have reference to the number of people employed in agriculture.  Although the Minister is very careful, in other directions, to criticise figures, what he has never done is to state the number of people in agriculture&mdash;farmers' sons&mdash;who have been always working on the farm, and who, now, owing to the various acts of the Government have got themselves registered.  There is no additional employment given.  No one has been more insistent than the Minister that these figures are most misleading. But he himself can quote them when it suits him and the Minister for Agriculture can follow his lead and can quote them when he wants to be still more misleading.  Therefore, the alleged increase in employment which is supposed to have taken place within the last 12 months indicates no real increase in employment.  We saw the tendency, when there was a possibility <Col N="506" /> of checking these figures, of a gradual decrease in the number of people employed in agriculture since the present Government took over.  Now there is the mere question of an increase in the number of people registered for other purposes altogether.  It is now 12 o'clock, and I am waiting to be called. I have no intention of disregarding the House or the Chair like the Minister.</P>
