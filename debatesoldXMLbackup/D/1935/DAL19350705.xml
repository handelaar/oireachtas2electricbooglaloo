      <P>It is proposed to take the business on the Order Paper commencing with item No. 7, Conditions of Employment Bill, to item No. 10, Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Bill, inclusive.  Public business will not be interrupted at 12 noon to take Private Deputies' business.  The Dáil will adjourn until Tuesday, the 9th inst., at 3 o'clock.  It is proposed that the Dáil sit later than 2.30 o'clock to-day, and that the Order for the Adjournment be taken not later than 12 o'clock midnight.</P>

      <P>The motion before the Dáil is to sit from 10.30 to-day until 12 o'clock to-night, and to dispose of the Conditions of Employment Bill, the Finance Bill, the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Bill and the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Bill.  No special reason is given for this motion.  One would expect that an explanation would be given as to the reasons for asking the House to discharge certain business.  There is not one of these items on the Agenda Paper which would be affected by one or two days' earlier or later consideration.  It is significant that for hours during the <Col N="1814" /> sitting of the Dáil in the past week one single Minister sat on those benches ever there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is treating the Dáil with scant courtesy and with disrespect. It shows very little consideration for the business before the House.  The Dáil has sat this week since Tuesday and for several weeks past it sat on Tuesdays.  It is certainly a great inconvenience for members who have long journeys to make through the country.  It is quite obvious that it is not meant seriously as a help to consider or discharge the business set down to-day.  Is it likely that after sitting from 3 o'clock each day until 10.30 at night, and in addition having this long sitting to-day, that that sober reflection and consideration which the business of the country demands will be given to it?  It is easy enough for the Government to put on one Minister at a time particularly when that Minister devotes none of his time in giving any consideration to any matters down on the Order Paper, and takes no part in the discussion.  No complaints could be made or can be made that any time has been wasted in considering any of the Bills that are before the Dáil. The Finance Bill which is at present before the House has at least 100 new items or 100 separate items on which a tax is to be imposed.  Surely the country is entitled to know what is the amount of the new impositions and whether they are in accordance with the tariff policy of the Government, or with the alleged tariff policy of the Government, or whether they are purely and simply new taxation.  Only in this morning's papers one can read of the extra charges that are being incurred by the Mental Hospital in Cork by reason of the new impositions on the necessaries of life.  Generally speaking this proceeding on the part of the Government this morning is characteristic of the entire policy of the Government to do everything in haste and to repent at leisure.  There was scarcely a single measure introduced by this Government within the last three years in <Col N="1815" /> connection with which they had not to bring in amendments and amending Bills within twelve months and even subsequent amending Bills to these.  The legislation or enactments of this House in the last three years are certainly no credit to it.  Each Bill is followed by an amending Bill, and very often by a subsequent amending Bill to amend the first amending Bill.  There is one measure which deals with farmers and with factory owners, and we have four separate measures which have been rendered necessary by either one or other of these Bills in order to see in what way they might evade the possibility of incurring any of the penalties that have been imposed.  To take another instance, we have one Bill on the Order Paper, introduced by the Minister for Finance in connection with investments, and though the Minister got two years and six months in which to make up his mind as to how he would set up an Investment Board, he wants, it appears now, a further extension of time to consider that matter.  The whole legislative proceedings since this Government came into office are a disgrace to modern Parliaments.  The action of the Government on these matters is characteristic of their whole mentality.</P>

      <P>The school-master is vexed, but he no longer has the leather&mdash;the leather with which he used to beat the people of this country and especially the political opponents of the Government.  That has to be given up, but he can still keep the pupils in.  Why are the Deputies of this House to be kept away from their business in the country, having sat here from 3 o'clock on Tuesday until this morning?  Because they had the temerity to examine what the Ministers are doing in their Finance Bill this year.  Because they had the temerity to take from under the magnificent wrapping of a Budget speech and the jokes of a Budget speech the actual facts of the budgetary proposals. Because they took the Finance Bill in the House and examined it <Col N="1816" /> clause by clause and item by item, and they dragged out, so as to make them clear even to Deputies themselves, the implications of it.  So much so that not only are the members of the Fianna Fáil Party on the Back Benches absolutely silent in face of the criticism brought against them and the revelations brought out in respect of the sections of this Finance Bill, but Ministers are completely silent too.  If they have any reply to make, it is the shout and the roar and the desk thumping of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  All the rest is silence.</P>
      <P>We are told the House does not matter.  The Minister for Finance can come in here and read his novel quietly on the Front Bench and try to stuff his ears to the facts that are being brought forward for the information of Deputies running an Irish Parliament.  Deputies are to be kept here this evening and prevented from going to their homes to look after some of the urgent agricultural business that requires to be done, because they want to discuss the situation that exists in the country and why, in continuing that situation, every household of this country shall be entered into and anyone who has to use coal, butter, bread, bacon, meat, who has to have wallpaper on the walls, linoleum on the floors, glass in the windows, or tea in the tea-caddy, must pay the Government a tax on them. We would like to hear Deputy Flinn&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. H. Flinn Mr. H. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Flinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and some of the glum members of the Fianna Fáil Party on some of these subjects.  If they have a case to make it might be possible to shorten the discussion on some of these things.  But the whole attitude we have been faced with here is silence on the part of the Minister for Finance, and misrepresentation on the part of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  You cannot get up to discuss a tariff which is being proposed in this Bill that he does not misrepresent the position with regard to the taxation already <Col N="1817" /> imposed; that he does not simply fob off anyone who wants to inquire into the position of employment in these industries.  The Parliament here has a responsibility and has business to carry out, and Deputies are going to see that it is done within the limits of their power.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance the other day, when he could not get the Chair simply to get a rubber stamp and to record &ldquo;absolute majority, two&rdquo; against each section, told the Chair he would have to consider whether he would stay any longer in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are other people considering what they will do with the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are going to do our business here.  It is nearly time that both the Ministers and members of the Fianna Fáil Party would ask themselves what is their business here. When they bring forward financial proposals for the year, it is at least up to them to contribute in some way their opinion of the general condition of things in the country, their opinion as to the amount of money being raised from the people; whether the people can afford, in the present circumstances, to bear that taxation; whether they can afford, in any circumstances, to bear the taxation that is being put on them.  Now, with as little explanation and the same silence as we had on the discussions in the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, they propose a motion that Deputies will be kept here until 12 o'clock to-night.  They do not tell us why.  They do not tell us the reason for it; they do not examine the length of the Parliamentary programme they want to get through and the time at which they consider the Dáil ought to rise for the Summer Recess.  Not a word at all.  They simply go through the formula of moving a motion and they just sit there and have it in the back of their minds that, if the Chair will not co-operate with them and destroy this institution by stamping their resolution &ldquo;absolute majority, two&rdquo; when a motion is moved, they can wear him down and they can wear the House down and reach the stage at which that absolute <Col N="1818" /> majority of two will be stamped on the resolution put before the House.</P>
      <P>Ministers talk very much of the type of dictatorship they will not stand for; of the type of dictatorship they will hunt down and trample under foot.  But was there ever a dictatorship that wanted to act in the way the Ministry have been wanting to act in the last few days?  By means of a rubber stamp they want to have it recorded: &ldquo;This is to certify that the Fianna Fáil Party have an absolute majority of two in Dáil Eireann.&rdquo;  Therefore, what is the use of talking; why not go home and pursue your business; why not devote all the efforts that you can to saving your home and your business and your family from the ruin that is coming on top of you; what do you mean by wasting your time coming up here when they can say &ldquo;absolute majority, two&rdquo;?  That is the attitude we have been faced with here from the very first moment the Minister for Finance had to come before the Dáil in May last and disclose the financial position of the country and the extremities to which he was prepared to go to remain in the position in which he could simply say: &ldquo;We have our absolute majority; we are going to carry on.&rdquo;  We would like to hear, even at this late hour, from the Ministry what work they propose to do before the Summer Recess, and we would like the President to tell the House what is the attitude of the Executive Council towards this Parliament.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I find this motion rather in keeping with everything that has happened during the past week.  I do not think there is anything strange in the Fianna Fáil Party, or the Government, bringing forward this motion.  From the way in which they express their opinions, the only way in which they do express them here&mdash;inarticulately, it is quite obvious that their whole conception of this Parliament is that it is not a place in which the proposals of the Government can be examined.  Every suggestion that the sole business of this Parliament was merely to register, without a tittle of examination, the proposals of the Government was <Col N="1819" /> received with a strong voice of approval from the Fianna Fáil Benches this morning.  There was nothing reactionary about it in their view. Even Deputy Flinn and Deputy Corry were not let loose.  They were kept in the &ldquo;jug&rdquo;&mdash;I think that is what it was called&mdash;or perhaps they were put into cold storage.  Even Deputy Corry, as I say, was not loose though he is let loose to-day for the purpose of interruption.  Not one single word was uttered in defence of any of the Government taxes by the Minister himself, or by the back benchers, during a whole week.  That is what they call the work of Parliament.  It is quite obvious from their attitude here to-day that their whole idea is that Parliament shall not be allowed to examine the very disastrous proposal in the way of taxation that the Government have put before the House.  Now they come in and ask the House to give them the luxury of sitting here the whole day but with a further refusal to examine any proposition that the Government has to make.</P>
      <P>The Party that deliberately tries to abolish the Second Chamber, now deliberately takes up the line that there is to be no discussion in this House.  When an effort is made to examine the Minister's proposals he gets into a &ldquo;pet&rdquo;&mdash;that is the only phrase which applies in the case of the Minister for Finance; and because the Chair refuses to become a blind instrument in his hands, and in the hands of the Fianna Fáil Party, the Minister threatens to leave the House, because the House wants to enter into an examination of the Government's proposals and to carry on discussion in a business-like way it is threatened that the whole Fianna Fáil Party and Ministers will leave.  That is the conception of Ministerial responsibility that we get from the particular Government now in office.  Why this delay?  Why this motion?  Was it not because the Government, not merely cannot conduct the affairs of this House &mdash;during discussions there were scarcely ever more than three Deputies on the benches opposite&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No.  The Deputy was kept out of the House. The Deputy might in his unwisdom make a defence of these taxes.  The delight of the Party opposite as Deputy Corry says is to pile on taxes. The Minister for Finance finding the Deputy's presence awkward saw that he was kept out of the House.  He was hardly ever here.  If he were here he might in his rashness have made unwise remarks.  We remember his unwise remark that he and his Party were ready to tax everything.  After that he was kept out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not denying that the Deputy was here.  There were several divisions, and the Deputy had to become part of the recording machinery to carry out the orders of the Minister for Finance.  The fact is we have an extraordinary lack of responsibility in a country that is still supposed to have parliamentary and democratic institutions.  We have the Minister for Finance refusing to take part in the discussion or to defend any of the taxes that we are now asked to facilitate him in imposing on the people.  They are moving this motion now not because they want discussion. Certainly not.  It is clear from the action of the Minister for Finance and the &ldquo;pet&rdquo; he got into, that his idea of an all-night sitting is to stifle discussion. We were threatened that unless <Col N="1821" /> we passed these proposals without discussion there would be an all-night sitting.  The reason we are now discussing a motion for an all-night sitting is that the Minister wanted previously to have Resolutions imposing heavy duties on the people passed without discussion.  Threats were held out to us and one of these was an all-night sitting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It is about time we heard that, but most of the taxes have been passed by now so that Deputy Corry and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance can be let loose.  Their whole idea of an all-night sitting is the hope that they will get the worst piece of work that they have done for this country for the last 12 months passed without discussion.  We have not the slightest objection to their motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary appears to have the same contempt for the Chair that the Minister for Finance has.  He has tried to raise, as a point of order, something that is not a point of order at all.  He has not shown the full measure of contempt that the Minister has shown in the last week.  We are supposed to facilitate the Minister for having shown contempt for the House and for the Chair.  The Minister for Finance will not break his vow of silence; he has got into a &ldquo;pet&rdquo; and has not got out of it yet, and so the Minister for Agriculture is to reply for him.  In fact, the Minister for Finance has two other Ministers by his side, the one will shout and the other will &ldquo;coo,&rdquo; and the Minister can still maintain his Carthusian silence which he has not broken except for the purpose of disorderly interruption.  The House ought not to facilitate the Government, seeing the <Col N="1822" /> way they have treated the House and the country for the last week.</P>

      <P>I was delighted to hear Deputy O'Sullivan talk on this motion, because he did know what he was talking about, which was rather an unusual thing for the Deputy.  The business that we want to get through is urgent.  It should be obvious to everybody, especially to Deputies on the other side of the House, who at one time conducted the business from this side.  The Finance Bill must be law by the 5th August.  If we are going to have the Committee Stage to-day and the remaining stages next week, there are only barely three weeks for the Seanad to consider it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The second Bill is the Conditions of Employment Bill, which everybody will agree ought to go through this Session, because everybody agrees with the principle of the Bill.  It is a Bill which will require at least a fortnight, and perhaps three weeks, between Committee and Report Stages, and if we do not get the Committee Stage this week, it means that the Dáil is going to run into August. I do not know whether the Deputies opposite have any objection to that, but I assume that they would prefer to get away as soon as possible.  The Cereals Bill must be law by 31st July, and, therefore, to show due respect to the other House, we must get it out of this House to-day, if possible.  The Widows and Orphans Pensions Bill is obviously urgent in that the people who are going to benefit by it should receive its benefits as soon as possible. Every single item on the Paper is important, and every single item must be <Col N="1823" /> got through this Session, with the exception of No. 19, which need not go through all stages, and there are other Bills to come.  We spent a good deal more time than usual on Finance measures this year.  We spent fourteen hours on the Second Stage of the Finance Bill, and I think it was more than twice as long as was ever spent before on any Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>We also spent longer on the Estimates which have gone through this year than we ever spent before.  I do not know if it is that our Estimates are different from those of other years, but I think it is due to the fact that we have an Opposition who take longer to put their few small ideas into words than ever the Opposition did before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They come in here searching for them, but they should have them before they come in at all. Surely we cannot be accused of stifling discussion by introducing this motion. Three Deputies from the other side spoke&mdash;Deputy Cosgrave, Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy O'Sullivan&mdash;and if a person came in here, not knowing what motion was being discussed, I am quite sure he would think there was a motion before the Dáil to closure discussion, or a motion for the guillotine.  All the talk was about closure, while, in reality, we are bringing in a motion to give them more time for discussion than is normally allowed.  In the normal way, we should adjourn at 2 o'clock to-day, but we are asking the Dáil to take plenty of time in order to give due consideration to these measures that are before the House.  We are <Col N="1824" /> accused of stifling discussion, and that gives an idea of the misrepresentation carried on by the Opposition.  Misrepresentation is scarcely a strong enough word, and only that there are certain rules of order here, I could use a stronger word.</P>
      <P>What is all the heat from the Opposition about?  We say to the Opposition: &ldquo;We do not altogether agree that you are discussing these things in an intelligent way; we think they could be discussed much more briefly and much more intelligently, but, taking the Opposition as it is, we are going to give you more time than would normally be given by any other Government for the discussion of these measures.&rdquo;  They resent it because, they say, we are trying to stifle discussion. I think that is not justified. Deputy Cosgrave says we are spending our time amending Bills.  I, myself, am bringing in three Bills this session to amend Cumann na nGaedheal Bills. That is what is taking up our time.</P>

      <P>The Cereals Bill amends one of my own, but there are the Diseases of Cattle Bill, the Fresh Meat Bill and a Fisheries Bill, to amend three Cumann na nGaedheal Bills.  They must be amended because otherwise the country could not carry on.  Deputy O'Sullivan talked about the lack of responsibility we are showing. The Deputy who speaks of having to go home to attend to his business and leave the Dáil is showing utter contempt for his responsibility.  His responsibility is to do national business and to do his own business afterwards. He must always keep national business first.  Surely no Deputy on the opposite side has any objection to doing his duty for the country, and, therefore, how can there be any division on this motion?</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister must have some alternative to compelling members to sit until 12 o'clock to-night?  He must also be aware that <Col N="1825" /> many Deputies do not reside in Dublin, and that Dublin is not all the Twenty-Six Counties.  There are other Deputies besides those who live in Dublin or adjacent to it, and responsible Ministers must know that many Deputies, such as myself, have certain week-end commitments.  We have to get home to distant places, and surely there is an alternative.  To show that I am prepared to accept the alternative, I ask why not sit five days next week?</P>

      <P>Surely to goodness, the Ministers knew that they had their Estimates to get through, together with the Budget.  That Budget was delayed for over a week, and that delay is responsible for the <i>impasse</i> we have got into now.  I would suggest that we sit five days next week.  I am prepared to vote for that, but I will not vote for sitting until 12 o'clock to-night.  I <Col N="1826" /> think it is most unfair for a small number of Deputies to dictate to the remainder of the House, and I feel confident that many of the Government back benchers are not in full sympathy with sitting later than 2 o'clock.</P>

    <P>SECTION 40.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Deputies whose names appear to it, I formally move amendment No. 123:</P>
      <P>To add at the end of sub-section (1) the following proviso:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Provided that if a joint representation is made to the Minister by a majority of the workers in any premises where an industrial undertaking is carried on and by the employer <Col N="1829" /> to the effect that owing to transport conditions affecting the said premises or to conditions of employment at specified periods of the year or to any other specified cause the granting of the said interval of one hour would operate to prevent the working of a nine-hour day in or about such premises the Minister may while such transport conditions continue or for the specified periods of the year or while such other specified cause operates permit the interval of one hour to be reduced accordingly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment deals with only one possibility which might arise under this one-hour period for meal time. In doing so, I suggest to the Minister that the meal interval which is fixed at one hour under sub-section (1) is not sufficiently flexible.  It is quite satisfactory for certain classes of workers.  I will mention certain classes of workers whom it would suit admirably.  The first is the worker who has regular employment in a factory or workshop adjacent to his home.  He is able to go home for his mid-day meal, and has the advantage of getting a meal cooked in his home surroundings.  An hour interval suits him admirably.  There is also the case of the workman who may have to go out from an establishment which is closed for an hour for dinner.  In both these cases the workmen are well pleased with an interval of an hour. I would also like to bring to the Minister's notice cases where this provision will not work.  Take, for the sake of argument, the case of a builder who is building a house.</P>
    <P>About the 14th December, when one can scarcely work a 44-hour week, the workman is invited to stop in a damp, cold house and spend an hour over his meal, which he probably gobbles up in 20 minutes.  He then finds that at 4.30 the light is gone.  I suggest to the Minister that he should alter this provision to not less than half an hour, and from half an hour to an hour by arrangement.  I realise that the workman should have a say in the matter as well, but I think it can be left to the common sense of both parties to work out a period that will suit.  There <Col N="1830" /> is nothing wrong with an hour for certain people.  Where there is no difficulty about it, I do not see any reason why that should not be taken as a standing arrangement, but it is quite obvious that there are other cases in which half an hour is almost too long. I should like the Minister to allow greater flexibility.  It is not that an hour is too long, in most cases, but, in my opinion, it should be left to the parties to agree as between half an hour and an hour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree generally with what the Deputy says.  It will not be possible to have an hour's interval fixed in relation to all types of employment, but I am not sure that it would not be better to deal with that situation by Section 22&mdash;by excluding certain forms of industrial work from the provisions of this sub-section&mdash;than by amendment to the Bill.  That could be done by Section 22.  Workers away from their homes on a building or construction job would probably not desire more than half an hour's interval in the middle of the day if they could not reach their homes.  That would involve the termination of their employment half an hour earlier in the evening.  I think that there is a good case for that, and I agree to consider it.  I should like the Deputy to understand that what I am proposing to consider is whether it is desirable to deal with the situation by amendment of this section or whether it is better to leave it to be dealt with by regulation under Section 22.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose, in any case, the Minister would have power to deal with the matter under Section 22.  If the Minister went around certain trades, he would find a fifty-fifty division as between an hour and a half-hour. I think it is obviously desirable that the Bill should follow the prevailing practice when it is not undesirable.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 124:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (3) to insert the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purpose of calculating the amount of time for which any employer is required by this Act to <Col N="1831" /> pay wages or salary to any worker at the overtime rate, the overtime interval shall be reckoned as overtime worked by such worker.</P>
    <P>I think a good case can be made for giving the worker a period of rest before the commencement of overtime, as suggested in the section.  But we have got to recognise that, in the main, overtime is worked for the convenience of the employer.  It is at his request the overtime is initiated, and it is at his request that the worker is subjected to the inconvenience of working overtime.  Seeing that the subsequent work will be in the interest of the employer, and that the request for the working of overtime will be initiated by him, I think the worker should not be required to lose that half-hour. That is only fair, seeing that the incidence of this overtime was initiated by the employer and that the request for the overtime emanated from the employer.  The object of this amendment is to secure that the worker, when given an interval of half an hour as a preliminary to working overtime at the request of the employer, should be paid for that half-hour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not accept the principle of the amendment at all but I agree that it might be unreasonable that a worker whom it is intended to work for half an hour overtime should be kept an hour away from his home in order that half an hour's overwork should be done.  I am proposing to amend sub-section (2) so as to provide that the half hour interval will not be obligatory unless one and a half hour's overtime is to be worked.  If it is only intended that the worker should work half an hour extra, then there will be no interval but if it is intended to work one and a half hour's extra, then the interval will be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>A period that would make the half hour bear some relationship to the period of time worked.  The Minister suggests that a person working one and a half hour's overtime should lose this half hour.  I think the proportion is altogether too high.  The minimum ought to be two and a half hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is intended to work the worker from the dinner interval to the normal hour, plus one and a half hours extra, there should be, before the one and a half hours, an interval during which the worker could get a meal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that the worker should have the meal in his own time, seeing that the request for the overtime worked is initiated by the employer.  I do not think that the worker should be obliged to bear this inconvenience for a short period of overtime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Deputy Norton is looking too much to the worker's pocket and too little to his stomach.  I entirely agree with the Minister that if the overtime is for a very short period&mdash;for necessary tidying up or something like that&mdash;it would be absurd that he should stand by for a meal hour.  I congratulate the Minister on that decision.  Taking Deputy Norton's idea, let us examine the case of a worker whose work would normally cease at 5.30.  He is called upon to work a quarter.  That means that it would be coming up to 8 o'clock before he would get an evening meal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>My proposal is that he should have relief of half an hour and that, since the request for the overtime emanated from the employer, the worker should be paid for that half hour's relief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but you have tacked on to that, that it is only in cases where he has worked two and a half hours that it is compulsory he <Col N="1833" /> should get half-an-hour's rest for a meal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that he has to be paid for the half-hour's rest would obviate the necessity to resort to overtime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister on the question of keeping a man stalled up for half-an-hour for a meal to do a few minutes' work.  But I should like Deputy Norton to look at the other side of the question.  Under the overtime provision an employer will be compelled to pay from 25 to 50 per cent. overtime rates.  If he had to pay a man for having his meal as well, the amount would run practically to 100 per cent. on the rate he has to pay.  While Deputy Norton says that this is for the benefit of the employers, I should like to point out that it is for the benefit of the concern, and that the worker is interested in that.  In a great many cases the overtime that has to be worked is co-ordinating work that is necessary because someone has fallen sick, or there has been a breakdown, or there has been some abnormal arrival or despatch of goods, which it is necessary to deal with, but which does not add to the profits of the undertaking.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 125:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (5) to insert the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every worker present in an industrial undertaking during the time that industrial work is carried on in such undertaking shall be deemed to be employed in such undertaking.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this Bill it will be an offence to employ workers outside certain periods, except in certain processes, on Sundays and public holidays.  Notwithstanding <Col N="1834" /> the provisions of the Bill, cases may arise where an endeavour will be made to secure a worker to work during prohibited hours or on prohibited days. If an inspector from the Department visits an industrial undertaking, and points out that a man is working, either in prohibited hours or on a prohibited day, the employer's defence may be: &ldquo;Oh, that man is only looking where he is going to work to-morrow&rdquo;; or &ldquo;He is only having a look at the machine,&rdquo; or &ldquo;He is really not working.&rdquo; In that way a loophole for considerable evasion may be left in the Bill.  This amendment seeks to assume that every worker present in an industrial undertaking during the time that industrial work is carried on &ldquo;shall be deemed to be employed in such undertaking.&rdquo;  If the Minister has this power it will enable him to deal with any possible evasion.  I do not think he will be able to deal with it as the section is drawn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>When I saw the amendment I was not quite clear as to its purpose.  In view of the explanation given by the Deputy, I may say that I agree with him.  I think power to deem that a worker who is present on the premises is there for the purpose of employment would facilitate considerably the administration of the Bill, and if the Deputy will leave the matter over, I will have an amendment considered for the next Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>&ldquo;and where any employer permits any worker, in accordance with the provisions of this section, to do for him on any day which is a Sunday or a public holiday any industrial work such employer shall be deemed to have agreed to pay such worker in respect of such industrial work at a rate calculated by increasing by not less than fifty per cent., the rate at which such worker would be entitled to be paid for doing such industrial work if it were done on an ordinary working day.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apparently, the only compensation for a worker who works on Sunday is that he is to get 24 hours consecutive hours of rest before the following Sunday.  The amendment seeks to ensure that if a worker is employed on Sunday, not only will he get a day's rest in respect of the Sunday, but that <Col N="1836" /> in recognition of the fact that Sunday is regarded as a normal rest day, and that work on that day is paid for in many industries at time and a half, and even at a higher rate, there should be special recognition of the claim for compensation for being obliged to work on Sunday.  Consequently, any worker who works on that day should have his earnings, whatever they may be, increased by not less than 50 per cent. of the rate which he would earn on the normal working day.  Another amendment sought to ensure in respect of public holidays that they would be brought to the same level as Sundays.  The section seeks to ensure a six-day week for workers.  If a worker works from Monday to Saturday, that is six days, and assuming that he has 10/- a day, he has £3 to get as wages at the end of the week. But if he happens to work from Saturday to Friday, which is also six days, that involves work on Sunday, but he is only paid the same rate of wages. The amendment seeks to ensure that he will be paid 50 per cent. extra for such work as he renders on Sundays; that is, 50 per cent. extra in respect of whatever the normal rate for Sunday would be, if it were a working day. Sunday work is already specially paid for in practically all industries and the State recognises in the case of its employees, the obligation to pay time and a half for Sundays.  There is a strong case for the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Deputy has made no case at all for it.  It is true that in certain industries work on Sunday is paid for at a higher rate than on an ordinary day, where that work is done by way of overtime, and where it is additional work done by the worker on Sunday, and added to the work he does ordinarily during the week.  Here, however, we are dealing with a section which prohibits the employment of workers in industrial work on a Sunday or public holiday except in certain industries&mdash;continuous process shift work, the printing of newspapers, and the work of a creamery.  In relation to these particular industries, the day of rest for a number of workers is not and cannot be Sunday.  These industries must continue <Col N="1837" /> on Sundays or Mondays or any other day in the week, and we are providing here that, instead of Sunday being the day of rest in their case, these workers must get another day in lieu of that.  If they had to work another 24 hours they would be entitled to be paid, but, in fact, they are getting the holiday in lieu of the Sunday in the week because, by the nature of their employment, Sunday cannot be a day of rest for them.  I cannot agree to accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Minister will admit that, in respect of three categories of work, it is permissible to work on Sundays, and thus, in these three categories of work, there is no restriction in the matter of employment on Sundays.  Consequently, employers in these industries will find that it is all the same if they employ a worker on Sunday or Monday or any other day in the week.  There is no extra payment demanded from them in respect of workers who work on the Sunday.</P>

      <P>As a rule, in the industry referred to here, it is the night duty men who take on the Sunday work, and those men are paid because of having to work on Sunday and are paid an extra rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but Deputy Anthony will admit that that has been the result of the efforts of the trade unions concerned.  Everybody understands what the existing trade union <Col N="1838" /> practice is.  I can tell of cases where double time is paid on Sunday.  My point is that there is no provision in this section by which the worker would be paid anything extra for Sunday.  It is true that, in the case of certain workers, their trade unions have been able to get them extra remuneration for such work, but this section is not getting it, and, consequently, so far as this section is concerned, there is to be no special payment in respect of work on Sunday.  I think it is agreed that work on Sundays is generally irksome and irritating, and that it is inconvenient for the worker since it is the day when all his friends are available for recreation and rejoicing, and since it is a day upon which he can make more use of his spare time because of the fact that it is generally observed as a day of abstention from work.  In this section, however, the Minister proposes to assume that an ordinary week-day is of the same value to the worker as a Sunday, and, consequently, the Minister tries to take the view that if a worker gets, say, Thursday off in compensation for Sunday, he is adequately remunerated for his work on Sunday, apart from the normal day's pay which he would get on that particular day.  I think there is a special case for additional compensation, over and above the normal wages, where the worker is employed on Sunday, and I do not think it is any compensation to the worker to say that he is adequately compensated if he gets a week-day off because of the fact that be worked on Sunday.  If the Minister were to take a ballot of the workers it would show that most of them would prefer to be off on Sunday rather than on any other day of the week, and I think that would be evidence to the Minister that they regarded Sunday as a more valuable day of recreation than a week-day.  In the circumstances, I think the Minister should look into the matter with a view to ensuring that, so far as this section is concerned, some provision should be made for compensation, over and above the normal day's pay, for work on Sunday.  I think that it would make it cheaper for the employer, as it were, to avoid Sunday work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's proposal is that we should do this by an Act of the Legislature and impose the obligation upon everybody involved in these three industries, without any information as to what the existing practice is, the circumstances that obtain, or the burdens that might be imposed on the industries.  I feel that any provisions of that kind should be brought into operation by agreement, and, under Section 42, such agreements could be made universally applicable in relation to the industries covered by them.  I think that is, by far, the preferable way of dealing with the question of rates of wages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that agreement could be reached on this matter between the representatives of the employers and the representatives of the workers and that the agreement could be subsequently registered under Section 42, but I think that is leaving it to the free play of the economic forces which bring about these agreements. <Col N="1840" /> I think there is an obligation on the Legislature to say, quite apart from the strength of the trade unions to enforce a claim on the employers or the employers' capacity to resist a claim, that some compensation should be paid in respect of work on Sunday. I would press the Minister to examine the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is suggesting a particular rate, but that might not suit in all cases.  For instance, I know of one firm in Dublin where they pay treble pay for work on a holiday. If we were to put in what the Deputy suggests, it would mean the worsening of the workers' conditions in that industry, and they would have to accept time and a half.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, and consequently I have done the reasonable thing and suggested not less than 50 per cent.  In some cases the workers are paid double rates, but I think the Minister will agree that whatever benefits of that nature the workers enjoy have been brought about by the action of the trade unions, and that these benefits are still available. I think, however, there should be some statutory provision for paying certain additional compensation where work is performed on a Sunday, and I would press on the Minister to fix some minimum extra remuneration in respect of work performed on a Sunday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>The Minister thinks he can regulate everything under Section 42.  He cannot.  The keeper of the register will be idle, redundant, and perhaps unemployed, unless the union officials or the employers come in and ask to have the agreement registered. That is the position, and if the Minister is hoping to deal with this matter under Section 42, he is only going to be able to deal with it by allowing employers on the one hand, and workers on the other hand to fight out their battles on the industrial field and, when the battle is over and some agreement arrived at between them, then they can come and ask to have the agreement registered.  I want to suggest to the Minister that the State should accept the obligation to provide some minimum rates of compensation for work on Sundays, and ought not to leave the matter entirely to the free play of economic forces in the industrial field.  I still think there is a good case for fixing some minimum compensation for work on Sundays.  Fifty per cent. may be too low; I think it is too low.  I think it is inadequate compensation for a person required to work on Sunday. If he is paid 10/- a day I do not think it is adequate compensation to give him an extra five shillings for working on Sunday, but 50 per cent. is suggested as a minimum.  There are cases where a worker is paid double time for Sundays, and the Minister has admitted that he knows cases where treble time was paid.  What difficulty can he have, therefore, in imposing a minimum obligation to pay 50 per cent. compensation for work performed on Sunday? <Col N="1842" /> Having regard to what obtains at present, 50 per cent. is a very reasonable minimum figure.  I would ask the Minister to look into the matter, because I think it is desirable that some minimum should be fixed.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton asks me to look into the matter, and I want to examine any suggestion made, but I feel we are coming up against something which we have really discussed on another amendment&mdash;the question whether, as a general principle, rates of wages in organised industry should be fixed by agreement or by State regulation. I am all in favour of fixing them by agreement, leaving State regulation out of it altogether, except where the circumstances of the industry are such that the Trade Board Acts can be applied.</P>

      <P>If Sunday work is done by way of overtime, or holiday work is done by way of overtime, then overtime rates are applicable, but my point in relation to those industries which are being exempted from the general prohibition of Sunday work is that Sunday is not a day of rest for a number of the workers who are engaged in them. But those workers, when they work on Sunday, are not exceeding the hours limit.  They are not working more than the maximum number of hours per week.  They are really, because of the circumstances of the industry, substituting another day of rest for the Sunday.</P>

What the Minister is doing <Col N="1844" /> in this case is abolishing the Sabbath day in respect of certain workers.  The Minister says that they must work on Sundays in certain of those industries, and the only compensation they will get for working on Sunday is a day off on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, or Saturday.  Does the Minister think it is compensation for a worker who is required to work nine hours on Sunday that he should get nine hours off on Monday or Friday?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>He gets 24 hours' rest; he does not get 24 hours off.  He gets the normal working day off&mdash;that is, nine hours; he gets 24 hours' rest.  The only compensation for working nine hours on Sunday is nine hours off on Monday or Friday, or any other day of the week.  In this section the Minister takes the view that that is adequate compensation for requiring a person to work on Sunday.  I do not think it is. I think it is most unreasonable that a person who works nine hours on Sunday should merely get a day off as compensation. I think there is a very strong case for paying a certain minimum addition to the normal rate of pay for work on a Sunday.  Merely granting a day in lieu is not dealing adequately with the inconvenience caused to the worker.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2), line 38, before the word &ldquo;any&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;or on a public holiday.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), line 39, before the word &ldquo;such&rdquo; where it first occurs to insert the words &ldquo;or on a public holiday.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This section starts off with the declaration that it shall not be lawful for any employer to permit any worker in his employment to do for him on any day which is a Sunday or a public holiday any industrial work other than the type of industrial work which is set out in three categories. In sub-section (2) of that section it is provided that if any employer employs any worker to do on the Sunday in any week any industrial work which such worker may be lawfully permitted to do on a Sunday, such employer, if such worker remains in his employment for such week, shall allow him 24 consecutive hours of rest before the next following Sunday.  In other words, the section declares in the opening that it is unlawful to employ a worker on a Sunday or public holiday to do industrial work except of the kind permitted in the section.  Then in sub-section (2) we find that if the worker does, in fact, work on a Sunday he is entitled to 24 hours' rest before the following Sunday.  But if he happens to work on a public holiday, then in respect of that public holiday he is not entitled to any rest. Seeing that the section opens with a declaration which is tantamount to saying that Sundays and public holidays are on an equal basis from the point of view of the desire of the State, as expressed in this Bill, to have workers excluded from working on those days, I think the same benefits to the worker in respect of 24 hours' rest should follow when he works on a holiday just as it follows when he works on a Sunday.  I thought that there was an omission in regard to public holidays in sub-section (2) or that there was a mistake of some sort, because I cannot understand on what ground the Minister could defend the exclusion of a public holiday from sub-section (2), in view of the declaration contained in the preceding sub-section.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the section is to ensure, apart from the prohibition of work in certain industries on Sundays and holidays, that every worker will get at least one period of 24 hours' rest in a week. That is provided for in the section. If a worker works on a Sunday then he must get 24 hours' rest to compensate him for the loss of the Sunday. The same consideration does not apply in respect to public holidays. The worker will get his 24 hours' rest in the week in which a public holiday occurs, but it is not proposed to secure that the worker in such a week will get two consecutive days. There shall be one period per week of 24 hours' rest.</P>

      <P>The Minister takes the viewpoint in sub-section (1) that a public holiday is virtually equivalent to Sunday for the purpose of his prohibition of work on that public holiday, and then he proceeds to say (2) that if the worker works on a Sunday he will get 24 hours' rest before the next following Sunday in other words if the worker works on a Sunday he will get one day off for that day, but in respect of the public holiday the Minister is not prepared to give any compensation in respect of the worker having worked on that day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Take this position.  A person works from Monday to Saturday. Let us say, Wednesday is a public holiday and the worker is required to work on that particular day, and he gets in respect of that day his day's pay.  He will get under the section no other compensation in respect of that day.  I am taking it <Col N="1848" /> in any case that the Minister will find it very difficult to get the worker to work on a bank holiday.  If he works on a bank holiday he will have to get paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably the worker works on a bank holiday and the only compensation he gets is pay for that day just as if it were not a bank holiday at all.  My amendment seeks to ensure that he will also get a day of rest in respect of that apart from the day's pay.  I think there is a pretty strong case for that.  The Minister is going pretty close to the Russian method of abolishing the normal week as we understand it in this island.  But, notwithstanding what has been done in Russia, there is a good case to be made for the recreation given by a public holiday. No experiment made by any country in the world has convinced me that there should be any change in this matter or that any such change will be a benefit to the worker.  The worker should get his ordinary rest on Sundays and bank holidays.  The compensation that the Minister is giving is merely pay for the work done.</P>

      <P>Whatever they have got they have got by their own efforts. Instead of recognising that there should be some compensation for working on public holidays, and enshrining that principle in the Bill, the Minister proceeds to deal with the situation as if nobody ever got compensation, apart from his wages, for working on a public holiday or a Sunday.  If the worker is compelled to work on the first Monday in August, on Easter Monday or on <Col N="1849" /> Whit Monday, I think he has a strong claim to get something more than his ordinary day's pay for working on that day.  On a public holiday the worker would like to go out and enjoy the day with his family.  He would like to go to the seaside or to the mountains; to go visiting friends or to sports fixtures, football matches and things of that kind.  But by reason of the fact that he is compelled to work on the bank holiday, when all these amenities are available to him, he is denied the recreative benefits that he might have enjoyed.  This is denied him because he has to work on the bank holiday. The only benefit he gets is the ordinary day's pay.  I think the attitude of the Minister is a most unreasonable attitude to adopt in this case.  There is a very strong case for recognition of the claim for special compensation in respect of work done on a holiday.  In sub-section (1) the Minister has committed himself to the principle when he puts Sunday on the same plane as a public holiday in respect of work.  I ask the Minister seriously to consider this matter.  I now see that the Minister is standing for what I at first thought was an omission in sub-section (2).  He seems to have made up his mind that the worker who is working on a bank holiday is not to be specially compensated.  I think that is regrettable.</P>

      <P>What Deputy Norton seeks to do in this amendment is to ensure that where there is a public holiday the person who works on that holiday will have 24 hours' consecutive rest in that week in respect of that day.  The Minister's intention is to ensure that the man will not work more than six days in the week.  That is the sum and substance of the section and it is good as far as it goes.  The amendment has no meaning other than that where a public holiday occurs the man will get 24 hours off in respect of that holiday.  It does not say whether he will be paid for it.  All the Minister ensures is that the man will not work seven consecutive days. Deputy Norton says in respect of a public holiday that the same rule would apply.  Neither the Minister nor Deputy Norton in his amendment provides for payment for the man.</P>

      <P>We have not come to that amendment yet.  What is the purpose of public holidays?  Apparently, they are for the purpose of giving the workers the enjoyment of a day's recreation.  So far as the case is concerned, if there be a case at all for a public holiday, there is a case for giving it to persons employed in factories and people of that sort.  That is as far as this particular amendment goes and the Minister ought to consider that.</P>

      <P>What we are providing for here are the minimum requirements. We cannot do more than that.  We cannot do more than that taking into account the circumstances of the different industries, and the various reasons that may apply in different cases.  It may be that in some places the workers are not paid extra for public holidays but in the majority of <Col N="1851" /> cases they are.  The minimum requirement we are providing for here is one day's rest in the week.  If any individual agreement between employers and their workers provide for more than that there is nothing here to prevent their getting it.  What we are doing is we are fixing it as a statutory obligation. That statutory obligation provides for a six-day week.</P>

I asked for 50 per cent. extra in respect of Sunday.  The only employer who could be affected by that is the employer who was paying less than 50 per cent. extra for Sunday work.  Where the employer is paying 100 per cent., 200 per cent. or 300 per cent. as the Minister spoke of there can be no penal effect by this amendment. I suggested, therefore, that the minimum, which would be only a 50 per cent. increase on the normal rate, be given, and the Minister would not accept that though it meant no additional burden on those who were paying more.  The only persons who would be affected would be those who were paying less at the moment.</P>

      <P>It does.  This section permits him to work on a bank holiday and, presumably, to get wages for the service he renders on that bank holiday.  But this section gives him no other compensation.  It is true that his trade union has, in many cases, got him compensation, but this section is doing nothing for the recognition of that principle, nor is it doing anything to safeguard the position of those who have got extra compensation. It is described as a Bill to make further and better provision for regulating and controlling conditions of employment, and it does nothing to safeguard what has been won for the workers in that respect.  It does not even enshrine the principle, and it does nothing whatever to deal with the employer who, contrary to what the general position is in the industry, is paying nothing in respect of work <Col N="1853" /> on a bank holiday.  I cannot understand the mentality of the Minister on this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister says that generally in industry some extra compensation is paid, he need anticipate no difficulty in coming to an agreement with employers and unions on the matter.  The only person with whom there will be difficulty if this amendment is accepted will be the person paying no compensation whatever to a worker on a public holiday or Sunday, apart from the normal day's pay for work on these days.  I do not think the acceptance of the amendment will in any way militate against the chances of getting general agreement under Section 42.  Nevertheless, we ought to establish some minimum standard, and that is what the amendment seeks to do.  I think it is most unreasonable that the Minister should in one section provide that workers shall be prohibited from working on a bank holiday, and that in such cases as it is necessary to employ them on a bank holiday, he should treat that bank holiday just the same as an ordinary day and give no additional compensation to the worker.  Although the whole principle of the Bill is to pick out the bank holiday and recognise it as a day of much more importance from the point of view of industrial leisure than any other day in the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 131 (a):&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (3) to insert the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every worker employed by any employer to do industrial work and who under the provisions of this section is not permitted to do for  employer any industrial work <Col N="1854" /> on a day which is a public holiday shall be paid by his employer in respect of such public holiday at the following rate, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  in the case of a worker whose ordinary remuneration is calculated by reference to time, at such rate per day as shall be the average earnings of such worker for the last six working days immediately preceding such public holiday, and</P>
    <P>(b)  in the case of a worker whose ordinary rate of remuneration is piece-work wages, at such rate per day as shall be the average earnings of such worker for each working day of the last five weeks immediately preceding such public holiday or, if he has not then been in the employment of such employer for five weeks, shall be the average earnings of such worker for each working day of such period as he has been in such employment.</P>
    <P>This Bill, in my view, is extremely ambiguous as to the position of a worker who does not work on a public holiday.  One would imagine from the Second Reading speech of the Minister and the declarations made outside the House by the Minister that worker who do not work on public holidays were, nevertheless, to be paid in respect of the limited number of public holidays defined in the Bill, but I can see no ground in this Bill for assuming that a worker will in fact be paid for a public holiday.  If there is any clarity about the Bill in respect of workers who do not work on a public holiday, I think the clarity is that a worker will not be paid if he does not work on a public holiday.  In this Bill we are defining what are public holidays and, presumably, we are defining them for the purpose of saying that certain provisions will govern employment on those days, or certain provisions will be made so as to prevent, as far as possible, the employment of workers on those days.  A provision of that kind is a recognition of the fact that we rightly regard public holidays as days of normal recreation.  Yet, in <Col N="1855" /> the Bill, while we regard these as days of normal recreation, as special festivals to be set apart as days upon which there shall be a suspension from industrial work except in a certain limited number of categories, we fail to provide that the workers who are so exempt from work on those days will be paid wages in respect of their abstention from work, in accordance with the authority of the legislature, on these particular days.  In other words, so far as this Bill is concerned, if workers are to have holidays&mdash;St. Patrick's Day, Easter Monday, Whit Monday, first Monday in August, Christmas Day and St. Stephen's Day&mdash;they are to have these holidays at their own expense.  I think that is contrary to the underlying theory of the Bill in defining holidays for some express purpose. This amendment seeks to ensure that when some workers are not permitted to work on public holidays, they will be paid for the public holidays, in the case of weekly workers in the manner calculated in paragraph (a) of the amendment, and in the case of pieceworkers in the manner calculated under paragraph (b).  I think it is only reasonable that when the legislature has provided six public holidays, namely, those specified in the Bill, the legislature should see to it that workers who, in accordance with the provisions of the Bill, are prevented from working on these public holidays, should be paid in respect of the public holidays on which they are prevented from working.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill does not provide a statutory obligation for any worker in respect of public holidays. I see considerable difficulty in forcing any such obligation.  Perhaps the Deputy, on examination of the question, will realise that, to make such provision would also create a situation in which the employer who desires to do so, might be facilitated in evading the week's holidays; that is the holidays agreed periodically throughout the year.  We fear the possibility may arise that certain employers would evade the obligation of giving a week's <Col N="1856" /> holidays to workers by periodically dismissing them and re-employing them so that continuity of service would be invaded.  But, in order to prevent that, we adopted a device by which the employer was obliged to pay a day's pay for each two months the employee was in his employment.  Suppose we place upon him the obligation that he has to pay, also, for public holidays, it is not impossible that on the day preceding the public holiday the employer, will formally dismiss his worker, pay the day's pay provided for in the general holiday section, and by doing so evade the obligation to pay for the holidays referred to here.  The employer would lose nothing by doing that.  If he keeps the worker in his employment he will be obliged to pay for the public holiday, but if he dismisses him he will pay the same amount, but he will succeed in evading his week's holidays obligation.  Has it not occurred to the Deputy that certain public holidays are, at the present time, recognised under existing law, but there is no obligation for payment, nor do I think it is the general practice to pay for public holidays.  If we impose this new obligation to pay now, I do not see how we can get over the difficulty to which I have referred.  I do not know whether the Deputy would like to give thought to that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I sought to prevent that difficulty by eliminating the word &ldquo;consecutive&rdquo; in the section dealing with holidays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There must be consecutive employment.  We will have to provide for accidental gaps in the continuity of the employment, and make allowances for breakdowns of plant and such temporary stoppages, but suppose we got a definition of temporary employment, the difficulty still exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the section, in which holidays are provided for, workers have the right to one day for every two consecutive months' service. I sought to have the word &ldquo;consecutive&rdquo; deleted so as to ensure that a person who had two months' service with an employer could claim one day's holidays.  In support of that, I pointed <Col N="1857" /> out to the Minister that, under the section as drawn, it was possible for an employer to employ a worker for one month and three and seven-eighth weeks of another, then terminate his service and pay for no holidays.  I think that would have been the effective way.  I moved that amendment as an effective way of dealing with a problem of that kind.  It might work out, in an extreme case, that a person taken on for one day might have to get a day's holiday the next day, but I think a medium practice could be devised to prevent that anomaly.  It is only by putting some obligation on the employer to grant holidays for some substantial period less than two months, and to put penalties on him so as to obviate any advantage to him of dismissing workers to avoid holidays, that you could operate under the Bill the part designed to give holidays to workers carried to any period of time.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister will have to go back to that section dealing with holidays, and put a heavy obligation on the employer, making it necessary for him to grant these holidays in respect of shorter periods of service, not in the hope that holidays will be granted for shorter periods, but to avoid the dangers that may arise where the employer wants to interrupt two months' consecutive service by a break of one day.  If the Minister does that he may get over a substantial portion of the difficulty.</P>
      <P>The other portion is a very practical one, namely, what restriction can be imposed upon an employer so as to ensure that he will not dismiss workers in advance of a bank holiday.  I think there is a certain type of employer who would resort to that subterfuge in order to escape his responsibility to the employee.  But there are many who would not stoop to that level.  In the Bill there is no obligation put on workers who do not work on bank holidays.  I suggest to the Minister, even though there may be imperfections in the Bill that to ensure that that work will be paid for that lawful authority in the matter should be enacted by accepting this amendment.</P>

      <Col N="1858" /> It will be difficult to regulate bank holidays in respect to each particular worker, and it will be an adjunct to trade union action to keep time with this position.  If there was general recognition by any class of employers over a wide number of industries, that bank holidays should be paid for, I think ultimately you would reach a stage when the employer who desired to evade his liability in that respect might, in the course of time, reach a sufficiently higher standard of public conduct as to realise that he should fall into line with other and better classes of employers in the same industry.  It may be possible, and even desirable, to insert some provision by which, where an employee is dismissed before a bank holiday, and if he has rendered a certain minimum period of service, he will have to be paid in respect of that bank holiday.  Even if that latter provision is not made, I think substantial compliance with the amendment could be ensured, even under existing circumstances. But an addition of that kind would, I think, help to ensure compliance with the section, as amended, over a very substantial number of industries affected by this Bill.  At all events, it is obviously unfair to the worker to say:&ldquo;You cannot work on bank holidays and, because you cannot, we will make sure that you do not get paid.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am afraid I could not accept the Deputy's contention that it is wise to make this provision in the belief that a number of employers in any event will conform to it, even though others can evade it.  That is precisely what will not happen, and it is precisely to prevent such a situation in relation to any condition of employment arising that the Bill is designed, namely, to ensure that the standards and practices of the good employers will be made legally enforceable against all.</P>

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 42.</P>
      <P>(1)  As soon as may be after the commencement of this Act the Minister shall establish and thereafter maintain a register (in this section referred to as the register) in such form as he shall think proper to be styled and known as the Wages Agreements Register.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1861" /> (a)  that the employer signatories to such agreement are substantially representative of the employers concerned in such form of industrial work in the area to which such agreement relates, and</P>
    <P>(b)  that the worker signatories to such agreement are substantially representative of the workers or of a particular class of workers concerned in such form of industrial work in the area to which such agreement relates, and</P>
    <P>(c)  that such agreement, if made after the commencement of this Act, contains provisions regulating the duration or providing for the termination of such agreement and that such provisions are so framed as to secure that such agreement will be operative for at least one year from the date thereof, and</P>
    <P>(d)  that such agreement is in all respects suitable for registration in the register,</P>
    <P>the Minister shall register such agreement in the register.</P>
    <P>(4)  Every agreement registered in the register shall, on and after the date on which it is so registered and for so long thereafter as it continues to be binding on the parties thereto, be also binding on every employer concerned in the form of industrial work in the area to which such agreement relates and on every worker or, where such agreement relates only to a class of workers, every worker in such class employed in the said form of industrial work in the said area, and shall regulate, restrict, or otherwise control in accordance with the terms thereof the rate of salary, wages, or other reward payable by any such employer to any such worker and shall be enforceable by any such employer or any such worker in any court accordingly notwithstanding any contract or agreement between such employer and such worker to the contrary or inconsistent therewith.</P>
    <P>(5)  Whenever an agreement is presented to the Minister for registration under this section the party or <Col N="1862" /> parties so presenting such agreement shall furnish to the Minister a copy thereof to be retained by him and shall furnish to the Minister all such information (if any) as he may require concerning such agreement and if such party or parties fail to furnish such copy and information the Minister may, on the ground of such failure, refuse the registration of such agreement.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 132:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In sub-section (2), line 56, before <Col N="1863" /> the word &ldquo;body&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;trade-union.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In putting down this amendment, I was hoping that the Minister might see his way to accept it.  This is the section of the Bill about which most discussion has taken place &mdash; a good deal of it of a very acrimonious character, by the way.  In both trade union circles and outside trade union circles and, particularly outside, a lot of acrimonious discussion has taken place.  We are getting advice from all and sundry, and particularly from people who describe themselves as the left-wingers, in relation to this section and as to how it will be interpreted by the Minister when it becomes law. Sub-section (2) of Section 42 says that:</P>
    <P>... a body or bodies (in this section referred to as the worker signatories) purporting or claiming to be substantially representative of the workers....</P>
    <P>I propose to insert the words &ldquo;trade union,&rdquo; and because of inserting those words, I had to define that in Section 2.  It was consequential, of course.  It is generally understood that the Irish Trade Union Congress does not represent all the organised workers in the country.  A number of very old established trade unions are outside the Irish Trade Union Congress.  Many of them are outside because they cannot afford to be affiliated, and many others because they do not believe in linking up with the Irish Trade Union Congress.  Hence, I suggest, in my definition amendment earlier, the words &ldquo;an organisation of workers recognised by that body as a genuine trade union body.&rdquo;  Notwithstanding the fact, as I have said, that a number of bodies are not affiliated, they are recognised by the Irish Trade Union Congress as genuine trade unions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>No matter how the Executive of the Irish Trade Union Congress may be constituted at any time, I have sufficient confidence in that body to believe that they would not rule out any genuine trade union organisation.  It is also well known to Deputies, and especially to any of those who take an interest in the trade union movement, that there are a number of bodies calling themselves trade unions which have simply broken away from their parent unions and which, because of some industrial disturbance, get themselves registered as a trade union.  They break away, for some obscure reason, in many cases, and establish an organisation of their own.  That occurred in this country during a very troubled period when it was only necessary to put the word &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; before the name of the body and it became popular and got thousands of members.  It is to obviate that kind of thing that I put down the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be two parties to the bargain&mdash;the Irish Trade Union Congress and the representatives of the employers. I cannot see any objection to this amendment.  I tried to anticipate a whole lot of objections.  I am aware that Deputy Norton has a longer and more comprehensive amendment on the Order Paper to this section, and if Deputy Norton satisfies me that it is a better way of arriving at an amicable understanding between the various unions and the employers' groups, I should be quite satisfied to withdraw my amendment in favour of his.  I agree at the same time that the Irish Trades Union Congress, because of its being so long established in this country, would be the most appropriate body to speak on behalf of the workers' <Col N="1865" /> organisations.  Hence I move the amendment standing in my name.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not accept the amendment which would create the position that we could only accept as representative of the workers a trades union affiliated to, or recognised by, the Trades Union Congress.  Officially I have no knowledge of the rules of the Trades Union Congress.  I have no means of ensuring that it will always abide by its rules.  I have no means of preventing the Trades Union Congress refussing to recognise a body that may be genuinely representative of the workers concerned in any industry or opposing its request to have an agreement negatived.  I have no means of preventing the creation of a second body calling itself the Trades Union Congress.  You might have half a dozen bodies calling themselves the Trades Union Congress if there was any difference of opinion on any matter in the trades union movement.  Deputy Anthony's amendment and Deputy Norton's subsequent amendment to set up certain machinery arise out of the suspicion in the minds of certain people that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, either now or in the future, might accept as representative of the workers in any particular industry a separate body, organisation or group of persons, who were not really representative of these workers and that, by his doing so, there might be an agreement registered which would not be in accordance with general trades union interests or contrary to the interests of trades union members. I do not think there can be the slightest ground for that fear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think myself, having regard to the fact that the Minister has no power of initiative under the section, that he is concerned only to register an agreement when it is presented to him, and then only if he is satisfied that the persons who signed the agreement are genuinely representative of the people on whose behalf the agreement has been made and if he is of opinion that the agreement is one which having regard to all the considerations should be registered, these fears will have no foundation in fact.  Having regard <Col N="1866" /> to the fact that the Minister has got to account for his actions in relation to these matters here in the Dáil and to the public generally, the prospect of any Minister putting himself in a position in which he would register an agreement on behalf of a body of workers, or a body of employers for that matter, who were not genuinely representative of the people concerned in the agreement, is very remote indeed.  There is, however, a slight danger that so long as that fear exists and so long as any body of trades unionists have any suspicion in their minds in relation to the section, the section may not become as operative as I should like to see it and I am prepared to consider an amendment to the section in certain respects.</P>
    <P>We can provide here that no agreement should be registered unless at the request of both parties.  At the present time an agreement can be registered at the request of either party and if we make a provision that the agreement can only be registered at the request of both parties, then there is an obligation, not merely on the Minister who deals with the registration, but also on the parties to the agreement, to satisfy themselves as to the representative nature of the parties dealing with it. I think that is not a 100 per cent. safeguard but it is a provision that I will be prepared to accept although from the purely trades union point of view it is not a desirable amendment.  I think circumstances may frequently arise in which a trades union may have an agreement made with a body of employers and would like to have that agreement registered even though the consent of the employers to the registration of that agreement may not have been obtained.  However, I am prepared, if I am pressed, to provide that the agreement can only be registered at the request of both parties.</P>
    <P>If there is still a suspicion that agreements may be registered by parties not properly representative of those for whom they purport to sign, I am prepared to go further.  I would give any party the right of appeal to the <Col N="1867" /> courts against the registration of the agreement on that one ground, namely, that the parties to the agreement were not properly representative of those for whom they purported to speak.  I think that would give an adequate safeguard on that ground.  That would put the Trades Union Congress in the position that if they saw an agreement being registered by a body of people whom they did not regard as properly representative of the workers concerned in the agreement, they could initiate legal proceedings to have that registration upset.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister propose to introduce an amendment embodying that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I am prepared to do it.  If I might deal with it at this stage, as I think it has something to do with the objections which were expressed to this section, I might refer also to a matter arising out of sub-section (4).  Sub-section (4) provides really that when an agreement is made it can be legally enforced by any worker against his employer, or by any employer against his worker.  People have been reading into that provision something which is not there, and which was never intended to be there, namely, that once an agreement is registered, it will become illegal for a trade union to take any action during the currency of that agreement, which would result in workers refusing to work.  The agreement, as Deputies are aware, is really only in relation to wages.  Yet people have read into that section the interpretation that, assuming that an agreement is made in relation to wages, and a dispute takes place between the employer and the worker in the industry concerned, over some other matter&mdash;over hours of work, recognition of a trade union, or something of that kind&mdash;it would, nevertheless, be illegal for the trades union to take action which would prevent the workers working in the industry so long as the recognised rate of wages is being <Col N="1868" /> paid.  That is not so, nor do I think it is of the slightest value to any employer to have the power to go to the court for an injunction to prevent a worker receiving a higher rate of wages than that which the employers have agreed to give.</P>
      <P>The desire to maintain that position under sub-section (4) is very largely due to the illusion that it gives some effective power which can be used to restrain workers from going on strike while the agreement is in operation. There is nothing in the Bill which requires a worker to work in any particular industry.  We could well have the position created in which, assuming an agreed rate of £4 was fixed for an industry, a worker employed in that particular industry would say: &ldquo;I am not prepared to work at that rate; I am going to offer my services in some other occupation.&rdquo;  You could not possibly have the situation in which that worker could be forced to work in the industry at the agreed rate of wages.  Therefore, I am prepared also to amend sub-section (4) in order to provide that it should operate merely in this way; that when an agreed rate of wages is registered, it shall be in the power of the worker by the procedure contemplated in the section, to require his employer to pay at least that agreed rate and leave it at that.</P>
      <P>Deputies will appreciate that it is not proposed to force an agreed rate by action through the Department. What is provided is that an agreed rate is fixed, and that any employer who pays less can be brought to court by the worker who can recover the amount by which he was underpaid as a simple contract debt.  With these two amendments to the section, the amendment making it possible for any party to upset the registration on the ground that the agreement was made by people who were not properly representative, and the alternative that I have indicated to sub-section (4) I think that most of the objections which I have heard from any quarter to Section 42 have been met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I had an amendment <Col N="1869" /> down to delete sub-sections (3) and (4), and in lieu thereof to insert a new sub-section which, I think, from the point of view of the workers and of every reasonable concept of the whole position, meets the problem with which this Bill endeavours to deal in a more reasonable, and, from the trades union point of view, less restrictive way.  The Minister has made reference to the provisions of sub-section (4) of Section 42.  I suggest that might be discussed because it may obviate the necessity of moving this rather lengthy amendment at this stage.  I think the Minister must be aware of the fact that there has been very considerable concern expressed by the trades union movement as to the terms of sub-section (4) of this section.  There has been, in my opinion, a quite legitimate suspicion that it was designed to curb the present legislative rights of trades unions in the matter of prosecuting industrial disputes: that the section was designed to hamper the rights of trades unions as those rights exist to-day.  That view-point has been largely generated by the terms of sub-section (4) which provides:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Every agreement registered in the register shall, on and after the date on which it is so registered and for so long thereafter as it continues to be binding on the parties thereto, be also binding on every employer concerned in the form of industrial work in the area to which such agreement relates and on every worker or, where such agreement relates only to a class of workers, every worker in such class employed in the said form of industrial work in the said area, and shall regulate, restrict, or otherwise control in accordance with the terms thereof the rate of salary, wages, or other reward payable by any such employer to any such worker&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>and here is the serious portion of the sub-section&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>and shall be enforceable by any such employer or any such worker in any court accordingly notwithstanding any contract or agreement between such employer and such <Col N="1870" /> worker to the contrary or inconsistent therewith.</P>
    <P>It would appear, from the drafting of this sub-section, that the agreement was to be registered in the Wages Agreements Register.  In making his case on the Second Reading of the Bill for the power conferred in this section, the Minister indicated that his objective was to bring up the employer who was paying low rates of wages or enforcing bad conditions of labour into line with the good employer who was paying a trade union rate of wages and observing trades union conditions of labour. With that view-point I am in complete agreement, because I think that the bad employer is not only a socially undesirable person but that he is a menace to every decent employer who wants to pay decent rates of wages and put into operation decent conditions of labour.  I think that nobody with a reasonable outlook on a matter of this kind will quarrel with the Minister's desire to require employers, in certain industries, to conform to a given standard, that being a standard regulated and fixed by good employers and trades unions and not by bad employers and unorganised workers.  But in his desire to ensure that the bad employer is required to conform to conditions which have been agreed to by good employers, the Minister seeks to make such portion of an agreement relating to wages which is entered into between good employers and trades unions enforceable upon all employers, and in his desire to try to secure unanimity in that manner, he also proposes that such a wage agreement shall be enforceable not merely on the employer but on the worker as well.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the object of enabling an employer to enforce an agreement of that kind on the worker, nor can I understand why it is necessary that provision should be made in this section for enforcing the agreement on the worker.  If, let us say, there was in the agreement a provision ensuring that the worker would be paid £3 a week, whereas he was formerly only paid £2 10/- per week, <Col N="1871" /> it is against all reality to suggest that it would be necessary to sue the worker to make him take £3 a week.  As drafted, this section appears to contemplate the possibility that it will be necessary to sue the worker in order to get him to accept the rate of wages provided in the agreement. In other words, that somebody fears that the worker will not desire to ask for, or receive, that rate of wages. Now I know that is a ludicrous contion. If that is not the intention, and if the worker could not be sued in that way, in what way could he be sued?  If it is not the intention to sue him for a breach of the agreement, which breach takes the form of accepting a lesser rate than that provided in the agreement, in what other way then is it intended to sue him under the section?  Is it intended to sue him to make him take the rate provided in the agreement if that rate is higher?  Is the section intended to ensure that where the rate of wages is paid to a worker under an agreement entered in the Wages Agreements Register that it shall be illegal for that worker to cease work for an employer so long as that employer is prepared to pay that rate of wages, and is the provision in the sub-section, as drawn, intended to get us to the stage where the worker is not free to decide where he can sell his labour or withhold his labour?  As drawn, this section seems to me to be open to the interpretation that an agreement is made between the representatives of the workers and the representatives of the employers.  Let us say that agreement provides for the payment of a rate of wages of £3 a week.  It is possible, I think, under the section as it is now drawn, for an employer to sue the worker and to require him to continue to work for such employer so long as the wages agreement was adhered to by the employer.  It seems to me that that is the only possible interpretation which can be placed on this section as drawn.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to say in what way it is contemplated that a worker could be sued under this <Col N="1872" /> section.  The suspicion in the trades union movement, and that suspicion has been fostered by the terms of sub-section (4), is that the desire expressed in the sub-section is to require that a worker will be compelled to work so long as the rates of wages provided in the agreement are paid.  Of course, any attempt to enforce a section of that kind against the workers would be productive of results which I do not think anybody desires to see enacted in this country.  There is the inalienable right of the worker to sell his labour at any price that he chooses.  His right to sell or withhold his labour is an undeniable right.  His right to work when he chooses and to abstain from work when he chooses is a right which is older than the State itself.  It is older than any civilised community and it would be intolerable to think that, while still professing belief in democratic methods, we contemplated putting any restriction on the right of the worker to sell his labour at any price he thinks fit.  I should like the Minister, therefore, to say in what circumstances it was contemplated that this section could be used against the worker and in what respect.  It was feared by the trade union movement that this section would restrict the right of workers to withdraw their labour.  It is probably true that, once the wages agreement was being adhered to, the workers would not desire to withdraw their labour but, while observing the wages portion of the agreement, an employer might break the hours portion.  He might unjustly dismiss a worker or in a variety of ways introduce changes in organisation or conditions which would operate to the detriment of the workers.  In such a case, there should not be any restriction on the right of the workers to withdraw their labour as a protest against these new and detrimental conditions.  It was feared that under sub-section (4) there was a barrier to the right of the workers to withdraw their labour and that even if labour were withdrawn in such circumstances&mdash;in fact, the right to withdraw labour cannot be restricted, though it may be restricted in law&mdash;it was feared that the provisions of this <Col N="1873" /> sub-section might be successfully pleaded in the courts against the use by workers of the rights which they enjoy under the Trades Disputes Act.</P>
    <P>Another portion of this section which has given grounds for suspicion is that which says that the agreement</P>
    <P>shall be enforceable by any such employer or any such worker in any court accordingly notwithstanding any contract or agreement between such employer and such worker to the contrary or inconsistent therewith.</P>
    <P>This gets us back to the Minister's earlier phrase about the bourgeois concept of the standard of wages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear from the end of this sub-section that if the workers in a particular industry had a rate of wages of £3 5s. 0d. per week, and if an agreement were made providing that workers in the industry generally should have £3 per week, it would be possible, so long as £3 5s. 0d. was not recognised as the rate for a particular class of workers, for the employer to sue in the courts, if necessary, in order to bring down the rate of wages from something above the standard, or minimum, rate provided in the agreement.  I think it should be made clear in any approach to a problem of that kind that the &ldquo;inconsistency&rdquo; and the &ldquo;contrary&rdquo; viewpoint referred to in the section should be regarded as used in the minimum sense and not in the maximum sense, and that where the Minister seeks to establish that an agreement is binding on the workers and employers, &ldquo;notwithstanding any contract or agreement... to the contrary or inconsistent therewith,&rdquo; it should not be capable of being used in such a way as to prevent a worker being legally entitled to any rate of wages which is higher than the rate fixed in the agreement.  The main purpose of my amendment to Section 42 is to make sure that those real dangers which I see and which the trade union movement sees in sub-section (4) will be removed and that such provision will be made for registration of agreements as will ensure that only bona fide groups of workers shall be so registered. The amendment which I have submitted is designed to provide for the setting up of a committee, representative of employers and workers, to consider any agreement which the Minister considers as one the registration of which should be considered. After examination of the merits of the agreement the committee might report to the Minister that, in their view, it was desirable to register the agreement. Any agreement so registered should be enforceable as a minimum for all employers in the same industry and they should be required to pay that rate.  In that way, the real object expressed by the Minister on Second Reading would be secured, and the <Col N="1875" /> real dangers in sub-section (4) would be avoided.  I think it is possible for the Minister, in conjunction with the trade union movement, to reach a substantial measure of agreement on this matter.  The trade union movement desires to secure a mass forward move, a regulated forward move and a disciplined forward move, and, generally speaking, it does not desire any indisciplined or sporadic industrial action.</P>
      <P>Certainly it does not desire any uncontrolled action.  I think the Minister desires to achieve a somewhat similar purpose.  Therefore, it is possible for the Minister while preserving existing rights to trade unions, which have long been enshrined in legislation, to reach a substantial measure of agreement with the trade unions.  I am quite willing to withdraw the amendment if, in the meantime, the Minister is willing to consult the Trades Union Congress so as to endeavour to secure agreement, either in the form set out in the amendment or in some other form, in a way in which the object behind this section can be given effect to.  There are obvious advantages in a reasonably drawn section of this character. Both employers and trade unions will see the same merits in a reasonably drawn section, and I suggest to the Minister that, concurrently with withdrawal of my amendment, he should arrange to consult the Trades Union Congress and endeavour to have this section an agreed section.  If the Minister approaches the matter from that standpoint, he will find that the Bill, by reason of co-operation in drafting, will be worked in a better spirit, and with greater harmony, and that the real intention of the Minister on his Second Reading speech will be more truly realised than merely by pushing through sub-section (4) which, if persisted in, will beget the bitterest hostility of the trade unions.</P>

      <P>While I agree with the principle behind Deputy Anthony's amendment, and with a great deal of what Deputy Norton said, we should not overlook the fact, when dealing <Col N="1876" /> with this Bill, that the majority of the workers are unorganised and do not come under the Trades Union Congress at all.  That is the trouble. Deputy Norton made one or two statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The majority of industrial workers being unorganised?  Is it a majority affected by this section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say a very large percentage.  I am afraid the Deputy is thinking of cities like Dublin, Cork or Waterford.  Great numbers of workers throughout the country are unorganised and do not submit to trade union conditions, unfortunately for themselves.  We must keep that in mind.  Whether the Deputy admits it or not, he will agree that existing trade unions, instead of going out to try to organise other workers, spend their time trying to poach from one another.  The Deputy said that workers had a right to sell their labour at any rate they choose.  Surely, that is not so.  No trade union ever admitted that. Otherwise, why are there strikes and strike pickets?  I want to assure Deputy Norton from my experience, while it may not have been so in the cities, the necessity is well-known of seeing that workers are compelled to live up to an agreement when it is registered.  The Deputy knows quite well that for many reasons workers are prepared to accept lower rates than those fixed by trade unions.  That is quite common all over the country. In recent years, the great trouble trade unions had, particularly in cities, was with the inflow of workers from the country who were prepared to accept work at rates lower than the trade union rates.  That trouble arose mainly from the fact that these workers were unorganised.  As the section stands at present there are certain dangers in it.  I would like to see all workers organised so that it would be essential, for the proper carrying out of the intentions of the Bill, that the Trades Union Congress or a similar body, should be, so to speak, the central body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another danger is that the Trades <Col N="1877" /> Union Executive has been for a number of years largely composed of trade union officials.  By that I mean officials of existing trade unions, and, if a genuine attempt was made by some person or persons&mdash;and I do not envy them the job&mdash;to organise the unorganised workers, it would not be looked upon with pleasure by officials who should be catering for these unorganised workers.  While I do not say it will happen, there is the possibility that efforts might be made to see that that attempt at organisation would not receive the sanction or the recognition of the Trades Union Congress.  That danger is there.  The principle is perfectly sound, and I am in favour of it, but I think we should not overlook the difficulties and certain dangers that are in it.  I do not think registration is to be condemned.  I agree with Deputy Norton that there is a necessity to make it watertight, so that as far as liberty goes workers will not be put into a position that was never intended.  There is a good deal to be said, from the point of view of the workers, that when there is agreement it should be registered, but workers should know about wages and conditions and if you like have a legal right to insist on getting these rights.  The position in some towns is notorious.  I was responsible for the establishment of a rate of, say, £2 per week in one town. I know towns in the south of Ireland where that was established by trade union action.  I am quite satisfied, from information I have now, that many of these workers to-day have only 30/- or 35/- a week.  There was never an open attempt made by employers to reduce wages, but it was intimated that where there were two or three men working, that they could not all be kept on owing to particular circumstances, loss of trade or depression, and that unless they agreed to a reduction of wages one of them would have to be dismissed or a wage reduction insisted upon.  I know men that have accepted that situation, particularly when the employer told them, and with a certain amount of truth, that there were plenty of men <Col N="1878" /> outside quite willing to work for a lower wage.  I am sure the Deputy knows that that is the position. These are some of the dangers I see on this question.  The principle is sound and, as far as that is concerned, I am in favour of the amendment, but I would like to see it so tightened up that, while the Trades Union Congress should be the body primarily responsible, it would not be used by officials, if others attempted to organise unorganised workers.</P>

      <P>May I correct what I think was an unconscious misrepresentation of my point of view by Deputy Morrissey.  He said that I stated that workers had a right to sell their labour at any price they liked.  In relation to the manner in which I used the remark I stand over it.  I was speaking of organised workers.  I was merely pointing out that in sub-section (4) it is sought to compel a worker to sell his labour at a fixed price, and that fixed price could be enforceable against him.  My point was that the worker should be free to say that his labour was worth a higher price, and that he should not be compelled, even under orders, to work for a lower rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the wording of sub-section (3) (c) I do not know what the practice is in all agreements but, certainly great numbers of these agreements are, more or less undated.  They contain, however, a provision for their termination by either party on giving so much notice. I should like to ask the Minister if that agreement would be in order under this section; in other words, I do not think it is at all necessary to have a one year period stuck in in every agreement.  I should like to have the Minister's viewpoint on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another question that I do not think the Minister made quite clear.  Presumably, he is considering&mdash; which I think, is probably all to the good&mdash;that he is going to get agreement by both the employers and the workers before he registers an agreement, <Col N="1879" /> because I am afraid that if you drag in one party unwillingly you will have a whole lot of trouble.  However, the Minister is looking into that aspect of it, but he speaks of when an agreement is reached, and presumably he is satisfied that that will not take away the right of the workers to go out or to disagree on everything except wages.  I suppose, if that is so for the workers, it would be so also for the employers, so that you could have a dispute over anything except wages and have either strikes or lock-outs. There is another question I should like to ask the Minister, and that is where an agreement is registered with him, and presumably, notice would be given by either party, as, on one side, for a rise, or on the other side for a decrease, in the rate of wages: would the Minister contemplate saying to either party: &ldquo;I refuse my sanction for the notice that you have handed in,&rdquo; and then would the dispute take place in defiance of his permission or would he merely give a voluntary permission more or less to meet the matter, to let the dispute commence, and having given his blessing to the dispute, so to speak, then leave it to be settled by the ordinary proceedings such as now operate?</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton spoke about having an advisory committee or something like that who would, more or less, overhaul the agreement handed in by either employers or workers.  I do not think that, personally, I would have very much faith in such a committee, because it would be extremely difficult to get anybody who really could technically go into the details of all the various agreements that might be sent in to them from all over the country, and, in that respect, the Minister might find that he had raised a monster that would give him a great deal of trouble.  Accordingly, I think the best plan would be to have direct intercourse with the employers and employees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Industry and Commerce will have nothing to do either with the making of the agreement or with the enforcement <Col N="1880" /> of the agreement when it is made.  It will merely establish and maintain the register, and when an agreement is presented for registration then, assuming that it is regarded as the type of agreement that should be registered, it will be registered; but once the agreement has been registered, the enforcement of it becomes a matter for the parties themselves through the procedure established under the section.  Obviously, we could not have agreements that would operate for less than a year.  There are many agreements which do not terminate at any particular date and that type of agreement is quite common.  In future, we would insist on some such class of agreement, such as that it should operate for a certain period but, in any event, for not less than one year from the date of registration.  I think that is a reasonable thing to require and that the parties to the agreement should indicate their intention to keep the agreement.</P>
      <P>Section 42 put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>(1) Where, in order to comply with this Act, the hours of work prevailing immediately before the commencement of this Act in regard to all persons or any particular persons or person employed in any particular form of industrial work are reduced or otherwise altered, the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) the said reduction or alteration of hours of work shall not terminate nor prejudicially affect the contract of service under which any such person is so employed immediately before the commencement of this Act, and every such contract shall continue in force after such commencement with such modifications only as may be necessary in order to comply with this Act and in particular the modification that notwithstanding the said reduction or alteration of hours of work, the rate of salary, wages, or other reward payable <Col N="1881" /> to such person under such contract shall remain unchanged.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1) (b), line 31, before the word &ldquo;with&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;in the same manner as if this Act had not been passed&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is put down with the object of taking from the sub-section the rigidity which it appears to have, as it is drawn.  It is provided under sub-section (1) (b) of Section 43 that in a desire to maintain the present rate of wages &ldquo;a reduction or alteration of hours of work shall not terminate the contract of service under which any such person is so employed immediately before the commencement of this Act, and every such contract shall continue in force after such commencement with such modifications only as may be necessary in order to comply with this Act and in particular the modification that notwithstanding the said reduction or alteration of hours of work the rate of salary, wages, or other reward payable to such person under such contract shall remain unchanged.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the object of this section is to preserve an existing agreement, voluntarily entered into, one can quite understand and appreciate it, but I fear that, as drawn, the section seems to conceive of the possibility that the contract may not be altered, and the contract is given a rigidity there which would even prevent it being altered in an upward direction.  Suppose a contract that has been made is in existence at the time of the passage of this Act, and that it provides for the payment of a rate of wages of 30/- a week, I want to ensure that nothing in this sub-section shall prevent that being altered, in the ordinary way in which contracts are altered, in an upward direction.  I want to make sure that there is nothing to prevent the rate of wages being raised above that level.  I have, therefore, moved to insert the words &ldquo;in the same manner as if this Act had not been passed.&rdquo;  The amendment may not be <Col N="1882" /> necessary, but I fear that there is a measure of rigidity about the sub-section as it stands.</P>

We cannot penalise the employer in a case where the worker makes a false statement as to what he has been doing earlier in the day.

      <P>While I agree with the principle of this amendment, and I think in a great many cases it is carried out, at the same time the employer may see the job terminated or a stop <Col N="1886" /> page of the works, in which case he could hardly be bound by this provision. The Minister has mentioned the case of a worker running around with petrol tins, but of course a whole lot of other reasons may arise.  While there are any number of cases of agreements for a week's notice, there is a very large number of employments where, theoretically, a man is only entitled to an hour's notice.  I do not suggest for a moment that that is very fair, or that it is a common practice, but certainly a very large number of exceptions would have to be brought in if amendment No. 156 were accepted.</P>

      <P>157.  To add at the end of the section the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Every employee in an industrial undertaking in charge of the firing or stoking of steam boilers shall possess a certificate of competency to be issued by the Department of Industry and Commerce and shall produce such certificate for examination when requested by an inspector so to do.&rdquo;&mdash;(Deputy P.S.

      <P>I should like to hear what the Minister has to say on this amendment.  The position is that in various industries, both in the city and in the country, there are quite a number of inexperienced people in charge of boilers.  I think if the Minister makes inquiries he will find that a number of accidents have occurred by reason of the fact that the persons who have charge of those boilers are not qualified.  There are other countries in <Col N="1887" /> which people are not permitted to take charge of a boiler except under certificate, notwithstanding the innovation of mechanical appliances on account of which it might be suggested that nobody at all is required to look after the boilers.  I would ask the Minister if it is possible to insert this amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wonder has the Minister considered whether he will make a statement on this proposal to put a tax of 5/- per cwt. on roofing slates.  We have repeatedly pointed out to the Minister that there are a large number of items here which are imposing a very considerable burden on house building, thereby increasing the cost of house building and increasing rents.  There was some sort of a suggestion last night that the development of slate quarrying in the country was going on satisfactorily and that therefore the amount of slates imported into the country fell last year considerably as compared with the year before, and fell the year before as compared with the previous year. That being so we want to know why this tax should now be put on?  It is a tax that will inevitably increase the cost of the home-produced slates as well as increase the price of the imported slate.</P>

      <P>If it is a revenue tax I think it is a great pity to mix up revenue producing items with a whole lot of duties or tariffs for which the home manufacturer may be blamed. For instance, there are types of slates imported into this country that are not produced in any slate quarry here.  I refer to ton slates and other special sizes and types.  I have already pointed out to the Minister that this is another item which is putting up the cost of building.  It is a customs item.  I think the collection of this money bulks very large in comparison with the revenue that is to be derived from the tax.  I would ask the Minister if he can see his way to do so, to do away with a number of these small taxes.  They are only producing confusion. One bad result may be that Irish manufacturers may be blamed or may get the credit for the imposition of these taxes and the consequent raising of prices.</P>

      <P>I am concerned only with the nature of the reply.  I do not care to whom the reply was made. The Minister has conveyed the information to the House that this is a revenue tax.  There is a complete change of attitude on this tax.  I am sure it is immaterial to the Minister but I want to tell him that the Minister and his Government have gone down in my estimation when I find them prostituting the machinery they have at their disposal to help Irish industry.  They are using that machinery to tax the people.  Along with being a revenue tax this is a hypocritical tax.  It is a tax that requires some investigation.  I dare say the Minister's knowledge of industrial possibilities in this country is limited.  I have it on an authority that I consider is one of the best in this country that from Nenagh to Killaloe and around that area, there are richer slate deposits than in Wales. The best English slate, &ldquo;Westmoreland Green,&rdquo; is surpassed by Irish slates in the opinion of this technical expert to whom I am referring.  I refer to slate which is found in large quantities down around Nenagh and Killaloe.  This expert also said that the quarrying there is scamped, for the real good slate is left at the bottom. I know from first-hand information that it is impossible to get Irish slate. No man who is venturing on speculative building can afford to take the risk, even if he had the wish to do so, of roofing his house with slate, because he might be held up in the midst of the work through not being able to get <Col N="1895" /> Irish slate.  I am speaking now with first-hand information.  When I look at this new tax I am beginning to wonder whether the Government have some method in the madness.  As in the case of coal, apparently the Government want to get in English slate on which they can collect a tax of £5 a ton.  Under the circumstances is it any wonder that the slate deposits in this country are not being worked? What is more, I venture to say that the most of the output is exported. Glasgow has booked orders in Killaloe months ahead.  Could any Dublin builder book an order for Killaloe slates?  Will it not pay the Minister to export these over to Glasgow?  If a person wants to import slates they will be let in, but the Minister for Finance will get £5 per ton on them.  So that slates are left in the bottom and doles and free beef are going around.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, in their generosity, are giving grants for the building of houses.  By the time this Bill is in full working order far more than the grants of £50 or £60 now given out of the Exchequer for each new house built will be more than paid back through the operation of this Bill.  Slates, copper tubing, sewer pipes, and surface drain pipes are taxed and there is 5/- on cement.  The little bit of profit that builders were making out of ground rents was capitalised and almost one-fourth of that has to be paid down.  When all those things are taken into account where is the margin of profit unless the price goes up?  Of course, there is the inevitable remedy that building will stop.  Not only that, but if a man buys a house the oil cloth that he puts on his floors is taxed.  The fresh air that he gets in that new house in the suburbs of Dublin is about all that is left untaxed by the Minister.  If the Minister is there next year he will have a good try to tax that.  Of course, indirectly he is taxing it, because he is compelling unsuitable pipes to be used for drainage.</P>

      <P>We will have a little discussion on Mayo slates.  I am sure the men of the West will not be easily driven out when we are discussing such a subject.  Unfortunately, these Mayo slates are small slates, but they are well able to compete with the imported small slates.  If the Minister had shown a little intelligence he could inadvertently help an Irish industry.  Just as in dealing with other matters he has used a unit that is not known in the trade.  Anybody who asked a merchant for a ton of slates would be promptly told that they are not sold by the ton.  The Minister did not deal in the units known to the trade; nor did he give us the percentage of the tariff that he proposes to impose.  He simply puts down £5 per ton.  Quite obviously the big slates will be better able to bear that tariff than the small ones.  In the matter of small slates, the Irish industry, without any tariff, was more than able to hold its own, but in the big, good class slates it was not able to hold its own.  Good class slates which are thin, consistent with quality and durability, will be able to bear this tariff.  Of course, the question of tariffs does not matter now. It is a tax we want&mdash;tax, tax, and more tax.  All these presents that we were given were by way of encouraging house-building.  Now we are on the down-grade and pursuing a course to discourage house-building, and we shall easily succeed as everybody will see as soon as this Bill is in operation. There is no need to pursue the argument about it on industrial grounds <Col N="1897" /> as it is purely a revenue tax, as was admitted by the Minister.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary suggest that it is not?</P>

      <P>The truth apparently lies very deep down in the Minister for Finance.  His silence during the last few days has perhaps kept it even further down.  But he has coughed it up.  We were led to believe, as far as my recollection goes, by the discussion which took place on slates yesterday that we were stifling the development of the slate industry here by opposing this tariff on slates. Now we are told that it is for the purpose of getting money.  It just emphasises what is perfectly clear to everybody, that this Budget is introduced more in a spirit of gold-digging for the purpose of filling the coffers of the Ministry than for the purposes of assisting Irish industrial development in any way, or making the conditions in the country such that the people can better bear the enormous burden of taxation put upon them.  It has been pointed out to me that there is a considerable amount of housebuilding <Col N="1898" /> going on and a considerable amount of money spent and that a considerable amount more remains to be done.  Having regard to the amount of money spent on housing, taken in relation to the number of houses built, and the achievement in the past, the cost is rather unsatisfactory.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health feels it unsatisfactory, and he was driven, a month or two ago, to state more explicitly the facts in that regard.  He was seeking to include in the number of new houses every case in which he gave a grant of £20, £25, or £30 to persons in a rural area who put new roofs on.  The figures were being swelled in order to excuse, in some way, the enormous amount of money spent.  On top of all that there is the proposal to take at least £30,000 out of the pockets of people in the country who have house property at the present time.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask why the Ministry approaches the slate industry in this country in connection with the Budget in this particular kind of way.  There has been expressed, in this House, and throughout the country, a general complaint that we are not able to get sufficient Irish slates to meet our present requirements. So far from turning their attention to seeing what could be done the better to assist in the organisation of the Irish slate industry, the Government ignored that altogether. They are content to scrape out of the pockets of people pursuing this very useful work, additional moneys.  The Department of Industry and Commerce has a research council.  Is it doing anything to assist those controlling the slate industry the better to direct and organise their work? It seems to me that it would be much better that they should do something like that than concerning themselves with trying to turn turf into silk stockings and whiskey.</P>

We now find it is not, but is for the purpose of getting money.  We think that the tax resources of this country would be better able to bear their burdens if the Government would direct its attention to assisting those controlling industry to organise their business better, and to get slates perfectly suitable for house building where they are available.</P>

      <P>When work like that needs to be done it is simply scandalous that instead of doing it the Government should impose an additional burden on the industry. When we take into consideration the imported slates, goodness knows what it will add, and, also, when we take into consideration the rise that will take place in the price of Irish slates inside that tariff.  It is a great crime, when the cost of housebuilding is so great as it is, and when houses are so badly wanted by the people, and when there is so little money to pay for them, that this additional burden should be imposed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>When this matter is being considered in regard to slates, we should bear in mind this fact: that the slate industry in this country is not asking for protection against the importation of slates from outside.  There was a statement made in the last few months by the manager of a firm engaged in the production of slates, that they need not concern themselves whether any of their slates were put up on Irish houses, because they were not able to produce enough slates to meet the demands of the outside market.  So far from any need of protection, the slate industry in this country, because of the high quality of the slates, were in a position not only to meet competition here but to secure a very valuable export market.  The trouble is not outside competition. The trouble is that those engaged in <Col N="1900" /> the industry have not available the capital necessary for the full development of the slate industry.  The gentleman who made that statement referred to the Killaloe Slate Quarry, which is the largest in this country, and he said recently that if he had the necessary capital to enable him to develop his slate resources along the proper lines, he could produce three times the number of slates he is turning out at present, and employ three times the number of men he has engaged at present.</P>
      <P>This tax means only one thing.  It means that, because of the failure of the Government to help the slate industry to be properly organised, so as to be able to meet the demands of the home and export market, those people who either purchased or rent houses in this country will be saddled with £30,000 or £40,000 extra in order to provide revenue for the Government. That seems to be absolutely inconsistent with the Government's policy of providing houses for the people and providing them at the cheapest possible rent.  It must be remembered that the vast majority of the houses being built are to be occupied by the poorest people who have been brought out from the slums. The latest schemes are slum clearances schemes, and surely, so far from doing anything that would add to the rent of the people who have to be rehoused, everything should be done to make them cheaper still.  Deputies in this House, who are members of local authorities, know perfectly well that those people who are brought from the slums and have to be put into new houses are, many of them, in receipt of unemployment relief or home assistance and have no weekly wages.  In such cases an extra 6d. or even 2d. added to the rent is a very material consideration for these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is wrong. There are 111 houses in my own town on the point of completion.  Every one of them will be roofed with slate.  We <Col N="1901" /> were enabled to roof them with slate because of the special plea which was made to the manager of the Killaloe slate quarry and because of the proximity of the town to the slate quarry. It was only by going to a certain amount of trouble and by up setting, to a certain extent, the orders which he had from across the water, he was able to oblige the council.  I submit to the Deputy and to the House that if the slate industry was properly organised, every house in the country would be roofed with slate without in any way impairing the outside market. It seems to me that less can be said for this imposition than for any other tax in this Budget.  I think the Government will find it almost impossible to make a case for it, because the industry is an industry which is able to stand on its own feet.  It has not looked for protection and does not need it.  All it needs is sufficient capital to organise itself to meet the home and the export markets and to employ three times the number of men employed to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?  Because they will not get the grant if they do not use Irish roofing material, and if they want Irish slate they find that they cannot get it.  Therefore, in order to get the grant, they are putting on inferior material.  This is a tax of £5 per ton on slate for revenue purposes and it does not require a genius to see that that is going to discourage the use of slate.  It is not helping Irish slate at home, because we cannot get it.  If it were helping Irish slate and if the imported slate was displacing Irish slate, I could vote for the tax if it were £10 a ton.  But it is not.  It is for revenue, and the effect of it will be less use of slate which is imported <Col N="1902" />&mdash;the only slate we can get&mdash;and the less imported slate you have, the less houses will be roofed with slate and the less revenue you will have.  This tax is going to be a suicidal tax and nobody with common sense would vote for it.</P>

      <P>Not a bit of it and even if the Minister were to tell me that it had no protective effect, it would not have the slightest effect upon the facts, as I know them.  It has a protective effect, both on Irish slates and Irish alternative roofing material and no amount of <i>ex cathedra</i> stuff from Deputy Belton will alter that fact.  I would certainly like to see <Col N="1903" /> a great deal more development of Irish slates, and it has been my job to find money for a considerable number of development schemes in an attempt to get more slate, but the idea that everybody who can get Irish slate is prepared to use it, even on the quality which is specified in the contracts into which they have entered, is a wild illusion.  I have one case within my knowledge of a school in respect of which a contract was entered into, and in respect of which Irish slates of particular size and so on from three quarries were specified. Everything that was humanly possible to be done by those who had made that contract to avoid carrying it out was done.  At a critical moment, I was told that they could not get the slates and I went to the trouble of finding the slates for them as specified in the contract, and I told them where to get them, and then they would not use them.  They put in another objection, and I again found another slate right in the very town in which they were building this school.  They were told that &ldquo;slate of such and such a quality as specified in your contract can be found in such a business place in your own town,&rdquo; and the answer was that I was denounced with bell, book and candle for attempting to enforce the use of Irish slate which they had entered into a contract to use.  That illustration should certainly put a slightly different complexion on the thing.  Some day or other, I may tell the whole of this very extraordinary tale&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That £30,000 can only be taken out of these pockets if the imported slates are used to that extent, and therefore the Deputy has said that a £30,000 inducement has been given to those who are engaged in building houses for the purpose of forcing them over to Irish slates or alternative Irish building materials.</P>

      <P>We have heard extraordinary arguments brought forward in support of taxes but I think this is the first time that we heard the head of a Department bringing forward as an excuse for a tax of 5/- per cwt. on slates, that he is incompetent to enforce the law. He had a legal contract according to which Irish slates were to be used and, apparently, this extraordinary Department and this extraordinary Parliamentary Secretary could not enforce that legal contract because he had not an extra tax of 5/- per cwt. on slates.  Assuming for the moment and purely for the purposes of the debate&mdash;I confess I am using it for no other purpose &mdash; that there were some difficulties as he suggested, it was an extraordinary argument to use.  I enter into a contract with a certain school manager to utilise Irish slates and he does not do it.  He is legally bound to do it, but I cannot enforce the contract, yet I can do it if you put 5/- of a tax on imported slates.  That is the argument that has been used.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand quite well that Deputy Corry mistakes himself for the moment as the Minister for Finance.  I was not accusing Deputy Corry of studying Culbertson while the business of the House is in progress.  I do not think for a moment that he could hope to get any enlightenment in finance from that particular volume.  I know that Gevernment Deputies were let loose to-day.  They were kept in leash all the week; they are now let loose.  The Parliamentary Secretary told us about the manager of a particular school, if it existed at all, who complained of difficulty in getting Irish slates, but I gathered that it was not merely the manager of that school but builders of all kinds who experienced that difficulty.  I have not the slightest doubt that if the head of any Government Department goes to a certain quarry and asks for slates he will get them.  The owner of the quarry would be very foolish to refuse to give slates to the head of a Department when he puts that request up to him but to say that the ordinary person in the country, who is carrying out a building contract, can get them on demand is an entirely different matter.  That is the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We heard from various Deputies that the lack of development in the <Col N="1909" /> case of the biggest slate quarry in the country is not due to the lack of protection but is due to lack of capital.  There is a sufficient demand for slates; I gathered from the various speakers we have heard in this House that there is plenty of demand for Irish slates, a greater demand than can be supplied at the moment. Therefore when we are asked to choose for the moment as between the statements of the Minister for Finance and those of his understudy as to the purpose of the tax, we shall take those of the Minister for Finance and regard this as a revenue tax.  The Minister's deputy here to-day pretended that this was a protective tariff but in reality as we gathered from the Minister himself this tax is meant to be a purely revenue-raising tax.  I put it to Deputies, is it anything extraordinary that this Government having gone into every nook and cranny in the House to get money should start at the roof and finish at the drains?  In this particular schedule we have it that the Government are putting a tax on every bit of a house and on every house, so that when a man is sleeping he is sleeping under a roof that pays a tax.  If that man has not a ceiling in his house, the first thing he sees in the morning are the slates, and he has to pay a tax on them.  Again, there is the usual example of the Government alleging that its business is to promote a certain kind of activity&mdash;industry&mdash;in this case house-building. But in every part of this schedule we find plenty of evidence that its activity is in the opposite direction.  How the putting up of the price of building material in various ways, slates in this particular case, is expected not to have an effect on the price of a house, and, ultimately on the production of houses, passes the imagination of the ordinary man.  But, apparently, this is one of the methods by which the Minister for Finance thinks he can best help the policy of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  This, we must take it, is a revenue tax.  It was not from an <i>ex</i><Col N="1910" /><i>cathedra</i> pronouncement, as the ecclesiastically-inclined Parliamentary Secretary would seem to suggest, between popes&mdash;about his being excommunicated by bell, book and candle by a school manager and his <i>ex cathedra</i> statement&mdash;that we got the idea that this was a mere revenue tax from Deputy Belton.  We got it from the tax itself, and from the statement of the man who is supposed to be responsible for this particular Bill.</P>

      <P>That was followed up by a further statement.  Deputy Flinn showed how this would be a protective tariff.  He gave the example of the contractor who was bound to use Irish slates and who would not either get them or use them.  The one thing to be learned from the arguments of the Opposition is this: that they are out to see that the Government's housing schemes will give as little employment as possible to the Irish people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is it.  The Government are determined to see that if the people of this country are going to finance housing schemes, then those schemes are going to give all the employment possible here.  They are <Col N="1911" /> going to see that Irish slates and Irish tiles will be used in the construction of houses and that all the employment possible is given to the Irish people. All the arguments of the Opposition are directed against that policy. Because we are endeavouring to protect those employed in the production of Irish slates and tiles, the Opposition are speaking against this proposal and arguing against it.  If the 5/- tax brings in £30,000, as Deputy Mulcahy says it will, may I ask him this question: how much Irish money at 5/- per cwt. on slates is going to be paid for those slates if they are purchased from abroad?  Our answer is that all that money should be kept here for the production of slates and tiles to roof houses for the Irish people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <P>It should be 100 per cent. During the ten years that he was in office Deputy Mulcahy did not build a house for the Irish people, and now he is endeavouring to get back on his old game again.  The Deputy complains because the Irish people are going to get employment in producing slates and tiles for our housing schemes.  He wants all that money to go to some other country for slates to roof our houses.  We had enough of that game during the time Deputy Mulcahy was in office, and I am very glad that it is being put an end to now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>During the past few days the criticism directed against the Finance Bill has come mainly from these benches.  Those on the Government side of the House did not intervene very often.  I am glad to see that even at this late hour some of the Deputies opposite are showing a desire to intervene.  They were careful to refrain from making any intervention when the provisions imposing taxes on the food of the people were being discussed.  Perhaps they did not think it wise to intervene then. Now we have Deputy Corry, with the indiscretion of a bantam fighter challenging a heavyweight, intervening. I do not know whether this <Col N="1912" /> is a revenue tax or a protective tax, or whether it has a touch of both.  The Minister for Finance says that it is a revenue tax.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance said that it was not&mdash;that it was mainly protective, but that there might be a touch of revenue about it. The Parliamentary Secretary tried to prove that it would help and protect some industry.  He did not mention slates.  I think he did refer to some subsidiary form of slate production.  What strikes me about this particular tariff is that it is going to increase the price of building materials.  It is well known that Irish slates cannot be got by many builders.  That cannot be contradicted, and yet we have the principal manufacturer of Irish slates exporting slates.  It is reasonable to suppose that his reason for doing that is that he is able to get a better price for his slates.  He is hardly doing it for fun.  It must also be assumed that when there is an export market for Irish slates they must be regarded as a better article than the slate produced in the country to which they are being exported.  Another reason may be that by exporting Irish slates the manufacturer is attempting to force the Minister to give him a monopoly of the trade here such as manufacturers in other lines got before.  It may not be necessary at all for certain manufacturers to export the goods they produce here, but as I have suggested their reason for doing so may be to endeavour to force the Minister to give them a monopoly so that they may be able to force up prices on the home market.  That may be the reason here.  I do not believe that we are at all near the day when we will be able to produce sufficient slates to meet the home demand.  Therefore, this tariff is going to result in an increased price for slates.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that our attitude was to prevent people using Irish materials.  That is ridiculous.  If people want to use the best materials, then they are entitled to get them and if Irish slates are the best they should be entitled to get them.  If people cannot get Irish slates then they ought to <Col N="1913" /> be able to get the slate that, in their opinion, is the next best.  When people want to get the best material to roof their houses, they ought to be entitled to get it.  If they want to have their houses roofed with slates instead of some other material they ought to be able to get them.  If people who initiate housing schemes believe that a slate roof is the best roof, surely they are entitled to have slates.  There are people who believe that even a slate inferior to the best Irish slate is a better roof than some of the best substitute roofs which are being used. This tax is going to force people to use substitute roofing at, possibly, the price of slates.  It is going to increase the cost of building to that extent.  We may get an inferior roof at the price the slates would cost.  This tariff will have the same effect as all other tariffs. There are cases in which a tariff does not fall on the consuming country. The people in these circumstances can get the goods elsewhere or substitute goods.  But, in practically all cases, a tariff will have the effect of raising prices at home.  I do not think that there is one tariff which we imposed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>This tariff, in my opinion and in the opinion of many others, will add to the cost of a certain building material, to wit, slates.  If it has the effect of making the manufacturers retain at home what they at present export, it will mean that they will put the 5/- on the amount they keep at home.  That might be all to the good, but we must realise that this tax is going to add to the cost of building. Whether that is wise or not, is another question.  For my part, I think building costs are high enough.</P>

      <P>It does not seem to me to be by any means clear how a tariff <Col N="1914" /> on an article in respect of which the supply does not equal the demand will raise the price of that article.  Surely the opportunity for raising the price is already present, to a large extent. Deputy Belton says that Irish slates cannot be obtained.  Several other Deputies said that the supply was not equal to the demand.  Why, in these circumstances, should a tariff be required to enable the manufacturers to raise prices?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, the whole case about raising prices seems to be absurd. If it is not, then the case has not been put clearly.  If I were in possession of an article for which there were people clamouring, I should be inclined to take full advantage of the clamour and raise the price.  A tariff of 5/- per cwt. would not be of much importance to me.  I think that the point about raising prices has not been proven. Another point arises.  Deputies opposite profess a great desire to see the industries of the country developed.  They admit that there are slate quarries in the country.  They say that, under present conditions, the slate quarries are not being developed. Deputy Belton referred to the manner &mdash;I thought this was very inconsistent from the point of view of his argument&mdash;in which slate development was being scamped.  There was, he said, no attempt to penetrate deeply into the quarry; development was merely superficial.  If all that has happened and if the argument be correct, that capital fails to go where there is a demand for it, how can there be any objection to the Government trying <Col N="1915" /> some further stimulus?  If this tariff gives a stimulus to proper slate development, I do not think that any Deputy interested in industry should regret it.</P>

      <P>Let the Deputy get this into his mind&mdash;that they do not require protection.  Irish slates are able to get sufficient demand on the home and export markets on merit alone.  I think it is an insult to those engaged in the Irish slate industry that a tax of 5/- must be imposed to help it.  Is Deputy Moore aware that the City of Glasgow would take the whole of the present production of the Killaloe slate quarries?</P>

      <P>When the Deputy talks about £30,000 or about a 5/- <Col N="1917" /> tariff, let him get this into his mind &mdash;that there is only one way to help the Irish slate industry, and that is if the money was handed over for the further development of the quarries and to give additional employment. The manager of the Killaloe slate quarries appeared before the Commission on Prices recently, and stated that if he had sufficient capital he could produce three times as much slates and find demand for them.  This is not a question of assisting a weak and a struggling industry.  The position is, perhaps, unique, because we have an industry that cannot produce enough slates to meet the demand. I suggest that it is a reflection on the industry to say that the 5/- is being imposed to help it.  Of course, it is not.  No one knows that better than the Parliamentary Secretary, who talked around this question very glibly.  He talked about everything except the question under discussion. He mentioned a contractor who was legally bound to put Irish slates on the roof of some building, and that he could not get him to do so.  He said there was no method of getting that done, except by having a tax on slates.</P>

      <P>If Irish slates are specified in the contract, whatever may be the prejudice of the contractor, he must put Irish slates on the roof.  Apart from this section, the law is there to compel him to do so.  I say it is unfair to make use of the Irish slate industry on which to hang this tax.  It is not required.  The position is that the City of Glasgow alone could take the whole production of the Killaloe slate quarries, and they are the biggest quarries in this country.</P>

      <P>Deputy Moore, and other speakers, want, apparently, to repair the damage that the Minister for Finance did, by his frank admission, perhaps in an unguarded moment, that this is purely a revenue tax.  Deputy Moore asked me if the tariff would not help the production of Irish slates.  My answer is, not in the least.  The trouble is that we are not looking for a market but want to get Irish slates.  If I was building a house to live in and wanted Irish slates and could not get them, I would have to import slates.  Apart from the price, I would buy Irish slates.  I cannot get them.  Deputy Moore's argument is that we should not be allowed to get any slates if we could not get Irish slates.  The Parliamentary Secretary was looking for an excuse, and he drew on his imagination about a contractor for a school and the trouble there was to get him to carry out the terms of the contract.  Does anybody believe that the Parliamentary Secretary did that? Of course not.  I am not a Parliamentary Secretary, but if I was in a position to give a contract, I would enforce it by going to a solicitor to have it carried out.  That is what the Parliamentary Secretary would do if there was any substance in what he said.  I will give another instance, where I was building 24 houses in two terraces.  Before I started I decided to arrange about the slates. A traveller from one of the biggest firms in Dublin assured me that he could get Irish slates.  I had trouble before about finishing houses with Killaloe slates, 16 by 8, and in the end, after searching Dublin, I had to buy job lots.  I had to buy slates 22 by 10 and to pay a man to cut them back to 16 by 8 in order to finish the job.  I was unable to get Killaloe slates 16 by 8.  It was essential for the development of the place that the 24 houses should be slated.  I told the traveller that I had got a &ldquo;sickener&rdquo; before and that I should have the slates on the ground before I started.  He came next day and assured me that he could get small slates 11 by 7.  I consulted the architect who said that the best thing to <Col N="1919" /> do was to lath and board the roofs. I went to the trouble of having that done but could not get small slates. The firm wrote and wired to the quarries and they could not get an answer.  I will give the name of the firm to anyone who is curious to know it.  Finally, I had to abandon Irish slates and to order Blue Bangor, which were delivered in an hour. When I asked if it would be safe to put Blue Bangor slates on boarded roofs, I was told that it would not, and that I would have either to take off the boards and laths or to put on felt.  I had then to go to the expense of putting on felt for use with Blue Bangor slates. Deputies say that our opposition to this tariff is because we do not want to help Irish industry.  Deputies are going to vote for this tax as a revenue tax.  They are afraid and ashamed to admit that they are going to tax slates in order to produce revenue.</P>

      <P>Let the House have some explanation of your attitude. You cannot give it.  I repeat that if a tax of £10 a ton on slates would help Irish industry, I would support it.  I will not support a tariff of ten farthings a ton to help production when we have not enough slates for our own development.  The Minister said that this was revenue tax and he cannot get away from it.  When the Minister went out the Parliamentary Secretary came in.  Perhaps the Minister saw that he put his foot in it.  Possibly, he may have suggested to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should take him out of the hole that he had got into.  The Parliamentary Secretary failed miserably to do so.  Now the back benchers want to support this tax on slates that we have not got.  Deputy Moore said that the tax would help industry. If a tariff of £1,000 was put on imported slates it would not help, because there is a greater demand for Irish slates than can be supplied. It is for those responsible for the development of the country to help the Irish slate quarries.  It will not <Col N="1920" /> be necessary to put a penny tax on slates if they can be produced in sufficient quantities here.  It is not that help is wanted for Irish slates but to have them made available when required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>We have listened to the most peculiar and amazing arguments I ever heard.  First, we had it stated that Glasgow was buying all the Irish slates.  Evidently the charge is that the Killaloe people are so unpatriotic that they will not supply Irish builders, but would rather export the slates to Glasgow.  If sufficient slates are not being produced, how is it that they are being exported?  As the Parliamentary Secretary said, people here have either a bee in their bonnets, or they are not prepared to use Irish slates, unless they are made do so. Surely to goodness the Killaloe Slate Quarries are prepared to supply the Irish people with slates first before they export them.  Apparently, the whole thing is that they must be exported, and then we have Deputy Morrissey trying to camouflage it by saying that the whole object of the people over there is to create all the unemployment they can.  There is enough roofing material being made in this country to roof every house that is being built.  If it would give employment to our own people, I would vote not alone for 50 per cent. but for 100 per cent.  I would like to know how the Killaloe people are exporting to Glasgow and will not supply the Irish people with Irish slates and, on the other hand, why you are so anxious to import foreign slates here.</P>

      <P>I wonder where the idea sprang up that this was a tariff.  The Minister for Finance, in that remarkably long speech he contributed, said that it was a revenue tax.  It is.  The purpose of a tariff is quite clear, and that is to secure the home market for the slates, but it is quite obvious that there is a sufficient home market for the slates produced in this country. There is no necessity, therefore, for the tariff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I always knew that it was unpatriotic to export cattle, according to the Deputies opposite, but now I understand it is unpatriotic to get even Scottish money, not to speak of English money, for Irish slates.  The whole thing is absurd and ridiculous. We cannot get money for the goods we export, and, according to Deputy Corry, it is unpatriotic of the Killaloe Quarries to sell Irish produce outside the country.  That is the latest Fianna Fáil doctrine or policy of self-containedness.  Not merely are we to take nothing from other countries, but apparently we are not to export to other countries.  We dare not sell abroad.  We are unpatriotic if we do.  This is purely a revenue tax and nothing else.  I am not relying now on the Minister's own statement to that effect, but on the actual facts of the situation.  This is not a case of protecting or securing the home market for Irish produce.  That market is already secured and more than secured.  There is a much greater demand for the Irish produce in this case than there is a supply. The difficulty is, not to find a market for the Irish slates in Ireland; the difficulty is to find Irish slates for the market that is in Ireland.  To speak of protecting that market in this connection is simply a complete misconception of the whole purpose of protection. The idea of protection is that, when the home-produced goods are being driven out of the home market by foreign competition, you try to keep out the foreign article, but <Col N="1922" /> emphatically, that is not the case here.</P>

      <P>At any rate, the Deputy who spoke last does not seem to be attending to the business of the House.  He seems to be reading letters, instead of attending to it. We had then the extraordinary statement that there can be no increase in prices because there was a greater demand than supply in the home market.  That was Deputy Moore's argument.  Apparently, the 5/- a cwt. on slates, which amounts to 50 per cent. of an increase, is paid by nobody.  It is just given away with the slates.  Surely, it means an increase in price and in building costs.  I suggest, however, that the whole debate has been most interesting in so far as it allowed us to see the extraordinarily muddled point of view of the people opposite on the question of finance, protection, tariffs and taxes.  We cannot wonder at the state the country is in when such matters are in the control of a Party such as that.  They speak of protection without knowing what it is for.  When a mere revenue tax is imposed, they speak of it as a protective tariff.  This tariff is not a protective tariff.  It is nothing of the kind.  It is a tariff purely and simply for revenue purposes.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 42:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In Part I, to delete reference No. 10, including relevant references in columns 2 and 3.</P>
      <P>Under reference No. 10 the Minister proposes a tax of 9d. per cwt. on glazed pipes made wholly or mainly of clay or earthenware, and glazed connections, for pipes of any kind, made wholly or mainly of clay or earthenware. The Minister for Finance told us, when dealing with the Resolution on the Second Schedule on Report, that he knew those were not made here, but this was mainly a revenue-producing tax; there was just this aspect of it, that there were purposes for which glazed pipes were being used at the present time, and for which perhaps glazed pipes need not be used, and he proposed to some extent by this tax to force people to use unglazed pipes where at present they were using glazed ones.  He said that this tax, however, was mainly imposed for revenue purposes.  It is not easy to see how much this is going to impose, but it may impose anything between £8,000 and £10,000, another of the many burdens upon house building costs which the Minister is imposing under the various proposals in this Finance Bill.  Again, the House has to consider whether it is going to stand for the elaborate policy that is being pursued in those regulations of raising every single halfpenny which the Minister can raise by means of import duties on materials which are absolute necessities in connection with the building of houses.  There is a considerable amount of housebuilding going on here.  A lot of it is more than necessary.  There is a considerable amount more to be done, which is even more necessary still.  The Parliamentary Secretary has drawn attention to the type of person for whom houses are being provided at the present time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the type of person who is not able to pay anything like an economic rent for the houses that are being built, and who day by day is becoming less able to pay the rent that is being charged. This tax must inevitably force higher rents out of those people, or impose higher rates on the ratepayers who are subsidising the building of houses. The Minister for Finance is making his side of the question safe.  He is taking back some of the money which <Col N="1925" /> he is pretending to spend on houses. Ultimately he is taking this money at the expense of the very poorest class of the community, who will have to pay increased rent.</P>

      <P>I would like to draw attention to the fact that the Minister is imposing a tariff on a material the trade in connection with which he knows nothing of.  As Deputy Briscoe probably is aware, nobody would go into a business house in Dublin and ask for a cwt. or a ton weight of glazed pipes, because he would be laughed at.  It is not by weight that these things are dealt with; they are dealt with from the point of view of design and description&mdash;bore, glazed or unglazed.  On a rough estimate, judging from the items proposed to be taxed by this Bill for revenue purposes, I would say a £700 or £800 house would be increased by £100.  Of course, houses of different costings will be put up proportionately.  I observe the antics of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.  His little tricks will not deceive anybody and will not draw anybody.  It is a very serious matter for people who have to live in this country, have all their interests in this country and have even their banking accounts in this country; it is a very important thing for them to consider where we are drifting.</P>

      <P>When we have one it is time to protect it and not when we have merely a debit there.  Perhaps some people have their debits here and their credits elsewhere.  So far as I am aware, those articles specified <Col N="1926" /> in the Bill are not manufactured here.  I would like to know if, when an attempt was made to make those here and to divert the attention of people to the use of substitutes, the architectural profession was consulted. Anyone who knows anything about drainage is aware that the best type of sewer is one with the smallest possible fall that will move.  The glazed pipe was not an accident nor is it to be regarded as a superior pipe to do a neat job or anything like that. It was produced definitely to bring about this result, to keep a move on the load with the smallest possible fall.  As Deputies can easily appreciate, the smallest fall that can be produced and that will be efficient, the better, and it lightens the cost because every sewer must have a fall from beginning to end or otherwise it must move into some depot where an elaborate and expensive pumping station has to be erected.</P>
      <P>An attempt has been made to produce alternatives here in the form of concrete pipes.  These concrete pipes, I understand, will require a greater fall and it is questionable if the efficiency will be as good.  However, that is immaterial for the men out recklessly looking for money.  I do not suggest that the Minister for Finance would do anything reckless, but there are people who, when they are hard up for money, break a bank and get it.  I do not suggest the Minister does anything as reckless as that. But this differs from breaking a bank only in degree.  The Minister taxes a commodity that is not made here and that is absolutely essential for the public health.  It puts up the cost considerably and I have not seen any case made for it.  It would be interesting if somebody could make a case for it now.  If we have suitable clay here, and I believe we have, it ought to be exploited and the industry should be developed.  That should be done by way of bounty until we see if the proper article can be produced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very serious thing for the sewerage systems that are being installed throughout the country now at a cost of hundreds of thousands <Col N="1927" /> of pounds.  It is a serious point that we should be rushing out to experiment on those systems, using concrete pipes instead of the earthen pipes that have been used heretofore.  All this work is being completed at a great cost with an article that is at present only in its experimental stage.  It is a matter for very serious consideration. There are some members of the Corporation here and they are probably aware that the concrete pipe recommended to bring water from the proposed waterworks in the Upper Liffey to Belgarde Reservoir in Clondalkin is not manufactured in this country and the process, I understand, is unknown to engineering in this country except through books. How much more careful must we be when carrying out sewerage systems with concrete pipes that are only in their experimental stage?  Four years ago you would not see one of them and now they are dumped everywhere.</P>
    <P>We are taxing glazed pipes that have done the job efficiently up to now and we are not making any definite effort to produce pipes here as a substitute for the foreign glazed pipes. As to whether the concrete pipes are durable enough, I am not in a position to say.  I am referring now to concrete pipes forming a main deep down under the ground.  There is no question, however, that every architect in Ireland will tell you there is only one pipe that will give satisfaction and that is the glazed earthen <Col N="1928" /> pipe used for house connections to the main.  This is the proposition, to tax that without making provision for Irish glazed pipes.</P>

I believe that the position is as the Minister has indicated&mdash;that he is scraping in all the revenue he can and that these taxes are for the purpose of providing revenue.  This means taking money off the ratepayers every day of the week.

      <P>In Part II to delete reference No. 13 including relevant references in columns 2 and 3.</P>
      <P>Another few halfpence have been collected here in increased rents because we are dealing with another imposition on housing.  Reference No. 13 imposes a tariff of 10 per cent. on glass of all kinds imported in sheets or strips whether flat or bent or otherwise shaped.  The Minister for Finance&mdash;he has subsided again into silence&mdash;told us when dealing with the Report Stage of the Resolutions embodying the taxes in this Schedule that the imposition of the duty in this Bill is due entirely to revenue considerations.  But the Minister has not told us how much he expects to raise the general rents in the country by the imposition of these taxes.  I suggest it will be anything from £7,000 to £10,000.  The Minister has sat silent while tax after tax has been imposed which increased the cost of house building at a time when both rates and the ordinary revenue are being utilised in a big housing campaign to house the poorer sections of the people.  Here again he dips further into the pockets of the ratepayers, who are contributing substantial amounts towards this housing campaign, to help to keep going the miserable and disastrous war policy that is being kept going at present.  We have the people becoming less and less able to bear the burden of rents and taxes being saddled with this tax this year with every prospect of its being continued.</P>

      <P>We are gradually coming nearer to the end of the litany of the Minister's folly.  It is strange how silent an important member of the Dublin Corporation, who sits behind the Minister, is on this important matter.  It is putting up the cost of building construction in the aggregate by from 10 to 20 per cent.  Whatever opinion I had of the Minister, I never thought he was so reckless.  It shows the desperate straits to which he must be reduced when he proposes to tax the light.  He has taxed the air, I might say, by making us use inferior sewer pipes, inasmuch as the good air will be polluted by bad drainage.  Now he is going to tax the light.  It is extraordinary how the Minister thinks he can get away with such reckless taxation. When he, of all men in this country, knows the financial condition with regard to housing, he is putting another load on it.  The Minister heard of the Dublin Corporation's housing programme which, as Deputy Briscoe is aware, was enunciated one night in this way: &ldquo;Why stop at 1,000, why stop at 2,000; why not 10,000 houses per year?&rdquo;  That was before the Deputy and his senior, the Minister for Local Government, thought of supporting <Col N="1931" /> a tax on light.  The Minister for Finance knows as well as anybody how he has put up the costs by these taxes.  He knows what the general public does not know, that all this talk about 5,000 or 10,000 houses per year to be built by the Dublin Corporation has now ended in smoke.  I would rather I had not to say this, but it is time that the public should know that there is not a bob now for any new houses, and the Minister knows it.</P>

      <P>Yes, everything used in the construction of houses.  Judging by the way things are going, there will soon be nothing to tax, because the building trade will just sit down.  I do not see many of the Government Deputies from the City of Dublin here. We should remember that 2,000 people are earning their living on the Dublin Corporation housing schemes, and there is nothing staring them in the face except the sack in a couple of months. Another 1,000 people are working on housing schemes which are being carried out by private speculators, and they are dribbling out gradually.  The Minister knows that, apart from this taxation, they would dribble out because of financial stringency.  There is no money to purchase houses.  The sources are being dried up.</P>

If there is no money in that market and the cost of production is increased we very soon come to the end of our tether.  There is no money in the house market now and the Minister knows it.  A lot of people are employed in the building trade in Dublin&mdash;more than are employed in any other one trade in Dublin.  The market for the houses is dwindling because of money stringency, and the cost of constructing houses is going up because of the Minister for Finance poking his nose into that dying trade in order to get revenue out of it. This is nearly the last word in absurdity &mdash;to tax glass.  Then, of course, he is going to tax the tumbler after that and the glass jug.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have often expressed the view, in the course of these discussions, that if the Minister would indulge, as from time to time, in blocks of the Finance Bill, and tell us what was the motive that induced him to bring forward these items for discussion it would save time.  We have dealt with most of the big taxes of the savage type upon the articles and necessaries of life that always have, and always will bring in, without any doubt, a certain yield of taxation.  Whether they will continue to so yield is a matter for speculation. Apart from these, it is not surprising that the Government should find that they are coming to the end of their resources.  But it is surprising that the Minister should scatter through <Col N="1933" /> his Budget a series of taxes that will prevent the only industry found here as elsewhere in which the Government can properly intervene, where private enterprise has failed, namely of housing making progress.  Governments are endeavouring everywhere in the serious state of unemployment, due mainly to economic barriers and national frontiers, to enter into the project of house building from which private enterprise has just marched out.  Private enterprise did not so much march out as that it was thrown out because in the war period people were taken off the building of houses and put on to munitions work.  Then there was a dearth of houses; rents had to be raised and Governments had to come to the rescue of those suffering from the rent raising.  Private enterprise not being able to assist, Governments in various countries in the world, decided to take a hand. Economists noted this fact that in the building industry private enterprise had handed over the work to the State.  In that enterprise the State has worked and successfully worked in most countries.  It is the only enterprise in which the State has worked even with a degree of success, in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I need not go into the figures, but the position is, according to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that out of 21,000 persons employed in May, 1934, it is clear that the house building industry has found employment for 15,000 out of the 17,000 that got new employment in three years. That particular enterprise has been placed beside road-making, one in which State intervention has been attended with success.  It should therefore be the duty of the Government, agitated about unemployment, to see that that particular branch of employment would not be blocked or impeded in any way.  Yet it is impeded in this Budget.  Everything in connection with house building is picked out for taxation.  It does seem as if Deputy Corry's philosophy is permeating the whole of the Government financial problem.  If you are in a bad way and your main sources are dried up you must go to what the <Col N="1934" /> people must of necessity get in order to get assistance.  Then you have the other surprise, that the State that wants to give certain subsidies towards house building, with one hand, are collecting with the other hand, and abstracting through taxation, a certain amount of the grant they are giving.  This tax can clearly be regarded as one of the impediments to house building.  Again I say that point is clear.  If you put a big weight of taxation on a particular industry the yield in the long run is bound to disappear.  It gives a red light, a sure indication and pointer towards danger.  The Minister believes that by abstracting 1d. here and 3d. and 6d. in another place he will be able to hide his failure.  But he must realise that the accumulation of the pennies and the threepences put on at one end on particular items are likely to have a pronounced effect in the long run.  I do not think the Minister has any other method of relieving unemployment in this country or any method of finding alternative employment for the 15,000 persons out of the 17,000 that the Government has been able to find occupations for in the building trade in the last three years.</P>
    <P>The result of this taxation will be that the building industry will display a downward tendency like everything else; it is somewhat peculiar and I think requires an answer.  We have a method here where the very lowest level&mdash;articles that most communities regard as sacred&mdash;are taxed to the fullest.  Foodstuffs, necessaries, and things which sustain life are all taxed.  Now we get to the shelter for the people which is only one step up and these are taxed.  People may live in the open if they get enough food. Even the story books talk of people landed on desert islands and tell us that those people know that if they are able to find food they will be able to do some rough job of housing. We have got to this second step by attaching taxes to what, according to the idea of Deputy Corry, the people must have.  The accumulation of these taxes on glass, on pipes, on slates and the rest of it represents <Col N="1935" /> the Minister's most facile way of getting himself the amount of money he wants for the coming year.  The accumulation of these taxes will have a fatal result and much earlier than he thinks.</P>
    <P>Apart from all that, I should think that glass as a subject for taxation would be the last thing that the Minister would tackle.  I thought it would be recognised as a national monument.  I think it was behind a wall of glass that President de Valera sat when he wanted to do nothing. He wanted to display himself as a man who saw clearly but could do nothing.  Is that the position that the Minister for Finance wishes to take up?  Glass dulls sound as well as prevents action.</P>
    <P>There is a further point.  We are going to tax this glass whether in sheets or strips or whether bent or otherwise shaped.  Is this clearly for revenue also?  A more promising Minister at one time wanted to tax flat sheets of corrugated iron, and announced that he was going to get employment for people in bending this material.  I do not know whether the Minister for Finance is going to engage people in bending glass and putting it into shapes other than those in which it was brought in. The Minister has not at all told us what his object is.  The calculation is made that about £7,000 will be the yield of this tax.  A small mining concession, if the State handled it properly, would bring in at least as much.  Indeed, if it was properly handled it might bring in three times that amount.  Perhaps the Minister is going to put forward an idea of properly handling this matter.  We have got the idea that by abstracting pennies in the form of taxation from <Col N="1936" /> breadstuffs, butter, tea, sugar and everything else the multiplication of these pennies will get the Government that promised everything out of its difficulties.  And now we have come down to this, that we have to try to stop the rot from going on for another year in order to prevent a spectacular collapse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point I want to bring out very briefly.  It is regarded as one of the signs of a progressive Government that they look after the housing conditions of the poor, and it has been the aim of all Governments in recent times to provide better housing accommodation for the poor.  This tax is a retrograde tax.  It brings the position back to the position that existed over a century ago when there was a tax on windows.  It was regarded as a sign of progressive times when that tax was removed.  We are now going to put a tax on windows and thereby reduce the entrances of the light and the air into houses, by means of that tax, so that we are going back, or endeavouring to go back, or leading the way, by this tax to the position that existed some century, or so, ago. It may be that there is another reason for this tax.  The Opposition Party have certain premises in this city, and elsewhere, and it is the habit of some of their opponents, supporters of the Government, to throw bricks at these windows as they pass by.  We have to buy glass to replace them and we will increase the revenue of the State by that means.  That may be the real reason for this tax.</P>

      <P>In Part II to delete reference No. 14, including relevant references in columns 2 and 3.</P>
      <P>We have seen quite a string of cases in which the Minister proposes to tax nearly everything he could think of which goes into the make-up of houses for the working class.  We have seen a string of things, upon which he imposes a tax, which the working man will have to get when he goes into a new home.  If the resident in a tenement area in Dublin, about whom the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance spoke so feelingly a short time ago, is transferred to a new Corporation house, and, if reviewing the family chattels, the woman of the house finds that she requires a little bit of new linoleum or a little bit of oilcloth, she will, when she goes to purchase them, find that the Minister for Finance has levied a tax on them. Now, if she wants a few glass runners or a few glass vases, the tax gatherer meets her at the door and says: &ldquo;You cannot go in here; you cannot make your home the kind of place you think it should be, from the point of view of equipment or furnishing, without paying every tax that has been imposed in the Finance Bill this year.  I must get my hand into your pocket again before you can buy a couple of new runners to put on your tables.&rdquo;  This is the proposal that is made in this reference under which the Minister proposes to put a tax of 10 per cent. on</P>
      <P>&ldquo;glassware not otherwise liable to duty and not containing any goods at importation which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, is suitable for domestic or household use or ornament.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The house cannot have that little bit of new equipment that the woman of the house requires if she wishes to make the new home the home of her desires, without the Minister's agents waiting at her door to pilfer her pockets of a few pounds or a few shillings.</P>

      <P>The Minister still continues his weary way.  There are still a few more steps to take.  He has now got from the roof through the drainage, and through the windows, to the linoleum and the oilcloth, and he has arrived at the few little articles of glass furniture.  The Minister must know how all these enter into the housekeeper's budget if he has a little experience.  I shall try to give him some idea of how people in need of houses are circumstanced.  A few years ago, the Dublin Corporation had about 500 houses completed for house purchase.  Advertisements were inserted in the papers for applicants and there were somewhere about 12,000 applicants.  There was some trouble about paying the rents, or the instalments on the house-purchase schemes, and calculations were made which showed that to liquidate the loss to the corporation it would be necessary to clear out those who were not paying and then order a flat rate for new tenement purchasers of £45 per house.  The applicants then amounted to 3,000 or 4,000.  That was a rough census of people who wanted houses and who were in a financial position to take houses.  From experience, we know that there are some thousands of people in and around the city who can afford to put about £100 cash down; but in every case, when you come to close quarters with them, they say: &ldquo;Well we do not want to get a house and keep it as an empty house.  When we go into a new house we want to get some new articles of furniture.&rdquo;  One would have thought that these people must have gone round, whispered into the ear of the Minister, and that the Minister must have taken note of their remarks.  Of course, he preserved that stoical silence he preserves here. He did not tell them what he was doing it for, but he selected these things to tax.  He is now taxing the tumblers and a few odds and ends of ornaments, thus increasing the tenant's outlay by 10 or 20 per cent. It is extraordinary that, when a matter of importance like this is being discussed&mdash;the taxation of the household requirements of the people&mdash;<Col N="1940" /> there is not a solitary Labour Deputy present.  With the present trend of things, no power on earth can prevent 2,000 or 3,000 building operatives being thrown out of work in the City of Dublin in the next two or three months.  The Minister goes on his weary way taxing building materials from top to bottom of the house, taxing the bit of oilcloth&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would like if, for once, the Minister would break silence and let us know if he is going to appoint an æsthetic adviser to the Revenue Commissioners.  It appears to me that will be necessary if he is going to enforce this tax.  The Minister is putting a tax on glassware &ldquo;which is suitable for domestic or household use or ornament.&rdquo;  I want to know who is to decide whether the glassware is an ornament or whether it is not. Suppose, for instance, a certain bit of glass comes from Venice, the great glass-blowing centre to-day.  So far as I know, no rival is going to be set up to it here.  Who is going to decide whether that bit of Venetian glass is ornamental or ugly?  Who is going to be the adviser to the Revenue Commissioners in order to decide whether a thing is pretty enough to carry a 10 per cent. tax or ugly enough to be exempt from all duty?  That seems to me to be a rather heavy burden to put on the Revenue Commissioners.  The Minister, no doubt, considers himself extraordinarily æsthetic.  Of course, we all know that he cultivated the mount of Pegasus in the days of his youth, and I suppose he is pursuing the other arts in his more mature years.  Will he inform us if he himself is going to give assistance to the <Col N="1941" /> Revenue Commissioners, and is to be the infallible judge as to whether a thing is ugly or beautiful.  If it is ugly it will be exempt from duty, but if it is beautiful a 10 per cent. tax goes on.</P>
      <P>I understand that there is rather the view at the present moment that artistic beauty should be considered in this country; that we do not consider quite sufficiently, or value highly enough, artistic effort and artistic output, but if we are going to tax what is beautiful and let in what is ugly that surely is suggesting that the Minister for Finance will be putting a premium on ugliness and undoing all the work which the æsthetic members of the community are endeavouring to carry out.  There seems to me to be another difficulty.  This speaks of glass suitable for domestic use or ornament.  We discover a little later in the Schedule that amongst the things that are not considered to be of domestic use are glass bottles.  No one in an ordinary household is to be allowed to have for domestic purposes any glass bottle, because these come in under reference No. 17.  I am very anxious to know what is meant by &ldquo;domestic or household use or ornament.&rdquo;  A rather necessary thing in a household, one would imagine, is a cruet stand which contains bottles.  Is not that to be regarded of domestic use?</P>

      <P>I am in disagreement with two things that have been said by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney. He reads this reference number as calling for some aesthetic judgement on the part of the Revenue Commissioners. I do not agree.  The Deputy founded his phrase on the definition: glassware suitable for domestic or household use to which is attached a bit of an ornament.  I understand that such things as gargoyles, not remarkable for beauty, are considered to be ornamental, and here we find one of these ornaments on the front bench.  Someone spoke of the Minister's stoic silence, but anyone who has read a little history or philosophy must know that the stoics were a rather brave type of people.  This is cowardly silence from a man who cannot defend anything.  Neither can he <Col N="1942" /> get any of his back-benchers to defend this, and so we have these orphan taxes running through.  No one in the House will give them their benediction or stand for them.</P>

      <P>The Minister says that I am the one man on the ice floe.  He would not sit so quietly on the ice floe.  It might be too uncomfortable. Has the Minister any reasons he can give for these taxes? Why, as Deputy Belton has asked, has he decided to batter in on the whole scheme of house construction?  This hits not merely the people engaged in moving into new houses who have to consider such things as the replacement of ordinary domestic ware.  It hits particularly the people who are house-hunting, those who are going to set up house for the first time.  It is going to eat in on the little, in the way of resources that the activities <Col N="1943" /> of the tax-gatherer have left them to spend on equipment.  To come back to the definition, it is simply another way of saying that whatever articles the Revenue Commissioners decide to be glass are to be taxed.  The phrase used is very comprehensive &mdash; any glassware which is not otherwise liable to duty.  If otherwise liable to duty, the Revenue Commissioners will have to bring their judgment to bear on it.  Something that is a little bit transparent and that anyone recognises as glass will be subject to duty. Something that the Revenue Commissioners will pass as glass, something that one can see directly through, will be subject to this tax. As long as there is some idea of transparency or some possibility of opacity the thing will be classed as glass.</P>

      <P>The brass Minister is absent, but we have got the dumb one instead to-day.  Surely there should be some consideration before piling up this ten per cent. tax on all these items. No doubt, as far as ordinary commodities are concerned, the Budget is a pickpocket Budget, but one would have thought that the Minister would not have been so vigilant in scrounging around small households to see what he could get his hands on.  No doubt this Budget was largely inspired by back benchers on the Government side.  In preparing his Budget the Minister must have relied very much on them.  It is not the Budget of a man living in a middle class way in Dublin.  It seems to be inspired rather by someone who knows the interior of the ordinary <Col N="1944" /> two-roomed house.  Someone who had got a fairly good picture of everything in it, of everything used on the walls and floors, in the rooms and on the dresser in the kitchen.  The Corry mind is distinctly evident here again.  There is this very comprehensive view: &ldquo;We will take in everything.&rdquo; Remember, there is no idea of protection in respect of this item.  In the speech to which Deputy Mulcahy referred, made here on the 23rd May of this year, we were told that these were revenue tariffs.  The idea is that we must get in these pennies, twopences and threepences which we are to pay back to certain people in a certain way, and then we are to describe ourselves as brave fellows, tender-hearted people, for giving these benefits to certain folk. There is an O. Henry story, to which I referred before, of a man who was refused admission to heaven.  He saw other people passing.  One other person was held up and he excused himself, saying he only took the pennies out of a blind man's tin.  He got in as against the other man who had been held up.  If the Minister for Finance and the man who took the pennies out of the blind man's tin were running neck for neck for heaven, I believe the fellow who took the pennies out of the blind man's tin would get in.</P>

      <P>In Part II, to delete reference No. 15, including relevant references in columns 2 and 3.</P>
      <P>The Minister proposes to impose a 50 per cent. tax on paper, without any matter or design printed thereon.  To go no further than the paper used by newspapers, this tax is going to impose a very heavy burden upon them.  How much does the Minister for Finance expect to get out of this tax?  Does he understand that it can have no other result than the reorganisation of overhead expenses by newspapers and the creation of a considerable amount of unemployment?  Has the Minister examined the position with regard to any of the big daily newspapers or any of the weekly newspapers?  Has he examined the position as far as the daily newspapers are concerned and what the effect of this tax will be? Does he not understand that it will inevitably bring about a reduction of overhead costs, by way of a reduction in employment?  The Government and the rank and file of the Fianna Fáil Party have been attacking newspapers for a long time.  In some parts, resolutions have been passed calling for the suppression of some of the local Press. Repeatedly, Ministerial statements and the Government organ have indicated that, but for the anti-national nature of all the daily Press in this country, except the Government organ, there would be an end to the economic war.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is, no doubt, a revenue producing tax, for this reason, that we have a certain amount of paper produced here, and if a tax had been put on paper which is competing with the home-made article there would be sympathy with it.  I protested here before, and I protest now, against putting a revenue tax on the raw materials of certain industries. Amongst other things, paper is the raw material for manufacturing stationers.  We have got protective tariffs running as high as 75 per cent., and if we are going to go on increasing the cost of everything that a manufacturer has to deal with, we are going to find very soon that protective taxes of 75 per cent. are of no assistance to local manufacturers.  I have seen instances where a tax or a tariff as high as 50 per cent. was put on raw material.  It will not be very long until that will bring about its own Nemesis.  Take the case of a professional photographer who gets an order to execute some postcards. The postcards would be his raw material, and there is no manufacturer of sensitised paper in this country. He imports sensitised postcards from the Continent which bear the one word &ldquo;postcard,&rdquo; rendering them liable to a duty of 50 per cent. as stationery.  How can we go on imposing a tax of 50 per cent. on certain peoples' raw material, without affecting the amount of money that is spent in that industry, and the employment given by it?  Is it any wonder that a number of people in this country are wondering why it is that it seems as if we had a back door and a front door and that the Government were putting people into employment through the front door and, as a result of a great many of these tariffs not being properly used, that people are being disemployed through the back door as fast as they are being <Col N="1948" /> ushered into employment through the front door?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>This tax, I think, includes newsprint.  I should like to ask the Minister if he is aware that, as a result of the policy pursued by the Government for the last two or three years, many&mdash;I think I may say nearly all&mdash;of the newspapers and, particularly, the provincial newspapers, have suffered very material losses.  I have been told that some provincial newspapers with a small circulation have suffered a loss in valuable advertisements of anything from £5,000 upwards per year. Even the lower sum of £5,000 is a considerable matter to small concerns. A considerable amount of employment, and very well paid employment, is given by these provincial newspapers. It seems to me that the Minister, in his efforts to get revenue, has imposed these taxes without any regard to what the effects may be on employment in this country.  This is, of course, clearly a revenue tax.  It does not even purport to be a tax to give revenue to any industrial work. It is merely a revenue tax and is just adding another burden to an industry which has suffered very heavily owing to the actions of the Government in the last two or three years.  I know of one or two cases where they have just about managed to carry on with the same staff, in the hope that things might get better, but this impost will mean that they cannot carry on with the same staff.  If it means the dismissal of only one man on a small newspaper, that would be a very serious matter.  Unfortunately, we do not know what the Minister's hopes or views are in the matter.</P>

      <P>This appears to me to be one of the most unpleasant taxes, put on for purely revenue purposes, that we have had.  It seems to me that this shows a very considerable ignorance on the part of the Minister as to what is actually happening in this country at the present moment; or else it shows a very deliberate design on the part of the Minister to impede the cultural development of <Col N="1949" /> this country.  Everybody who knows anything about present conditions in Dublin knows that there are many people who have endeavoured from time to time to establish magazines here which would have a really literary and artistic value, and they have known how desperately hard it is to keep alive in Ireland any magazine with a good literary tone.  We know that one paper, which was noted for its extreme literary value, died from want of circulation a few years ago&mdash; want of circulation combined with a libel action the expense of which it could not stand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a magazine, <i>The Dublin Magazine,</i> which is of the highest literary quality but which, owing to its purely literary appeal, has a very limited circulation &mdash;so limited that, I daresay, it is unknown to my friend Deputy Smith, and to my friend Deputy Corry, because of its literary value.  I made that remark because I saw the Deputy looking around.  I apologise.  I forgot. Now, what the Minister wants to do is to make the production of high-class literary magazines more difficult than it is at the present moment, or to make the production of any paper that appeals to a small, if select, circulation, more difficult than it is at the present moment, because he will make the production of that class of paper much more expensive when he has put this particular tax upon its raw material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another angle from which I should like to approach this tax on paper.  There is a publishing industry in this country which many persons had hoped would develop.  A great number of persons, myself included, had hoped that it would develop, because there is a great deal of literary ability in Ireland and it had been hoped at one time that a publishing industry would ultimately develop <Col N="1950" /> considerably in this State.  That hope of a publishing industry in this State is being put back and possibly destroyed by the Minister's tax upon the raw material.  What chance has a Dublin publisher to compete against an English publisher if the Dublin publisher cannot turn out his book at the same cost of production as an English or American publisher?  We know that, at the present moment, books written by Irishmen, books with an enormous circulation, which might have been published in Dublin, are being published at the present moment by English and American publishing firms.  Evidently, it is in order to prevent Irish publishing firms from having a fair opportunity of competing with English publishing firms that the Minister is going to tie this mill-stone around their necks and say to them: &ldquo;You will have to pay duty on the paper which you import&mdash;the raw material of the books which you turn out&mdash;whereas your English rival, who is able to get Irish writers to publish through him, will be unduly helped by the attitude I am taking up.&rdquo;  I wonder if, even amongst his own supporters in Fianna Fáil, there is support for the attitude the Minister is taking up here.  I wonder whether this tax, which will have the effect of sending the literary output of Irish writers to the City of London rather than to the City of Dublin for publication, is a policy of which the Fianna Fáil Party entirely approve, or if all members of the Fianna Fáil Party entirely approve of it.  If some disapprove of it, I wonder if they disapprove to such an extent that their disapprobation will carry them, dumbly silent, into the lobby to vote against the Minister.  I do not ask them to take away the cold chain of silence which has been hanging over them so long.  I do not suggest that any single one of them should get up and attack this tax.  I do not ask them to do that.  After all, in a great moment of prophetic oratory, in a magnificent burst of sublime oratory, a Fianna Fáil Deputy once declared: &ldquo;Our Party are 77 dumb tombstones.&rdquo; I thought, at that time, that Deputy Beegan was a little <Col N="1951" /> extravagant in his imaginative oratory, but I see now that he was not extravagant, but only prophetic.  He knew that this discussion upon this Finance Bill would come on, and he knew that the tombstones would all be dumb, even if we have one smiling tombstone opposite.  It is a lovely thing to see a tombstone smiling.</P>

It is a tax like his other taxes which we had the other night, on prayer books and religious works, when he and his Party were endeavouring as far as they could to prevent the dissemination of religious knowledge in this country.  They cannot succeed; they can only make the effort.  In this particular tax they are endeavouring to prevent the spread of secular learning in this country also.  It seems to me that the effort of the Minister and of the Fianna Fáil Party generally is to lower the whole State to their own intellectual level, so that nobody in this State will be any better or any wiser than the Fianna Fáil Party.  If they succeed in that, God help the country.</P>

      <P>I am sorry I brought the Deputy into disorder.  The tax we are speaking about here is a tax on paper without any matter or design printed thereon.  I should have thought that the Minister for Finance would have preferred that, if the Fianna Fáil Party should read anything&mdash;which God forbid&mdash;they should read paper which has nothing printed on it.  After all, Sir, that is the raw material of all the silence we have had here for the last couple of days.  I cannot imagine the Minister, out of any feelings of humanity or sympathy for his back benchers, deciding that he would prohibit this particular type of paper.  However, there is no doubt about it that the questing mind is at work here again, whether the inquisitive mind of Deputy Corry, hunting into all the little kitchens, and deciding to tax everything, or whether that of somebody else with another view, I do not know.  Look at the philosophy behind this&mdash;get away from the foodstuffs&mdash;they are gone.  The ordinary houses and the things that go to equip those houses are gone.  The Minister is still totting up feverishly, and, after their foolish borrowing and everything else in this Budget, they have not got sufficient to make even a pretence of balancing the Budget.  Then the bright idea strikes somebody about breviaries and missals, and there is the bright idea, &ldquo;we are taxing secular reading; what about taxing non-secular reading?&rdquo; From that, there flows this idea of taxing paper that has nothing on it. It is a terrible thing to see paper that has nothing on it coming into the country!  So paper that has nothing on it, a little sheet of white paper, upon which each of us may write a little line or two&mdash;Deputy Corry even included&mdash;is not going to be allowed in. Education is bad for certain people, and so we will just have 6d. on it.</P>

We are to have 5 per cent. on paper that has nothing on it.  We are going to prevent the dissemination of news.  We do not want to appear too completely Boeotian. We do not want to appear thick-witted. We do not want to appear before the world as thick-witted people who do not want to see any print.  It is a scandalous thing not to want reading matter, and so we will get a whack at this just as we dipped into the sugar and tea, had a stab at the butter and the loaf, glassware, tumblers and everything else.  Last night we said we had put people into the position of not being able to remain in their homes through anxiety on account of the taxes that are walking around them.  You drive them out to the taxed pictures. Having driven them back from the taxed pictures, you will not even allow them to have their little bit of reading matter without a tax on it.  Paper comes from rags, and that Party has gone to rags.</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister if he will tell us how much money he expects to get by this tax, and the Minister is, apparently, prepared to tell us nothing but what is in the Schedule.  If any reliance can be placed upon the statisties recently published with regard to the imports of this particular class of paper into the country, the Minister expects to raise about £16,000 on paper brought in here for printing purposes.  Does the Minister think that he can take £16,000 out of the newspaper business and out of the publishing business in this country without its bringing about a reduction in the number of persons employed in the country?  Does he think that any review of overhead expenses, in the way in which both publishers and newspaper printers will have to review their overhead expenses, is likely to bring about economies to that extent in any other way than by a reduction in staff?  If the Minister knows anything about the matter he must realise that a reduction of staff will inevitably follow the imposition of this tax on paper used for printing. The tax that will be raised under the proposal will be considerably greater <Col N="1955" /> than that; there is a tax on paper other than printing paper.  I wonder has the Minister considered that there are in this country publishers and printers who are competing successfully with printers outside, and has he considered in what way those people are going to find themselves when they have to pay part of this additional tax on paper coming into the country.  Are those people going to be allowed any relief? Will they be repaid the taxation where duty has been paid on paper coming into the country, and books upon which printing has taken place are exported out of the country?  Will there be a rebate to such firms, and can the Minister assure us that the printers in this country who are competing successfully outside will not be prejudiced by bearing their particular share of this burden?  That might involve possible loss of employment, but perhaps the Minister can give us an assurance in that respect.  The principal thing that <Col N="1956" /> stands out is the fact that there is bound to be a reduction of staff in the printing trade, particularly in the printing of newspapers, if this tax is persisted in.  Are we going to get any information?</P>

      <P>In Part II, to delete reference No. 16, including relevant references in columns 2 and 3.</P>
      <P>As the Minister went along with his Budget statement we were able to check off one, two, three, four, five, six, down to 14 or 15 jokes.  We have now passed a fairly long litany of jokes put upon the House and taxes to be put upon various things that people entering new houses will have to pay. I do not know whether there is a sufficient number of jokes to have each of these jokes covered by a laugh.  I do not think there were sufficient laughs for the Minister's jokes which ran to 14 or 15.  It would require a big laugh to cover item 16, which reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Paper which has a design or pattern printed thereon, and is, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, primarily suitable for use as wallpaper.</P>
      <P>That paper is being taxed at 5 per cent.  A person leaving a tenement area in the City of Dublin comes to a new house or a new flat on which there has been a considerable subvention granted both by the rates and by the State.  That person is going to walk in and see the white walls of the new flat or the new house as if a notice was written on them saying: &ldquo;You cannot put wallpaper on these walls until you pay a tax to the Minister for Finance.&rdquo;  The people who are going to read these notices in future are the people who are most hit by the general circumstances that, in the first place, makes the Minister search every corner of their pockets to take money out of them to keep this Government going. In the second place, these are the class of people who are most hit by the kind of policy the Minister is pursuing.  In the matter of housing, and in relation to the people going into the new houses, we have described some of these taxes as brutal and some of them as mean.  I do not know how to describe the tax imposed by the Minister in this way except, as I say, by posting up a notice in the new houses to say: &ldquo;You cannot put wall-paper on these walls until you pay a tax to the Minister for Finance.&rdquo;  Will the Minister say how much money he intends to squeeze out of the pockets of these people before he is going to allow them to paper their new walls?</P>

      <P>The tax in this item is on &ldquo;paper which has a design or pattern printed thereon and is, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, primarily suited for use as wall-paper.&rdquo; How is this to prevent Fianna Fáil Deputies running around with this wall-paper, and trying to read it?  After all, are you prohibiting them getting blank stuff and making pot hooks and things like that on it?  Otherwise they might have this paper scattered around the country covered over with the economies they promised; or they might be driven to the further amusement of trying to work out cross-word puzzles with that wall-paper.  Deputy Mulcahy has <Col N="1959" /> opened up with a speculation about the walls of the new houses.  Perhaps they would be driven to write up on the walls &ldquo;Up the Republic.&rdquo;  I suppose reading these things on the walls would satisfy some of them.  I have no doubt &ldquo;Up the Republic&rdquo; would satisfy some of them even if they did not get it.  There are people who are in the future to go around in hair-shirts; these people will not want wall papers.  They will have amusement enough sitting on the floor trying to conceal their irritation with the garments to which they are not accustomed.  The irritation produced in that way would not tone in very well with the inspiration produced by the English wall-paper. Again, we might inquire and look around and ask what else is to be taxed?  Something that the people want.  That is a new way of searching for new taxes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Fianna Fáil has scrutinised the Estimates with minute care and they are satisfied that £2,000,000 can be saved without doing injury to any service.&rdquo;  Give us the £2,000,000 and then get wall-paper anywhere you like.  That is my alternative to Deputy Donnelly. There might be some other way of getting taxes on gold mining, but that is neither here nor there at the moment.  There is a desperate philosophy behind Deputy Donnelly's inquiry: &ldquo;What is the alternative?&rdquo; The philosophy of the ordinary community is different from that.  The <Col N="1960" /> ordinary Government says: &ldquo;We will tax luxuries; we will tax the things that the well-off people will buy.&rdquo;  But when you find that the people whom you think have money are not buying certain things and that ordinary revenue is falling, you have to get away from what used to be the strong back to the backs of the multitude. Of course, the more people you have buying certain things, the smaller the tax can be.  That gets down to the subsistence level, to the things that people must eat and drink and have about them; the ordinary items of a sort of primitive life&mdash;food, drink, and something in the way of shelter. Everybody must have these.  They are the things covered by the subsistence allowance in the income tax.  Their position is: &ldquo;We have given a subsistence allowance in the income tax; we have to break that down, but we do not like to say it; we will tax everything, even the man getting two or three pounds a week, and the way to do that is to tax the things on which a man will be spending the subsistence part of his income&mdash;bread, butter, sugar, etc.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder do you in the end.  The Deputy approves of that.  It is not the civilised theory. It is a theory that most Governments try to get away from.  The only Governments brought down to that are Governments that are on the rocks. Eventually, when a Government goes on the rocks the people go on the rocks.  Because if you do tax the subsistence level you are trying to wring money out of people who have not got it.  You are trying to stop them paying for the things they live on, and trying to make them pay into the Government instead.  That breaks down eventually.  The ordinary source of revenue that the community used to be able to support itself out of is gone.  Deputy Donnelly, apparently, has not merely accepted that, but has deluded himself into believing that this system of taxation is the ideal one&mdash;to get after the things the people <Col N="1961" /> must buy.  Undoubtedly, that is a certain way of getting taxation up to a point, but only up to a point.  It breaks down also.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are getting the money.  That is the point.  Surely the Deputy has some idea of the way taxation is apportioned.  Generally speaking, Governments who are in any way human try to apportion it against the people who are getting most, make them bear the brunt of the taxation.  You only move away from that when that source of revenue is gone.  Income tax is not yielding what it used to.  Ordinary excise duties are not yielding what they used to.  People have not money to spend. Therefore, you are going to dig down under the subsistence point, you are getting down to the bread and butter line, or below it; at any rate into it. I am glad the Deputy is trying to make up his mind.  I suppose it is the cheeriest thing to do in the circumstances&mdash;to say that it is the best thing and not make any apology; not to say, &ldquo;We would do something else, if it were there to be taxed&rdquo; but just, &ldquo;This is the way to get it.&rdquo; In connection with the tax on bread I said I did not know if history showed an example of a tax on this type of ordinarily used article.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is generally the other way about.  I consider wall paper to be one of the things ordinarily used.  I do not know whether Deputy Donnelly will put me out of order by denying that.  Nobody would ordinarily invite a person into a room which had not wall paper on the walls, unless you are going to have some mural decorations to adorn the bare walls.  I suppose if we all fly to that <Col N="1962" /> there will be a tax on home decoration, and you will not be allowed to draw pictures on the walls of your own residence.  At any rate, the Minister will get after it by taxing the wherewithal of the trade.  We have got to the point of taxing wall paper&mdash;a thing which is ordinarily used.  History does not hold any example of the taxation of things ordinarily used except in a period which has been shown to be a prelude to revolution, and revolution caused by the fact that the people have been battered down below the ordinary level of subsistence and there is nothing else to do except in despair to kick over the traces.  I do not know whether Deputy Donnelly will regard that as a sign; whether he thinks the old theories of taxation are wrong and that this new one should be accepted.</P>
      <P>It is simply a case of what Deputy Donnelly says, &ldquo;We are going to get the money.&rdquo;  We have flying squads belting into the kitchen, grabbing the stuff on the walls, the things on the table and the things on the dresser; the foodstuffs and the things around the people.  Everything that goes to raise life from the primitive a little bit, that is what we are going to tax, because that is what the people have to get.  But the end is in sight. It is the same as if the Government were forced to bring in an income tax on incomes say of £50, as was done in some countries.  But it was only done in countries where they were in desperation.  Some countries in the post-war period, suffering from inflation, as a last resort decided to have direct taxation on incomes even of £1 per week, or at any rate £2 per week.  If we decided to do that the people would have no difficulty in recognising it as a sign of, &ldquo;All hands to the pumps.&rdquo;  Instead of that they take 10 per cent. here and 5 per cent. somewhere else, in the hope that the people will forget.  But the cumulative effect of these will lead in the end to a break down by its own weight and we will be in a worse condition in a year than we are in now.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Donnelly has gone back to his school days.  I think that he sat there just considering the days in which, I hope not too painfully, he was compelled to read the Satires of Horace. He might remember, and evidently does remember, the advice which a bad father gave to his son: Make money; make it honestly if you can, but make money.  That is precisely the philosophy of Deputy Donnelly and the whole Fianna Fáil Party.  Of course, we do not get it in the continuous spoken word, but we get it in the interjections from the courageous men who venture to interject: &ldquo;Let us tax anyway we like provided we get the money; let it be a just tax or an unjust tax.&rdquo;  Justice or injustice has nothing to do with the Fianna Fáil system of taxation.</P>

      <P>I thought I was relevant the whole time because I submitted this was an unjust tax.  The policy of taking money, wherever you can get it, is the policy of the Government. It is a policy of taking it wherever you can get it by just means or unjust means.  What is a just tax? It is a tax which does not weigh with undue harshness on any member of the community.  An unjust tax is one which weighs with undue harshness upon a class of the community which is <Col N="1964" /> least able to bear it.  The Government has no right, not merely to impose a tax which weighs with undue harshness upon a section of the community; but it is an immoral action on the part of the Government to impose such a tax. I venture to say that when a tax is in itself obviously, and palpably, unjust it is a matter which must affect the consciences of persons, whether Ministers or otherwise, who introduce unjust taxation or whether members of the Party who vote for it.  I say it is a matter of conscience, and they are bound in conscience to make restitution for the amount they raised in unjust taxation.</P>
      <P>These are plain, simply unanswerable doctrines of Christian ethics.  This is not a doctrine which anybody with elementary knowledge of Christian ethics, or of the doctrine of the Catholic Church, could for one moment venture to contradict.</P>

      <P>This tax is one of the series of taxes that press upon the poorer members of the community and is obviously and patently a tax which is unjust.  It is a tax which presses unduly upon the very poor.  Everybody is entitled to live in reasonable comfort with the little luxury that their particular state in life provides for them.  Every person, whether labouring man or woman, in Dublin or in Cork, or whether agricultural labourer or small farmer, in our country districts is entitled, as of right, to the ordinary means of subsistence and the ordinary decencies of life. These people are entitled to a home which in itself will be pleasant to them and into which they can introduce their friends and visitors.  You cannot take a tax like this, segregate it, and say there is to be an extra tax on wall paper and on nothing else.  You must take the Budget as a whole.  And every particular little straw that you put on is coming nearer and nearer to the fatal straw that will break the camel's back in the shape of the Irish people.  This is a tax which will not hit people who are well off to the same extent as it <Col N="1965" /> will the working classes.  That is patent.  But wallpaper is a necessity to one as to the other.  You may talk about it from a high æsthetic point of view.  Some people may distemper their walls in order that their pictures may be shown off, but the ordinary person with one living-room wants to keep it dry and well-papered, not merely from the artistic sense, but also because he likes his room comfortable and warm.  I leave it to the sense of the House, if there is any sense of right in Deputies opposite, and I leave it to the sense of justice of the House, if there is any sense of justice in Deputies opposite, as to whether an accumulated system of taxation of this nature is a just system for the Government to adopt in order to get money. Their policy seems to be to get the money by fair means or by foul, by fair taxes or foul taxes.  If that policy is to receive the approbation of the Party opposite I am sorry for the state of consciousness that obtains in that Party.</P>

      <P>After the Minister has taxed every raw material used in the construction of a house, he follows it up when that house has changed hands. <Col N="1966" /> Generally, when a new house changes hands, the walls are bare.  The Minister, presumably, knew that a woman's taste will not put up with bare walls.  She must have them decorated at any cost and, in her enthusiasm in going into a new house she does not mind spending a little more money on it.  The Minister, therefore, thought he would put a little more on. I wonder is there any pretence at helping an Irish industry in this?  Deputy Dockrell might, perhaps, enlighten the House&mdash;he is a more reliable source of information than the Front Bench&mdash;as to whether there is any wallpaper made in this country, or is it likely to be a business proposition, in the near or distant future, to manufacture wall-paper here in view of the limited market and the numerous designs of wall-paper there must be.  I fancy this is purely a revenue tax and nothing else, just like all the taxes on raw materials used in the construction of houses, and I hope that when the Minister boasts again of all he has done, is doing and will do, for house-building, he will couple with that all he has done, is doing, and will do to soak the people who build houses, buy new houses, or repair old houses, by way of taxation.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Second Schedule be the Second Schedule to the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister emphasised with a certain amount of heat that there was no licensing provision that would enable paper to be brought in without the payment of this tariff of 5 per cent.  I would ask him whether that statement refers to the whole of the 17 various items that are covered here and if so, has he given any special consideration to reference No. 1, in respect to asphalt and bitumen, and reference No. 5 with regard to starch?  Are we to understand that local authorities, in connection with their work on road making, are not to be allowed to import asphalt and bitumen free of this tax and that, therefore, the tax will fall as an additional burden on the rates throughout the country?  In the case of reference No. 5, I should like to know if he has given any consideration to the position of the linen industry in the country and if he has taken into consideration the amount of tax on the linen industry that this duty of 3/- per cwt. on starch involves, if the persons who are conducting the linen industry are not going to be allowed to import starch free of duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>If reference No. 5 relating to starch, has any bearing on the starch factory that is being established, we should like to know it.  We are not told if it is a protective duty. If so, it would be interesting and understandable.  Some of us would now like to know if there is likely to be any outlet, as a compensation for this tax, for the rapidly accumulating quantities of small potatoes we have or has all this talk of our starch factory been no more than a prelude to a tariff on imported starch?  Of course the tax on bitumen and tar of 3d. per cwt., as the previous speaker pointed out, is fairly substantial.  It is the thin edge of the wedge and is adopting a very bad principle, the principle of taxing something we want and that is produced here only in very limited quantities.  All the trunk roads of the country and the link roads&mdash;in fact every road except the very small by-roads&mdash;are now being tarred and this is a serious consideration for local authorities.  It seems to me that such taxes will gradually bring back to the Exchequer the grants that are being given by the Exchequer and which, it was claimed, have been so generously given by the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fail to understand also why there should be a tax of 1d. per lb. on grapes.  Is that going to be a national crop in this country?  Grapes are used in hospitals very largely for invalids.  Many healthy people also like grapes but I presume there will be no discrimination as to the people who use them.  They are a delicacy used largely by invalids.  Very often they are recommended for use by invalids when no other solid food can be recommended.  Still 1d. per lb. is going to be put on them.  I am not aware of any discrimination as to the value of the grapes.  Sometimes grapes are sold at 4d. or 5d. per lb. and the import wholesale price of such grapes must be very small when they can be <Col N="1969" /> retailed at that price.  1d. per lb. on such grapes is a very large tariff, especially when we consider that we cannot produce this tariffed product here except more or less as a luxury product in glasshouses.  They are certainly never going to be a commercial product in this country.  I suppose like all the other commodities that have been taxed they are taxed for revenue purposes and nothing else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what principle has been followed in the division of these tariffed commodities into the different Schedules, but I think that this is a Schedule that we can describe as the house Schedule.  I do not say that taxes in other Schedules do not fall on houses as well but the variety of taxes embraced in this Schedule are chiefly aimed against houses, against the people in their homes, against the adornment of their homes, against articles that they will have to purchase for simple adornment and practical use.  There are, outside these, one or two matters that have been referred to.  Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Belton pointed out that the tax on asphalt and bitumen will mean that the Government are going to get something back out of the grants which they have given to local authorities.  Similarly, that portion of the Schedule embracing what I call house taxes, will enable you to withdraw what has been given in the way of subsidy, the subsidy, of course, to be paid eventually by the ratepayer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

      <P>I have often heard of a dog being fed on its own tail but I never saw a Minister for Finance trying to pull more tail out of the dog in order to give it more feeding stuff. That is what this comes to.  It is a ghastly picture.  That is what is happening.  It is only when one goes through a schedule of this kind, sees the variety of articles that are covered by it, and tries to find the mentality behind it, that the realisation dawns upon one of how completely down at <Col N="1970" /> heel the Ministry are.  Just now there was a reference to the tax on grapes. I suppose the one place where one sees grapes most frequently is the sick room, the invalid's room.  They are regarded as a luxury by some people, but they are not a luxury that most people enjoy.  They are a sort of ordinary accompaniment for the sick bedside, the invalid's table.  We are going to get our 1d. per lb. off them&mdash; 1d. per lb. off the invalid's bedside table.  That is what the Minister does.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says &ldquo;Most moving.&rdquo;  It is not anything like so full of crocodile tears as the Minister would have bedewed his speech, if he were in opposition.  The fact of the matter is that the Minister has been driven to silence.  There is not a Deputy of his Party who can stand over any of these taxes.  Not even one of them can tell us why it was necessary to delve into the household in the way in which he has done. Are the other taxes so really badly exhausted as to make it necessary to have a grab at the bedside grapes? I do not call that moving at all.  I think it is a degrading business&mdash;1d. a lb.  I do not suppose a national budget was ever so completely composed of scrounging as this.  There is the example of the poor man who had to live on the crumbs that dropped from the rich man's table, but here the community is reduced to the position of being asked to give social services on the scrapings of the invalid's room. It is no wonder that a discreet silence is much the best thing.  The only justification for that was the justification given by Deputy Donnelly and Deputy Corry&mdash;sheer, acute necessity, the fact that we want money despite all that was promised about more and more money.  Why should it ever stop flowing?  The economies have not come off.  They are, therefore, driven to tax these things.  Grapes is an item that is full of woe.  It is a small <Col N="1971" /> thing.  It is not going to bring in very much in the way of taxation.  It just shows how wide the net is being flung and how desperate the need is of the people who flung it so widely.  It is a big thing because it hits socially and, as such, is a retrograde thing.</P>
      <P>In connection with housing, the Government are now trying to fill up the gap created by their own activities previously.  They say that they are going to give subsidies, but they are going to get some part of the subsidy back.  They are spreading the net in such a way that they hope that their activities in that connection will not be noticed.  Sometimes there is a certain amount of admiration in the world for the big thief, the gigantic embezzler, the man who indulges in company promotion and wrecks thousands of homes.  But for the man who robs a sacristy or takes money out of the blind man's tin, there is nothing but contempt, and it is appalling to think that the Government of a country should be reduced to that level of meanness.</P>

      <P>It is a pity that the Minister should have left it to Deputy Donnelly to make the admission that the idea underlying these taxes is to get money, to scrape it in any way he can.  Of course, that might be all right for a footpad or a burglar, but one would expect that a national Budget would be framed on better principles and with greater consideration for the sources from which money is got and the sufferings that these impositions are going to cause the very poor.  The plea has not even been put forward that this money is to be used as a protective tax for industry.  In connection with starch, at the moment we have no starch factory in the country.  Not many years ago we had a couple.  It <Col N="1972" /> has been stated that it is proposed to start a factory here soon.  The raw material for starch is rice, so that if this factory is ever established there will be a tax of 2/- per cwt. on the raw material required for it.  Rice is also an important article of food.  Starch is also used largely in other manufacturing industries, in the linen industry, for instance.  Rice flour is used largely in the bakery trade.  The tax on rice is, therefore, going to add further to the cost of the production of bread. The tax on wallpaper has been referred to.  It will hit the poorer classes of the community very severely.  They use wallpaper to a much greater extent than the better off people.  I know myself that the little cottiers down by the seaboard paper their houses very often.</P>

      <P>I desire to elucidate the position relative to this schedule.  If Deputies look at page 1 of the Bill, they will observe that Sections 10 and 11 refer to the imposition of duties in the First Schedule and Second Schedule respectively. These duties are not there specified. Consequently a detailed discussion of these two schedules was quite in order; more particularly owing to the fact that numerous amendments were tabled.  If Deputies now turn to Section 12, it will be observed that Section 12 deals specifically with the alteration of the various duties on sugar.  The House has decided that Section 12 should stand.  Section 12 sets out that the duties shall be as <Col N="1975" /> prescribed in Schedule 3.  The House has, therefore, decided and in some detail the principle of Schedule 3. The House cannot now canvass that decision without stultifying itself. Therefore, no discussion of the principle arrived at on Section 12 could now arise unless by way of amendment. No amendment has been tabled.  That is the position.</P>

The Minister for Industry and Commerce would not have anything to do with that. The sugar question was debated before when different rates were attached. Certainly, in my experience, it is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners to put up a recommendation, which went to the Minister for Finance, and then the Minister for Industry and Commerce was asked about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the drawbacks, there is a matter of some importance that I wish to refer to.  I presume we are dealing with the whole Schedule.  Section B deals with the drawback on sugar and molasses in bonded warehouses and which were made exclusively in Saorstát Eireann. <Col N="1977" /> If sugar is made from beet, with the bounty, it is much more expensive than imported sugar.  It is obvious when imported sugar can be bought for something under £6 a ton, while sugar made here costs £21, that an undue charge will be made in respect of imported sugar for use as ships' stores.  It is particularly desirable that we should have an arrangement to get as much goods as possible for that purpose bought in this country. The drawback in that case should amount to the export duty charged upon sugar.  No loss will be occasioned the Revenue if such an allowance was made.  In connection with the sugar problem it could be arranged that at a particular time, when sugar is available from the beet factories, and when supplies of imported sugar are stopped that the transfer of the sale from one to the other would be immaterial.  The point to be noted is that the goods should be bought in this country for ships' stores.  At first sight it would seem as if there would be a loss by giving the full Customs duty, rather than the Excise duty, but in practice no loss whatever would occur.  It simply means a transfer from imported sugar in bulk to sugar made here.  In other words if the Customs duty were allowed, no loss is sustained.  We consume all the sugar manufactured here, and whatever sugar is imported comes in at a smaller price.  The duty would be charged on that.  If the full Customs duty was allowed, that would ensure that purchases would be made here. Purchases in respect of vessels trading from here, as anyone who has been on these vessels knows, are of some importance.  It is particularly desirable that ships' stores should be purchased here as largely as possible.  If it is known that when ships require sugar, and none is available but sugar made from the beet grown here, if imported sugar was available there would be no loss in doing what I suggest.  There will be a gain if they can be persuaded that they will not have to pay £15 as against £6 a ton. There will be a gain to general business as well as in the sale of ships' stores generally.  If a bias is likely <Col N="1978" /> to arise against purchasing goods at Irish ports then we may lose a great deal more than these regulations would gain.</P>

      <P>More than often I have kept the Minister for Finance in his place by keeping after him on account of his bad manners.  At any rate, if the Minister for Education is rather tired of this, I suggest that he should return to the slumber from which he has been, rather unaccountably and, apparently, too early, aroused.  In any case, his Department is not under consideration at the moment and he has slumbered on that so long that he might as well continue to slumber on it.  With regard to the relevant matters in this schedule, Deputy Mulcahy has asserted here on many occasions&mdash;and has got no intelligent reply denying the facts&mdash;that since 1934 there is a sum of £980,000 to be collected from sugar.  With regard to that sum of £980,000, I want to know how much of it will come from sugar under the different polarisations, from molasses, glucose, and saccharine.  Surely, the Minister ought to be able to reply to that without exciting the annoyance of his colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is &ldquo;None,&rdquo; because it is all coming from the purchaser.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the answer. It is the consumer who will pay, and that is why all this parade of customs duties is so much nonsense, because, in fact, these customs duties, as far as sugar is concerned, are only a farce, since the situation is&mdash;and the Minister knows it well&mdash;that the way the consumer is going to be fleeced in this matter is a simple enough performance. When there is no competition, the factories or the company can charge what they please, and polarisations and polariscopes are all nonsense, and all this long business, which we are told is founded upon some basic figure, is not worth wasting <Col N="1981" /> the paper over which the printing extends, because, in the end, the whole thing relates to taxation of the consumer, on what is a vital necessity, because of the price he will be charged; and that price will be whatever the company decides to make it since there is no competition.  I have referred previously to the pennies in the blind man's box.  The Minister for Finance used that phrase himself previously in relation to a duty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I sometimes follow a simple lead.  When the Simple Simon of the Party was talking on the occasion to which I have <Col N="1982" /> referred, he said that it was like dropping a penny into a blind man's tin in order to make it rattle.  The circumstance in which that remark was made was where some benefit was being given to the farming community and it was being taken from another source.  In fact, it was in relation to old age pensions.  Think of what is happening now.  We have now a drop in old age pensions and a tax on practically every necessity of life.  If the other was a case of dropping a penny in the tin in order to make it rattle, this is giving the tin a kick, not to make it rattle, but to knock the coppers out.</P>

      <P>It would save a lot of time if the Minister would listen to my point, which will not entail a long speech.  When we passed the section with reference to this Schedule we understood that what we were doing was protecting home industries. By means of a tariff on other fruit, and a preference to oranges, particularly Spanish oranges, we understood that we were helping the farmers and fruit growers.  We are told to-day that you should not let anyone sell you a Spanish orange.</P>

      <P>There will be.  But I am not on oranges at the moment; I am not dieting.  I want to ask a few questions and I will direct them to the second dome of silence who has crept into the House.  Why are plums, which include damsons, prunes and greengages, <Col N="1986" /> to be taxed at 2d. per lb. between certain dates and only 1d. per lb. on other dates?  Do plums always include damsons, prunes and greengages, or is it only in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners that damsons, prunes and greengages are plums? Are we not going to allow anything off for prunes, because they have a certain elocutionary effect when joined with prisms, or will that only be in the season when the 1d. per lb. is on, so that people who are dumb ordinarily will get the use of these articles to enable them to be more vocal and perhaps more intelligible?</P>
      <P>I do not know why the delectable cherry should be picked out for the terrible slap of 3d. per lb. when damsons, prunes and greengages are charged only 2d. and, in their best season, go as low as 1d.  The same thing will apply to raspberries.  Raspberries, I observe, are to include loganberries. It might have saved paper and probably would have been quite as intelligible if cherries, strawberries, raspberries, loganberries and gooseberries were put together instead of being placed in different categories. Is there any real discrimination relating to the dates upon which these particular fruits mature, or is there any particular discrimination based on the time when a competitive article here would come on the market, or is it just again Deputy Donnelly's idea that we want the stuff and here are the goods that will give it to us?  Oranges are not on this, and oranges, I think, should be counted.  My main appreciation of oranges is derived from attending football matches, and certainly there one would gather that they are the fruit of the democracy.  Yet, we will not tax them.  We give people something they can apparently wash their faces with instead of eating.  It is a sort of dry pulp at this time of the year and it is given as a&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a solace; it is an irritation.  You get people at football matches in the autumn and oranges will be hawked around amongst <Col N="1987" /> them and they will be sold, these Spanish dried-up skins with really no juice, or the matter that the people like, inside them.  There is not a word of explanation given to us about the Schedule.  We are not told what is aimed at, how the taxes have been selected, how even the fruits for the taxes have been selected.  We are just presented with this on the take-it-or-leave-it principle.  Deputy Donnelly's idea is that you cannot leave it, so that you have to take it.  It is all getting at what the people enjoy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Crab apples would certainly be the sort of thing to attract the present Minister for Finance, because it is the fruit young people enjoy and generally get free.  Crab apples may not be very good for them. The whole idea of the Budget is to get down as far as you can to what the people commonly use.  The Minister has got after those things and imposed harsh taxes.  We have an example here again in fruit.  All the time we have to leave out the special item of oranges because of our glorious arrangement with Spain.  The Spanish Treaty is, apparently, going to rank with the Belgian and German Treaties, and even the Coal-Cattle Pact is going <Col N="1988" /> hard to be on the top line&mdash;and mind you, it is a hot class when you think of the Coal-Cattle Pact, for rottenness.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask if there is any discrimination in connection with these duties on the raw fruit as to what countries they are brought from.  In regard to some fruits that we are not permitted to mention, I understand, in view of the ruling of the Chair, it occurs to me that the same situation might arise as has arisen in relation to other fruits, namely, that we might allot certain portions of the year to certain fruits and, having split up the year amongst certain countries, we might then find that a war had broken out in the fruit trade and we would be compelled to buy from each of the combatants in turn fruit at the highest prices, and we might not be able to take advantage of what I might call the world war which might be going on in the fruit trade.  I would like to urge upon the Minister not to tie his hands in any way in connection with the fruits that are scheduled here, and to take warning from what has occurred in other sections of the fruit trade, namely, that we may be delivered over to each of the combatants in turn to be charged the highest market prices instead of the world price.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear from what you said that, as we are at this moment, an amendment can be introduced on the Report Stage for increasing or decreasing.  The Minister tells us now, as a sort of third removed answer to what Deputy Mulcahy asked, that he has already given full indication to the House.  That bright moment in which he gave full indication of anything to the House should be remembered.  The Minister also makes the excuse when asked about the amount of extra money to be derived from the people through this, that that should have been asked on the section.  I suggest that that should have been mentioned by the Minister as an appropriate matter on the section. Again, we have this peculiar viewpoint, that what the Minister has to do is to come in here slapping on tariffs, duties and taxes, and not even saying what the aim is, in the sense of protection or benefit to the community, or what the effect is.  The Minister apparently thinks that all these matters should have been got out of him by the laborious process of parliamentary question or that he is entitled to sing dumb until he is asked.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>All the information that has been asked for from me on this stage of the Bill was given in my <Col N="1992" /> Budget statement and is available to any Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Minister has begun to recognise a point of order when he sees one.  But I suggest that that type of thing never was a point of order.  It is not either cute or anything else to deal with this matter in this way.  There is this very vital matter of the tax upon tobacco, which has come to be regarded by economists as a sort of necessity in certain walks of life, and the Minister simply sits here and will not indicate what he means by it.  The Minister I know did tell us generally in his Budget speech that he was driven to desperation and simply had to get money.  This is Deputy Donnelly's advice again.  Here was something the people were going to use and to continue using and he would get a bit extra.  As he is not putting it on bread, we ought, I suppose, to feel some way relieved.  The Minister, at any rate, did interfere with the tobacco business early, with disastrous results.  He is now interfering later, with still more disastrous results, and the intelligent Deputies in the background are asked to vote on this without knowing what the impact of it means.</P>

      <P>The duty upon rubber boots and plimsolls was imposed in order to discourage their importation. They were coming in in huge quantities in 1932-33, to the detriment of our existing boot industry, and the duty was imposed to discourage that importation. They are also subject to quota restriction, and the quota restriction is in operation at the present time.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister give us any information as to what is likely to be the difference in price between boots manufactured here, when they are manufactured here, and the imported article?  This tax amounts, if I mistake not, to 2/- per boot on a boot the overall length of which is nine inches.  As a rule, I think taxation imposed on boots and shoes is imposed on the pair and that represents 4/- in this case.  Surely it is not likely that that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>May I interrupt the Deputy?  A corresponding duty of exactly the same amount was imposed in Great Britain in 1933 in order to keep out the Japanese footwear which was coming in to Great Britain in large quantities at that time.  It was feared, and rightly feared, that a large consignment of boots and shoes, which had been printed in England, with English lettering and descriptions on the boxes and intended for the British market, would be diverted into this country and, in fact, a considerable <Col N="1995" /> quantity was so diverted, before we imposed a duty corresponding to the British duty.</P>

      <P>This tax of 2/- per boot or 4/- per pair will probably operate similarly to the 6d. tax we had last night on the other alleged Japanese products coming in here.  In that case the Minister had a choice of 50 per cent., or 3d. or 6d., as the case might be.  Here it is a mere lump sum. Has he any indication of what that comes to on an average rubber boot coming, not from Japan, but from England? Last night we got a figure of 2/- per dozen in the case of knives, and 50 per cent. on that, from the Minister's point of view, would be no use.  Therefore, he adopted, in that particular case, the full tax of 1/- to get over that particular very low product.  At the same time he had the 50 per cent. What does this 4/- a pair amount to?</P>

The individual who is taxed in that way, and who cannot pay the tax flies to a substitute, and then you tax the substitute, and the one person who does not count in it all is the consumer.  If we had tariffs debated here in any sort of decent economic philosophy, we would be told what is the amount of employment given; what is the increased purchasing power that is going to be scattered through the community, through the employment of workers in the manufacture of these goods, so that we could see what is the lift of the burden from the shoulders of the community, in return for the burden that is being put upon them by making them buy things at a higher price than they used to pay.</P>

      <P>It strikes me at any rate that we have a new tax here on rubber boots and to a certain extent on other boots.  While we are making these boots here, I am not sure that we are making the finer quality boots to any extent and these will be dearer for many people.  At the moment we are paying duty on uppers made of leather or skin to the extent of 30 per cent. of the value of the article.  At the same time we are sending skins out of the country for nothing and paying a bounty to get them out. Possibly the fact is that we are paying a duty on these skins when we get them back in the shape of uppers for boots.  That is a policy, of which those of us engaged in the agricultural industry are rather suspicious because the raw material for some of these boots is being exported&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Even though the Minister said that the additional cost of these rubber boots will be small, no matter what amount it is, those who are engaged in agriculture will certainly object to it and vote against it.  I do not care if it is only a penny per boot.  Our capacity to buy any kind of boots has been limited tremendously and this is not the time to add to the cost of boots or shoes.  I hope the Deputies will vote against this Schedule.  I am not prepared to stand for an increase of even a penny or twopence on boots, not to mention 6d. per boot.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made what is to my mind a bit of a startling admission in perhaps one of his unguarded moments.  What I gathered from the Minister was this: there has been a fall in world prices. The producer in this country, especially the agricultural producer, feels the effect of the fall in world prices as far as it affects the products which he himself is selling, but when it comes to a question of buying manufactured articles the Minister says: &ldquo;Oh you have no right to complain; it is true that the price of what you are selling is falling but I shall take right good care that you do not get any advantage that comes from a falling market in the things you are going to buy.&rdquo; That seems to me to be a most unjust <Col N="2001" /> way of looking at the matter.  The Minister takes one particular year, any year he likes, and he is going to keep the price that prevailed in that year in his mind for all his period of office.  The result will be that he will maintain by tariffs a price which has become artificial, and he will say: &ldquo;In the year 1932 you were paying just as much for it.  It is true that if you went out of this country you could buy it 50 per cent. less, but you are not going to buy boots or any other article in this country cheaper than they were in 1932.&rdquo;  I am glad that the Minister has made that perfectly plain to us. I am glad that the people may know that while they may suffer from falling markets, in anything they may have to sell, the unfortunate producers will not be able to get any advantage from that falling market in the commodities that they have to purchase.</P>
      <P>Another remark which the Minister made also struck me as rather strange. So far as I understood the Minister, speaking previously on the production of boots generally, I understood him to say that there was one part of the trade in which the boot producers of this country were able to meet their rivals on equal terms and that was the manufacture of heavy boots, especially farm boots.  Unless I have misunderstood many speeches made by the Minister that was his point of view, but to-day he tells us that the home market for strong boots has become too high priced for the agricultural community to continue to buy leather-soled boots.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>If so, what does the Minister mean by telling us that the rubber soled boots have driven the leather boots out of the market. That is what I understood the Minister to say.  I cannot understand the Minister's present position.  If heavy boots are being driven out of the market, why are more of them being sold than ever before?  It is very difficult to reconcile two completely opposite points of view, and it seems to me that is what the Minister is asking <Col N="2002" /> the House to do.  Without coming to our assistance, he is setting us an extraordinary task, namely, to make two absolutely irreconcilable things reconcilable. If his earlier statement, as distinguished from his later statement, is to be taken as correct, and if heavy boots are being driven out of the market by rubber soled boots, then that must be due, if I am to accept anything that he has said as being accurate, to the fact that the purchasing power of the farming community has fallen to such an extent that they are unable to buy the better class article.  Everyone knows that for the farming community the leather soled boot is ever so much a better article than the rubber soled boot.  Anyone who has ever walked through a grass field, or who has played golf, knows well the advantage of the leather soled boot compared to the other.  We all know how difficult it is to walk in the streets of Dublin on a muddy day in a crepe soled shoe.  Of what use would a rubber soled boot be to a ploughman or a man digging with a spade?  Of course, he would not wear such a boot if it was possible for him at all to get a leather soled boot.  I would like very much if the Minister would enlighten my ignorance.  I am always anxious to hear the words of wisdom and of illumination that fall from him.  Will he tell the House why the very best article that the Irish boot manufacturer can produce is being driven out of the market by a second rate article?</P>

      <P>I invite the Deputies opposite to vote against the Schedule, and I will be very disappointed if they do not.  I notice that they forget it very quickly whenever they take action of that kind, because, whenever there is an official opening of a boot factory, they are all there on the band wagon leading the procession, indicating their joy at the new development. When the two new boot factories are opened in Kerry, I am certain that Deputy O'Sullivan will be there just as Deputy Cosgrave will be at the opening of the new factory in Cork. They will be all there on the band wagon beating the drum.</P>

      <P>The Minister, I think, did indicate that the real alteration in this tax relates entirely to children's boots and shoes.  On that basis I ask the House to reject the Schedule.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney talked about heavy farmer's boots, heavy Government Front Benchers' boots, shoes for playing golf and all the rest.  The point that I want to emphasise is that this tax will punish most those who have to dress their children in canvas shoes and rubber boots which can be cheaply got at present.  These are the people who are being taxed, and not the man behind the plough or the spade, or the gentleman playing golf. At present, as I have said, these canvas shoes and rubber boots can be got cheaply.  The Minister tells us that they will not be produced in this country until October and even then, he says, he cannot guarantee that they will be available at a price equal to that at which they can be obtained at present.  It is the poor who are being hit by this tax, and particularly the poor who live in the towns and cities. Even country children will not suffer so much as these city children, because the country children develop hard skins&mdash;like Ministers&mdash;on their feet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that the passing of Section 22 has no reference whatever to the Schedule.  Quite a number of these taxes in the Schedules come under one of two, or both of two, headings.  A tariff is either intended to help in the manufacture of goods here or as a means of getting in revenue.  It was stated here to-day&mdash;I was not here at the time&mdash;that in one case it was partly one and partly the other.  That is reminiscent of a question put in the police courts on one occasion by the magistrate: &ldquo;Was the man drunk?&rdquo;  The answer was: &ldquo;Partly, your worship.&rdquo;&ldquo;What part of him?&rdquo;  asked the magistrate.  In this case, we have elicited from the Minister that these goods are to be manufactured in this country.  I am prepared to accept that.  I am prepared further to say that, from my experience of the firm mentioned, the goods will be well made.  They are in a position to compete with any firm in England.  What I am not satisfied about is that, during the period that will elapse between now and the time of manufacture in this country, the people should be saddled with a price beyond the needs of the moment.  A tax of 2/- per boot is not required in this case.  The Minister's own statement is that what would be required would be the difference of cost in manufacturing for 45,000,000 people and manufacturing for 3,000,000 people. That is not 2/- per boot.  This is an <Col N="2008" /> unreasonable tax because it falls more heavily on the section of the community less able to bear it than on the other section of the community.</P>
      <P>The Minister was rather unfortunate in his remarks about attending the opening of factories.  I do not know if anybody has attended these functions as often as the Minister.  During our period of office, the expansion of industrial employment was probably 20 times what it has been in the Minister's period and he has probably attended 20 times as many functions as I attended.  If he wants figures as to that matter, he will find them in the statistical return.  That continuous employment, which was particularly noticeable from 1927 to 1931 or 1932, was possible by reason of the care taken in the imposition of tariffs.  This particular imposition is unreasonable.  It is more than a tariff; it is a tax. While the Dáil may have committed itself to accepting some proposals in respect of this matter, the Dáil has not committed itself yet to this imposition of 2/- per boot.  It is a sum beyond the need and beyond what is necessary to give the factory its opportunity.  I know more about the factory and its history than the Minister does.  I was using their products before the Minister was born and I found them satisfactory. There has been an improvement in quality during the past few years far beyond anything the users ever contemplated.  Their tyres run two or three times the length of time they used to run a few years ago. That is not a character they require from me.  Their goods provide it in their quality.  If that factory undertakes the work this tariff is unnecessary. If it is imposed before they undertake manufacture here, it will place an undue burden on the people and, therefore, I oppose it.</P>

      <P>On the question whether the House ought to accept this Schedule or not, the Minister has given one sufficient reason against it.  I want the Minister the next time he goes on the band wagon to one of these factories and makes a speech, to say. &ldquo;I will not congratulate you on the magnificent work you have done.&rdquo;  Here is the test.  There was a time when the people wore an agricultural boot for which they were charged certain prices. The people are drifting away from the heavy soled leather boot to the unsuitable article with a rubber sole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not a rubber sole; it was all rubber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is much more unsuitable for digging with a spade, and is very unhealthy.  The Minister ought to state, the next time he is on the band wagon&mdash;and it is the greatest criterion of the work of these factories &mdash;that there was a period in which the people went away from the agricultural boot to which they were accustomed, which the factories here produced and in which there ought to be a good trade, because it was the heavy end of the trade.  There was then no question of wearing boots with finer uppers. The Minister could say: &ldquo;That is the criterion on which I award the palm but, in some way, you drove the people away from using an agricultural boot to the unhealthy rubber boot.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly not.  That is the situation here, with protection, machinery, equipment, and with the tradition of the boot factories that developed mainly with the agricultural boot.  All the Minister can say is that they broke away from that.  I suggest that the question of very much cheaper rubber boots would not be weighed in the balance if the people got the old type of leather agricultural boot at the old price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They were getting them much cheaper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2011" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the Minister says, that in fact agriculturists have been offered these boots cheaper than ever.  They were accustomed to those boots and valued them, yet they went to rubber boots and we have to put 2/- a boot on them to keep them out.  I would not like to be the manufacturer who would have that said to me in an after lunch oration by the Minister.  I would not like to have to listen to that type of phrase. At any rate, the Minister has shown the standard price in certain years. Arising out of boots and shoes, can the Minister take this as a test?  The next time there are industrial exhibits in the Industrial Hall he might ask people who make a display there to put above their boots the tariffs they are now enjoying, the number of workers employed before the tariffs went on, and the number now employed, with the increased purchasing power. Say that wages came to £25,000 or £3,000,000 or £4,000,000, that would give the populace something by which they could judge whether the tariff is good or not.  They could look on the prices they are being charged and they could see the wages paid now, with the tariff, to let them get a grip of the industry.  Until you get that <Col N="2012" /> you do not know any proper standard. The increased wages would be a criterion.  This ought to be voted against, from the angle of the introduction of the duty, especially as it is no answer to critics to say that the tax has been on already.  Most of these taxes were rushed as emergency imposition duties.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 47, standing in Deputy Mulcahy's name:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In Part I, to delete reference No. 1, including relevant references in columns 2, 3 and 4.</P>
      <P>As far as I understand this, from the explanatory statement, the effect of it is that a duty had previously been imposed at the rate of 20 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i>, which, in October, 1932. was raised to 37½ per cent., with a preferential rate of 25 per cent., and that the present provision is to increase the rate of duty on harness leather to 40 per cent.&mdash;a flat rate.  The situation, apparently, is that the preference rating was the rating that ruled, which was 25 per cent., and that that has been increased to 40 per cent.  Of course, anything before that was at 37½ per cent., and we have not been given any reason why this duty on harness should be increased.  I do not know whether any explanation is going to be given, but I move the amendment in the hope of a reason being given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The main reason of the duty is for administrative convenience. All the leather duties are being arranged on the basis of a flat rate of 40 per cent., for the purpose of convenience in the administration of these duties.  There is, in fact, practically no importation of harness at the present time, and there are sufficient firms in this country to meet all our requirements. They are, in fact, meeting all our requirements at the moment. Since there was a question of a varying duty on straps and so on, it was thought better, for the sake of administrative convenience, to have a flat rate.</P>

      <P>I do not follow the Minister's argument.  He seems to be striving after symmetry in this matter, chiefly.  No doubt, symmetry is a good thing to have, but I do not think it is the one thing to look to.  I think that the Minister should aim rather at efficiency than at symmetry. The Minister now tells us that the reason for this is not because there is any need of it, but merely that it <Col N="2015" /> looks more symmetrical and more in keeping with all the other taxes on leather.  His argument seems to be that, since there is a tax of 40 per cent. on a leather strap used in harness, therefore there ought to be a tax of 40 per cent. on a collar.  Now I must frankly confess that that is an argument I did not follow at all.</P>

      <P>It was what I understood.  I am afraid that the gift of lucidity of expression which used to be characteristic of the Minister for Industry and Commerce is suddenly beginning to desert him, because it appeared to me that he was speaking very lucidly and very clearly when I understood him to say that as there was a duty of 40 per cent. on straps it would be very improper if there was not a nice levelling up of that; because there is a duty of 40 per cent. on straps, there is to be a duty of 40 per cent on everything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a duty of 40 per cent. on straps other than straps forming part of a harness, and it is desirable, in order to prevent evasion, to have 40 per cent. on the rest.</P>

      <P>As a matter of fact the Minister is not doing himself justice.  He can really make himself quite intelligent when he wants to, but I still do not quite understand his argument.  A strap that goes round a portmanteau bears 40 per cent.; a strap on harness bears 40 per cent., and, therefore, because a strap on harness bears 40 per cent., a straddle or collar must bear 40 per cent.  That is <Col N="2016" /> a thing I do not understand.  Of course, the harness trade is naturally a decaying trade.  As far as I know, the number of harness makers in this country is very reduced.  There used to be harness shops in every town, and now there is possibly one harness maker in some old back lane, just to make the few odd collars that are required.  That is the position in regard to harness-making, certainly as far as the West of Ireland is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>This is another of the little incidentals; I might say it is one of the mosquitoes that are going to make the swarm.  The Minister says he is only levelling-up matters&mdash;that straps other than straps on harness are taxed already.  If the Minister is so anxious to level things, I will help him to do it.  Why not bring them all down to the same level instead of levelling them up?  Instead of levelling up the 35 per cent., or whatever the figure is, I would suggest that we bring them all down to 35 per cent., and change this Schedule a bit.  As I say, this is another of the little mosquito tricks, and they all add to the burden.  The whole matter of this Finance Bill has been most illuminating to some of us. In fact I myself did not completely realise the iniquity of it until we came to discuss it in Committee.  The discussion has been somewhat limited inasmuch as the Government side did not partake in it.  It has been left to us to try to drag out whatever elucidation could be dragged out of the Bill without the assistance of the Minister. In that way, perhaps, the discussion has not been as useful as it might have been with the proper intervention of the Government Front Bench to explain matters.  I dare say that the discussion might even have been shorter if the Government had been more helpful in explaining matters to us.  We would <Col N="2017" /> not have had to get up one after another, and try to drag out some information on the particular points that affected us all.  This particular tariff in the Schedule here is raising the duty on harness, and for much the same reason as I objected to very many of the duties here I am objecting to this one.  This is not the time to put up the price of harness.  Perhaps the people in the towns and cities will not be so much affected as the people in the country will be by the increase in the cost of a set of harness, or a set of tackling as it is commonly called in the country.  Even a very small addition to the price is going to affect us.  I do not care whether it is going to mean 6d. or 1/- or 5/-, I certainly object to it.  For my own part I object to this Eighth Schedule on that particular point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather that the particular recommendation which the Minister put forward for this tax is that it is no use&mdash;that it does not do anything.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>But really so far as we are concerned, it does nothing, because there is no harness being imported.  I gather that is the contention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Either this is an effective tax or it is not.  I gathered from the Minister that it is not.  I think it is objectionable&mdash;I will not use a stronger word than that&mdash; to put on those tariffs which are of no use whatsoever.  The principal advantage that it has in the Minister's mind is not anything affecting industry, not anything affecting the country, and not anything affecting farming; he says it will do them no damage because no harness is being imported at present.  It will not increase the amount of harness made in this country because no harness is <Col N="2018" /> being imported at present.  The only reason he has, therefore, for putting up the price to a higher level, with all that may come afterwards&mdash;which, of course, the Minister leaves out of account in all those taxes&mdash;is that it will facilitate the Customs, and enable them to make up their minds as to whether a strap belongs to a set of harness or tackling or whether it belongs to a portmanteau.  Again we are approaching the same question which we had last night&mdash;the inability of the Customs people to make up their minds.  Last night they could not distinguish between thread and yarn. I have never known the Customs officials&mdash;and I think the Minister bore me out on this last night&mdash;to err on the side of the consumer or of the person who was to pay the tax.  I could give plenty of amazing examples of the way in which they have interpreted those things; they have never erred on the side of the person concerned, so the Minister need have no fear in that regard.  Merely for the convenience of administration, as the Minister calls it, and to save the Customs officials from making up their minds as to whether a thing is harness or not, this tariff on harness has been levelled up.  There was one aspect of the matter which the Minister left out of account&mdash;though at the present moment that will not affect the price of harness, or it should not if there is any substance in the Minister's argument&mdash;and that is that when you fix a tariff of that kind I cannot see how the inevitable result will not be a gradual approach to the level which you set.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder when the Minister will approach his job in a business-like way and when will he give intelligent protection of our industries a chance?  With the Minister's desire to bring all leather goods of this kind under a common tariff for administrative purposes, I agree.  I think it is a sound and proper principle that the Minister should do that.  But I part company with him when he start levelling up.  I would not part company with him if he said that harnes and leather goods are still being <Col N="2019" /> imported.  I understood him to say that there is practically no harness being imported now.  In such circumstances why does he want to level-up this tariff?  Is it not time he started levelling it down until he would come to that point, if he would come to it at all, when he would reach zero and harness started to come in?  If the Minister is trying to develop that other arm of the nation he must not amputate the arm that is there.</P>
      <P>What is harness used for here? Mainly for agricultural horses.  The Minister is giving a margin of profit of 40 per cent. above the British profit to harnessmakers here.  But what commodity do these agricultural horses produce that is equal to the British price of an agricultural product?  Who is to buy the harness made by the harness makers?  In the main, it is the agricultural population.  In other words, the Minister is fixing 40 per cent more outlay for agriculture and 40 per cent less for the produce of agriculture.  That is a simple economic exercise and if the Minister ponders on it he will realise there can be only one ending.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney said that harness-making is a dying industry.  Of course, it is, because the produce of the purchasers of harness is a dying industry and, therefore, harness-making must inevitably fall into that grade.</P>
      <P>I would prefer if the amendment were worded to fix a much smaller percentage than 40 and I would feel more comfortable in voting for it then.  In face of the Minister's statement that no harness is coming in here, and in face of a 40 per cent. imposition on agricultural produce, I am prepared to vote for the amendment.  I must say as a protectionist the Minister has made an exceptionally bad case for the 40 per cent.  It is only 40 per cent. to encourage profiteering, to sell in a market that is getting poorer every day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to hear the Minister justifying this levelling-up.  I remember when all the top straps and all the accessories of harness were imported here a few years ago.  Now they have been kept out through a tariff barrier. <Col N="2020" /> Only a tariff barrier sufficient to keep them out is justifiable, and no more. The Minister, having kept them out on a low barrier, wants to increase it. For what purpose?  Profiteering.  That is quite unjustifiable.  That is the policy that is going to kill protection in this country.  Every producer here should be made produce on the bare margin, on the border line.  He should be protected to that border line and he should be made justify any increase in the tariff.</P>
    <P>The policy of the Government, once a certain productive capacity has been attained, should be a policy more or less in line with that of the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;impose taxation until the taxpayer jibs.  The policy of the Government should also be to lower the barrier when we have destroyed imports of certain commodities that we can make here until the manufacturer jibs and then he should be made sit the other side of a table before an expert who knows his job and be made justify to that expert that it is necessary to have that tariff barrier kept at its existing height or, if he wants it, increased.  The Minister should not be throwing away the people's money encouraging profiteering. That is what he is doing under this proposal.  For that reason I will vote against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Administrative convenience is the only argument put up to justify this change.  Administrative ease.  There are two arguments swaying different ways in that respect.  If they want very many articles tariffed in this country, one could say there is not very much necessity to ease the duties of the Revenue Commissioners or those employed under them.  Of course, we know that they are overburdened. On the other hand, if we felt that the Revenue Commissioners were going to be perturbed in a decision as to what was harness and as to leather of particular types in harness, there might be a little difficulty there.  But we know very well the Revenue Commissioners and their staffs decided distinctly in one way. We have this particular measure littered with phrases such as &ldquo;things <Col N="2021" /> which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, are suitable for use as wall-paper,&rdquo;&ldquo;things which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, are suitable for household ornaments,&rdquo; or &ldquo;things which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, are primarily suitable for laboratory use.&rdquo;  We have the judgment of the Revenue Commissioners often put in as a standard and it could easily be done here if there were any necessity.  But I do not consider that a desirable way out of this at all.  Look at the further mess we are getting into.  Harness and harness leather had a 20 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> duty which was increased to 37½, with a preferential rate of 25.  We now want to increase the rate on harness to 40 per cent. and we are leaving the duty on harness leather as it was.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This seems to indicate that the harness leather duty still remains at 37½ with a 25 per cent. preferential rate.  I suggest that is only going to make confusion worse. Supposing we say we are disposed to leave this to the judgment of the Revenue Commissioners and supposing we agree that administrative ease is a thing to be regarded, then that can be discussed.  What is the minimum duty of a protective type that is required for leather straps?  If it is 35 per cent.  I suggest the better scheme would be to reduce all to the 35 per cent.  If we are going to have the rate raised in order to make it equal to something else we should be able to discuss what is the proper protection <Col N="2022" /> for these other articles and what is the proper rate at which these duties should be fixed.  It is a matter of some importance to regard this question of price.  There is not the slightest doubt in the world that when you put a tariff at a certain point the price increase approximates as closely as possible to that particular aid, that particular protection.  The community sacrifice is really measured by something a little bit lower than the particular amount at which the tariff is put.  Now, if 35 per cent. will do, there is no reason under the sun why we should give harness makers in the country an extra 5 per cent.</P>
      <P>If 35 per cent. is sufficient, there is no reason at all for giving them 40 per cent., and it is as inevitable as day follows night that the prices will creep up when this is raised; they will creep up just that little bit extra that is put on, particularly when these people read and understand the arguments; when they find that the House regards it as of no consequence whether the real rate was 25 per cent. or 40 per cent.  Surely, the natural deduction they will draw from that is that the House does not care whether their price has a relation to the 40 per cent. instead of to the 25 per cent.  That is one view that can be taken of tariffs&mdash; that the price follows on the wide stride of the tariff.  The Minister said that prices can look after themselves, that we will put on the tariffs and the consumers pay.  That is practically what it amounts to.  He told the House there is no protective addition necessary.  If the House is to consider the thing on any basis at all they should consider what is the protection required.  I suggest that this item should be held over for equation to enable the whole thing to be reconsidered and put at 25 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 48:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In Part II, to delete reference No. 4, including relevant references in columns 2, 3 and 4.</P>
      <P>I understand this is the twenty-first tax on house-production and is about the seventh of these taxes uncovered by a budgetary joke of the Minister for Finance.  Reference No. 4 proposes to increase what was an effective tax of 20 per cent. on putty, paints and distemper to 50 per cent.  So that if a person, going into one of the new houses built by a local authority, finds a notice on the wall that he must pay a tax before he puts wall-paper on the walls, and turns aside to see whether he will not, in the circumstances, colour the walls with some distemper, he finds himself faced with another notice on the new white walls that he must pay a tax before he can put any distemper on them.  The rent has already been raised somewhat by the increased tax on paint and putty, and he must now put his hand in his pocket and pay a tax before he can colour the walls. The tax on putty in respect of the house-builder or the person renting the house is also in the same class as the tax on rice-pudding for the occupier.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask what is the position with regard to the putty manufacturer at present.  Does he import his whiting free of duty?  I should also like to know what is the position with regard to linseed oil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot give Deputy Dockrell the information he requires.  The arrangement some time ago was that 50 per cent. of the whiting was imported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Free of duty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and 50 per cent. of the whiting came from Ennis. But the intention was gradually to increase the percentage of Ennis whiting in the putty.  I could not say what exactly is the position at present. So far as the increase in duty is concerned, the position is that paints, putty and distempers, to the value of £93,000 were imported last year, or about 40 per cent. of the requirements of the country.  There was no reason why that paint should have been imported. <Col N="2025" /> There are a number of very excellent firms engaged in the production of these goods here which are quite capable of supplying all the requirements of the country.  They are, in fact, supplying 60 per cent. of the requirements at present.  They have expanded their production very rapidly.  In the course of last year alone the employment in the industry was increased by 100 people.  The increase in duty is for the purpose of stopping that import.  We are satisfied that there is very keen competition between the existing firms and that competition will be effective in keeping the price position right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister&mdash;I do not know whether he will agree with me or not&mdash;that there are certain lines of paint which are not covered by the existing paint manufacturers here, and that is the reason for their coming in.  After all, there must be some reason why they are coming in.  The Minister has not answered my question about linseed oil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that again the Minister is busy destroying his own case.  The Minister seems badly off form to-day.  In the other two or three debates in which I listened very attentively to the Minister he was very careful to point out that he had no case.  But I do not think that in any one of them he pointed it out quite so plainly as in the very short speech which he has just delivered.  He told us that the Irish paint industry is going on in splendid style, that it is driving its rivals out of the market, and that it gave employment to 100 more men last year. If it is driving its rivals out of the market, what is the necessity for putting on an extra tariff?  I could understand a tariff being put on to aid a struggling industry.  That is the justification for a tariff.  It is the only justification that a tariff has got.  In a great number of instances it is a complete and entire justification <Col N="2026" /> for the imposition of a tariff, because you have in other countries a well-established industry which has got its connections, and a new industry starting in another country is badly handicapped and is not starting on equal terms.  In order that it may be on equal terms, it is bound to get some of the assistance which a tariff gives to it. But when you have a manufacturer or a number of manufacturers who are going ahead, without any further increase in the existing tariff, and when, according to the Minister's statement, the existing tariff is ample and adequate and the industry is increasing and employing 100 more men and is going on increasing and driving its rivals out of the market, surely the only result of a tariff will be that that industry is able to rise indefinitely up to the very limit of the tariff the price of its paint and putty.  It does not want a tariff otherwise.  Again and again, in the course of this debate, the extraordinary ingenuity with which the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance have found articles of domestic necessity for the purpose of taxing has been referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this tariff will be to reduce the revenue considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter, even assuming that the tariff reduces the revenue.  The Minister is absolutely impregnated with this idea that there is a State and that the State is everything.  The Minister has completely and entirely forgotten that there are individuals who compose the State and that there are people who have got their rights.  The Minister must consider that whether his revenue goes up or down is not a matter of primary importance to the persons who are bound to pay the extra and higher prices which the imposition of these tariffs brings about.  Indeed, any particular individual who has to buy paints at an enhanced price, owing to the existence of this tariff, would, in all human probability, say: &ldquo;Let that go into the Exchequer&rdquo; rather than say: &ldquo;Let it swell the profits of firms that are already making adequate profits <Col N="2027" /> and making profits so adequate that they are able to extend their business.&rdquo; They would very much prefer as a whole that the extra cost they are put to should be a gain to the State than that it should be a gain to manufacturers who are already adequately recompensed for the labour and capital they have put into their work.  I do not, therefore, understand the meaning of the Minister's interjection.  As I say, the Minister is terribly off form to-day.</P>
      <P>To get back to the point on which I was when the Minister interrupted me, these taxes are taxes which are being put upon persons who are unable to bear them.  They are increasing the cost of living and increasing the cost of repairing a house to persons who are not in a position to bear that, and this tax has to be taken in conjunction with all the Minister's other taxes.</P>

      <P>I am not discussing it.  I am asking that, when you come to discuss this, you should keep in your mind, silent to yourself, the surrounding circumstances.  Do not draw vocally the attention of other people to it.  That, I agree, would be against the rules, if I may respectfully <Col N="2028" /> say so.  But surely I am in order in asking members considering this tax to consider the surrounding circumstances &mdash;not to discuss them but to consider and bear in mind the circumstances surrounding its imposition.</P>

      <P>The Minister can think in a certain atmosphere. He can talk, and at the same time he can remember that he is sitting in the Dáil, and even the Minister will not require two minutes' silence to remember that he is in the Dáil.  In the same way, we need not have two minutes' silence to remember the other taxes which are imposed, when talking of this.  Again, I am afraid the Minister is off his shot to-day.  He is foozling badly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>If I might come back to the point which the Minister has been strenuously endeavouring to prevent me from making&mdash;and I do not mind it; I like his interruptions&mdash;the Minister and the Minister for Finance have been going around in the most careful way to see if there is anything which is of real use to the community upon which they can slap down a tax which would increase the price to the consumer.  They have found out: &ldquo;There is putty, and you cannot put in a window without putty; you must have windows in your houses, so we will see to it that the putting in of your windows is a little more expensive than it used to be, and we will slap a tariff on putty.&rdquo;  I think it was Alexander Pope who drew a distinction between man and a fly, because, he said, the fly had a microscopic eye and man had not, but, if Alexander Pope had been listening to this discussion, he would have classified the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance as a very fine <Col N="2029" /> brace of flies, with the most magnificent microscopic eyes, because the number of things which they have been able to discover which they can put up in price to the unfortunate individual who they consider has no rights, the ordinary citizen of this State, is wonderful. There has been no justification at all for the tax proposed here, and I certainly will oppose it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It was most appropriate that the Minister should be dealing with putty and paint because if there is one bogey which a man who is getting a job done, and has to pay for it, has to watch, it is the putty and the paint. That is what covers up bad work.  The Minister is more illogical in this proposition than in any he has put before us.  We are told that there is 20 per cent. of an effective tariff.  I take it that is right&mdash;a 20 per cent. effective tariff.  The Minister said, in reference to that tariff, that we have developed our putty and paint industry rapidly. If &ldquo;rapidly&rdquo; means anything, it means that we are getting quickly to that point at which we can produce our own requirements.  I do not see what more rapidly the Minister wants to travel than that.  I do not see what case he can make for more rapid travelling when it is going to cost more and to put up the price more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that last year £90,000 worth of putty and paint was imported.  Then he asks: &ldquo;Why should we not produce that putty and paint here, and why should we not have the employment that the production of that will give?&rdquo;  With that I agree, if we were stagnant, but we are not stagnant.  We are reaching the point of self-sufficiency, in the Minister's own words, rapidly.  In response to an interjection or a statement by Deputy Dockrell he said that the competition among the many firms would keep down prices.  I wonder has the Minister taken leave of his senses.  Where is the competition?  We have a market of 100 per cent. but £90,000 worth, 40 per cent. of our requirements, is imported.  We have a market of 100 per cent. and we are only supplying 60 per cent.  We have a margin of 40 per cent. that we are not filling.  We <Col N="2030" /> are rapidly increasing our production and the Minister says, soberly and deliberately, that even though we are 40 per cent. behind the production of our requirements, there is sufficient competition between the firms which are producing that 60 per cent.  Was there anything ever more ridiculous than that?  If these firms said: &ldquo;Well, now we are getting a 20 per cent. effective tariff; we will fix a price 19 per cent. above the price of the imported article,&rdquo; that would leave a margin of one per cent. which would be effective to keep the market for home producers.  But we are still only filling 60 per cent of the market we have. Where is the competition?  The thing is absurd.  I should like to be producing for such a market.  I would not mind how many were competing with me, for no matter how many were competing with me and cutting prices, even if they cut prices down to the level at which paint could be imported here I could say: &ldquo;Let them do it.  I can charge 19 per cent. above the import price, less the tariff.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that the firms were quite capable of supplying all the requirements of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>At whose expense?  If the firms are capable of supplying all our requirements, why do they not do it?  Are they working short time, or what is the reason they cannot do it? Where is the competition?  That whole fabric of the Minister's argument falls to the ground.  A child would not put it up.  Deputy Dockrell asked whether there was any difference in the volume of our products as between the dearer and the cheaper paints.  Are we producing the best paints here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say the best in the world, but I know the Deputy would not believe me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>If I heard that in my young days, when I thought everything Irish was the best in the world, I might believe it, but when I went out into <Col N="2031" /> the world my eyes were opened.  If the Minister had any experience of the world his eyes would be opened too. The sooner we equate ourselves to other peoples in the world, the sooner we shall know ourselves.  If this paint is the best in the world and that we are capable of producing all our requirements, why is it that we are still importing £90,000 worth?  The thing does not wash.  The Minister throws in the usual stuff by stating that it will give so many more people employment. I agree it would, if we could go on the level that we have been going up to the present, but the Minister proposes to double the effective tariff and have a double increase in the price.  Has the Minister taken into account how much that increase in the price of these materials will affect employment among painters and painters' helpers? The Minister is going the right road to diminish employment in another line.  A little boy or a little girl can stir the paint in mixing it, but it takes a tradesman to put on the paint, and the tradesman's employment will be curtailed because of the increase in the price of the commodity.  People are not going to decorate their houses in future because of the increase in the cost of the materials and the decrease in economic standards, until they are driven to do it.  Consequently the Minister's policy will lead to more unemployment in that way.</P>
      <P>I should like to hear the Minister again explain to the House where the effective competition comes in when only 60 per cent. of the home market is now being produced at home.  How can he explain that there is effective competition amongst the firms producing that 60 per cent. or that there is a sufficient assurance to the public that prices will not soar, if an increase of 20 per cent. is added?  I think he actually said that prices would go down.  In the name of heaven, what is the use of putting up the tariff if prices will come down?  Why do they not come down?</P>

      <P>I wonder whether there is any good in trying to convince the Minister that he is doing these industries no service by the particular line he has taken on this matter and on many of the other industries with which we have dealt to-day for which a high tariff has been asked and imposed by this Bill.  The case made by the Minister in defence of the tariff was, strange to say, the <Col N="2033" /> extraordinary strides made already in this industry.  There you have an industry with the existing tariff showing, according to the Minister, every signs of health, and producing an excellent article.  I think he said the best in the world.  At any rate the article is good and the advance in the industry is rapid.  What, therefore, is the excuse for this increase?  According to the Minister, the industry is in a healthy condition.  In putting this increase on is he not running the risk of bringing it into an unhealthy condition? He may make more profits for the particular industry.  The increase in it may become more rapid, but what I fear is that in order to get that this healthy industry may be largely damaged.  On his own showing there is no reason why he should have been dissatisfied with the present rate of increase.  On the contrary, he should have been well satisfied, but by his present action he is running the risk of damaging an industry that is in a healthy condition by his unreasonable desire to go altogether too quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the whole idea is unsound, and that there is no justification for the line that he is taking up.  Deputy Belton's argument struck me as being perfectly sound.  With 40 per cent. of the market still to be collared, I do not see where the necessity arises for this.  There is a 20 per cent. tariff on already and with it the industry is in a healthy condition.  Those in it, even on the existing tariff, can charge at least another 15 per cent., so that according to the Minister's argument prices will operate as far as competition is concerned.  With 50 per cent. of the market still to be captured by these firms it is possible that competition will be done away with.  Is not that the inevitable result?  It is now proposed to increase the tariff by 40 per cent. without any justification, and this in the case of an industry that is rapidly increasing.  I suppose it is not necessary to mention the fact that this is interfering with other industries.  There are other articles tariffed in this Schedule.  Grapes is one.  In Schedule II, duties have been <Col N="2034" /> put on fruits of various kinds and vegetables, all of which require greenhouses. This tariff will make greenhouses more costly.  The Minister will say it will make them cheaper.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated that something like 40 per cent. of the paint used here is imported.  Can he give the House any information regarding the exports of paints from this country?  They are considerable, I suggest.  We all know what happens when tariffs are put on by one country against another.  So far as this industry is concerned, it was gradually making progress here.  It was well able to hold its own.  It was doing that so well that a firm in another country came over here and joined a successful and well-managed firm here with a trade not only in Great Britain but on the Continent, where chemistry had been elevated almost to one of the fine arts.  Is this tariff likely to interfere with that export trade?  Even if we were to get the whole of the home trade and were to lose the foreign trade, we might lose on balance.  There has been a gradual encroachment on the paints imported here.  If, on the other hand, there are people with a disposition to buy paint, and that it simply means increased cost to them, that will have its effect on employment in other directions.  The Minister has had experience of getting painting done in his own house.  Speaking from experience, I should say that with the good quality paints produced in this country the results are very satisfactory for anybody who gets his house painted with Irish materials.  The Irish paints last longer and retain their sheen much better.  Even after a couple of years a house painted with Irish paint looks as if it had been painted only last year. <Col N="2035" /> With that position, and with the export trade increasing and the possibility of ultimately getting, let us say, 90 per cent. of the home trade, is it a wise proceeding on the Minister's part to interrupt that?  Where there is an export trade there is always the possibility of expansion.  The people in the trade here are highly specialised.  They have been in it for generations and have made a success of it.  They have made such a success of their business that, as I have said, a firm in another country was induced to come over here and join them.  It surely is a dangerous thing to interfere with an industry such as that.  It would be useful, I think, for the Minister to give us some information as to the volume of the export trade.  When something of this kind was attempted in other directions we lost practically all our export trade.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>But expansion may result there.  There may be a disposition on the part of people outside to purchase more and more of these special classes of paints.  I venture to suggest that there is still a great chance for an expansion in that direction.  If, by reason of increasing this tariff, people are induced to impose tariffs against our goods, then the loss will be ours.</P>

      <P>The real position with regard to the imposition of this tariff is still obscure.  The enormous burden that is being put on the general building trade is also obscure.  The <Col N="2036" /> Minister told us that about 40 per cent. of the paint used here is imported. Taking that figure, it means that something more than £200,000 worth of paint is used here every year.  At present, the Minister is getting about £20,000 in revenue from imported paint.  If he is getting that on the import of paint, there is the equivalent cost of something nearly approaching 20 per cent. falling on the people buying Irish paint. I propose to increase it to 50 per cent. If the present import of paint continues as it is and if it takes the Irish houses a little while to expand their production, the Minister is going to raise £50,000 in 12 months instead of £20,000 and there is going to be a corresponding rise in the price of Irish paint here.  I submit that the Minister's proposal will have the effect of imposing an additional cost on the users of paint of anything up to £80,000 or £90,000 per year.  I should like the Minister to address himself to that aspect of the question and to say if the housebuilding industry can bear that impost.</P>

      <P>By increasing the price to something close on the 50 per cent. margin?  I submit that the housebuilding industry is not capable of bearing that impost.  There is sufficient falling-off, due to the financial condition of the people, in work of that kind without adding to it in this way.</P>

      <P>Reference No. 5 proposes to clear away a tax of 15/- and a preference of 10 per cent. on presses for racquets used in any of the games of tennis, lawn tennis, badminton, racquets or any similar game.  The Minister proposes to clear the ground in order, subsequently, to put on a tariff of 50 per cent. on these articles.  He proposes to extract a revenue tax from persons who take part in sport and who wish to keep their sporting instruments in a sound and proper condition.  This is an attack on real economy, or, you might say, an attack on the character of the people.  Persons who keep their sporting implements in a sound condition are the type of people who build up the country in the right way and who do its work in the right way.  The Minister proposes to single that class of persons out and to take a revenue tax from them by imposing a tax on the care and solicitude that they have for their equipment.  If that is not so, I should like to hear what the intention of the Minister is.</P>

      <P>These racquets are expensive and this represents money going out of the country.  I never bought a racquet, but I am told that the price of a good one is about £3, and that it lasts, perhaps, a season.  I am sure that £2 10s. or 3 guineas leaves the country for a racquet and, that being so, it is advisable to ensure that more than that amount will not leave.  I understand these presses are essential to keep the racquets in good condition. Can the Minister give any information as to the quantity of racquets imported?

      <P>It is proposed here to impose a duty of 50 per cent. on presses for tennis racquets, etc.  The Minister says those things are going to be made here.  I should like to hear any argument that the Minister can bring forward as to why a tariff of 50 per cent. is necessary in order to get presses for tennis racquets and badminton racquets made here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to hear the explanation, because if it satisfied anybody it must have been very cogent.  This reference number says &ldquo;presses for racquets used in any of the games of tennis, lawn-tennis, badminton, racquets, or any similar game.&rdquo;  To start off with, there is no tennis played here.  There is no such thing as tennis played here.  There is not a tennis court in all Ireland.  The game does not exist here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister know that the game does not exist here?  Where did he copy this from? There is nobody in this country who plays tennis, and I do not suppose the game has ever been played in this country; well, I do believe there was one private court in a house which still exists.  I think the outline of the court is still there, but it has been turned into either a veranda or a flower show. I do not suppose there is anybody in the country who has a racquet for that game.  As far as lawn tennis is concerned, it is played; badminton slightly; racquets progressively.  Then we got &ldquo;or any similar game.&rdquo;  I wonder what that is supposed to catch. You do not put a ping-pong racquet in a press.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>To put a ping-pong racquet in a press.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not recommended? I would nearly give the Minister 10/- if he could get a press in which you could put a ping-pong racquet.  What else is there to be caught?  What is &ldquo;other similar game?&rdquo;  I do not suppose he wants a press for fishing nets? What is the requirement for 50 per cent.?  There used to be a rather ugly and&mdash;being ugly and having more board&mdash;a somewhat dearer type of press for a lawn tennis racquet.  It was much heavier and more expensive than what is now used.  With regard to the old type of frame I suppose the ordinary carpenter could turn it out <Col N="2045" /> with great ease, once he got the boards for it.  It was a 3-ply board.  Of course, the only thing that is required in the press is to keep the racquet from warping.  It has a natural tendency to warp, particularly with the strength of the gut tending to make it curl up at the side.  The board had to be fortified and strengthened.  It was more than 3-ply; the wood was fortified in different ways.  Given the bits of board, an ordinary carpenter could do the dove-tailing of one into another.  The ordinary rectangular type of frame which used to be made was a simple thing.  After the boards were cut all that was required was the addition of four holes bored in a particular way, and the adjustment of the screws.  The cost of sending the presses across to this country, particularly the old type of press, must have been fairly expensive.  They are heavy articles and, secondly, they make an awkward parcel when sent in big lots.  The person who was getting in the boards and making the presses here must certainly have the advantage of a fairly heavy freight.  You can get the boards in decent lengths, and have them cut.  Of course, the type that is coming in now is much lighter.  The price has gone down.  The wood is much more strengthened and fortified than it used to be.  The type of frame is now a criss-cross diagonal thing, with one screw only.  Instead of four screws there is only one.  I think for the badminton racquet there is a very light press indeed.  We are told there is a requirement of 50 per cent. instead of whatever it is that we are removing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has anybody indicated to the Minister that they cannot make those presses under the protection of 15 per cent. plus freight, and that they are going to make them under the protection of 50 per cent?  Has anybody indicated that 15 per cent. was not sufficient?  I should be surprised to find it was not.  That is the argument I want to hear.  There is <Col N="2046" /> nothing very subtle or expert about the construction of those presses, and it should be possible to make them here once the boards are fitted together in a particular way.  I should like to hear the argument which the Minister says satisfied the House that 15 per cent. is not enough, and that 50 per cent. is required.  As I have not heard the argument I have to go on some of the possible reasons that might have been alleged.  The main one would be that 15 per cent. is not enough, and that 50 per cent. is the proper figure to induce the manufacture here, whereas the lower figure would have failed.  I should like to hear why that 35 per cent. additional has got to be made.  Can the Minister even tell us what is the average cost of the roughest type of board press for, say, a lawn tennis racquet?  We will then know what this 50 per cent. additional means.  Would the Minister tell us where those are likely to be manufactured? Is it at the ordinary sports outfitters' establishments or is it going to be an addition to some timber place?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless they are definitely connected with the sports outfitting places, remember there can be a danger, because if the press is not made in a sufficiently expert way it will have the same tendency to curl up in damp weather that the racquet has.  If that is slipped on to the frame of a good racquet it will give it an additional tendency to curl.  I would have thought that some of the good sports shops in the city might have taken it on and engaged some of their employees in their spare moments in the winter time making these things. I wonder if the Minister could give us an indication of the number required, so that we may get an idea of the extent of employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would certainly be ludicrous if there was any estimate based on that assumption; it would be sheer folly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>A press will certainly outlast many racquets; it ought to be good for at least five or six years.  In these days, perhaps, a press might be let drop or might be pitched around the court, but if it is kept in the ordinary way there is no reason why a press should not outlive several racquets.  A person who buys a racquet in a particular season does not require to buy a press at the same time, if he has one already in his possession.  Some people are inclined to assume that each racquet brings with it its own press, but I do not suppose there would be any necessity to get a press each time one purchases a racquet.  There are, in fact, quite a number of people who never put a press around a lawn tennis racquet at all.  You will find people who think that the best way to keep a lawn tennis racquet through the winter is to prop up a window with it, to use it in order to let in the air.  Of course that is bad for the racquet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It might slip and, in view of the Government's attack on window glass, you would want to be more careful of the window glass in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely meant that when the clothes brush is not handy they put in a tennis racquet or a shoe. That is not good for the window or for the racquet.  It is only the experienced club player who gets down to the point of using a press at any time, and not even that type of person gets a press every time that he purchases a racquet.  As I indicated before, a press will outlive any racquet and, in <Col N="2048" /> the circumstances, I see no reason for this 50 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a very bad principle to tax anything in connection with sport in any form.  The Government have gone as far as they could in the way of taxing the necessaries of life and now we find them taxing the type of amusement which is beneficial to the health of the young people. With regard to racquet presses, the number of them coming into the country annually must be very small. There seems to be an idea that every racquet comes in with a press, but that is not so at all.  I have used a press for the last 15 or 16 years, and it is still in quite a good condition.  Only a couple of shillings would be involved in the purchase of a very efficient press.  The amount of protection that will be required in connection with this matter is really not worth all the trouble.  I think the tariff of 50 per cent. proposed by the Government is an extraordinary amount to put on.  I am perfectly sure that whatever presses are made here they will be well able to compete with the foreign article without any protection whatsoever. I have seen some Irish-manufactured presses and they are very good, and they can make them very cheaply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I really do not see the object of putting on this tax.  It is not going to bring in any appreciable revenue. There would not be more than a couple of hundred of these presses imported in the year; they certainly would not reach the thousand mark.  The cost will be only a couple of shillings, possibly 5/- each, and the whole amount will not be much more than £50 or £60.  I do not think any industry could benefit very much with a tax like this.  It is wrong, at any rate, to tax any form of sport, because it means an indirect tax on the health of our people.  There was a time when tennis was not so popular as it is to-day.  It is now very popular amongst our young people, amongst the younger generation working in offices and other places.  I do not think the Minister should put anything in the way of the advancement of tennis, which has now become a thoroughly democratic game <Col N="2049" /> in this country, a game within the reach of all our boys and girls and a game that induces very healthy exercise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would very much like to know where the Minister gets his facts from.  He tells us very glibly certain things and he gives us certain estimates.  Who makes the estimates for him?  If I understood the Minister correctly he said 60 gross of presses come into the country in the year.  Sixty gross would mean 8,600 presses, and the Minister mentions that that number comes into the country in the year.  To be accurate, 8,640 presses are brought into this country, according to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Slightly more, as a matter of fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder how many tennis racquets are sold in the country each year?  If we allow three or four years' life to a press, that would be a fair estimate.  I should certainly say there is about one press for every four or five racquets in the country.  According to the Minister's estimate that would mean a sale of something like 40,000 tennis racquets in the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister instead of simply telling us straight away: &ldquo;I will make an estimate&rdquo; would tell us how his estimate is arrived at and who made it; because it seems to me to be a grotesquely impossible estimate.  On the general question, apart from the accuracy of the Minister's figures, I think it is a great mistake in taxation all around to put on little taxes which really do no good to the revenue and do no good as far as giving employment is concerned.  Nothing substantial <Col N="2050" /> of any kind in the way of employment is gained and yet it is very annoying to the ordinary person in the street.  These little pin-prick taxes are annoying to the taxpayer and they do not tend or conduce to making the taxpayer pay up those other taxes which ordinarily he is quite ready to pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Are those figures just an estimate of the number of racquets sold in the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think 60 gross is the figure, that is 8,640 racquet presses sold.  I think the Minister would find on a calculation that there is not one in four used in the country as a press. Perhaps it might be put at one in five or one in six.  People buy racquets for their children and they would not buy very expensive racquets.  They go in for something cheap, just as people do in the case of cheap motor cars, something that would last during the season.  They are used after that for holding up a window or something like that, and it is only about one in six would be kept in a press.  Let us say there were 43,000 tennis racquets sold in a year.  It is only the people who take a keen interest in the game and people who play in club competitions who would probably buy a new racquet each year.  The ordinary club player will certainly make a racquet do, on an average, for three years.  That would mean that there are about 120,000 lawn tennis players or about 120,000 between lawn tennis players and badminton players in the country. This figure is certainly the most fantastic figure we got to-night, a shocking figure.</P>

      <P>Reference 5 of Schedule 1 of the Finance Act, 1933, imposed a duty of 37½ per cent., with a preference duty of 25 per cent. on footballs, the covers of which are made wholly or mainly of leather, and also on football covers made wholly or mainly of leather imported separately.  We have seen in the discussion of this measure how the agent of the Minister for Finance searched every hole and corner of a workman's house to see what he could take there; searched every bit of material that goes into the making of a workman's house, to see what he could take; and put the tax-gatherer outside the house of entertainment that the workmen could go to.  We have seen various other taxes put on sports materials.  We have had an effective tariff of 25 per cent. on footballs, which is now raised to 40 per cent.  So that, following carefully the report of the various ways in which workers can be taxed, the Minister follows the workman to the football field.  He will not allow him into the field until he has paid a substantial increase on his football.  I should like to hear from the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether there is a side to that proposal other than the side the Minister for Finance has been giving us here in his interjections&mdash;that he is looking for revenue.</P>

      <P>That is the way tariffs should be discussed.  We have now information in a certain way.  The Minister knows exactly and can tell us how many footballs are booted round to extinction; how many have to be brought in for replacement and renewal purposes in a year.  He can tell us accurately how many are made at home and how many imported; the number of workers employed and the wages these workers get.  He can tell us the resulting price to people who indulge in this pastime and what he is going to get under the increased percentage. As a matter of fact, there is an extremely able case being made for this tariff on all the information the Minister has given.</P>

      <P>The cat is out of the bag now.  When discussing harness leather, the Minister told us that the increased tariff was necessary&mdash;it was only for levelling up matters.  As Deputy McGilligan suggests he thought of another answer since.  But whether he thought of it since, or whether it is the correct answer, the fact remains that the present tariff of 25 per cent. is not sufficient; 40 per cent. is necessary and the possibility is that the price will go up.  The Minister says that is most unlikely, but he did not say it was not possible. I suggest that it is extremely possible and that when it is possible the manufacturers will take care that it will be probable, and in fact almost certain. <Col N="2055" /> The price of footballs is going to go up as well as other articles of necessity, of sport, and of luxury.  In fact, one does not know in what way we can escape from tariffs in any direction. As we are discussing sporting matters I suggest that the Minister should blow the whistle now and cry halt to this game of increasing tariffs. Let the country rest on its laurels for a while with what we have achieved, and give the industries started a chance to prove their worth in competition with other countries.  Do not surround them with artificial boundaries or, as Deputy Belton put it, put them in a nursery altogether.  There ought to be some limitation to this almost continuous increase in tariffs. I do not see any necessity for the increase in this tariff and we will have to oppose it, as we have opposed most of the extra charges in this Schedule, and I hope Deputy Mulcahy will insist on pressing it to a division.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy McGilligan, I am very uneasy about the statement of the Minister in the matter of footballs. It is a levelling up apparently. The making of a football certainly does not require more technical skill than the making of harness.  We were told that there was no harness imported.  Now the Minister says that there was a considerable number of footballs imported and that led him to the conclusion that the 25 per cent. was not adequate.  We are not fit for anything if we cannot make footballs with a 25 per cent. margin and the sooner we recognise it the better and stop this &ldquo;codology&rdquo; about the industrialisation of the country.  I was only a nipper when I made a football.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is ready for use the moment you take it off.  There is no technique required here.  The Minister said that some are machined and some are hand-sewn.  What is the hand-sewing of a football?  An awl and a piece of wax-end.  That is the whole technique of a football.  We have a 25 per cent. tariff and we are not able to compete with the foreigner, according to the Minister, in the making of these footballs.  Is it not time we shut up shop?  The man who would vote for an advantage for the making of footballs in this country would be the greatest enemy of Irish industry.  It is time we learned to work; it is time we started to do a day's work and stopped talking about it.</P>
      <P>The Minister talks about employment in this matter.  Frankly, I do not believe the Minister when he said that 25 per cent. was not sufficient, and I do not believe he has any information on it.  He cannot be correct in both statements&mdash;that we have cut them out in the harness competition but that they have beaten us in the football competition.  I suppose the Minister is aware that they are both leather goods. The discussion like this up to midnight is really a waste of time.  You would not find lads in toss-pits at the cross-roads wasting their time talking stuff of this kind, and not one will believe the Minister when he says that we are not able to make a football with a 25 per cent. advantage against the people of any other country.  That is not the dope the Minister puts out when he goes down to the cross-roads, but it is gradually getting to the cross-roads, and the Minister will be known better and better every time he goes there in future.</P>

Those Standing Orders govern the proceedings of the House and they arrange for meetings on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.  I submit that unless a motion were made at the hour of sitting, on any of those days, which would cover the proceedings here, it is irregular to adjourn to any other date.  I submit that, having regard to the Standing Orders, it is irregular to permit of a motion being made now, without notice, without any information and when Deputies are scattered throughout various parts of the country and unable to be made aware of this meeting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the motion that progress be now reported, I desire to speak.  To-day, we were told that it would be necessary to get this Finance Bill through, with the Conditions of Employment Bill, the Cereals Bill and the Widows' and Orphans' Pension Bill, and whatever reasons were given for that seemed sufficient to certain people who were then present, including the Labour Party, who are now entirely absent, to ask them to sit until 12 o'clock to-night to finish this business. During the course of the debate that followed, nobody took any exception to the debate that took place on the Conditions of Employment Bill.  If anything is to be said about that, it is that the discussion was, to a great extent, shortened and, to some extent, burked by the fact that the Minister decided to indicate that he would bring in amendments on another Stage in order to allow other points to be debated.  It was presented as an urgent Bill.  It was certainly a Bill which had lain long enough.  It was incubating for a long time, and there had been what some of us regarded as insufficient time given for the setting down of amendments between the time at which the Second Reading was taken and the date the Committee Stage was fixed for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Committee Stage was not taken on the day arranged, but that was not the fault of the House.  Any amendments that had been put in were in in good time.  I do not think that the green paper which came out contained <Col N="2059" /> any more amendments than there were in the white paper that came out in time.  There cannot be any suggestion that the Bill was held up.  That debate lasted until 2 o'clock to-day, and we then took up the Finance Bill&mdash; probably the most cumbrous and unwieldy Finance Bill with which this Dáil has ever had to deal&mdash;and the tactics adopted by the Ministry in regard to that were that, first of all, they were too afraid of criticism to make any comment themselves, and they effectively boycotted into silence any of their own members who had the temerity to make any comment on that Bill.  The only occasion on which Deputies on that side arose in the debate was when the Minister for Finance said, with regard to one tax that was being imposed, that it was a revenue tax and he was interrupted by three people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As regards the motion that the Dáil do now adjourn till 10.30 a.m. to-morrow, July 6th, that motion was handed to the Chair as a matter of urgency, as certain Bills have to get through this House within a week.  I consider that it would be rather an impertinence for the Chair to decide that the majority in this House in a matter of urgency cannot come to a decision as to whether or not it would sit to-morrow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand that you are taking this motion without notice to the House?  This is a motion different from any motion of which any notice has been given and to which objection is taken by a certain number of Deputies in this House. <Col N="2063" /> The reason, I understand, is urgency, but the Bill can be still got through in the course of next week without any necessity for sitting to-morrow.  I will ask your reconsideration of your decision on the grounds that any such urgency is due to incompetence and delay on the part of the Government and the majority Party in this House in the way in which they have conducted their business.  There is plenty of time for the Finance Bill in the course of the next week&mdash;Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday&mdash;to get through this House.  Therefore, I suggest to you, Sir, for your consideration that there is no such matter of urgency in this particular matter.  We have been treated with the grossest impertinence by the Minister for Finance.  He has taken up the attitude, so to speak, of not recognising the court.  The Opposition has discussed this measure.  His attitude is one of contempt for the House, and I suggest that the majority Party on the motion it is taking at present is treating the House with the same contempt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as this motion is concerned and the reason for it, there is no doubt whatever but that the Finance Bill can pass through this House by Wednesday and that there will then be 21 days in which it can go to the Seanad, and be passed before the first of August.  In these circumstances and having regard to the precedent that has been established and observed here since this House started, I submit that the taking of this motion now is certainly unfair to the Parliament.  It must be remembered that if there is a majority here there is also a minority and that the minority has a right to express its view.  They have been elected as well as the majority and it is their bounden duty to take part in the parliamentary proceedings.  They have done that with all the ability at their command, as was their duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House this morning was informed that the intention was to adjourn until Tuesday at 3 o'clock. Outside of the majority everybody in this House believed that that was the <Col N="2064" /> programme.  They believed in all good faith that once that announcement was made no attempt could be made or would be allowed to be made to interrupt the business by moving that the House would meet to-morrow.  I put it on another ground.  We have been sitting here since Tuesday at 3 o'clock.  We have been sitting from 10.30 a.m. to-day and it is now near midnight.  I put it in all reason that members of this House are not likely to bring to the consideration of business that application which is demanded of us in the Parliament of the nation.  If you are accepting the motion that the House adjourn until to-morrow morning at half past ten o'clock I submit that it is an outrage on the proceedings and precedents that have been established in this House. If you are going to accept that motion I will have to move an amendment.</P>
