    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In page 9, section 15 (2), line 13, after the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;there search for any such butter and examine all butter found on such search and also&rdquo;.&mdash; (Minister for Agriculture.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have little to add to what I said on this amendment before the adjournment of the <Col N="1222" /> Dáil the night before last.  I put it to the Minister that he has not really considered and does not grasp the measure of annoyance which the enforcement of this clause in the aggravated form in which he proposes to embody it in the Bill is likely to cause and that he does not appreciate the difficulties that it will put in the way of the smooth working of the Bill.  I gathered from his speech in introducing the amendment that he professed to believe that, in practice, it would not be used in the case of the particular class for whom we have spoken&mdash;the farming class.  If that be so, and if there are only one or two cases in which this power would be used, I think that the irritation caused by the introduction of it will not be at all compensated for by the use he intends to make of it.  I ask him once more to seek a formula which will exclude the producers of butter&mdash;the farmers&mdash;and include the particular people at whom he professes to aim.  Though I fully accept the bona fides of the Minister's professions in this matter, I cannot accept the likelihood of their being realised.  With the general temptation that this Bill, when it becomes an Act, will inevitably put before the producer, there will, I fear, be a tendency to evade the law so far as possible.  The inspectors will then get busy in the inspection of farm houses.  I do not think that they can do so effectively by this clause, as it is to be amended.  That is the point I am making against the clause.  The clause as it is to be amended will simply put into the hands of the Minister power to harry people.  I do not think the sections of the Bill of which the Minister spoke so strongly will empower him to get after what will be analogous to smuggling to any appreciable extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious that the Minister has no real conception of the objection felt to this kind of proceeding in the country districts.  If he had, I am sure he would receive our objections to this clause much more sympathetically than he has done.  As the Bill stands, it is less objectionable than it will be if this <Col N="1223" /> amendment be carried.  Therefore, we propose to oppose the amendment. What the difficulties are in distinguishing between the farmer and the butter merchant the Minister did not make clear.  The House will remember that the Minister, when asked to justify this measure, refused to accept responsibility for doing so, and tried to throw the responsibility on the Opposition. He was asked how the powers he is now assuming would be made effective. He did not answer.  The objection was made, again and again, that these powers would not be effective.  His only answer was: &ldquo;How would the Opposition make them effective?&rdquo;  He made no effort to show how the powers he is claiming would be effective.  He objected to the introduction of a clause distinguishing between the farmer and the shopkeeper&mdash;seller or butter merchant&mdash;and shelved the problem merely by asking how the Opposition would deal with it.  He forgot, apparently, that he is in charge of the measure and that it is his business to justify the legislation he introduces and not the business of the Opposition.  We find the clause as it is proposed to be amended more objectionable than the provision at present in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the Minister on a previous occasion in connection with this section, the thought struck me that the proper title for this Bill, when it becomes an Act, would be &ldquo;The Butter Safety Act&rdquo; because of its resemblance and similarity, with this amendment incorporated, to the Public Safety Act, about which we know so much.  This section empowers an official of the Government to go into any premises where he believes butter may be kept or stored.  Having done that, what happens?  Unlike the provisions of the Public Safety Act, it is not an offence to have butter on the premises.  Therefore, the inspector must look outside and follow up the transaction in order to establish an offence.  The Minister, as Deputy O'Sullivan said, must realise that there is great objection&mdash;and quite rightly&mdash; to an inspector&mdash;I do not care to what branch of the Government service he <Col N="1224" /> belongs&mdash;going into every room in a farmer's house in which he thinks butter might be kept.  Would anybody like to be subjected to that annoyance? Would the Ministers themselves think it reasonable that somebody should be empowered to knock at their doors at night, or even during the day, and say: &ldquo;We are going to search your premises&rdquo;?  The Minister says that the powers will not be used, although the Government will possess them.  I think there is too much of that type of excuse for legislation at the present time.  I came up against a case which reminded me very strongly of that recently.  Although it is not relevant to this section, I ask the indulgence of the Chair for a moment while I refer to it.  A child of mine, aged about ten years, chanced to be absent for two or three days from school because he was ill.  I met a guard to whom I had occasion to speak upon another matter. He said: &ldquo;By the way, is this boy of yours delicate?  He was away a couple of days from school and no excuse was given.&rdquo;  It was an offence for the boy to be absent from school when an excuse was not written in the book. That is the way that legislation is passed here.  I am afraid that people are not sufficiently careful as regards the powers which they put into the hands of the Government.</P>

      <P>What Government passed that legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing I know about it is that a representative of the Government whose duty it was to look up the attendance of children at school hauled me up about it and gave me to understand that it was an offence to have the child absent from school unless there was an excuse. In this case there was a genuine excuse.  I was not a member of the House at the time that that legislation was passed.  I simply quote that incident in support of my argument to show what can happen in connection with the enforcement of a drastic section such as the Minister is seeking to insert in this Bill.  This is a type of section which, in my opinion, would only justify itself in <Col N="1225" /> a measure such as the Public Safety Act.  If it is inserted in this Bill, what is it going to mean?  It will mean that inspectors can call at all times to farmers' houses and make a search, but still the position will be that even if they do find what they are looking for they cannot prosecute. Surely there ought to be some other way of doing what the Minister is aiming at than by the insertion of a drastic power of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be admitted that it is not very nice that inspectors should have the power to come into a person's house at any time at their own sweet will to carry out a search, and the strange thing about it is that if they do search and find butter it is not an offence.  I imagine that the only way in which the Minister can get <Col N="1226" /> satisfactory evidence of an offence having been committed is by having an inspector outside the door of a farmer's house, getting him to follow the farmer's trap into the nearest town and seeing how he disposes of any butter that he may bring into it.  I imagine you would need to have something of that sort in order to get evidence to bring a prosecution.  The finding of butter in a house is not an offence and does not prove anything.  Why, therefore, have such an objectionable section in the Bill?  I object very strongly to it, and I submit to the Minister that he ought to try and find some other means of achieving the object that he has in view.</P>

      <P>This is a question not of the debate but of an expression of opinion of the House.  I am not questioning your ruling, Sir, but I presume that the Minister's <Col N="1228" /> amendment and Deputy Haslett's amendment are moved by them both merely as members of the House.  In that case, I suggest that the Minister has no priority over Deputy Haslett. Deputy Haslett proposes a wider departure from the actual Bill as it stands, and I suggest that that is a reason why the first decision should be taken on Deputy Haslett's amendment. Otherwise, the House will not be in a position of giving a really definite view on the matter because we may have to vote for the Minister's amendment as against what is in the Bill.  On the other hand, the bulk of the Deputies on this side of the House and on the Independent Benches, as well as the bulk of Deputy Belton's Party, want &ldquo;fifteen pounds&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;seven,&rdquo; and I suggest that there is no method of deciding this unless we are allowed to put the &ldquo;fifteen&rdquo; against the &ldquo;seven&rdquo; if the &ldquo;seven&rdquo; is carried. We prefer &ldquo;fifteen&rdquo; to &ldquo;seven,&rdquo; but we also prefer &ldquo;seven&rdquo; to what is in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I should like to point out that it is of no great importance which amendment is put, because if Deputies will read sub-section (2) (b) of Section 16 they will see that it says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The total quantity of butter sold in any one week by the licensee shall not exceed such quantity as may be prescribed by regulations.</P>
      <P>That means that it can be altered the day after the Bill goes through, if it is found necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has put a point to the Chair.  He may rest assured that precedent is being followed.  The Deputy will realise also that the course he suggests might result in a whole series of amendments. The usual procedure has been to decide the issue on the amendment first submitted; in this case a Ministerial amendment.  The House, having decided, if it does decide, that the word &ldquo;seven&rdquo; stand, could not alter its decision immediately afterwards.</P>

      <P>In order to shorten the discussion, Sir, would I be in order in <Col N="1229" /> suggesting that the Minister alter his amendment by substituting a higher figure than &ldquo;seven&rdquo;?  I do not know if it is in order, but perhaps it might meet the wishes of all the parties in the House to have a figure higher than &ldquo;seven&rdquo; in order to meet Deputy Haslett's desire as enshrined in his amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said before, it is of no great importance, technically speaking, because it could be altered afterwards by regulation.  On the other hand, however, whatever amendment the Minister might introduce would naturally be an indication of the figure that he might stick to afterwards unless other considerations came in that he did not foresee at the moment. I put in the word &ldquo;seven&rdquo; therefore and thought that we might take that as the figure that would at least be put into the first regulations, if regulations are necessary.  I should like to repeat that we may not foresee conditions now as we would see them then and, of course, the figure might be higher or perhaps lower.  We can only see conditions as time goes on.  As far as I could judge the position and as far as I could foresee the working of this Act, I was inclined to raise the figure from &ldquo;five&rdquo; to &ldquo;seven.&rdquo;  I am quite prepared, however, to do what Senator Gibbons suggested.</P>

      <P>Well&mdash;let us call it the Upper House.  It is rather confusing, of course, to come back to one House from another.  However, I think that there is no necessity to lose a lot of time over this amendment.  I have a fair idea of what are the views of the Opposition on this particular thing&mdash; that they would like to see the figure as high as possible and that they would prefer to have 15 lbs. to the 5 lbs. I think, however, that 15 lbs. would make the Bill rather useless in that particular section in regard to the collection of levy, that is, from the producers who are delivering butter direct to the consumer.  There are two reasons why I should like to raise the figure somewhat above &ldquo;five.&rdquo;  In the first place, because these small producers have not more than 5, 6 or 7 lbs. of butter to sell every week and are, perhaps, more deserving of consideration than large producers; and in the second place, it is a big consideration in the matter of finance, because the cost of collecting from a large number of small people would perhaps be almost as much as might be raised in that way.  For these two reasons this clause was put in.  For the same reasons, it could be argued that 5 lbs. could be raised to 7 lbs. or to 15 lbs. It is a matter of opinion where the particular limit should be set, but, if it would shorten discussion, I would certainly agree to a compromise by making the figure 10 lbs.  In making the figure 10 lbs. that is not only amending the section but also giving an indication of the line I must pursue in the working of the Bill, conditions remaining as I see them.  It must be understood, if there is a change in conditions, that this figure may be changed upwards or downwards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister realises that the sale of 15 lbs. of butter a week would be only the product of a small number of cows, about three fresh cows, after allowing a generous supply for the owner's family.  If the Minister is in a compromising mood, I suggest 12 lbs.  I see the force of the Minister's argument that he should <Col N="1231" /> have power to make regulations disregarding either 10 lbs. or 12 lbs.</P>

      <P>I do not question your ruling, Sir, in the matter working out as it does, but I think I have a grievance. A point was made about saying time, particularly when the question was debated previously for over three hours.  In my innocence, I rose to suggest a compromise and thought the Minister would undertake to put down an amendment.  I did so in good fath. The Minister rather torpedoed my amendment by coming in with one.  I do not say that he did so intentionally, but I think it would be fairer to have discussed my amendment and to arrange on whatever the House agreed on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>My strong point is that we need a figure higher than 5 lbs. That is a ridiculous figure, in this way, that it does not prescribe an average of 5 lbs. a week all the year round, <Col N="1232" /> but says 5 lbs. any week.  I want to make a case for the person with two or three cows who has a few lbs. of butter for sale during a few weeks of the year.  We saw that difficulty on a previous amendment.  The lower the figure the more the difficulty is accentuated. The idea underlying this question of raising the figure from a small one is that we cut out insignificant amounts and look after people with a substantial amount of butter for sale. In putting the figure 15 lbs. in the amendment, I did so, so that we could discuss it and come to an arrangement. If the figure is kept low there is more encouragement for evasion.  The House seems to have awakened to a very keen sense of the difficulties that arose in many other Acts that were passed, where the outlook was towards evasion.  When the figure is low it opens the door to evasion and would lead to the wearing of mantillas which I believe is still common in parts of County Cork.  If the Minister raises the figure substantially I suggest there will not be the same encouragement to evasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexHaslett" hpid="Mr. Haslett Mr. Haslett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>There is also this consideration, that if the figure is kept low it is people who are selling only a few pounds of butter and who need the money most will benefit.  We cannot follow people with 4 lbs. of butter because the amount collected would be insignificant and the game would not be worth the candle.  We are creating an impossible situation if we pass legislation which will become ridiculous in the eyes of the people, seeing that they can easily evade it.  I agree with Deputy Belton that the figure should be raised.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Belton's suggestion that the figure should be 12 lbs., which would simply represent four or four-and-a-half gallons of milk, seven days of the week, on every farm.  If there was any little advantage to be given by fixing the figure at 12 lbs. the Minister and the House should not object to giving <Col N="1233" /> it to small farmers, so that they could, if they wished, dispose of a few pounds of butter.</P>

We should not make the figure too small.  This is an industry on which a great many industries hinge.  I strongly appeal to the Minister to fix the figure at 12 lbs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputies who have been discussing this amendment seem to be under the impression that the small producers were the only people who made home-manufactured butter. I would like to point out to Deputy Haslett that the creameries in his constituency and mine depend largely upon the three-cow type of supplier, the man to whom Deputy Belton has referred as the supplier of milk.  While it is all very well to come in here and ask that the figure be raised from 5 to 7, from 7 to 10 and from 10 to 12 lbs., I think Deputies should not forget that the small suppliers to creameries who are assisting and helping and contributing to the stabilisation of prices, should not be asked to do so while their neighbours who are on a par with them are to be permitted to get away with the sale of 10 lbs. or 12 lbs, of butter per week.  In discussing this whole question that should be kept in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know as a result of the Stabilisation of Butter Prices Act in my constituency that a number of small farmers took advantage of that Act and withdrew from those creameries their supplies of milk.  They changed over to manufacturing their milk into butter at home.  They took advantage of the increased price as a result of this Stabilisation Act.  In discussing that matter with them, I pointed out that they were doing an injustice to their neighbours, and they replied naturally, &ldquo;As long as your Government permit me to do this, why should not I take advantage of it?&rdquo;  It is all very well to talk about the small <Col N="1234" /> farmer who is producing a certain amount of butter at home and wants to sell it.  It is all very well to try to make him immune from the result of the stabilisation of prices, but remember you are asking other small farmers, his neighbours, to make a contribution to effect that stabilisation of prices. As far as I can see, and my constituency is affected in this matter, I think the gesture of the Minister is quite fair.  I do not think he should agree to go any further than he has indicated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Sometimes when I hear Deputies on the Fianna Fáil Benches talking about small farmers I ask myself have the small farmers of this country become lice on the body politic.  Hear the patronising tone of Deputy Smith about small farmers and his telling us that they say: &ldquo;As long as your Government permits us to do this why should we not take advantage of it?&rdquo;  Is it really a crime in this country to earn your living?  Is every small farmer to go hat in hand and to kneel on bended knee before Deputy Smith and his colleagues of the Fianna Fáil Party before he is permitted to earn a living for his family? What crime is it that the small farmer should try to make the most profit out of his business of buttermaking when every other part of his business has been ruined?  Why should this House enter into a conspiracy now to destroy the one small industry in which the farmer can make a profit?  Are the remaining farmers to be brought under the yoke of Deputy Smith and his colleagues? Have they to crawl to these Deputies in order to be permitted to make a living?  Sometimes it makes me sick to hear farmers' representatives craving indulgence from the Minister to be allowed to sell a couple of pounds of butter in order to support their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One wonders sometimes whether all sense of justice has died out of our people.  One wonders has all sense of independence died out of them.  It appears the more we are trampled and the more we are kicked and the more we are crushed down, the more we are inclined to feed out of the hands of <Col N="1235" /> those who are trampling on us.  The Minister for Agriculture, of course, should fix no limit on these people as to the amount of butter they should sell.  I will not oppose the proposal to increase the figure to 12 lb., because I want to spare the people as much suffering as I can; but this much I will say&mdash;that I would never ask the Minister for a concession in this matter, because I think it is an outrage to impose this tax at all.  But 12 lb. will be less oppressive and less offensive than 7 lb.  I ask the House to bear in mind that, having made this gesture here on this matter, every pound of this limit can be taken away, by Order, at the Minister's own whim. Whether it is 7 lb. or 3 lb. or 12 lb., if the Minister wants to make the production of farm butter uneconomic as he is about making the production of pigs uneconomic, he can do it.  This House need not lay the flattering unction to its soul that by making it 12 lb. instead of 7 lb. they are doing something beneficial for the people. They are not.  All they are doing is they are creating false hopes in the people.  They are creating in the people a false sense of confidence that they are all right&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wish to draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that this section as to the quantity of butter the farmer can sell is passed and that the question now before the House is whether the limit is to be 5 lb. or 7 lb. or 12 lb. or 15 lb.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Not against the section, but I want to point out that any such gesture on the part of the Minister is nothing more than a fraud.  It does not matter two hoots what figure he inserts.  The Minister himself admits it is only a pious hope on his part.  What I want to make clear is that Deputy Victory and Deputy Gibbons and other <Col N="1236" /> Deputies getting up here and asking the Minister to spare the small farmer&mdash;these crawlings to the Minister for concessions are merely an attempt to pull the wool over the eyes of the small farmer; because these Deputies know that having got that gracious concession from the Minister that that gracious concession can again be taken away by Order. As soon as it suits the Minister for Industry and Commerce to kick the Minister for Agriculture, the Minister for Agriculture will have to change his tune.  He will bow down as he has done before to the will of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The first time that President de Valera cracks his whip and says that he thinks that it is about time that some more of the small farmers should be put into the front line trenches, the Minister for Agriculture will issue the Order taking this concession away.  He will betray the people to whom he is responsible as he betrayed them before.  That is why I object to the farmers appealing to the Minister for this concession.  This measure puts every butter producer in the country in the power of the Minister.  I would not ask the Minister for 2 ozs., because I know that any concession he makes now is absolutely useless.  It can be taken away to-morrow.  So far as I am concerned I have not the slightest interest whether the figure is fixed at 5 lb. or 12 lb. or 15 lb.  It is all going to amount to the same thing in the end.  It is immaterial to the farmers what figure is put in now.  The Minister will have to take some figure, 7 or 5 or 12.  I want to ask the Minister whether, in fixing this figure as to what the farmer will be permitted to sell, will that permit a person who is allowed to sell 5, 7 or 12 lb. a week to collect the butter over a period and sell a firkin of butter if it is not for re-sale by the person to whom it is sold; say if the butter is for the use of a baker or some such person for use in Saorstát Eireann?</P>

      <P>I would be as slow to run away from a scrap as anybody. Fighting on my own account, however, is one thing, and I realise that we are here with power vested in us by others. In the circumstances, I think the attitude of Deputy Haslett, Deputy Gibbons and Deputy Victory reflects the opinion of the constituents of those Deputies.  I cannot say it reflects the opinion of the people who sent me here, because I represent a city constituency. I am quite sure it reflects the opinion of Deputy Victory's constituents, because he represents my native county.  I would, therefore, make an appeal to the Minister, as this only means 2 lbs. more of butter in the week and would make a substantial difference, to reconsider the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1238" /> The Minister appreciates what it would cost to inspect the premises of such producers to see that they do not sell over a certain amount of butter. The higher he makes the maximum that may be sold, the less inspection will be necessary.  The Minister appreciates that the game will not be worth the candle, as if the 5 lbs. is left in the Bill it is coming down to the one-cow man.  I, therefore, would make an appeal to the Minister on this matter, not that I am going on my knees to him or the Fianna Fáil Government, but because we are in the position that the Minister can get the authority of this House for 5 lbs., 7 lbs., or 12 lbs.  I realise that position.  When a man puts a pistol to my head and my hands are behind my back, that is not the time for me to say, &ldquo;I will knock your head off.&rdquo;</P>

I would, therefore, ask the Minister to make it 12 lbs.  The 2 lbs. difference between is not worth all this talk.</P>

      <P>The spectacle of Deputy Dillon being so intoxicated with the exuberance of his own verbosity so early this morning is more pathetic than otherwise.  The Minister has shown a disposition to meet the suggestion of Deputy Haslett very fairly.  This suggestion was first mooted by Deputy Haslett on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  He did not mention the precise figure to which the exemption limit should be raised, but he said &ldquo;either double or treble it.&rdquo;  Fianna Fáil Deputies are quite as solicitous for the welfare of that important person immortalised by Clarence Mangan, &ldquo;The Woman of Three Cows,&rdquo; as any Deputy on the Opposition Benches.

Deputy Smith has voiced a viewpoint which is rather important in counties such as Monaghan, where there are creameries supplied by farmers with a small number of cows. You have, therefore, to visualise the position in its entirety, and as the Minister has had an opportunity of considering the matter fully, I think we should leave it to the Minister and not press it any further.</P>

Why he did not immediately get up and say: &ldquo;I accept 15 lbs.&rdquo;  I do not know, because he made it clear that at the very best this was a kind of vague figure.  May I point out to the Minister that a short time ago his information as to the <Col N="1241" /> existing conditions led him to suggest 5 lbs.  Now the Minister changes his views every week.

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so, and that is why I refer to the implication of the three amendments.  Amendment No. 1 proposes to delete from sub-section (3) the words before the 25th January, 1935.  The Minister by his Bill, as at present framed, is depriving people of rights when they have established their claims before the courts in respect of certain injuries as a result of posts being erected and which a court has decided to be an obstruction or a nuisance. The Minister interposes in this matter simply because a decision has been given in the courts to the effect that certain people have rights and are entitled to certain compensation.  The insertion of the words &ldquo;25th January, 1935,&rdquo; in this sub-section here was to exclude persons who have such rights <Col N="1250" /> from exercising those rights prior to the date upon which this Bill becomes law.  There are certain cases in which a number of people have already taken legal proceedings to establish the rights they have by law.  There are persons who have received serious injuries and they have to establish before a court the fact that they have suffered those injuries and the particular circumstances in which they were received. They cannot go successfully to the courts with their claims unless they do establish the fact that they have received these serious injuries and have received them in certain circumstances. We are dealing with a limited number of cases of persons who suffered injuries and incurred them explicitly as the result of some of the Electricity Supply Board's acts.  In these circumstances I think it is unreasonable that the Minister should cut off rights from persons who were injured, in this particular way, from a date prior to the date on which this amending Bill becomes law.  I ask the Minister to recognise that is the position and to accept amendment No. 1.  If that amendment is accepted these rights will be guaranteed when this Bill becomes law.  The Minister may make a case against the amendment. This Bill was introduced on the 11th of April and he may argue that between the 11th of April and the date of the passage of this Bill claims which were not substantial, or were frivolous, might be made in fairly large numbers, although I do not think that there are a large number of cases that will come before the court.  The Minister might argue that he already had given warning to all concerned that the rights, if they existed, which they had and which it was expected they would have when the original legislation was passed would be withdrawn.  The Minister might have some case for refusing to accept No. 1 while agreeing to accept No. 2, but I think in legislative fairness to people who have certain rights, and particularly to people who suffered injury as the result of the public action of the Electricity Supply Board, it is quite unreasonable to withdraw <Col N="1251" /> those rights before legislation has been passed withdrawing them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's argument is based on two assumptions: first, that it is proper and right to take action against the Electricity Supply Board in consequence of the Board having erected poles for the support of transmission lines in roads and streets, and, secondly, that it was the intention of the Oireachtas to give that right, and that, in fact, it was given by the Act of 1927 and that now it is being taken from them.  Neither of these assumptions is correct.  I do not think that there is any doubt that the Oireachtas in 1927 intended to confer upon the Board power to erect those poles, and the Board acted on the assumption that they had that power. At no time was its power questioned between the period that intervened between the constitution of the Electricity Supply Board and the 25th day of January this year.  A decision was given by a certain Circuit Court Judge in an action taken by a Miss Creegan and the decision was that the Act of 1927 did not in fact, either explicitly or by implication, confer that right upon the Electricity Supply Board and that, consequently, these poles were a nuisance.  That was the situation which had to be remedied at once.  No one could contemplate the possibility of that situation being allowed to continue when the Board would be subject to actions in respect to every pole erected.  In this legislation, as introduced, there is the retrospective effect that the law is and should be deemed to be as the Oireachtas in 1927 intended it should be.  But we are preserving the interest of the lady who was successful in the Circuit Court if her case is upheld on appeal.  The appeal has not yet been heard, but in the event of her winning that appeal she is secured in the damages awarded to her.  But apart from that the intention is that the law should be put into the position that it should be in when the Act of 1927 was framed, and that its operations should be retrospective so as to protect <Col N="1252" /> the Board from a very large number of cases that might be brought against them.  I think it would be inadvisable to accept any of the amendments in the Deputy's name.  No other case has come on in the interval although I understand certain actions are contemplated.</P>

      <P>I might be prepared to agree, but, I submit, that question cannot be raised on this Bill.  This Bill deals only with Sections 51 and 52 of the Act of 1927, which gives the Electricity Supply Board the right to <Col N="1253" /> erect poles in the streets and on the roads, subject to consultation with the local authorities.  The wording apparently was defective, because when Miss Creegan took her case to the Circuit Court Judge Davitt decided that the section did not give that power to the Board.  If this lady should be successful on appeal we will protect her rights if that appeal is upheld.  Deputy Mulcahy's amendments would give similar rights to anyone who proceeded against the Board before the 11th of April.  There are three alternatives.  I do not think it possible to agree to any of them, nor do I think we are depriving any persons of their rights.  It is purely an accident that the power to take this action arose at all.  The intention of the Government in 1927 was clearly to give power to the Electricity Supply Board to erect these poles and, if that intention had been properly expressed in the Act of 1927, no such action could have arisen.</P>

      <P>I had not intended to intervene in the debate on this amendment until I heard the Minister.  He is not correct in saying that he is not depriving the people of a right.  They have the right, according to the law as it stands.  That right is being taken from them.  Although I quite admit that the interjections of Deputy Good might not, at this particular stage, be quite relevant to what we are discussing, they may furnish a motive for refusing the Minister the powers he now asks.  Technically, I object to the Minister or the Electricity Supply Board or anybody else, except the judges, deciding what was the intention of this House.  Once a Bill becomes an Act, nobody but the courts can decide what the intention of the House was.  The Minister's argument is entirely invalid.  The Minister is depriving the people of a right that they have enjoyed up to the present.  Therefore, the measure is, to that extent, retrospective.  The Minister is, I quite admit, preventing the Act becoming retrospective so far as certain individuals are concerned.  One individual has brought an action.  I suggest that every person is in the <Col N="1254" /> same position as that individual and should be treated in the same way.</P>

There is only one method of arriving at what our intentions were, that is by a decision of the court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. It is well known that the immunity <Col N="1255" /> of the State in actions of this kind is almost complete.  For once, I suppose, in the whole history of the State, that immunity is being broken through.  There is an opinion that Government Departments in general should be made liable in actions of tort, but there is an immunity in that respect at present, except for the provisions of the Road Traffic Act.  In this case, that immunity is being broken through, and it seems to me absurd that the Minister should argue that there was any intention behind the principal Act other than the intention to be gathered from the words used in the Act.  As Deputy O'Sullivan has said, it is for the courts to determine what the intention of the principal Act was.  In this particular case, the learned Circuit Court Judge has found that the power to put these poles up on public streets and roads does not exist.  I do not know what intention the Minister has, but one can easily imagine that several solicitors throughout the country are instructed at the moment in respect of claims.  Let us take it that there is only one case in which instructions have been given to a solicitor.  Some person, let us say, has been injured by reason of something done in violation of the powers given to the E.S.B. It does seem to me to be hard on the person thus injured to say that his right is to be taken away by retrospective legislation.  I do earnestly ask the Minister to reconsider this Bill and also the question as to whether or not he will accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Road Traffic Bill first came before the House, there was a very considerable volume of opinion on all sides that the State should be made liable for accidents caused by its servants in a way in which it had not been liable before.  The Traffic Act was finally put through by the Minister's Party and a clause was embodied in it which carried out the expressed intentions of the Fianna Fáil Party and met the wishes of the House fairly generally whatever doubts they <Col N="1256" /> might have about the difficulties and objections that might arise in carrying it through.  But the State was liable.  I do not want to go into the question as to whether we can argue here and now was to what the intention of the Dáil was, but the Minister is quite wrong if he attributes to me the opinion that the Dáil did not at the time of the passing of the original Act wish to give the E.S.B. powers to put up poles.  I would have thought it an absolutely necessary thing to do at the time.  It was not done, within the terms of the Act, in the opinion of the Courts.  One person, at least, went before the courts and established his right there to compensation for injuries received.  Now the Minister states that no other cases have been brought before the Courts, but I am afraid he cannot be fully informed on that.  I think I am correct in saying that additional cases were instituted against the E.S.B. prior even to the date of the introduction of this Bill, and I would suggest that the reason for its introduction is that additional cases were instituted against the E.S.B.  I quite agree that the Dáil now wishes at the earliest possible moment to put the E.S.B. into the position that it can erect poles and standards in the public streets after consultation with the local authority concerned.  But I do not think that in doing that this House wants to take away from people who have instituted proceedings against the E.S.B. in the meantime rights that they had.  These people have incurred expense in a particular way because of serious injury caused arising out of that.  I do not think that the House should take away from such people the rights that they have had up to date and before the passing of this Bill.  I do not stand on the date of the Act, but I do stand on the date of the introduction of this measure and of the notice that was given to the public and to all persons who might have these rights that the intention of the Government and of the Oireachtas was that the E.S.B., in order to carry out these works effectively, should <Col N="1257" /> have these rights.  I think that the Minister is asking the House to do a very definite damage, which is quite unnecessary and unworthy of Parliament, by asking the House to pass this Bill as it stands.</P>

      <P>I think we are entitled to draw a reasonable inference from the fact that the Electricity Supply Board since 1927 has acted as if it had this power conferred upon it, and that neither the Government that was in office up to 1932, nor the Government that has held office since, considered it necessary to introduce amending legislation in order to consolidate that power.  However, there is not much to be gained now in having a protracted argument as to whether a change in legislation, which will be retrospective in any case, should exclude cases where proceedings against the Electricity Supply Board have been instituted <Col N="1258" /> from the 25th January or some other date, and if the Deputy feels strongly on the matter I am prepared to accept amendment No. 2.</P>

      <P>Before the section is put, would there be any desire on the part of the Minister to deal with the matter that I raised a few moments ago? Owners of private property feel a grievance with regard to the action of the Electricity Supply Board in erecting poles on their property without prior consultation and in positions that are objectionable because of the situation of their residences.  In that way injury is caused to private property. Now I want something done that, while not causing any hardship in the way of making it compulsory on the Electricity Supply Board, will ensure consultation with the owners of property.  If that is done difficulty will be got over in very many cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very difficult to put that into legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is very desirable that it should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is certainly very desirable that the Electricity Supply Board should exercise its powers with due regard to the interests of the owners of property on which poles are erected.  That has been frequently pointed out to them.  I should say, however, that most of the complaints arose during the early construction period when the Electricity Supply Board was spreading its networks throughout the country.  But recently in the case of minor extensions the complaints received have not been anything like as numerous as heretofore. I do not think I have received a complaint for 12 months with respect to the erection of new poles by the Electricity Supply Board, whereas in the earlier period the complaints were quite frequent.  That may be due to <Col N="1259" /> the change in conditions and also to the fact that many representations have been made to the Electricity Supply Board both by the Department of Industry and Commerce and by private interests throughout the country with regard to the manner in which they were exercising their powers, and I think they are doing their best to conform to the wishes expressed in these representations.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does consultation with the local authority imply consultation as to the route to be taken by a minor extension from one point to another?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no limitation upon the consultation imposed by the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have known instances, certainly one outstanding instance, where a local authority was not satisfied with the route that a line took from one point to another.  It went across fields instead of taking a line along the road, which might be a little longer, but which would have been of great service because it would have provided facilities for people to become subscribers.  No advantage of that sort arose, or could arise, by taking the line across the fields.  I think there should be consultation, too, with the owners of property when erecting poles in a field.  Almost always they are put in the middle of a field.  The piece of land that a pole will take up is not worth speaking about and no landowner has much of a grievance about that, but what he may have a grievance about is the amount of land that may be wasted, especially if the pole is erected in the middle of a tilled field.  I think that, if a little thought were given to the matter, the pole could be just as easily erected near the fence or on the headland and if it were it would cause no obstruction. I think it would be no harm if there was consultation with the local authority as regards the route to be taken in the case of a minor extension.  Of course, in the case of a main extension, <Col N="1260" /> I can quite understand that an engineering line has to be followed. The poles must be erected in the proper place, from the engineering point of view, but I think that in the case of minor extensions attention should be paid to the points that I have brought to the notice of the Minister.  If consultation with the local authority extended to consultation as to the route, the service, and the subscribers that could be got on that route, and also if you would not give the right to the owners of land, as suggested by Deputy Good, to consult with the Electricity Supply Board, surely you ought to give to local authorities the right to consult on behalf of the owners of land within their area.  It is in the subdivisions that the most harm would be done.  I can quite appreciate the difficulty of framing legislation to meet those cases, but I think that the Minister should consider how to overcome that difficulty. In addition, before concluding, I should like to ask the Minister has he got any dossier from the law agent of the corporation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I had better not commit myself on that.  The main Act confers on the Electricity Supply Board the obligation of consultation with the local authority wherever they are erecting poles over the property of the local authority, along the roads or streets, or in the area of the local authority.  There was a certain defect in the drafting of that section, which is being remedied by an amendment here, although the Board has proceeded as if the amendment were there already.  So far as I am aware, there is no limit as to the nature of the consultation that may take place, and it is for the people in Dublin or elsewhere to have their views considered by the City Manager or whoever acts for the Corporation when the next representations are being made to the Electricity Supply Board in that connection.  Of <Col N="1261" /> course, there are a number of matters in which differences of opinion might exist.  Some people say it is better to have the poles erected behind the houses than to have them erected along the road in front of the houses. However, I do not like to give an expression of opinion on that matter but, as far as I know, the Electricity Supply Board will do their best to conform to the wishes of the local authorities in the areas concerned.</P>

The current was at Whitehall, and both the city and county were anxious to light the road to Santry.

The road wants lighting and not a single house can be served without big expense&mdash;more expense, at any rate than any individual owner or occupier of a house would feel warranted in giving; whereas if it were brought down the road, everybody on <Col N="1262" /> the road would have taken in the electric light and I suppose there would be from 30 to 50 subscribers on that road if the line were extended along the main road to Santry.  The Electricity Supply Board has not complained of all the profits they are making, as we all know, but I suggest that it is very hard to make profits if they do not go on the line of business.</P>

In doing so, I think it desirable that the Dáil should understand that this Bill is one of a number which will be introduced for the purpose of regulating the conditions of employment in various occupations. It was originally intended to introduce a measure relating to employment in factories and workshops which would not merely cover conditions of employment but also effect a codification and improvement of the existing Factories and Workshops Code.  It was found, however, that the preparation of such a measure would take a considerable <Col N="1263" /> time, and I considered it desirable to proceed at once with that portion of the proposals which is dealt with in this Bill and to leave until later the portion dealing with the codification of the Factories and Workshops Code. That second Bill, I think, will be ready in time for introduction during the present session of the Dáil, although it is not possible to say that definitely, having regard to the very complicated nature of the Bill and the possibility of difficulties in drafting arising.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Bills are being prepared to effect, in relation to persons employed in commercial occupations&mdash; that is, in shops and so forth&mdash;provisions similar to those which are proposed to be enacted by this Bill in relation to persons employed in factories and workshops.  Arising out of the report of the Commission on the Registration of Shops, certain legislative proposals for the regulation of retail trading are also under consideration. As I informed the Dáil, in answer to a Parliamentary Question this week, a Bill, which it was originally intended should be part of the first measure to be introduced but which, for legal reasons, has to be introduced separately, for bringing the law of this State into conformity with the International Convention for the abolition of night work in bakeries, has also been prepared and will be introduced shortly.</P>
      <P>This Bill does not cover employment in mines, because, in the existing code of laws, mines have been dealt with separately from factories and workshops and, for legal reasons, whatever provisions it is desirable to introduce in respect of employment in mines, must also be dealt with in a separate Bill.  A decision on a legislative provision of that kind, which can be introduced, has been deferred pending a meeting of the International Labour Convention at Geneva next month, when the Convention concerning employment in coal mines is being brought forward for revision.  We will have to take into account the decision made there in considering the introduction of legislation here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole purpose of the series of <Col N="1264" /> measures which we propose is to institute in relation to all occupations, where undesirable exploitation of labour might occur, machinery for the regulation of working conditions, which will prevent abuses, and which will enable the State to exercise a general supervision over these conditions of employment.  It is recognised in all countries at the present time that it is necessary to have such legislation, and that the State must exercise the function of maintaining supervision over conditions in which its citizens are employed.  There are very few countries which have yet adopted legislation of the nature now under consideration here, although progress in that direction has been made in various European Parliaments.  I do not know whether any Deputy will seriously question the necessity for legislation of this kind.  It is now generally agreed that, in modern conditions, the employment of workers and their remuneration cannot be left to be determined solely by the laws of supply in demand.  The great development in industrial employment that has taken place in the past 50 years throughout the world, and that is now taking place here, is bound to produce certain undesirable conditions, if State action is not taken to prevent them.</P>
    <P>Neither do I think it possible to contemplate conditions of employment and the remuneration of labour being regulated solely by trade union action.  The effectiveness of trade unions to deal properly with these matters is limited, and that is particularly so in this country at present, where we have in relation to many classes of workers, rival unions seeking these workers as members; where, I think, it is the general experience of all trade unions that where rival unions operate in relation to any class of workers, trade union organisation deteriorates, the number of workers which belongs to neither union increases considerably, and the power of the trade union movement to secure improvement in working conditions in agreement with employers is naturally lessened.  That situation exists here as well as in <Col N="1265" /> other countries, and it is of such a nature for us, and it exists to such an extent, that we could not possibly contemplate leaving conditions of employment in workshops and factories unregulated by the State or not subject to State supervision, in the hope that in time the abuses would be eliminated by trade union action only. There are in this country, and in every country, employers who will seek to secure competitive advantages over their rivals by employing workers for longer hours, less wages, or in less satisfactory conditions than others.  The effect of such action by any one employer in an industry is generally to reduce the working conditions of all branches of that industry, because in modern life, with the considerable competition for markets which exists between employers in all competitive trades, no employer can for a long time succeed if he maintains a higher standard of working conditions, a higher rate of wages, or shorter hours than other employers with whom he is in competition.  The fact is therefore beyond question, that the worst employer very nearly set the standard of employment in the industry in which he is engaged. That is another reason why it is necessary that the State should be in a position to intervene to prevent any progressive deterioration in working conditions in any industry, in consequence of the desire of a particular employer to secure a greater share of the market at the expense of his competitors and workers.</P>
    <P>The main provisions of the Bill are few in number, and can be easily understood by any Deputy who has read them.  It is proposed to fix in relation to the class of workers covered by the Bill as maximum hours of work those set out in the Washington Hours Convention.  It is true that for the great majority of workers in industry here that part of the measure is not going to make any change.  The 48 hours week is generally recognised in industry, and other provisions of the Washington Hours Convention are, in fact, in operation amongst all good employers in all parts of the country. <Col N="1266" /> There are certain trades which have not yet adopted the 48 hours week as provided for in the Washington Hours Convention, and, in so far as these trades are concerned, the Bill will automatically operate to produce a reduction in working hours.  The Washington Hours Convention provides for the maximum 48 hours per week in industries which are worked in the day time only, and for the maximum 56 hours per week in continuous process industries; that is, industries which must be operated continuously and in respect to which the shift system operates.</P>
    <P>We go further than the Washington Hours Convention in the automatic fixation of maximum hours of work, in providing that for juveniles the maximum working week will be one of 40 hours.  I will deal with that at more length later.  I merely draw attention to it now in order to make it clear that, whereas the main body of the Bill is based on the Washington Hours Convention, in that one respect we propose to go further than was proposed in that convention.  However, in order to prevent misunderstanding it is necessary to make it clear that in fixing these maximum hours of work for industry we are not, at the same time, expressing the opinion that for all industries these maximum hours are suitable.  It is necessary that Deputies should clearly understand that, in that respect, the Bill is fixing what we regard to be the minimum conditions, and it is proposed to take power in relation to any particular industry to make regulations providing for a shorter working week, after consultation with those who are engaged in that industry, whether as employers or employees.  There are, in fact, some industries at the present time where the normal working week is less than 48 hours.  A recent agreement made between the wholesale clothing manufacturers and the trade unions catering for their workers provided for a normal week of 44 hours.</P>
    <P>A 44-hour week has been instituted in other industries by agreement between employers and employees already.  There is no necessity to <Col N="1267" /> amend these agreements in consequence of the passing of this measure.  In fact, it is not improbable that immediately upon the passage of this measure arrangements will be made to bring into consultation in accordance with the Bill the representatives of workers and employers in a number of industries with a view to having arrangements made for the enactment of regulations prescribing a shorter week than 48 hours in respect of these industries.  Certain people who have expressed their views in the press upon this Bill have urged that the Bill should provide automatically in general for a shorter working week than a 48-hour week.  I do not think anybody could possibly contemplate the introduction of a shorter week than a 48-hour week for a general application, without first having a full and complete examination of the effect of the change upon particular industries.  The effect may be serious upon some industries; it may be negligible upon others. The procedure, therefore, proposed in the Bill is to provide for the examination of conditions of each industry by representatives of the Department of Industry and Commerce in consultation with representatives of employers and employees before any regulations are made so that the temporary or permanent circumstances of each industry may be fully considered before any change in working hours is proposed.  I refer to temporary as well as permanent circumstances because there are obviously factors operating at the present time in relation to certain industries which may make it undesirable, if not impracticable, to effect a reduction of working hours.  If there is an industry which is protected by Customs duty or Quota Orders, but which is not quite able to supply the full requirements of the country in the goods produced by it even when operated to the full limit of its existing productive capacity, then it is clear that any reduction in working hours would only have the result of increasing the importation of <Col N="1268" /> such goods until new equipment had been installed or until new workers had been trained.  That shows in some cases what may be the effect of the reduction in normal working hours.  Similarly there are other industries in respect of which that precise set of circumstances might not operate but where other circumstances such as a deficiency in the number of skilled workers and temporary difficulties on the part of employers in finding the capital involved for the purchase of new equipment, would suggest to us to institute any change in the working hours gradually rather than in a drastic manner.  We would also have to consider the effect of a change in working hours in one industry upon another industry in such cases where the product of one industry was the raw material of another.</P>
    <P>The International Labour Conference in Geneva met last year to consider the adoption of a 40-hours working week as a solution of the unemployment problem.  I would like to make it clear that in putting forward proposals for a reduction of working hours I am not doing so primarily because of its effect on unemployment, but because it is desirable. It is a desirable social change which modern circumstances permit us to effect.  It has not been fully established in relation to industries that a general reduction in the working week would increase employment.  There are many factors which might operate in a contrary direction.  One very well known firm of manufacturing druggists and chemists in Great Britain instituted a 40-hour week for their employees some time ago.  They at the same time carried out a rationalisation scheme and made changes in their method of production.  After a time the results were examined by a committee of experts.  I had an opportunity of reading a report of the persons who examined the conditions and the results.  They found that the reduction in working hours plus the rationalisation scheme operated so as to increase the output per individual worker so that they were able to maintain <Col N="1269" /> a much higher output on shorter hours than previously when working in longer hours with the same number of workers.  If the market for that firm's goods had not expanded so as to absorb the increased production, the reduction of working hours might well have resulted in a reduction in the number of persons employed. When one considers the matter from a general view-point it appears that a reduction in hours not accompanied by a reduction in individual earnings need not necessarily increase the general consumption of goods.  Unless there is an increase in the general consumption of goods there will not be any substantial effect upon the volume of employment consequent on the reduction of working hours.  The Americans have been experimenting on this matter for some time past. From the reports to the International Labour Office at Geneva as to the operation of the industrial codes brought into effect it appears that while they secured an increase in the employment in the industries subject to these codes and an increase in payrolls they have not succeeded in securing an increase in production. These increases took place while production was decreasing.</P>
    <P>The conclusion which one might draw from that fact was that the operation of the codes has not had the effect upon the general prosperity of the nation which was at first anticipated because the case for the reduction of working hours was that by increasing employment and consequently increasing the purchasing power of the workers there would be a general stimulation of trade and that more purchases would take place and that this would be reflected in the production of the factories and the employment in the general industries.</P>
    <P>It is, however, unwise to draw any general conclusion from facts of that kind, because other factors were operating which may have had effects upon the general prosperity and the total consumption of goods of which we are not aware, and of which no single individual could attempt to give a precise account.  In any event I am quite <Col N="1270" /> satisfied that in proceeding towards a reduction of working hours on the lines proposed in this Bill, we are proceeding along the best lines and, incidentally, the lines along which the International Labour Conference at Geneva now appears inclined to move.  The draft convention proposed at Geneva last year provided for a general reduction of working hours, but it did not get the necessary majority there to enable it to be brought forward to another stage.  In fact, only eight or nine Governments, including the Free State Government, supported the adoption of such a convention. Even amongst these Governments I do not think there was complete unanimity as to whether a reduction of working hours should take place without a reduction in individual earnings or with a reduction in individual earnings.  But this year, it seems clear that the drive at Geneva will be in the direction of having an international agreement made to effect a reduction of working hours, not over industry generally, but over named particular industries, the facts of which are fairly well known, and are common to all countries.</P>
    <P>A general reduction of working hours accompanied by other measures will, of course, in due course produce an improvement in the employment situation. But I want to make it clear that I am not banking upon any such policy as a solution of our unemployment problem.  It will help us towards a solution of that problem, but it will not by itself solve it.  The main argument in support of that reduction is that it will improve the working conditions of persons employed in industry.  It will enable them to share in the benefit of technical improvements.  It will prevent the full benefit from any technical development going to the employers in an industry.  It will permit us to secure that the workers will also share by a reduction of their hours of labour and an increase in their leisure.  In doing that, we will, of course, be able to secure to some extent that future technical developments will not be immediately accompanied by a reduction in employment, as they have been in the past.  In that respect, it <Col N="1271" /> does also help us to deal with our unemployment situation.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes that where any reduction in working hours takes place, either in consequence of the general provisions of the measure, which apply automatically to all industries, or because of special regulations made to govern working conditions in a particular industry, there shall not be any reduction in the weekly earnings of the workers concerned.  That is a somewhat difficult provision to frame in a form which will be watertight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Where there is an hourly rate, will it go up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It can be done obviously without much difficulty when making special regulations.  In that case, you have the representatives of the workers and the representatives of the employers together and you frame your regulations in consultation with them, and, consequently, you can make, under these regulations, or under another section in the Bill, the necessary arrangements which will give effect to the intention of preventing any reduction in individual earnings. It is where the automatic provisions of the Bill may involve a reduction of working hours that difficulties may arise.  We think we have got over those difficulties in the relevant section, but if that should prove not to be the case, it will obviously be desirable that the Department should have an alternative method of approach, and that is provided for in the section dealing with the registration of agreements.  The clear intention is that any reduction in the number of hours worked by any worker in consequence of the Bill should not result in a reduction in the amount of money received by that worker for a week's work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as this Bill, therefore, relates to working hours, and is designed to effect a reduction in working hours, it does so by two methods: (1) instituting as a general maximum for all classes of workers covered by the Bill the hours permitted by the Washington Hours Convention of 48 per week in day industries and 56 in <Col N="1272" /> continuous process industries, with a maximum of 40 hours per week for juvenile workers; and (2) by giving power to make, in relation to any particular industry, in consultation with those engaged in it on each side as employers and employees, special regulations providing for shorter hours than the maximum permitted by the Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Washington Convention permits of 56 hours work for workers engaged in continuous process industries where three shifts are working.  It is clear why 56 hours is arrived at there.  If you take the number of hours in a week and divide them by three, you arrive at the maximum hours which one person upon any one shift may work.  But there are various regulations in the Bill designed to ease that position, such as the regulation which requires that he must have one completely free day in the week, and that certain rest periods will operate, etc.  That is the general practice at the present time in all these industries.  It is the practice which is permitted by the Washington Forty-eight Hours Week Convention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite.  It will continue to operate in these industries, unless and until, as a result of consultation with the parties concerned, special regulations providing for a shorter week are brought into force, as might well happen, in fact, in a number of these industries.  In other countries, where special circumstances operate, they have sometimes instituted four shifts instead of three in the day and, consequently, got a much shorter working week than anything provided in this Bill.  The general tendency of the Bill is to discourage the working of shifts except where the industry is of such a nature that shift work is obviously necessary. Flour milling is a case in point. Another one would be, say, a glass works, where once the glass is melted in the tank the work must go on continuously day and night while that glass is there.  There are quite a <Col N="1273" /> number of other industries in respect of which it is obvious that you could not have an interruption of work and resume next day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree.  We intend to bring in a Bill to prohibit night work in bakeries.  Until quite recently there was no night work being done in bakeries here.  The general practice which arose from trade union action in the past, and which still operates in Dublin and the major cities of the Saorstát, has been to abandon night-work in bakeries altogether, but in consequence of the development of the bakery business in the Northern Counties, consequent on the tariff on bread from Northern Ireland, and the inability of the bakers there working one shift to supply the full requirements of the countrysides concerned, night-work was resumed.  But the Department gave due notice at that time to everybody engaged in the business that it was intended to ratify the Convention.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite: I said that there are only three main provisions in the Bill.  The first is restriction of working hours; the second is registration of agreements; and the third is restriction of the employment of juveniles and women.  The provision in the Bill for the registration and legal enforcement of agreements made between employers and employees is a new one.  Again, I think the necessity for that provision is fairly obvious.  It has frequently occurred in the past that the majority of employers and the majority of employees in a particular industry were prepared to make an agreement providing for certain rates of wages, certain hours of work, and other conditions, but could not make that agreement effective because a small number of employers refused to conform to it, and were able to get workers to work <Col N="1274" /> at rates of wages less than those provided for in the agreement.  Consequently, the fact that a minority of employers held out, and operated lower rates of wages or imposed worse working conditions, made it impossible for the majority of employers to institute the conditions which they desired, because by doing so they would place themselves at a serious competitive disadvantage as compared with the others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument might be advanced that that is a situation which could be left to be dealt with by trade union action, but against that I contend that we have had evidence in the past that trade unions are not always capable of giving effect to those agreements in all cases, and that in any event the ability of individual employers here and there to stand out from a general agreement has meant a deterioration rather than a continuing improvement in working conditions in their industry. I was rather surprised to see a statement in the Press from the Secretary to the Irish Trade Union Congress in relation to this provision of the Bill, the meaning of which statement, however, I hope I misunderstood. Mr. Eamonn Lynch, in a statement published in the <i>Irish Press</i> of the 10th of this month said that, by registration, large sections of workers would have legal enforceability of wages which would render trade union activity unnecessary, and that their experience has shown in this regard, both under the Agricultural Wages Board when it was in existence, and other modern trade boards, that such legal sanction militated against active trade unionism.  If I interpreted that correctly to mean that the Irish Trade Union Congress, or its National Executive, are opposed to this section providing for the registration of agreements because it is going to secure for workers the conditions which trade unions want to secure, without the necessity for trade union activity, then I think that the National Executive of the Trade Union Congress should reconsider its position very seriously.  It is obviously in the interests of workers that they should be able easily to secure the enforcement of the conditions <Col N="1275" /> agreed upon by their trade unions in negotiation with their employers, and that they should not have to resort to strike action or other action of that kind, even if it does mean that there will be less work for the officials of those unions to do.</P>

      <P>However, there is no use in pursuing that line, except to make it clear that in proposing that that legal enforceability of agreements should be enacted in this measure I am not aiming at interfering in any way with the effectiveness of the trade union movement.  I am aiming at securing for workers, without difficulty and with the support of the law, conditions which the trade unions themselves desire to see in each industry. I think that that provision is one which trade unionists should welcome, as it represents a decision on the part of the State to co-operate with them in improving the conditions of workers in all industries.</P>

Of course there is not and never will be an objection to an employer paying more to his workers than the trade union standard rate of wages.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Those circumstances have arisen very often.  I do not think circumstances will ever arise in which an employer will resort to the legal power conferred on him by this section to enforce an agreement of that kind. He himself will be required to conform to that agreement, and it will be of his own volition if at any time he decides to give a higher rate of wages or to concede better working conditions.  The effective use of this section will be in the hands of the workers, particularly the workers in perhaps some individual factory, where the standard rates of wages and the standard conditions are not being observed.  They are given the right to recover from the employer, as a simple contract debt, the amount of any underpayments of wages.  I am quite satisfied that the great majority of employers will welcome that section. The majority of employers have no desire to pay low wages, or to impose bad conditions on their workers.  Even some of those who are doing so are only doing so because they are being forced to do so&mdash;if they wish to maintain their positions in their industries&mdash;by the activities of other firms which have set a lower standard.  In quite a number of cases the employers have, in fact, come to the Department of Industry and Commerce asking that some means should be found by which the conditions of employment which they have agreed to with their men, and which they are putting into operation, should be enforced upon other employers in the same trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1277" /> References have often been made here to the rather unsatisfactory conditions which have arisen in the furniture industry, where a very large number of small concerns has come into existence, frequently in defiance of the existing factories code, and are operating under conditions which nobody would consider reasonable, the result of their activities being to decrease employment and lessen the effectiveness of the properly organised and properly conducted factories. Under the existing law we have found considerable difficulty in securing the enforcement of the very limited regulations which have been made, principally because district justices can very rarely be induced to impose what most people would regard as a reasonable fine for offences under these Acts.  It is usual to read of an offender being let off with a caution, given the benefit of the First Offenders Act, or dealt with in some way which imposed no penalty on himself and he goes back and continues as before, very frequently operating unprotected machinery to the danger of the lives and limbs of his employees.  That is something that we will deal with in the Factories and Workshops Bill which is to follow this one, but it can be mentioned, in so far as it is desirable, in relation to these industries particularly, that we should be in a position to enforce standard conditions of employment so as to prevent good employers and properly organised concerns being damaged in their trade by the activities of undesirable institutions.</P>
    <P>The third main provision of this Bill deals with the restrictions upon the employment of juveniles and women. I want to make it quite clear what the Government's attitude is in respect to the employment of juveniles.  By juveniles I mean persons over 14 and under 18 years of age.  Such persons must be employed.  It is not contrary either to Christian civilisation or good economic organisation that such persons should be employed.  In my opinion it would be very unsocial legislation if we were to introduce a Bill to prevent such juveniles being employed in industry.  They must be employed somewhere and it is eminently <Col N="1278" /> desirable, if they are going to make their living in industry, that they should come in at an early age so as to get the industrial training which will enable them to succeed.  The one thing which we must take care to prevent is the possible development of blind-alley occupations; that is, the establishment of industries upon the basis of employing juveniles only. Where a juvenile goes into an industry in which he is going to remain all his life, passing from one grade of employment to another until he is an adult and getting an adult man's wage for skilled work, there can be no objection to juvenile employment; but where a particular industry is established on the basis of employing children of 14 years and dismissing them when they become 16 or 18 years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, when they become insurable.  That is an undesirable development which we should aim at preventing.  We must be clear in doing so that we are going to provide for the substitution of these people by other people in employment.  It is possible there are some industries which have been established on the basis of an organisation which sells goods at a low cost and which would disappear if the cost of those goods had to be increased.  In relation to these industries we have to consider whether or not they are worth having. We may decide they are not worth having and deliberately wipe them out of existence.  But in the majority of cases it will be found the industries are desirable and they may only require internal organisation and a change in the public attitude in order to get decent conditions established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides for a maximum working week of 40 hours for juveniles. That is an important change.  These young persons are not capable of standing the strain of modern working conditions the same as adults, and a maximum week of 40 hours is something which I am sure will receive the support of all Deputies who are aware of the working conditions of a modern <Col N="1279" /> factory.  It is generally very monotonous, very tiring work, and it imposes a considerable strain on the nerves of those engaged in it, and young persons should not be asked to stand that strain for longer than 40 hours until they become inured to it.  It is quite possible if we were not to proceed on that line, if we were to permit existing conditions to continue indefinitely, the effect upon the stamina and the morale of the whole population would in due course become apparent.  We are providing for longer hours for juveniles who are employed in a factory where they are, in a sense, learning their trade, where they are engaged in an occupation which offers opening for them in future life, where they are engaged as assistants to adult workers, adult workers whose places they hope to take when they themselves become adults.</P>
    <P>That particular section was criticised from some angles as offering, I think the phrase was, a means by which the Government might avoid having to put a general 40-hour week regulation into operation.  I would like to give the exact phrase, but I have not got it at the moment.  It is quite clear that in certain cases it is absolutely essential that we should have that power, because in some industries it may be that unless juveniles were available as helpers and assistants to adult workers the work could not proceed.  Where that is so we can authorise the working up to 48 hours of these juveniles, subject to whatever conditions the Minister for Industry and Commerce thinks fit to impose in order to safeguard the general intention of this legislation.  The power to restrict or prohibit the employment of juveniles in any industrial pursuit is one which must be exercised in consultation with the representatives of the employers and employees and it is a power which, I think, should be there so as to enable some authority to be in a position to say that a certain class of work is of a nature which should not be performed by juveniles in the interests of the juveniles themselves and in the interests of good industrial conditions generally.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1280" /> The same is true in respect of the employment of women.  That particular portion of the Bill has been rather violently attacked by the representatives of the Irish Women Workers' Union and others who obviously misunderstood the intention of it.  The statement on behalf of the Irish Women Workers' Union that any attempt to restrict or limit the employment of women was an infringement of the rights of women, who had been given equal rights by our Constitution is, I think, one which will not stand examination.</P>
    <P>Many years ago a British Minister of Labour introduced, and got passed in the British House of Parliament, a Bill prohibiting the employment of women underground in coal mines. I do not know that anybody would suggest that that Bill should be repealed here now or would regard it as progress if we were to repeal the Bill.  The particular Minister was so pleased with his measure that he went to South Wales to inspect the coal mines, after the women had been removed from them, and he barely escaped with his life, because the women who had lost their employment pelted him with stones and mobbed him everywhere he went.  I hope that is not going to be my fate, but, in any case, there is a precedent for it.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that there are certain classes of work on which it is undesirable that women should be employed and for which they are not suited.  Certain Deputies from Limerick made representations to me only quite recently with regard to an institution in Limerick in which a woman is employed stoking a boiler. I do not think women should be employed stoking boilers, but, at the present time, there is no power anywhere to prevent women being employed on work of that kind and the purpose of this section of the Bill is to give the Department of Industry and Commerce power to make regulations preventing the employment of women on any class of work on which it is undesirable that women should be engaged.</P>

      <P>After consultation with the interested parties.  Miss Louie Bennett, Secretary of the Irish Women Workers' Union, in a letter to the <i>Irish Press</i> on 14th of this month&mdash;with which I am in complete agreement and I hope that by announcing my agreement, I will convey more definitely than might be possible otherwise exactly how it is intended that the powers under this Bill in relation to women should be exercised&mdash;said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Machinery has taken over in the factory work that used to be done in the home.  Women have followed their home work into the factory and they are not superfluous workers. They are required.  There are many industries for which women are better adapted than men&mdash;textiles, sugar, confectionery and tobacco, for example.  There are also many mechanical processes so monotonous that men find them intolerable. Women endure such monotony with less evil effect upon their nervous system.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>With a lot of that, I am in agreement. There are certain processes in all the industries to which she refers which are at present carried on by men and, in my opinion, should continue to be carried on by men.  The provisions of this Bill, however, are not intended as a device to secure employment for men who are now unemployed at the expense of women who are now employed, but, generally to have machinery established by which industrial employment can be regulated and to arrest any tendency which may develop in future to substitute female for male labour in consequence of alterations in the mechanical methods of production in any industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that, to some extent, large scale employment of women in industry, which has taken place over the past decade or so, has represented the transfer of work that was formerly done in the homes to factories and that women have foldowed their work from the homes to the factories, but that is not the whole truth.  It is very definitely the case that processes which were done by men, and could only be done by men, can now be carried on by women, because <Col N="1282" /> these processes have been mechanised. I think the most recent case, in which we had a strike on that account, was in connection with the clothing trade. In the old days, the pressing of suits of clothes was done by pressers with irons.  They ran a heavy iron over the suits of clothes and put the creases into the trousers and generally smoothed out wrinkles.  A very large number of men were employed in Dublin and elsewhere until our friend, Mr. Hoffman, invented the Hoffman Press which, in the majority of factories at present, is operated by women and which presses clothes much more effectively and quickly than was possible with the old hand-pressers. The institution of these presses has meant the disemployment of a number of these hand-pressers in factories.</P>
    <P>The aim of the Government in such a case would be to continue, if possible, the employment of these men who had been previously engaged in that work, or, in some other way, to secure continued employment in that industry for the men who had been previously engaged in it.  In fact, a number of employers who share that view, to a considerable extent, have endeavoured to fulfil that policy on their own.  Some of them are, in fact, employing men upon their Hoffman presses and paying the recognised rates of wages for male pressers in the industry&mdash;the women workers are, of course, working for less than the standard scale for male pressers &mdash;and others have endeavoured to use the men who are disemployed in consequence of the installation of these presses for other classes of work in their factories.  That tendency to transfer employment from men to women in consequence of mechanical development may take place in any industry at any time, and it is desirable that we should not get altogether into the position in which, I am told, the city of Derry is, where the great bulk of the men stay at home minding the children and the women go out to earn the daily bread.  I remember reading the comments of a newspaper correspondent who had visited Derry, where the shirt factories <Col N="1283" /> and textile factories are the mainstay of the city's prosperity, and all of which employ practically no other persons but women.  There is very little work for the men except to mind the children and look after the households.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And look after the shirts which their wives make in the factories. I do not think anybody will agree that that is a desirable situation.  If there is need for less work to be done; if, because of mechanical development and improvements in the technique of industry, we can get more production of goods with less expenditure of human labour, it is obviously desirable that only those should be called on to expend labour who are best fitted to do it and we should endeavour to take out of the employment market those who, for any reasons, should not be there&mdash;those who are too old, those who are too young, the physically unfit&mdash;and if it comes to a choice between men and women, I would say: &ldquo;Keep the men working and allow the women the benefit of the leisure which comes from these technical improvements.&rdquo; That, however, is entirely different from saying: &ldquo;Disemploy the woman and allow her to draw unemployment assistance in order to give herself a livelihood.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to consider all these problems as they arise and endeavour to work out a solution for each industry in consultation with the persons engaged in that industry.  We cannot apply whatever solution is ultimately decided upon in respect of any industry unless we have the powers set out in the Bill&mdash;the power to prohibit or restrict the employment of women and juveniles as well as power to limit hours, regulate overtime and effect the other purposes for which the Bill provides. I have read carefully and preserved all the statements about the Bill which have appeared in any of the newspapers.  Various employers spoke; various representatives of the Labour Party and Labour interests spoke; and individuals not attached to either side have expressed their views in print. <Col N="1284" /> Some have praised the measure and some have condemned it, but I did not see, in any one case, a valid argument against its introduction or a proposal for its amendment which was not in some way based upon a misunderstanding of the purposes of the measure.</P>
    <P>I was also interested to note the comments which have appeared in various newspapers.  A number have been interested in the measure which represents an innovation in legislation. It represents, according to the <i>Manchester Guardian</i>, a piece of industrial legislation much more advanced than any British Government has dared to attempt and it wishes us success in its enactment and enforcement in the hope that the British Government may be induced to follow suit.  Other foreign papers have also taken considerable interest in this measure because it is, so far as I know, the first time a Government that is still a democratic Government, dependent entirely upon a Parliamentary institution for its power, has endeavoured to make the progress in industrial organisation which this Bill is attempting. Dictatorships can do things which democratic Government cannot attempt but I think the need for this measure is so great, and the common opinion amongst all classes as to its desirability is so pronounced, that we will not be prevented from moving along these lines because of any weakness that may be inherent in our democratic institutions.  We are particularly fortunate, I think, in that respect&mdash;more fortunate than other countries&mdash;inasmuch as the general level of public opinion in relation to these matters is much higher and we have not got the pronounced anti-labour mentality, which is not merely evident in other countries, but also very vocal and influential, and, consequently, we can attempt changes of this kind more easily than might be possible elsewhere, particularly as a very large number of persons who are on the employers' side and are themselves large employees of labour are amongst the foremost advocates of this legislation and have publicly welcomed this measure as a move in the right direction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1285" /> I recommend the Bill to the Dáil.  I recognise it will require careful consideration from all Parties.  I do not propose to rush it through the House, although I am anxious to get it into operation at an early date.  The only ground upon which the Bill could be criticised is the form it takes.  We propose to effect these changes by regulation, and many Deputies have a constitutional objection to that, but in regard to this problem there is no other door open.  The problems and difficulties involved must be examined carefully and separately, and unless we were to have a whole series of Bills, each dealing with a separate industry, there is no alternative except what we propose here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a highly-important and interesting measure, perhaps the most important and interesting that the Government has introduced. On this side of the House we recognise the need for a measure of this kind, and approve of its principle and motive.  We shall have no hesitation in supporting the Second Reading, although we may have some amendments to move on the Committee Stage.  The Minister has well said there is no anti-Labour mentality in this country.  That is true, and we ought to be very glad.  No anti-Labour mentality is ever likely to arise in this country unless mischievous persons succeed in promoting an atmosphere of class warfare.  I hope that day is far off.  Unfortunately, one sees such efforts being made, but up to the present, I do not believe they have really succeeded except in so far as some people manage to mix them up with political and international questions. Therefore, I congratulate the Minister on bringing in this Bill and, as I have said, we shall have no hesitation in supporting the Second Reading. At the same time I feel, though I say it in no carping or cavilling spirit, that we should preserve our sense of proportion, and remember that the number of those that will be affected by this Bill, and come within its scope, is only a fraction of the workers of this country.  Unfortunately, the general policy of the Government, though they <Col N="1286" /> are attempting to provide in this fatherly way for employees in industrial occupations, has resulted in producing continuous and disastrous deterioration in the conditions of those employed in agriculture, which is so much the most important factor in the country's economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read this Bill over at least four times and as a result of a fairly careful analysis of the measure I have come to the conclusion that it marks a very definite step forward in the direction of social legislation in this country.  There are here and there in the Bill some sections which may require, and which I feel do require, amendment.  But the amendments I have in my mind's eye will not in any material way affect the good points scattered here and there throughout the measure.  I feel that some of the sections, notably in Part III of the Bill, will affect in a very large measure bad employers as well as good employers.  They will militate against bad employers and help good employers.  They will tend to level up matters and permit good employers to observe conditions arranged between members of the various trades unions and such employers, and will enable them to compete on equal terms with persons employing labour which is underpaid.</P>
      <P>In Part III of the Bill which, as I say, I regard as the most important, Section 24 allows the short day now fixed being substituted by some other day.  That change may be made after conversation or interview with the Minister.  In that respect I take it the Minister must have had in view the local conditions or the conditions obtaining in Dublin where Saturday might suit as the short day while it might not suit so well in other places.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>No; but what I say is that the Minister might have such change in view.  In some cities and towns Saturday might suit as the short day, while it might not suit so well in other places.  The provision that I regard as most important of all is the one for the registration of agreements. <Col N="1287" /> I cannot conceive of any objection from any section of the House in that respect, particularly from any member of the Labour Party.  I do not suggest for a moment that they are going to make any objection.  I would not refer to this at all except for the extracts read by the Minister from letters appearing in the <i>Irish Press.</i>  It has always been the ambition of Labour representatives to see industrial activity safeguarded in some way by legislative action.  In my view the Minister has gone a long way to meet the express wishes of some of the best trades unionists in this country.  There are other matters to which I should like to refer but, as my time is up, I shall formally move the adjournment of the debate until Tuesday next.</P>
