    <P>It has not been found necessary to take any special steps to invite Irish-speaking candidates, the number of applicants being considerably in excess of requirements.  The selection of suitable candidates is a matter for the Commissioner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>Has the Minister considered the effect on the police force or on the forces of the State generally if recruitment of this kind is to be made exclusively through Fianna Fáil clubs?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that many complaints have been made, particularly in County Longford, to the effect that policies have been and are being lapsed and cancelled on technical points by agents or inspectors of an Irish assurance company with consequent hardship to insured persons and without refund of the premiums already paid, and whether inquiries into those complaints have been or will be instituted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received some complaints of the type referred to, but I have no power to interfere in disputes between insurance companies and their policy holders.  As the law stands at present, such disputes can be determined only in a court of justice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there are instances in this connection that are very close to the conduct of moneylenders&mdash;conduct that was complained of some time ago and for the prohibition of which it was necessary to bring in legislation?  The action of certain insurance agents, in securing policies or getting people to propose or insure people on policies that are not valid, and doing that without the knowledge of their husbands, and things of that kind, which create a considerable amount of domestic uneasiness and hardship, resulting, finally, in many cases, in the arrival of the sheriff for costs and damages on very technical points, is, I suggest on a par with the actions of those who were dealt with in the Moneylenders Bill.  I do not wish to reflect on any reputable insurance company, but I can assure the <Col N="2239" /> Minister that there are very grave hardships inflicted by this kind of thing, and I would ask him to consider the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy will bear the matter in mind when the Insurance Bill is being discussed in the Dáil in the course of this session.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister says, but at the same time that does not relieve the hardships from which people are now suffering, and I would like the Minister to consider some steps that might be taken to relieve these hardships.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state for each county the total amount under (a) the pre-1923 Land Acts, and (b) under the Land Acts, 1923-1933, of Land Commission annuities proper to be paid during the year ended 31st January, 1935, which were outstanding on that date; the amounts similarly proper to be paid during the year ending 31st January, 1934, which were outstanding <Col N="2240" /> on 31st January, 1935; and the amounts similarly proper to be paid prior to the 1st February, 1933, which were outstanding on the 31st January, 1935.</P>

      <P>The reply to the first part of this question is in the form of a tabular statement which will be circulated in the Official Reports.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also asks for particulars of the arrears as at 31st January, 1935, for the year ending 31st January, 1934, but the accounts of the Land Commission are not kept in a manner in which these figures could be readily given and their compilation would involve the expenditure of time and labour which would not appear to be justifiable.</P>
      <P>As regards the concluding portion of the Deputy's question, all arrears of land purchase annuity prior to the 1st February, 1933, were wiped out or funded under the Land Act, 1933.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement referred to:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Statement showing the Arrears of all Gales of Revised Annuities for each County at the 31st January, 1935, in respect of <i>(a)</i> the Land Acts, 1881 to 1909, and <i>(b)</i> the Land Acts, 1923 to 1933:&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesGeoghehan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment of this debate last evening I was about to allude to some of the observations that had been made, suggesting that the Constitution (Special Powers) Tribunal or the Military Tribunal, as it is called, has in recent times so far attracted business, that would ordinarily go to the Criminal Courts, as to diminish the volume of business in these courts.  I think that an examination of the returns of trials before the Military Tribunal will not bear out that assertion.  I cannot recall a single instance of a case that has, in the last year, been tried by the Constitution (Special Powers) Tribunal which was not a case of a very abnormal nature, but however that may be, the Constitution (Special Powers) Tribunal is set up by an amendment of the Constitution itself.  It is embedded in the Constitution, and there it must remain until such time as that Constitution may be amended again.  If it were really relevant to the subject of this Bill one might perhaps suggest that this Courts of Justice Bill might be availed of for the creation of a special jury panel that would take the place of a tribunal such as the Military Tribunal in times of very great excitement and times of political passion, and enable the ordinary Criminal Courts to dispose of extraordinary criminal charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred yesterday evening to the need for some provision being made in this country to aid poor persons in carrying on litigation.  I was speaking about civil cases.  I think we should not lose sight of the even more pressing and crying problem here&mdash;the problem of the poor person charged with an offence which may entail capital punishment or a long period of penal servitude, for whom there is no adequate financial aid to help him in his defence.  Where the charge is murder, there still remains some ancient procedure by which a trivial fee is provided by the Attorney-General for counsel defending a person <Col N="2246" /> charged with that very grave crime.  I think that any member of this House who is a barrister or a solicitor will agree with me when I say that the inadequate remuneration that old procedure makes available has led to the practice of prisoners accused of murder being defended by young and inexperienced advocates.  I put it to the House that that is scarcely right.</P>
    <P>If citizens are suffering from sickness or disease, the community places the very best aid in the way of a physician or surgeon at their disposal, and I think the time has come when a citizen charged with a crime like that should have aid of a similar kind placed at his disposal by the State. As I have said, the only form of help that exists at all is where a person is charged with murder.  He may be charged with manslaughter or with any other crime that one cares to mention and there is no power to give him any help.  Possibly the House might see its way to entrust to the Attorney-General a discretion whereby, on his certificate, any person, whatever the charge against him may be, and who the Attorney-General considers cannot reasonably bear the expense of employing a solicitor or counsel, will receive reasonable aid from the State.</P>
    <P>Another matter that I should have liked to see dealt with in this Bill is a branch of the jurisdiction of the District Court the operation of which one living in the country immediately comes across.  That is the jurisdiction to order persons to enter into recognisances to keep the peace or to be of good behaviour.  I think&mdash;I hope I will be corrected if I am wrong&mdash;that in such a case no right of appeal exists, and I should have liked to have seen a provision in the Bill whereby any person who is ordered to find sureties to keep the peace or be of good behaviour would have the same right of appeal as if he had been fined a couple of pounds or had got a month in jail.  Very often such an order, although it seems in form quite innocuous, is a very great blemish on a person's reputation amongst his friends and acquaintances, and he should, I think, be given the opportunity of having such an order <Col N="2247" /> reviewed by a Circuit Court Judge on appeal.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of criticism directed to the sections of this Bill which deal with complaints regarding the conduct of district justices and the tribunal that would deal with circumstances that might arise making the transfer of a district justice desirable, even though he did not in any way misconduct himself.  Hearing that criticism, I felt rather puzzled because, as the law stands at present, a district justice, on an accusation being made against him, can be brought before a tribunal consisting of the Chief Justice and the Attorney-General.  The tribunal that is set up by this Bill consists of the Chief Justice and the Attorney-General, with the addition of the President of the High Court.  I would have thought that that change is, from the point of view of the District Justice, in principle a change for the better, and that instead of in any way imperilling his independence or security, it affords, by the addition of the President of the High Court for the time being, a very substantial addition to the security that public opinion ensures him in any case.</P>
    <P>Something has been said here about the stenographers who have been employed in the Circuit Court taking notes of evidence for the purpose of the hearing of appeals under the Courts of Justice Act, 1924.  It is now proposed by this Bill to displace that system and to introduce rehearing.  I should like to pay a tribute to the work of those stenographers.  My experience of them is that they have done their work extraordinarily well in very difficult circumstances, and I trust that some means will be found, either in this Bill or in some other measure to provide that they will not be turned out of the public service on the enactment of this Bill.  I think it was Deputy Costello who criticised the clause in this Bill which provides for the hearing of an appeal from a circuit judge and a jury on the judge's notes.  There seems to me to be a good deal of substance in many of those criticisms.  And possibly employment could be found for the court stenographers by having them <Col N="2248" /> employed as clerks in the court, clerks to the judges, making them available, when a case was being heard by a circuit judge and a jury and having their notes of the evidence, thereby avoiding the practical difficulties that frequently arise when an appeal is being heard on the judge's notes. There are not very many stenographers. There are only eight circuits altogether.  These stenographers have now acquired a great deal of facility in dealing with subjects involving technical expressions and procedure.  On their employment some years ago they were already skilled shorthand writers. They are now much more highly skilled still.  I think it would be highly regrettable if the State were to lose the services of this body of men.  If it is not found feasible to employ them in the way I suggest in the Circuit Court in taking notes in jury cases, then they might be attached to the High Court. It might be that the number of cases to be tried in the Circuit Court by a judge and jury are so few that it would not be worth while or economical to continue them in circuit courts.  If that is so, there would be abundant scope for them in the High Court.  The judges who are paid on a much more liberal scale than the stenographers: why should the time of the judge be wasted in taking longhand notes?  Their time is occupied a good deal in taking these longhand notes, and possibly it would lead in the end to economy of public moneys if the stenographers were, on the enactment of this Bill, attached to the High Court and made available to take official shorthand notes of the evidence in all cases tried in the High Court.</P>
    <P>There is nothing else that occurs to me in regard to this Bill, so far as principle is concerned, though there may be a good deal to be said as the sections come before Committee for consideration one by one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the main, this Bill is a machinery Bill designed to do certain things to improve the machinery of the courts.  The ordinary citizen of the country will not be very much concerned with the main principles of the Bill.  What he is concerned with is not what is in the <Col N="2249" /> Bill but what is left out of it.  This Bill is described as a Courts of Justice Bill.  But in dealing with the whole question of the administration of justice in this country and the price at which justice can be obtained in this State, one could well extend a qualifying title to this Bill.  In fact, everybody knows that the courts of justice in this country are open, not to all the citizens of the country, but to such citizens as are fortified with sufficient money to enable them to obtain justice in the courts.</P>
      <P>Dealing with the benefits which the courts confer upon poor people in the country, I must say they confer none at all.  The ordinary poor citizen knows perfectly well that it is quite impossible for him to obtain any justice whatever in the courts.  I know we are told that the courts are open to all; that every aggrieved citizen can go to the court and secure justice through its administration of justice.  But there seems to be about as much truth in a statement of that kind as in telling the people of Gloucester Street that the Gresham Hotel is open to everybody.  If the ordinary person presented himself in the court and asked for justice he would get justice short and sweet, just what the person from Gloucester Street would get if he presented himself at the Gresham Hotel and asked for admission for a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am concerned with in this whole matter is the fact that there is no provision in the Bill and no proposals from the Government to remedy a condition of affairs which deprives the ordinary poor citizen of the protection of the courts or a measure of justice which he is unable to obtain to-day.  Everybody knows that poor people are frequently involved in motor car accidents.  Everybody knows that when travelling through the streets poor people are knocked down by motor cars.  The owner of the car is insured with a powerful and strong insurance company.  The stronger the case the victim has against the owner of the car the greater the resources the company mobilises in order to ensure that the victim will not get the compensation which the Acts of Parliament of the <Col N="2250" /> country provide for in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>Let us take the case of an unemployed poor man with a wife and four or five children.  That man meets with an accident in O'Connell Street, Dublin.  He is knocked down and seriously injured.  Where is that man to get justice?  Can he go to the courts and say he is a poor citizen with no money whatever and can he ask there to secure justice or to obtain compensation for the injury he has suffered? If that citizen so acted, I can only say that his faith in the capacity of the courts to administer justice to him would meet with a very rude shock. The most that man can do is to raise some money and give it to legal folk for the purpose of getting their assistance to plead for justice in the courts.  Again, the measure of legal assistance he will get will depend upon the amount of money he can raise.  If he can manage to secure a goodly sum of money he may get the cream of the Bar to plead his case.  But if he is a poor man and cannot raise the money, then he must be content with somebody to plead his case, somebody to whom an ordinary citizen would not dream of going unless he was similarly impecunious.  There is no provision in the Bill to remedy defects of that and of a similar kind.</P>
    <P>Then there is the case of the tenants of slum houses in the towns of the country.  The landlord may let certain accommodation being conscious of the tenant's acute need of some kind of house accommodation.  That landlord charges the tenant an enormous rent. The tenant finds it extremely difficult to pay that rent.  He might go to the court and ask for a reduction, but since he is unfortunately unable to provide the necessaries of life in the form of foodstuffs for himself and his family, he is clearly unable to provide any money to meet the law costs.  The result is that the slum landlord gets away with charging an exorbitant rent.  Again, there is no provision to deal with cases of that kind or to provide cheap justice for citizens in such cases.</P>
    <P>At an earlier stage this evening the Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="2251" /> replying to Question 6 on the Order Paper told Deputy Seán MacEoin that if policy holders had a grievance against insurance companies because of the way in which their policies had prematurely lapsed, that was a kind of dispute to be determined in the courts of justice.  Imagine the unfortunate man unable to continue to pay his premiums on these policies of insurance because of unemployment, going into the courts of justice as advised by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Imagine that man asking justice from the court in a matter of that kind, when he is not able, by his sheer inability to pay, to engage counsel to argue his case.  That man would lose his case by default.  That is because the insurance company can be relied upon to brief the cream of the Bar in order to get legal sanction for an immoral and illegal thing done against the policy holder.</P>
    <P>My attention was drawn to a case a short time ago where a workman met with an accident in the course of his employment.  He made a claim for compensation on his employer.  The employer had the risk covered with a wealthy cross-Channel insurance company and after considerable delay and when this man had been out of work for at least ten weeks the company offered him £25.  The man showed me the offer which was made to him and he said he thought it was inadequate, seeing that he had been seriously injured and had lost the sight of one eye.  He said to me: &ldquo;What can I do?  I cannot hold out for ever and I think I will be forced to accept this £25.&rdquo;  The man was penniless and I wrote to the insurance company on his behalf expressing the view that the sum offered was utterly inadequate and bore no relation to the injuries which the man had suffered, nor did it compensate him for his diminished earning power.  Following that, the company consented to increase the offer to £50, but even that amount seemed to be inadequate.  Eventually, seeing that the man was badly handicapped for want of money to fight the insurance combine, I recommended him to go to a certain solicitor, to whom <Col N="2252" /> I spoke on his behalf.  As a result of the solicitor taking the case to court and pleading for the man, the judge awarded him £200 compensation and costs.  Contrast that with the original offer of £25 which the man was almost compelled to take because he had no means of compelling the insurance company to pay a higher sum.</P>
    <P>That is a classical example of the way the poor are legally robbed because of their inability to obtain legal assistance in cases of difficulty. I think if the Government introduced a Bill to provide legal assistance for poor people, instituting, as Deputy Geoghegan almost suggested, a kind of legal hospital for people who are legally sick, they would be doing a good day's work from the point of view of many poor and deserving sections of the community.  I strongly urge the Government, if it is not possible to do it in this Bill, to find some opportunity in the near future of taking steps so that legal assistance will be available for people unable to provide for it through want of the wherewithal.  Quite apart from the necessity for providing legal assistance for poor people, there is a strong volume of opinion in the country&mdash;and Deputies know it exists &mdash;that the whole question of justice is bound up with the amount which you can offer for the justice you want to get.  The whole machinery of law is costly and, quite apart from the poorer sections who are unable to pay any money to obtain legal assistance, a large number of other sections of the community, who may be in regular employment, find it difficult to engage in litigation because of the expense involved in briefing the best counsel available.  It is a notorious fact, and virtually every Deputy has experience of it directly or indirectly, that you cannot engage in litigation and you cannot use the machinery of justice unless you have a cheque book in your pocket and a substantial sum in the bank to meet the costs of the litigation. I want to say that much with reference to the absence of provision in this Bill of assistance for needy persons who may be seeking justice through the machinery of the courts, <Col N="2253" /> machinery which this Bill aims at improving.</P>
    <P>There is a section of this Bill which, in my view, is the most serious and the most important section in the whole Bill.  I refer to Section 73 which provides that a verdict of nine members of a jury can provide for punishment in all cases in future in a murder or manslaughter case, or even the kind of case which is probably worse than manslaughter or murder.  A verdict of nine members of a jury is now going to be sufficient to secure the condemnation of an accused person.  Why that section should have got into a Bill described as a Courts of Justice Bill, I do not know.  This section should not be found in such a Bill as this.  The section is entirely foreign to a Bill which purports to improve the machinery of justice.  Why, this is sheer expediency; it is getting quite close to gangster law, not to justice, and I cannot understand on what grounds a section of this kind has been introduced into the Bill.  Certainly the Attorney-General is not in favour of it, if one can judge by his declarations yesterday, and the ex-Minister for Justice did not seem to be terribly enamoured of this particular section. Neither the Attorney-General nor the Minister for Justice has been able to produce a single lawyer on their benches to say a word in favour of Section 73.  It is a highly dangerous section; it is an attempt to trample on the rights&mdash;and he has rights&mdash;of an accused person.  It would be better that 100 guilty people should escape scot free from the penalties imposed by the law, rather than that one innocent person should be convicted.</P>

      <P>I shall have a very easy conscience and will have a less muddled conscience than Deputy Cosgrave when he votes against this measure, because he has already trampled on the principle himself. This section to which I have referred has no relation to justice at all; it is pure expediency.  Under this particular section it is possible for excitement, passions, and all kinds of hysteria to operate in such a way as to get a verdict of nine people out of twelve in favour of the condemnation of the prisoner.  I suggest to the Attorney-General that since no case whatever has been made for this section, it should be deleted completely. Let us get back to the system which has stood for a long time and in which no faults have been found in normal circumstances, irrespective of what might be said in times of special excitement or special commotion or in a state of special emergency.  This is a Courts of Justice Bill and it is going to govern a peaceful situation as well as a war situation until it is superseded by some war-time measure.  In our permanent legislation we ought to make sure that this kind of expediency does not find a place.  I hope, therefore, that the Attorney-General, who is in charge of the Bill for the Government, will undertake to reconsider the <Col N="2255" /> matter and to restore the previous practice which, in my opinion, more adequately safeguards the liberty of the citizen than it is possible to do by the maintenance of Section 73.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.M. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me start the few observations which I wish to make on the Bill by stating that I am in entire agreement with Deputy Geoghegan about an appeal from an order of a district justice binding a person to be of good behaviour and to keep the peace.  An order of that kind is really a slur on the person subjected to it and it is only right that he should have an opportunity of having it reviewed by the Circuit Court.  I am also in agreement with Deputy Geoghegan with regard to the stenographers. They have done their duty very well and they are entitled to the most favourable consideration from the Government.  It would be a pity if they were now thrown out of employment after having done really good work in the execution of the duties entrusted to them.  I also think that provision should be made for poor people who are unable to procure an advocate to lay their case before the courts in certain matters and I am also largely in sympathy with practically all that Deputy Norton has said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main object of the principal Act of 1924 was to cheapen litigation and to bring the courts of justice, more or less, to everybody's door.  I am sorry to say, however, that it did not achieve that object.  It certainly did not cheapen the law and, in many cases, it made the administration of the law far more inconvenient for those who had to have recourse to the courts.  I am sorry that, owing to illness, the Minister for Justice is not here this evening, because there is one specific case, with the details of which he is perfectly conversant, and in regard to which I may say he is quite sympathetic.  I will take now the West Cork area.  The town of Bandon, in the old days, was a centre for the County Courts, and sittings were held there three times a year.  As a matter of fact, on one occasion the Assizes were held there.  Bandon is about 19 miles to the west of Cork and its area <Col N="2256" /> extends to some places which are nearly 40 or 50 miles west of Cork. Bandon, while it has every convenience in the way of courthouses, excellent hotels, and railway and transport facilities of every kind, has been neglected in the appointment of the places where Circuit Courts were to be held.  The Bandon area extends many miles westward to Clonakilty, Rosscarbery and Dunmanway and beyond them, and the result is that the people have to pass Bandon and go to Cork, 19 miles beyond the natural place where the sittings ought to be.  It is a great hardship on poor people, in fact on every class of people, that they have to pass Bandon, where there is every facility and every accommodation, and to go 19 miles beyond it to Cork for the purpose of getting justice.  That is a matter that ought to be remedied under the present Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to the section that has been debated so much in public and in the Dáil which refers to the nine-member verdict, I assume from the remarks made by the Attorney-General and the ex-Minister for Justice last evening that the Government will proceed no further with that obnoxious section.  I am sure that they will drop it at once because they know that the good sense and the feeling of the whole community is against it.  There may be occasions of great civil commotion or times of special stress and national conflict when there might be some excuse for such a provision; but at the present time such a provision, in my humble opinion, is entirely and absolutely uncalled for and one that will be condemned by the whole electorate.</P>
    <P>There is one section on which I wish to say just a few words and that is Section 49, dealing with the district justices.  Let me start by saying that the district justices have done very good service to the State. I do not think there is anybody in this House or outside it who can reasonably contradict that statement. They live in the area where they function and I think there is no class of people entrusted with the administration of the law entitled to more ample <Col N="2257" /> protection and security of tenure than the district justices.  I do not care what the law has been up to this, it is my firm opinion that the district justice should have the very same rights and be entitled to the very same privileges as every judge of the Supreme Court, High Court or Circuit Court.  There is no reason why he should not get the same rights. When there is hanging over a justice a provision of this kind he is, more or less, in the position of the old tyrant Damocles&mdash;I do not use that word in any opprobrious sense&mdash;over whose head the sword was always hanging.</P>
    <P>Up to this there were certain provisions by which a district justice might be removed from office in certain circumstances. Let us see what the new section provides.  First of all, it sets up what I call a vigilance committee consisting of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court, and the Attorney-General.  I am sure that they are very able, independent and impartial gentlemen, and that not one of them has any anxiety whatever to act on a committee of this description. This committee having been set up, the section goes on to say: &ldquo;The Minister for Justice may at any time, on his own motion or in consequence of complaints or representations made to him, refer to the said advisory committee the question of the fitness of any particular justice of the District Court to continue to hold his office...&rdquo;  In other words, if the Minister for Justice gets a mandamus from a Fianna Fáil Club, if he wants to hold his position, he must immediately act upon it and have the unfortunate district justice, who may have happened to give offence to somebody brought before his court, before this advisory committee.  I presume it will be a kind of star chamber holding its sittings in private and examining witnesses, if any, in private. The section then goes on to state that they may inquire &ldquo;into the question of the fitness of any particular justice of the District Court to continue to hold his office having regard to his mental or physical health, or his conduct (whether in the execution of his office or otherwise) generally or on a particular occasion, or any other relevant <Col N="2258" /> matter.&rdquo;  That means they will have a roving commission to inquire into all his private life; to discover whether at the last dance at the Gresham Hotel or the opening of a beet factory in the country he danced the Walls of Limerick or the Tango or the Turkey-Trot, or to discover whether he goes to Leopardostown or a &ldquo;penny gaff&rdquo; along the quays.  Surely that does not commend itself to the good sense and prudence of any member of this House? I do not believe the Attorney-General has the slightest sympathy with such a drastic and comprehensive section as this is.  I think that the Government would be very well advised to reconsider the section, and, if they do not delete it, to amend it, because, as I have said before, and as I repeat, the district justices, instead of being turned into&mdash;as this section contemplates&mdash;the old Removables, whose history is so well known in this country, should get more protection and a larger measure of security than they have got here.  I really think that if the right thing is done in the interests of the people they will be accorded the very same independence as has been given to the judges of the High Court and to the judges of the Circuit Court.  It is not because they are at the bottom of the ladder and are underdogs that they should be kicked around, while others who are no more infallible or no more impeccable should be given a guarantee of security.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.I. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as this Bill is concerned generally, I oppose it on the ground that this is not the time for the introduction of such a Bill. We are all aware of the present financial position of this country, and why February of the year 1935, above all other times, should be chosen for the introduction of a Bill such as this is beyond me to imagine.  So far as the chief contents of the Bill are concerned, it is very difficult usefully to add anything to what has already been said by Deputy Costello from this side of the House, but there are one or two general features of the Bill on which I think comment will not be out of place.  I should like to support <Col N="2259" /> what Deputy Burke has already said with regard to Section 49.  That is the section which deals with the removal of district justices.  When the Attorney-General was opening this debate he gave us very little information on what was contemplated by this section, or what position had arisen which justified the existence of this section in the Bill.  We are all aware, of course, of certain utterances of district justices throughout the country which would be contrary to the views of large sections of the community, but surely that is no justification for a section such as this.  Under the provisions of this section the Minister has power to refer a number of matters in connection with district justices to an advisory committee. The terms of reference are such that that committee can inquire into the conduct of the district justice, not only in the execution of his office but, as the Bill itself says, &ldquo;otherwise.&rdquo; In other words, the conduct of the district justice in every sphere, no matter how private, is to be inquired into and made the possible ground for removal from office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For myself, I cannot see any possible reason for differentiating between the position of a district justice and that of any other judge on the Bench.  Why should not a district justice be entitled to his little indiscretions just as much as a Circuit Court judge or a High Court judge or a Supreme Court judge?  Why must a district justice be put in this penny-boy position&mdash;completely in the stranglehold of the Executive Council?  Certainly, this provision of the Bill will not do any good to the administration of justice in this country.  Terms such as these would not be accepted by a scullerymaid going into employment.  A district justice can be transferred from one district to another.  And why? Presumably, because he will not do what a district justice here was told to do a short time ago&mdash;namely, to impose higher fines.  That is the type of thing that is going to go on when this Bill becomes operative.  We are all aware of that case in which a district justice received a circular from <Col N="2260" /> the Department of Justice telling him that the fines he was imposing were not high enough.  In other words, we are now getting another source of revenue by the control which is being given to the Minister and the Executive Council over district justices throughout the country.</P>
    <P>There was another important aspect of this Bill which was dealt with by a number of speakers to-day, notably by Deputy Norton, and that is that so far as the viewpoint of the ordinary litigant throughout the country is concerned absolutely no provision whatsoever has been made for it.  So far as that is concerned Section 61, I think, is the only section of the Bill which deals with it, and the Attorney-General in dealing with that section yesterday, told us it was the intention of the Minister for Finance to raise the fees of the court officers.  In other words, the only thing that this Bill is doing for the ordinary litigant throughout the country is to increase the cost of litigation.  We are all aware, and it has been commented on several times in the course of this debate, of the present high cost of litigation. There is no getting away from the fact that the cost of litigation at the moment does make it impossible for a number of people to seek the protection of the courts.  In dealing with this aspect of the Bill, or rather with this aspect of omissions from the Bill, I should like to support what has already been said by Deputy Geoghegan in connection with the establishment of a fund out of which poor prisoners would be able to get free legal assistance.  The position in that regard at the moment is a scandalous one.  I think I am not exaggerating the position when I say that this is the only civilised country in which there is not some such support for poor prisoners.  We have this position, apart from poverty altogether for the moment, where a man is charged with a crime; he is put into the dock and he is kept in custody, say, for a week, six days or two weeks.  He is put to the cost of defending himself.  Assume for the moment that he is innocent and that at the end of his trial his innocence is established by the jury bringing in a verdict of not guilty.  He is out of <Col N="2261" /> pocket hundreds of pounds, perhaps, in defending his honour and in establishing his innocence.  That man cannot recover one penny of that money from the State.  That is something that should be provided for in the Bill.  If a man is put to the cost of defending himself in a criminal court, if he expends money in defending his honour and establishing his innocence, and if he does that successfully, I suggest there should be some provision in the Bill for recouping such person his costs.</P>
    <P>There is another omission in the Bill to which I should like to draw attention. In actions in which the State is a party, at the present moment, the authorities are able to avail themselves of all kinds of defences which are not open to ordinary private litigants.  I think it is right to say&mdash;I can be corrected by those more learned in law if I am wrong&mdash;that, in the absence of any express legislative stipulation to the contrary, the party opposed to the State cannot raise, for instance, the Statute of Limitations as a defence.  I think that is correct.  Numerous examples can be added to that but my general contention is this&mdash;and I can see no argument against the proposition&mdash;that the State should be in exactly the same position as any other party when it is engaged in litigation. There is another branch of the law in which the State gets a clear immunity and that is in ordinary actions of tort, except in a case such as that which has been provided for by the latest Road Traffic Act.  Generally speaking, it is true to say that an action of tort cannot be brought against the State. That is a most ridiculous position.  A private individual is for example libelled by some Government circular. No matter how outrageous or how defamatory that statement may be, there is no remedy on the part of the citizen against the State.  Surely these are things that should obviously be corrected, and this is the time to correct them.  This Bill makes no provision of any kind for that real kind of grievance.</P>
    <P>The only object of the Bill, as far as I can see, is to create two new judgeships. Everything else in the Bill is nothing but mere trimmings, and, as I <Col N="2262" /> have said before, this is not the time to bring in a measure of this kind.  There would be some justification for it if some real genuine grievances, such as I have spoken of, were remedied in the Bill, but nothing in that way is done by the Bill.  We hear a lot of talk about a reversion to the old appeal system&mdash; the rehearing system.  The net result of that will be that we shall have exactly the same position as before the courts were reorganised.  When the change from the rehearing system to the note system was coming about, it was welcomed by 95 per cent. of the legal profession.  Everyone condemned the rehearing system on the grounds that it led to wholesale perjury.  So far as this Bill is concerned it brings about no real constructive change.</P>
    <P>With regard to the position of the official stenographer, I should like to add something to what has been said by other speakers.  These official stenographers, doing their work in the Circuit Courts throughout the country, as Deputy Geoghegan pointed out, acquired what may be called a really specialised knowledge of their work. There are terms used in law to which they have become accustomed.  Their experience in the courts does fit them for this type of work in a way in which no other shorthand writers are fitted.  It does seem extraordinary that after 11 years' service these men are now going to be thrown out on the roadside.  That condition of affairs would not be so bad if it were not a fact that there is alternative employment which could be offered to these men, and this Bill should make provision for the utilisation of the services of these stenographers.</P>
    <P>There is one provision in the Bill providing for an appeal from a jury action in a Circuit Court on the judge's note.  Without any experience at all of that type of appeal, it seems to me on the face of it that this is precisely the type of action in which there should be a full stenographer's note.  Surely when an action is heard by a jury, and an appeal is taken from their findings, and from the general results of the action, that is no reason why a full transcript of what happened in the <Col N="2263" /> court below should not be placed before the superior court.  I understand from what Deputy Costello said yesterday, and from what I have heard from several of my colleagues, that this judge's note system is one that has already proved itself unsuccessful. What does the judge do?  As Deputy Costello pointed out yesterday, he is there in the court; he has to control counsel in the court; he has to observe the demeanour of the witnesses, and to look after the general conduct of the trial of the case, and his notes are always necessarily scanty.  That is what the higher court has to depend upon when the action comes before it&mdash;these scanty hurried notes.  The notes, in most cases, will depend on the type of judge.  He may be a very quick-minded man who will be able to take a quick note of what is going on, but without going into these matters at all, it must be obvious to everyone that on such an appeal, there should be as full an account as possible of what happened in the court below.  If we are going to have a rehearing system, and if that rehearing system is being given official recognition in this Bill, I do not understand why it is not being applied to jury trials as much as to trials without a jury.  I do not know why the differentiation exists, and I should like to have that more fully explained by the Attorney-General when he comes to reply.</P>
    <P>With regard to the majority verdicts, it seems to me absolutely certain that in order to convict a man, if 12 men are put there to try him, everyone of these 12 men should agree to the verdict of &ldquo;guilty.&rdquo;  I can see no answer to that argument.  I do not care about the other side of the question as to whether or not I would be in favour of nine men acquitting a man.  The main thing is that in order to convict a man you should have agreement amongst the 12 members of the jury.  If you like, you can provide that in order to acquit a man nine shall be sufficient, but we should face up to the proposition that no man can be found guilty of a crime of which he is charged without a unanimous verdict. There must be the unanimous <Col N="2264" /> verdict of the 12 presumably reasonable men who were put there to try him.</P>
    <P>There is just one thing with regard to appeals that I should like to say before I sit down.  I do not think it is true, as Deputy Geoghegan suggested yesterday, that by going back to the old rehearing system we are going to go back to cheap litigation and cheap appeals.  The present scale of costs in the Circuit Courts is absolutely different from the scale that existed in the old County Courts, and so far as counsels' fees are concerned on the hearing and rehearing of these appeals, I do not think they will be any different from that which exist at present on the hearing of appeals on notes, because you will have exactly the same scale of costs in the Circuit Courts as you will have under this Bill. Take a case in which a junior counsel is engaged.  He gets three guineas on the hearing of the case.  He spends a day in court and when the case is finished there is an appeal.  Surely, junior counsel is not going to go back to the old County Court scale on the hearing of the appeal.  The least that a junior will get on the hearing of the appeal will be three guineas.  You will never get back to the old scale, unless you want to revert to the whole scale of costs, when two guineas was given to senior counsel and one guinea to the junior counsel.  I do not think it was fair of Deputy Geoghegan to compare a case within his knowledge, in which an unsuccessful party had to pay about £100 and costs on an appeal, while in the next breath he spoke of the costs of appeal in the case he mentioned were £19 under the old system. You will never get back to that unless the whole scale of costs is changed. As a matter of fact, as far as the cost of litigation is concerned, the rehearing system will not make any difference, because all the party pays with notes will, in the general run, have to be paid for bringing witnesses together in the local venue for rehearing.</P>
    <P>I should like to reiterate what I said with regard to official stenographers, and to impress upon the Attorney-General that the position of these men is one that should certainly receive his <Col N="2265" /> most careful consideration.  I have heard that several men who entered into these contracts with the State 11 years ago will, when this Bill becomes operative, be without a job or a chance of getting a job.  In view of that fact, I urge on the Attorney-General that their services might be useful, even under the operation of this Bill.  They could be used, for example, on the hearing of every Circuit case, if only for the purpose of stopping what was carried on, on such a wholesale scale&mdash;perjury.  That is an aspect of the new system that should receive the careful consideration of the Attorney-General.  He is well aware of the amount of perjury that went on by way of rehearing when appeals were heard under the old system.  For that reason I urge that there is a real necessity for retaining the services of the present official stenographers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">

      <P>It is very difficult to make a speech on this Bill on account of all the nonsense we heard about it.  I never heard so many silly things said about any Bill as were said this evening, and particularly by Deputy Norton.  I do not want to use slang, but I never heard more &ldquo;tripe&rdquo; talked than from Deputy Norton: first, in the general case he made against law, and against both branches of the profession, and then in the particular case he referred to.  The Deputy said that the only hope of getting justice depended on the size of one's purse or money bag.  He then drew a comparison between Gloucester Street and the Gresham Hotel.  The Deputy is apparently keeping an eye on the voters in Gloucester Street. They will be talking about the matter this evening when they read what he said in the <i>Evening Herald</i> and the <i>Evening Mail.</i>  They will say: &ldquo;What a great man Deputy Norton is for the poor.&rdquo;  I do not know if the Gresham Hotel is open to the people of Gloucester Street, but I challenge contradiction of the statement that the Irish courts are open to every citizen who wants justice, irrespective of whether he has money or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the best thing I can do is to give examples to disprove the charges made against the profession.  I grant <Col N="2266" /> that the profession has to get fees and to get money.  In the first place, they have to be trained and solicitors have to keep offices and to pay big staffs of skilled persons.  Money is required on Saturdays for these staffs.  I wonder would Deputy Norton not want money on Saturday nights to pay workmen.  I had two cases recently which disprove the charges made by Deputy Norton. In one case the Minister for Industry and Commerce attempted, without notice, to take a small farm from a man in Donegal.  My client had not a penny.  The Minister, after being defeated in the lower courts, went to the Supreme Courts where my client won.  We set aside rules made by the Minister under the Mines and Minerals Act.  Take the other case made by the Deputy, under the Workmen's Compensation Act, where a man met with a serious injury, lost the sight of an eye, and was being bullied by an insurance society to take some trivial sum of money, about £25 until Deputy Norton got busy.  I wonder did it ever occur to the Deputy that he was breaking the law, and that the insurance society, as well as the man concerned, was breaking the law in taking £25, because they were all usurping the rights of the courts to arbitrate in a case where an accident took place.  The Deputy struts in here and attacks the profession, when he knows that the position does not depend upon the size of a person's money bag.  Classes of poor people were referred to by Deputy Geoghegan and by other Deputies&mdash;criminal classes&mdash;where the charges varied from charity to murder.  They are a huge class and it is only reasonable that something should be done for them. The reason why no one troubles about that class is usually because when a man is charged with committing a crime, the moment the Guards arrest him it is said he is guilty.  That class is no one's child; they are outcasts. There are many cases almost as serious as murder, where men are charged, and I do not see that any logical case can be made on behalf of the State for keeping a defence from murder cases to the most elementary cases in the District Courts.  Take all <Col N="2267" /> these various crimes&mdash;crimes less than murder&mdash;where the consequences may be almost as serious as in a murder case, why should not provision be made by the State for the defence of the accused?  They are the only class of people who, in practice, are deserted so far as receiving assistance for their defence in the court is concerned.</P>
    <P>Over a period of 20 years, during which I was connected with poor litigants and with a poor county, I cannot recall one case where people, because they had not the money, did not get justice.  I think if the position were otherwise that the honourable profession I belong to would not have the right to exist.  It would certainly be a terrible reproach to my profession, and I should be sorry to be a member of it, if a person whose rights were being encroached upon could not get legal assistance simply because he or she happened to be poor.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton referred to another case.  He talked about poor people being knocked down by motor cars and of millionaires going around in those motor cars.  He said that these poor people could not get justice.  The Deputy's speech was simply all nonsense. I had a case a fortnight ago where a poor woman, who had been working daily for 35 years, met with an accident.  I am simply mentioning this to disprove the sort of stuff that we had from Deputy Norton.  It is necessary to give a concrete case because otherwise Deputy Norton might deny this and say it was all untrue.  On the 20th March of last year this poor woman, when going home from her daily work, was knocked down by a motor cyclist.  She sustained a double fracture of the thigh.  She was left for 12 months without a penny.  She had, as I said, been out working daily for 35 years.  The people for whom she had been working discharged her.  She was living alone.  She has since been an invalid.  She received every attention from the doctors and a solicitor. The solicitor not only employed two senior counsel but a junior to look after the interests of that poor woman, giving, of course, his own services as <Col N="2268" /> well.  In spite of that, Deputy Norton comes in here to impeach the legal profession.  I quote that case for the purpose of brushing aside that sort of stuff from the Deputy.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Bill itself, there is only one aspect of it that concerns me.  There is one reform that I want to see carried out, and that is an alteration in the form of appeals. Deputy McGuire has been very severe on Deputy Geoghegan for the speech he made here last evening.  I suppose that both Deputy Geoghegan and myself are older than Deputy McGuire. We went through the mill and had a rather extensive knowledge of both systems.  I think that I can speak with more authority on this matter than Deputy McGuire.  The facts were accurately stated last evening by Deputy Geoghegan.  I remember that some 18 or 20 years ago I was asked to defend a farmer's son down the country at an assizes.  I did so.  The jury found him not guilty and I got a guinea.  Take the civil side.  Some members of the House will remember that the first Lord Chief Justice in Northern Ireland was the late Sir Denis Henry, who had been a leader of the North-West Circuit, of which Deputy Geoghegan and myself were members.  Deputy Geoghegan remembers as well as I do going to assize towns and of solicitors going to Sir Denis Henry, then the leader of our profession, and handing a brief in an appeal case marked a guinea or two guineas.  He went into court on that appeal and the case was disposed of.</P>
    <P>That was the system in those days, and then we had a reform under the Courts of Justice Act, 1924.  The point of view taken then was that all these British institutions were wrong; that there could be nothing good in them, and the thing to do was to brush them and sweep them out.  I know of nothing more stupid than the change that was made under that Act in regard to the hearing of appeals.  It really did away with justice.  Take, first, the question of costs and expenses. Imagine a small case down the country. We all know that people in the country are fond of law.  At an original hearing the whole countryside attended. <Col N="2269" /> Train loads of people came along, and in some instances bus loads accompanied the parties concerned.  All these witnesses had to be examined. A transcript of the stenographer's notes of the evidence cost anything from £10 to £14.  Deputy Geoghegan has told the House, and I agree with him, that a case such as that would be heard in the old days in the County Court, and decided on appeal, for the sum of £9.  Under the system in operation for some years the transcript of the notes for the appeal cost at least £10.  That shows the terrible mistake that was made when that reform was brought about.</P>
    <P>What I am most concerned with in this Bill is the change in the form of appeal.  Deputy McGuire said that the provision dealing with appeals will in practice be as expensive as the present system because, he said, the witnesses will have to be brought again to the trial town.  Take the present system where the whole countryside is taken up to the original hearing.  If they do not come by train they are brought up in bus loads.  They are all examined. Their evidence is taken down by the stenographer and I have told the House what the transcript of the notes cost for the appeal.  Under the system proposed in the Bill what will happen? The witnesses will be taken up in a motor car for the rehearing.  The hire of the car may cost £2 10s. and that will dispose of the whole thing.  The thing is to give the people the feeling that they are getting justice.  Whether they are getting it or not, give them the idea that they are.  That will satisfy them.  Let them swear, and let them have their kick and their fling. It satisfies them.</P>

      <P>That has been my experience of people in litigation. Deputy McGuire said that the real purpose of the Bill was to appoint two judges.  Of course, that is in keeping with a Government that entered office with a programme of economy.  The <Col N="2270" /> appointment of two new judges is in keeping with its doctrine that it would practise economy.  Deputies can visualise Deputy Donnelly going down for the week-end to his constituency in Offaly and saying &ldquo;we stand for economy.  We told the people that we were going to reduce taxation by £2,000,000.  We are reducing it by putting two additional judges in the Supreme Court&mdash;not the High Court&mdash; but in the Supreme Court where they will get the salaries of Supreme Court judges.&rdquo;  That is economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some other features of the Bill that I desire to refer to.  There is this thing of not giving more costs than damages in certain cases.  I have considered that, and I think it is an unwise provision.  Take the case of a man and a woman who are the guardians of a minor.  The minor meets with an accident.  At first it looks quite serious and is, in fact, serious, but by good treatment and good attention, and the fact that certain people have greater powers of recuperation than others&mdash;in other words, because they are better stickers and better fighters&mdash;the minor makes a good recovery.  Before there can be conclusive evidence as to its recovery, proceedings have to be instituted. Where are they to be instituted?  How is a guardian to discharge his obligations and determine whether or not the damage is not more than is represented by the sum of £300? On the other hand, perhaps the minor is permanently injured.  In order to protect himself and to be faithful to his trust, the guardian has to commence proceedings in the High Court.  High Court costs cannot be got if the verdict is for less than £300 unless a certificate is obtained from the judge.  Why should solicitor or counsel have to go into court and beg for costs when it is an old maxim of the law that costs follow the result?  If, in the discharge of his duty, a guardian takes a case in the High Court he should obtain his costs irrespective of the amount of the verdict.  In all these cases, one is subject to the whim of juries.  Nobody knows what they are going to do until they come in with their paper.  Sometimes, when you are expecting a favourable verdict they bring in a verdict <Col N="2271" /> against you.  I think that, where an action is reasonably taken in the High Court, costs should follow the result and there should be no necessity to apply for a certificate from the judge. Judges are like other members of the community.  Some of them have their whims.  Some of them are very conservative and cheese-paring, and may refuse to give a certificate.  To go back to the case of a guardian of a minor, he may institute an action in the High Court which will involve him in £300 or £400 costs.  The minor may, in the meantime, have made a good recovery and, when the case comes on, it may be necessary to make provision for little more than hospital, medical and nursing expenses.  The costs have, however, been incurred.  I think that the Attorney-General should look into that type of case and remove the restraint provided by the certificate.</P>
    <P>Another section of the Bill deals with actions remitted from the High Court to the Circuit Court.  In these remitted actions the Circuit Court gets an enlarged jurisdiction.  In other words, in a remitted action a Circuit Court judge can give more than £300 damages.  I do not like the provision as regards costs.  It may look very well on paper, but, in practice, if an action is of such a character that a Circuit Court judge may give more than £300 damages, it is, on its face, an action of a very important character.  That being so, senior counsel will be brought down on both sides from Dublin and will have to receive a special fee.  The fee varies from 20 guineas to 25 guineas. Would it not be much better to have that action tried in Dublin, where senior counsel would not get that special fee at all?  It is because they have to go to the country that these big fees are paid.  If there is a prospect of more than £300 being awarded, a case should be retained in the High Court. It may seem strange that counsel should get a fee of 25 guineas for going down the country, but it must be remembered that he may have to leave the day before the hearing, stay a night at the court venue, while the hearing may last all day.  It may be next evening before he gets back to town, and <Col N="2272" /> he will have lost two and a half days. I think that that section should be amended.</P>
    <P>I now come to Section 49, about which so much has been said.  It is useless to whip a dead horse, and this section has been pretty well whipped already.  I have yet to hear a case made for the courtmartialling of district justices for which this section provides. Are not the district justices barristers or solicitors, just as members of the High Court are?  Why, by the condescension of some high directing power, should any special inspiration descend upon, say, me or Deputy Geoghegan, because we happen to go into the High Court or Circuit Court over and above, say, Deputy Costello or Deputy McGilligan, who are made district justices?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

      <P>What is the logic of the case for this court of inquiry?  I quite appreciate that, in one or two instances, district justices have been very indiscreet, but High Court judges have been indiscreet, too.  Is the whole system to be condemned, and is the whole security of the public, due to the independence of these men, to be undermined because one man happens to make a silly statement?  That is the issue.  Section 49 provides a series of sweat-boxes through which a district justice is to be forced because one man happens to make a silly statement. Men have made silly statements from the beginning of time and will do so to the end of time.  What logical case is there for this court-martial of district justices?  They are trained men.  They have had seven or ten years' experience of their profession before being placed on the bench.  Many of them have had much longer service&mdash;service equal in length of time to the service of judges of the High Court.  If that be so, why a court of inquiry?  The mistake, if made, was made by those who appointed the justices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These mistakes have been made and will be made.  They cannot be prevented. You will get men who, in their ordinary work and in dealing with the man in the street, act quite sensibly, but when put into this position <Col N="2273" /> they seem to think that they have attained such a degree of importance that they have a right to dictate and pontificate about everything.  Are you going to undermine the entire structure simply because a couple of men once in their lives make a silly statement from the Bench?  Then, we have this tribunal, consisting of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the Attorney-General to determine, if you please, the mental capacity of district justices.  It might be more fitting if a similar tribunal were appointed to inquire into their own mental state.  Why should that not be done?  I wonder what metaphysical and psychological operation proceeded in the rambling mind of the man who produced this section. I agree that it should apply to all branches of the profession, to the entire judiciary from top to bottom, but there is no case for applying it to men who are drawn from the same profession as the judges of the High Court themselves.  The district justices were put into this position of independence to do away with the old, accursed system represented by the removable magistrate.  Eleven years afterwards, when the new system had given great satisfaction to the community, we are going to do away with the independence of district justices. Why?</P>
    <P>Deputy McGuire referred to a case where circulars were sent to a district justice because he was not imposing sufficiently heavy fines.  I think that Deputy McGuire is slightly inaccurate in that.  My information is that what happened was that, whether consciously or unconsciously, the Minister for Finance is attempting to use the district justice as a tax collector for himself, and that a circular was sent out to the official of the Circuit Court &mdash;not to the district justice but to the clerk of the court&mdash;to tell the district justice: &ldquo;Oh, your fines are not heavy enough.&rdquo;  Did anybody ever hear of such a way&mdash;such a clumsy way&mdash;of doing it, if it was done?  I am informed that it was done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, I know that it was sent out during the last six months.  The Attorney-General need not be shaking his head.  It is so, because I know it is so.  However, whether it was done under the administration of Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney or by the present Minister, that does not justify it.  Two wrongs do not make a right.  I say that this provision is now put in deliberately in this Bill in order to give these district justices a removable flavour, so that when an order of this kind is sent out to them to increase their fines, and they do not comply, they may be removed.  Very well; you are going to remove them, but where are you going to remove them to?  Is it to the museum?  Because, if you remove them from one place, you have got to send them to another place.  Will the next man who is sent to take the place of the removed justice be willing to oblige the Government?  Will he leave, say, Donegal, and go to Cork at the behest of the Minister for Justice or of this committee, because the displaced man has given displeasure to this committee, or this courtmartial, as I call it, consisting of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court, and the Attorney-General? That is the snag, and there is no provision here for dealing with it.  Where will you find a place for that man, if the man whom you want to take his place will not oblige?  When this courtmartial, as I call it, consisting of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the Attorney-General determine that a certain justice should be removed for one reason or another &mdash;say, because he is mentally incompetent, although, as I suggest, they are probably pretty well mentally incompetent themselves&mdash;what are you going to do with that man?  There is no provision here in this section or in this Bill for dealing with that.  I think <Col N="2275" /> that this thing wants a lot of looking into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there is the question of the section with regard to juries.  I am very glad to know that from no side of this House has any defence of this provision been made.  One can recall a very limited number of instances of criminal cases where, in defending a prisoner, one was pretty well convinced that the man one was defending was guilty who still managed to be acquitted.  I think I can recall the very first prisoner I defended. Certainly, I thought him guilty, but the jury found him not guilty, owing to the fact, I think, that the judge&mdash;who is now dead&mdash;charged so ferociously against the man that the jury felt it incumbent upon themselves to find him &ldquo;Not guilty.&rdquo;  Now, there is a very old maxim of the law which is admitted, I think, by everybody, or at least accepted by everybody.  That maxim is to the effect that it would be better that nine guilty men should go free than one innocent person should be convicted.  I think it is a very wise maxim.  It has stood the test of time. It has stood the test not alone of theory but of practice.  I think it has operated well, and that the number of cases in which a criminal, who was clearly guilty, was found not guilty, are very few.  In the memory of the oldest Deputy in this House or of the oldest man outside it, I think it will be found that the number of cases in which, on the evidence, men charged with serious crimes were found not guilty, where the evidence proved them to be guilty, were very few, and that was done under provisions whereby 12 of his fellow-citizens were sworn to go by the evidence.  It may be said, as against that, that it is English law, but there are a lot of things English that are not bad&mdash;even the coal on a winter's day.  That system has stood the test of time.  It is not necessarily bad because it is English.  It has been proved by time to be good both in theory and in practice, and more in practice than in theory.  I ask that that provision should be rejected on the Committee Stage.  This whole Bill wants a good deal of hammering <Col N="2276" /> out on the Committee Stage, especially with regard to Section 49, and I think I would ask the Attorney-General to take that particular section and recast it.  It must be remembered that this District Court is the people's court. We heard Deputy Norton here spouting about the poor.  If we are going to give them security, let it be by the independence of the court.  That is the important, and the most important thing that should be in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I object to your undermining the independence of the judges of that court.  You are undermining it.  I am referring to the District Court.  That is the people's court.  I say that you should make it as independent as the Supreme Court, and, if you do, the poor man can get justice, notwithstanding all the spluttering by Deputy Norton and others about the poor man's court. Make the man who can hear the poor man's case independent.  Make him more independent than the Chief Justice if necessary, and if it is possible. That is why I would ask Deputies of both sides of this House to apply themselves to that section.  Perhaps the principle in this Bill is to make two judges.  I have no great objection to that, particularly in view of the fact that it is suggested by a Government which alleges that it wants economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been accused of spluttering from those benches.  Being a non-legal man, I do not wish to deal with the legal points of this Bill, but there is one point with which I wish to deal, and that is a point of omission. What I have in mind, in my opinion, would be making for the protection of prisoners to an extent that I believe is necessary.  At the present time it is customary to have the publication of evidence on preliminary trials or hearings to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case, and whether or not counsel are supposed to produce evidence at that stage, in practice, I think, it is very rare that counsel do introduce evidence at this particular stage.  The result is that a broadcast message is sent to <Col N="2277" /> the people of this country to try and establish the guilt of the person who is charged before he is ever tried.  I think that where certain opinion is brought before people who may be potential jurymen, and who have the right to discuss these things at the fireside, and when they have only one side of the case before them, there is, willy-nilly, a feeling created in their minds of the guilt of the person charged.</P>
      <P>I consider that in the interests of justice, now that an attempt is being made to alter, and to some extent to improve, the administration of the law, this point is one worthy of the very serious consideration of the Government, and one that a very considerable volume of public opinion could be mobilised to stand for.  I speak purely as a layman, but I am expressing a view widely discussed by people not of the legal profession, but people who feel as I do upon this matter.  They feel that in this respect in the present administration there is a weakness, and that steps ought to be taken to prevent the publication of details at the preliminary hearing, and until the case reaches the stage that both sides can be put so that a jury can approach the matter with open minds and without any preconceived ideas with regard to the person charged.  I think this is a matter worthy of the consideration of the Government and of the Attorney-General, and I hope they will give it attention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am extremely sorry that Deputy Geoghegan should have left the House because at this moment it would be ungracious for anyone following him not to congratulate him upon his coming back into voice in the House, particularly since the vociferous incoherencies of Deputy Corry in relation to economies have ceased.  We had the spectacle up to to-day of a man like Deputy Geoghegan coming into the House and wending his way through the Division Lobbies voting for cuts on civil servants, Local Government employees, dispensary doctors and on everyone upon whom the cut could fall.  At any rate he had the decency to-day to stand up and say he welcomed this <Col N="2278" /> Bill even if he had to make the peculiar statement that it was a judicial reform forced by outside opinion.  I always used to think it was something of a scandal that men of a professional type, educated men, should have gone so far back upon their tradition as to allow those scandalous posters, often referred to, to be promulgated and votes to be got on them.  I also think there is another good thing in Deputy Geoghegan's appearance here on this Bill.  We will have to discuss the cost of this.  I am pleased that from this side of the House there has not been found anyone to say that when a Supreme Court judge is appointed £3,000 a year is too much to give him.  We have, at least, kept off that, but not all people can say the same.  I must say I used to regard with a certain amount of cynicism statements made by people who did attach themselves to this economist Party, which seemed to indicate that they were not wholly of the opinion that moved the majority of the Party.  Deputy Geoghegan had none of that in mind.  He announced at one time, at a meeting in Dundalk, that although he had some doubt about the policy once he saw that vast outpouring of Republican sympathy he would see this thing through to the bitter end.  The Attorney General told us on one occasion that he could not serve the Irish Free State.  The intervention of both those Deputies in this debate means that they are going to remain Daniels still in the lion's den, not Daniels come to judgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should have heard something about the cost of this measure.  The Committee met and reported upon the state of things they found at a particular time.  Two representatives of the Fianna Fáil Party, as mentioned by Deputy Costello in his speech yesterday, reported against any increase in the system of the High Court judges until two things came about, one that the economic situation in the country was better, and secondly until there was an increase in the urgent public business which had accumulated in the courts.  Yesterday the Attorney-General, deputed to this task by the exigencies of the situation created by the illness of his colleague, the Minister <Col N="2279" /> for Justice, read what were presumably his colleague's notes of his speech.  It was a very remarkable utterance.  There was no argument in it from beginning to end.  There was a statement of what was in the Bill, but that was all.  The Attorney-General informed us two or three times that in this and that particular we are not agreeing to the recommendations of the Joint Committee but why that was so we have not heard.  One would have thought that from a Party which stood so much for economy people would know what they were voting for. One would have thought that we would be told what the cost was going to be here and how it was to be borne as between the taxpayer and the litigant.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter and it is the gist of the whole thing, so far as the Committee that reported on the Court of Justice Bill is concerned, on which we get no information.  We were told that the system of hearing on stenographer's notes was bad, that it caused delay, that there was a vast number of appeals waiting to be heard. I asked a series of questions yesterday as to when the four appendices to these reports would be brought up to date.  I thought the Committee considering the Bill would have information on the point as to the cost and secondly on the question of the volume of Circuit Court appeals waiting for hearing.  I asked how many of these represented cases originating in particular years&mdash;and how many represented cases that originated this year.  I was told that the statistical abstract contained information bringing it up to the years 1932 and 1933 and that the Government had not got the other information.  So generally it would seem that the Government had not considered the position and those introducing this Bill had not the necessary information.  So far as I am concerned I had not got any; but the Government considered the position and decided taking a decision without knowing what is the state of the work in the court at the moment and without knowing what is the condition as regards appeals and what is the extent of the arrears.  Those are two <Col N="2280" /> big points&mdash;the cost and the urgency, and the arrears of business.  I have said the Attorney-General mainly devoted himself yesterday to telling us what was being done but he never once drifted into telling us why anything was being done.  He did say this; that the Government were keeping to the report of the Commission&mdash; he hurriedly answered in principle but not in detail.</P>
    <P>There are, say, five big things in this measure: there is the increase in the number of the judges; there is the question of the new system, which is phrased inaccurately as a going-back to the old system, with regard to the rehearing of Circuit Court cases; there is the complete abolition of the stenographer in regard to certain business; there is the attempt and the tendency to increase the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court; and there is this matter that has been so much referred to and which ought to be referred to oftener&mdash;the attempt to close down the official fist upon the district justices. Let us take one thing.  The judges are going to be increased.  What judges? As far as appointment goes, Supreme Court judges.  What was the Committee's recommendation?  They recommended that the Supreme Court should consist of more than three people.  They recommended further that a sufficient number of judges be appointed to clear off the arrears and to have appealed cases, as they came along, dealt with speedily.</P>
    <P>There was more than that said. From time to time, we have had discussions as to the difference between a Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court type and a High Court.  It was referred to long ago when the original Courts of Justice Bill was going through and the present Chief Justice, then Attorney-General, spoke on the matter.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is desired that this Court of Appeal, which is to be the final Court of Appeal and which is to be, unlike the existing Court of Appeal, constituted as a separate court, should stand apart and should be constituted by men specially chosen for their fitness for that particular <Col N="2281" /> court, and that it should not be possible to rush in High Court judges in order to give a day's golf or a day's holiday to judges of the Supreme Court.  It is the opinion of the Bar that in the present existing régime, judges of the High Court have been unduly called into the Court of Appeal, and it is a constant complaint of the Bar.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He finished by saying:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... with a long way the majority of the Bar, that judges of the High Court should not be called into the Court of Appeal and that the Court of Appeal should be made a stable institution to which people can look with respect and which should not be simply a scrap collection of judges got together to hear cases from time to time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Twice the matter was referred to. When evidence was being taken before the Commission, the Chief Justice himself was examined.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;My view is that the Court of Appeal ought to be kept separate and distinct.  In the old days we had the other experience .... and it was never satisfactory.  You have great difficulty if a judge in the Court of Appeal has to try a case in which there is an appeal from himself.  You will then have to borrow another judge, so that it leads to great confusion.  I am strongly of opinion that the Court of Appeal should be something separate and distinct.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The President of the High Court said the same thing.  He said that, giving a personal opinion, he had the view that the Court of Appeal ought to be a Court of Appeal and that judges should not go elsewhere.  What is the proposal here?  What are these judges going to be?  What is the reason for adding to the Supreme Court people who are clearly under this Bill going to be given High Court duty to do and only High Court duty in the main? Even the difficulty of nomenclature comes in.  The Bill talks of the ordinary judges of the Supreme Court, presumably meaning those other than the Chief Justice, and then goes on to make a distinction between those members of the Supreme Court who <Col N="2282" /> are appointed at the date of the passing of this.  Are we going to have a Supreme Court divided into Chief Justices, ordinary justices and very ordinary justices of the Supreme Court, or, using church language, are they going to be Supreme Court judges <i>in partibus</i>?  When they go hiking around the country is the Supreme Court to be held up if there are important cases that require five judges? Are we to have a Supreme Court of five at all?  Is it ever intended really that this Supreme Court of five should function?</P>
    <P>Is this not only a pretence?  The economy Party cannot face up to bringing in two High Court judges because there is no real reason for it, but having to join two sets of argument, one set relating to the Supreme Court&mdash;if it is proper in a country like this that your final court should consist of more than three minds&mdash;and that part of the argument swings in then to buttress up the rather weak case that can be made&mdash;a very weak case, indeed&mdash;with regard to extra appointments in the High Court.  So we have this mixture&mdash;this business of the people who will not know from day to day whether they are High Court or Supreme Court judges, as far as their duties are concerned, people who will not know when they will be sitting on an appeal from a court which possibly they might have composed themselves, sitting in the other way, and with all the confusion which the Chief Justice specially referred to, the confusion which finally led the Committee to report that the Supreme Court ought to be kept apart and ought to consist of men who were brought up as lawyers, men trained to give decisions on points of law and not men who are having their attention and energies dissipated by travelling around the country and keeping their attention riveted on this matter of review of witnesses and demeanour and the taking of notes in these cases that will be heard down the country.</P>
    <P>At any rate, there is a recommendation with regard to the Supreme Court.  There is another recommendation with regard to the High Court and with regard to both these recommendations <Col N="2283" /> with that economy mind we are told that it was wrong to have appointments made notwithstanding that there was great weight of argument in their favour.  It was wrong that these men should be appointed until the increased prosperity of the country warranted it, and until the volume of business in the Superior Courts urgently required it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Little was the mover of that. Is Deputy Little impressed now with the increased prosperity of the country, and has he the figures which show that the volume of business in the Superior Courts urgently requires this change?  When he has become satisfied on that, what about the latter part of this recommendation, which says: &ldquo;If there are any changes to be made, they should be accompanied by a revision of salaries in the light of a comparative study of the salaries paid to judges of equal rank in other European countries, for instance, in France...&rdquo;?  That, incidentally, came from Deputy Little, who had sat, and, I hope, had listened to all the evidence that was given.  So far as it was given in relation to French judges, it did not paint a very attractive picture.  At any rate, there is the first big point.  The Committee recommend a certain increase.  Fianna Fáil objected to it and they now tell us they want it.  They will not tell us what the cost is going to be but they apparently do not object to it. They do not tell us whether there is increased prosperity or anything about the volume of business or whether it urgently requires this change.  They do not even tell us what business these new judges are going to deal with. That is the first point.</P>
    <P>Secondly, we have this big matter of the rehearing.  I interrupted Deputy Moore last night when he was speaking and when he indicated that his point of view in this matter was that only lawyers should think and speak about it.  I have no experience as a lawyer sufficient to warrant me to speak on this, and I am speaking, more or less, with the point of view I formed as a layman about three years ago when I read all this voluminous evidence and read the opinions expressed by the Committee.  I heard <Col N="2284" /> arguments about this for years and it is impossible to say what is the weight of opinion one way or the other.  I do not suppose that really, in the end, one system is going to give any better satisfaction than the other, but I think that, at any rate, the situation should be made a little bit clearer than it is at the moment.  The Committee recommend the rehearing.  Did they recommend that simply?  They recommended the rehearing by two judges going on assize and they recommended, or at least, they brought into the atmosphere of their recommendations one other very important matter.</P>
    <P>Pretty nearly every witness who came before this Committee against rehearing used phrases something like this: that the system of taking these cases down the country and getting them heard with the witnesses paraded was an invitation to perjury.  That phrase was used by the people who object to the rehearing.  In the end, Deputy Wolfe who was, if I might say so without disrespect to the other members of the Joint Committee, the driving force so far as that Committee went, suggested, when the Chief Justice was giving his reasons to the Committee, that there was one way of preventing perjury, and that was that the stenographer's notes should be available for the second hearing, and the Chief Justice admitted that the notes of the stenographer would be helpful, and he added that that might hamper a man at the rehearing from telling a different story from that which he told on the first hearing.</P>
    <P>There was the possibility that on the rehearing a man might tell a totally different story from that which he told on the first occasion, or there was the possibility that in the changed atmosphere he would tell more than he had told on the first hearing.  The opinion of the High Court was that under such circumstances the notes of the stenographer, though available, would not prevent an increase in perjury and that what the Bill now proposes was definitely and clearly an invitation to perjury by witnesses on the rehearing. There is more than that to be said on this matter.  This whole question of the rehearing has been talked of here as if <Col N="2285" /> the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, abstracted from the people of this country some right that they had from time immemorial&mdash;a right almost common to mankind.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear about that.  First of all, note the change.  When the Courts of Justice Bill, 1924, was introduced, I understand from what I have read this afternoon that there was a system under which the County Court jurisdiction was, in the main, a £50 jurisdiction. This was increased to £300. There was some system of rehearing in relation to the £50 downwards.  We are now insisting, for the first time in the history of this country, on a rehearing of all cases from £300 down to £50. That question was brought out before the Joint Committee, and it was stated that in relation to the £50 and downwards, no country in the world had such a rehearing and that this country was unique in that respect.  How did that come about?</P>
    <P>The Chief Justice was asked a question on that point and on page 317 of the Report of the Joint Committee on the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, he said that there were peculiar historical circumstances about it, that it had an historical basis which no longer exists. In the case of the £50 and downwards cases we used not to have a judicial hearing at all.  The work was done under what was known as the system of the assistant barrister.  These assistant barristers were sent across the country hearing these cases.  The barrister was not a judge.  Then it became clear that the people who suffered from the defects of that system had not had a judicial hearing at all.  That matter of the rehearing arose so as to give them a judicial hearing because the rehearing that we have been talking about was the first judicial hearing.</P>
    <P>The fact is, therefore, that in the circumstances, these £50 and downwards cases were put into a category apart from what obtained in any country in the world.  They had no relation to that type of case of a judicial rehearing at all.  We now say with regard to the £300 and downward cases that we are going to have a rehearing.  I want to let the people <Col N="2286" /> who know the human beings who live around them realise what is going to happen on this rehearing of the £300 and downward cases.  Everybody who faces up to the situation knows the litigant will appreciate that he has his right of appeal.  He knows under the provisions of this Bill that that appeal is to take place in the local area with all the witnesses again paraded.  Now, does anybody not believe, knowing the people amongst whom we live, that that appeal is not going to be followed by an increase in perjury?  The witnesses and the people in the case are going to compare their own first story with the story that was put up against them by the other side.  Undoubtedly, on rehearing there is going to be a change in the story told at the first hearing.  The witness at the second hearing will be in a position, after comparing the evidence given at the first hearing, to add to his evidence.  The Joint Committee recommended that the stenographer's notes should be made available.  If these notes are available the witness will find that if he changes his evidence too much he will be caught out.  In this Bill we are introducing two things, first, a sort of duplicity which will mean that the case was not fully presented the first time; that the main witness was withdrawn or that there was something kept up the sleeve; or that there was something not revealed, but kept over for the second hearing.  The alternative plan to that may be to put your case best at first, but to do yourself up better for the rehearing.  That rehearing with all the historical circumstances ought to be considered.</P>
    <P>I am told and told in the most emphatic way that the people down the country want this rehearing.  That is what we are told.  I do not know that they know why they are asking for it. Neither do I know that the people who are voting for it realise that we are not going back to the old system.  But we are going back to the £50 downwards system, and we are making a complete change and a break as far as other cases are concerned.  That is to be viewed in the general tendency of this Bill, which is towards decentralisation &mdash;more work for the Circuit Courts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2287" /> The Chief Justice was asked about this and in reply to the question:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where else did a rehearing take place?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>replied:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;So far as I know, practically nowhere does an appeal on the credibility of witnesses exist.  Take, for instance, the County Court in England which has a jurisdiction of £100. There is no appeal on fact there. There is only appeal on law.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let us take the English system.  It is amazing that the English never tried out the system of rehearing on their own people.  It was tried out here. They did not like it afterwards and they never applied it to themselves. They have this compulsory jurisdiction up to £100.  They have, by consent, of course, a vastly bigger jurisdiction and there are figures in the possession of the Government Departments which show the amazing use that is made of the Circuit Court jurisdiction in England, in which men of reputed standing in the commercial and business world bring cases far beyond that amount into the County Courts; and they do that with the knowledge that they have no appeal except in point of law.  There you have a big community with a better commercial aptitude than we have and they go into their own courts with compulsory jurisdiction of £100, and they do that with the knowledge that the only appeal against the decision arrived at is an appeal, not on a question of fact but on a question of law. And yet we must have here this appeal on all cases now within the Circuit Court jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>There is one on the point to which the Chief Justice referred.  Talking of the rehearing, he said at one point&mdash;I cannot get the quotation at the moment&mdash;that the verdicts of the judges of assize were of very little importance in this country.  He says at one point in the evidence that the verdict of a judge of assize, a judge going out on this old type of rehearing, was regarded as of so little value that nobody ventured to quote it as an authority.  That, apparently, is what <Col N="2288" /> was thought of the system of rehearing. What has been the experience of the men who lived through that work? The President of the High Court gave any amount of evidence in the matter, and his view was that you had these men going out from the High Court in Dublin, that they were pervaded by a spirit of restlessness from the moment they went out until they got back, that they knew the High Court business was getting into arrear and their whole attention was riveted on the days they had to be out and keeping their programme scheduled so that they did not spend one extra hour in a country town.  Their attention was riveted on what they had scheduled themselves to when they started.  The President of the High Court went to the point of saying this.  He asserted that it could be said of the Munster Circuit that the only town in which there was even a proper hearing while on assize was the last town of the circuit, because there the judge knew he was then up to his programme; he had so many days before he would have to go back to Dublin and, in the main, he was able to fit in cases.  But in every other town there was always the fear of a day added on which would have to be taken off somewhere else; there was always the fear that days would have to be added on and the period he had allocated for himself would not be sufficient.  Apart from the way a man's mentality was affected by the thing, the spirit of restlessness pervaded and there was definitely an unsatisfactory system with regard to this rehearing.</P>
    <P>On page 355 of the evidence given before the Committee the President of the High Court says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;My view of the hearing of appeals that went under the old system is certainly not such as would make me recommend that system for the hearing of appeals to any tribunal at present.  If I may say so, there is a certain amount of halo cast about the old system of appeals. My own experience was nearly always a sense of dissatisfaction with the hearing of appeals on circuit. I think there was a tendency in all towns except the last town <Col N="2289" /> of the circuit, where the judge had unlimited time, to rush through cases and cases were rushed through in all the towns except the last town of the circuit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he talks about whether the work was generally done from the angle of the pleader.  The President, who had experience on circuit, condemned this system that the Government are deciding to go back to.  Why the Executive Council have taken this decision, I do not know.  It has not been explained here.</P>
    <P>Let us assume that the decision has been taken to get back and we are going to go out on circuit and the old assize business is to restart.  What type of assize hearing is there going to be?  The attitude of the Committee was in the direction of two judges. Reading through their evidence, the way in which they thought that the tendency to perjury could be stopped was by having the notes as well as by having the witnesses again.  We are doing away with the notes so far as this type of case is concerned; we are just going to have the witnesses.  The invitation to perjury is now open.  If one reads the evidence given here, as far as efficiency is concerned, there was very little contradiction of the point of view of the Chief Justice and the President.  There was plenty of contradiction from the aspect that people wanted the other system, that people were dissatisfied with getting a verdict in their absence.  The procedure was that the appeal came to town, and 18 months afterwards the parties were simply told by the solicitor &ldquo;We have lost&rdquo; or &ldquo;We have won.&rdquo;  We are told that is unsatisfactory, yet there is any amount of evidence that the people down the country want this.  But why do they want it?</P>
    <P>Let us go a bit deeper into that.  It was said they wanted it because it was going to make for speedier justice; you were going to get to the end of a case more quickly, and they were told on the Committee that the whole system was going to be cheaper. Let me take the point about cheapness first.  There is a peculiarity observed sometimes in the case of commissions. <Col N="2290" /> It is asserted that a comment made by an early witness colours everything.  An early witness came before this Commission and made a statement that then, as a layman, I thought was peculiar.  When I heard the comments of some people at the law I realised it was not merely peculiar but ludicrous.  The statement was made before this Committee that you would get senior counsel travelling on assize who now demand 20 and 25 guineas for a special case down the country, going out again and accepting two or three guineas on a brief. I remember when the Chief Justice heard of it in evidence afterwards he said: &ldquo;Who said that?&rdquo; and he was told a counsel said it.  His next astonished and perplexed remark was: &ldquo;Was it a senior counsel?&rdquo; and when he was told it was, he stopped talking. But a senior counsel did say that.</P>
    <P>I wonder if anybody who has any experience of the present system as opposed to the old, believes that counsel are going to go out again? There is no doubt the man who gets a special fee for an individual case, if he goes out on assize, will take something less, but anything like the idea of five or eight guineas on cases at assizes, and getting the best man for that, the man now rated at the other point, is ludicrous, and yet that is in the background, in the atmosphere, of this whole recommendation.</P>
    <P>With regard to speed, I take this report and I find that in the year 1932-33 a certain number of appeals were heard in the High Court.  What number of appeals, so to speak, originated in that year.  I cannot say; the information is not here, but I am sure it must be available somewhere.  But if what was the rule at the time the Committee met was still the situation with regard to those appeals in 1932-33, then this emerges, that the High Court in that year heard a number of cases which not merely included all the cases that originated in that year, but one hundred more.  It, therefore, appears that in 1932-33 the High Court had got to the point of knocking off all the appeals that originated in a particular year.  They had heard over three hundred cases.  At the time the Committee <Col N="2291" /> met, according to the Vice-Chairman of it, the appeals were accumulating, were rolling in at the rate of 200 a year.  Suppose the High Court had got to the point where they were dealing with a number of cases sufficient to include all that originated in a particular year, and 100 arrears, if the 1932-33 rate of progress was kept up in 1933-34 the arrears would have been wiped out.  The High Court was in a position to hear and determine within the year every appeal that originated within the year.  If that is the case, the argument of urgency has very little in it.</P>
    <P>Surely in this small community we have to balance these considerations of speed against considerations of cost. Again, we are baulked by the fact that no figures have been given by the Government, and we do not know what the cost of this will be.  We can simply see that there are two new judges to be appointed.  We know what that is going to cost; but I take it that that is a very small part indeed of the cost that the new Bill will entail on the community. There will be judges going out on circuit and there are judges' servants still to be appointed; judges' travelling expenses will have to be met, as well as the travelling expenses of the servants of the judges.  The £6,000 that will go in salary is going to be a very small part indeed of the extra cost of this to the community.  We ought to have some idea of the cost to balance against whatever is the consideration of urgency with regard to the appeals.</P>
    <P>Somebody has referred to the matter already and I want to say this briefly. In 1923 a Commission was set up to consider the whole question of courts of justice in the country.  They were asked to approach the matters referred to them untrammeled by any regard to any of the existing systems of judicature in the country, to examine the nature and classification of the legal business, both contentious and non-contentious, for the due discharge of which in the interests of justice, machinery and establishment should be provided by the State and to consider and report upon the requirements of the litigants and other persons <Col N="2292" /> interested, and especially as to accessibility, efficiency, expedition and cost.  That was the finale of a letter written by the then President who first of all directed attention to the fact that nothing had impressed itself more on the minds of our people as a standing monument of alien government than the system, the machinery, and the administration of law and justice, which we got over.  That Committee was composed of 12 people, two of whom could be regarded as belonging to the old regime and who were judges.  There were also six persons who are now judges&mdash;the present Chief Justice; the present President of the High Court, three judges of the High Court, a Senior Circuit Court judge in Dublin and a district justice.  There were also two members of the legal profession and a representative of the commercial community.  Unanimously they brought in a recommendation in favour of a new Circuit Court system and in favour of a rehearing on stenographer's notes.  It cannot be said that that group of six had any enthusiasm for the old system.  Three of them were chosen because they had been associated with the Dáil courts.  The majority of them were in sympathy with the movement that allowed for the establishment of the Dáil courts. Unanimously they recommended against the old £50 civil bill appeal and rehearing and unanimously reported in favour of the system of stenographer's notes.</P>
    <P>We are now going back upon that and we are going back upon it pretending to found ourselves on the report of a Committee which recommended that we should go back to a rehearing on appeal by two judges and an appeal apparently on the notes.  We are going back simply to one judge and we are wiping out the notes.  We are told we are going to have a cheaper system.  So that whenever the question of cheapness entered into the consideration of these people it was founded upon what would be regarded as the mistaken idea that apparently counsel's costs were thought to be the big item in this matter and that these costs were certainly going to go down. We have the ominous warning to the <Col N="2293" /> people in a particular section that court fees are going to be increased. If the consideration of cheapness has gone, it seems to me, and I do not approach this from the professional angle at all, that if there is no great question of urgency arising, no case has yet been made for departing from that unanimous recommendation and taking up something midway between the recommendation of the Committee of 1929 and something else that has emerged from the brains of the Government.</P>
    <P>The third point, an amazing point to have raised in a measure like this, is this whole question of stenographer's notes.  That was referred to often before.  Again, I go back to the time when the Courts of Justice Act was going through the Dáil in 1923. The present Chief Justice, who was then Attorney-General, speaking definitely on this matter of stenographer's notes, as reported in columns 458 and 459, Volume 5, of the Official Reports, talked about Civil Bill appeals and the ordinary County Court cases up to £50, and then said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The other cases, the cases which are now heard by the High Court, between the limits of £50 and £300 in value, which are commonly called Records, formerly were tried in a great hurry by the judge of Assize, or tried in Dublin.  In these cases the existing manner of appeal is an appeal on judges' notes, not an appeal by a rehearing of the witnesses, and every member of the Bar in this country has been greatly impressed by the great drawbacks that attend a hearing on judges' notes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I stress this because in this Bill we are going back in certain cases to a rehearing on judges' notes.  Here is the Chief Justice's attitude on that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Either the judge takes very elaborate notes, lengthy notes, which prevent him having that acute observation of witnesses of which Deputy Bryan Cooper speaks, or he takes inadequate notes, and the result has been that there has been for years a demand in all the courts here to have a stenographic report of the evidence as they have had in England for a very considerable time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2294" /> Several times later that was raised. That was in October, 1923.  I get a peculiar verification from England of what the then Attorney-General said in 1923.  I find a report in the English press of 14th February in which the Lord Chief Justice of England opening certain courts said this:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Those who know anything of the work of the Court of Criminal Appeal are well aware that it simply could not exist without the help of a competent shorthand-writer in every trial or indictment; those who know the work of the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division do not need to be told that the shorthand note is quite indispensable; and those who, at Nisi Prius, spend their lives writing down to dictation the copious evidence of a cloud of witnesses are unable to understand why their time and their attention cannot be saved by recourse to the same simple expedient.  It is not merely a question of time.  Nobody, I am satisfied, can attend adequately to the progress and development of a case if he is laboriously occupied in taking in longhand a full note of what is being said in the witness box.  In my humble opinion, the thing is ludicrous.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This shows the difference:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A judge is able, without much difficulty, to record briefly, for the purpose of his judgment or his summing-up, the handful of dates and documents, of figures and phrases, which really count in a case.  But, as the matter stands, a judge finds it to be his duty to take a full note of a mass of chatter in 20 cases because one of them might, conceivably, go to appeal.  In other words, he wastes time, energy and, therefore, public money in discharging the mere task of a capable amanuensis.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a man who is complaining that they have not in England a system which we got here in 1924.  In 1935 we propose to go back, for certain cases, to the system which the Chief Justice in England describes as ludicrous, and which our Chief Justice, when Attorney-General in 1923, described as making the hearing <Col N="2295" /> of cases completely impossible.  Why is it being done?  It is not on the report of the Committee, because the Committee recommended, not merely the keeping of the notes but recommended that even on a rehearing the notes should be there as an additional point on which to lean. Evidently swayed by the evidence of the Chief Justice when he spoke before them they accepted his contention and put in a recommendation that shorthand note-takers should be supplied, even to the Supreme Court, so that the judgments might be taken down properly and made available at once for members of the Bar and for the public.  We are simply told by the Attorney-General that this is happening and we have not been told why. We propose to depart from the present situation in this matter&mdash;a good situation brought about by the 1924 Act.  We propose to depart from it in the hearing of Circuit Court actions tried with a jury.  We are going to go, in those cases, on what the Chief Justice in England described as inadequate notes, and what the Chief Justice of our country described as being, probably, inadequate notes, or if they were not inadequate notes they were notes whose adequacy had been gained at the expense of the energy and time of the judge on the first hearing.  When he should have been keeping a watch on the demeanour of witnesses and other matters he had to be occupied with his notes.  There is no reason given to us why this should take place.</P>

      <P>One of the valuable things which the present Chief Justice referred to when talking of the courts system, and the change which had been brought in, was this: he said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We will not merely have a complete record of what witnesses say but a complete record of the judge's charge.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>How are you to get the judge's charge if there is no stenographer, and if the judge is giving the charge in relation to his own notes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>But what are we doing?  We are now going back and making this business in relation to the judge's notes the rule.  We had gone away from that.  We had achieved, with everybody's consent in 1924, a big change&mdash;a change which the Chief Justice in England wants at the present moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>When there is apparently everywhere a tendency towards the development of stenographers' notes we go back on it in regard to Circuit Court appeals where there is a jury in the case.  Why is it done?  It is not because the Committee recommended it, because the Committee did not recommend it.  They recommended <Col N="2297" /> quite the reverse.  That is entirely without regard to this other sympathetic matter of the fact that having trained up certain people and having had them occupied at this work, we now propose to put them out, making no allowance for their services up to date, and without any question of compensation for them.</P>
      <P>A matter which has not yet been stressed, and which I think is worth stressing at this point, is that there is in one section of this Bill a definite signpost, and in the Bill generally there is a tendency towards an increase of Circuit Court jurisdiction.  There is a section here&mdash;I will be told it is an old practice&mdash;which says that on remitted cases an award can be made above the ordinary Circuit Court limit.  I am wondering what the repercussion of that is going to be on the remitting of cases generally.  Deputy McMenamin has referred to the standard which judges have at the moment when an application is made to remit an action.  I do not think he stressed that standard in a sufficient way.  As I understand the test it is this: the application of the judge's mind is simply to one point, namely, &ldquo;Would a verdict for more than £300 be set aside as unreasonable and excessive&rdquo;?  Unless he can say that that is so the action is retained in the High Court.  Now that test certainly goes, to a big extent.  It may be said that notionally you still have the idea that £300 is the Circuit Court limit, but on a remitted action you are empowering the Circuit Court to deal with a matter which goes well beyond that amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if for the future the old test will apply, but I take what the Attorney-General said in relation to the phrase in the report as meaning that for the future consideration is to be not whether the matter is proper to be tried in the High Court but whether the matter should not be tried in the Circuit Court.  Where does that come from?  Any number of people were questioned about the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court.  Any number of people were asked whether they liked the change which had taken place between £50 and £300.  Some people said they liked it.  The majority <Col N="2298" /> of them said that had they been asked to give evidence on it before it had been accomplished they would have thought that £300 was too high.  Nobody who read the evidence given before that Commission could say that there was the slightest tendency observable on the part of the majority of the witnesses to increase Circuit Court jurisdiction.  Yet I think&mdash;I may be wrong in my opinion&mdash;that it emerges from this Bill that there is a definite urge towards driving more business to the Circuit Court.  Surely some argument should be used to the House when asking people to accept a Bill which has in it that tendency.</P>
    <P>District justices come into one section of this Bill.  Apparently the Attorney-General is of the opinion that, as between what is proposed in the Bill and what is the present situation, the proposal in the Bill is preferable. In this country we have a written constitution, and in that written constitution we establish the judges as a whole in a definitely independent position, and we give the higher courts control of constitutional matters.  Right down through the whole list of the judges in 1924 there was a big argument on this matter of independence.  I think the biggest argument which took place on the whole 1924 Act was in relation to what was regarded as an attempt by the then Government to break in on the independence of the judiciary. That arose through this matter of the rules.  With regard to the rules for the District Court the Minister was going to be the authority, assisted by, but not with the concurrence of, a particular group of people.  That caused a flare.  There was another point about the judges' salaries and where they were to be charged, but in the main the attention of the Dáil and Seanad was then directed to this question of the independence of the judiciary, and the main argument arose in relation to the district justices.</P>
    <P>We have a provision at the moment that no district justice can be removed save for incapacity, physical or mental infirmity, misbehaviour in office or misconduct. These are the only reasons for which a district justice can be removed.  He is removed, then, from <Col N="2299" /> office, but any of these things&mdash;incapacity, physical or mental infirmity, misbehaviour in office or misconduct&mdash; has to be certified under the hands of the Attorney-General and the Chief Justice.  Section 49 is to replace this. Section 49 opens briefly.  It has what Deputy Costello called a speciousness about it which attracts, because instead of the Chief Justice and the Attorney-General you have a committee&mdash;the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the Attorney-General.  But immediately your suspicions are aroused, because they are described as an advisory committee and you begin to wonder who has the power and then the meaning of the section begins to develop.  First of all who calls the advisory committee into action?  The Minister for Justice.  The Minister for Justice may at any time, and he may on his own motion, or he may in consequence of complaints made to him, refer to the advisory committee &ldquo;the question of the fitness of any particular justice of the District Court to continue to hold his office having regard to his mental or physical health or his conduct (whether in the execution of his office or otherwise) generally or on a particular occasion or any other relevant matter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now let us take that as the beginnings of the exercise of executive authority over a judge.  Section 73 of the Act allows removal, but it is only for incapacity, for physical or mental infirmity, for misbehaviour in office or for misconduct and, for any of these things, there must be a certificate of both the Chief Justice and the Attorney-General.  Take the effect of sub-section (2) of Section 49 alone. The Minister refers.  He can do it as often as he likes.  He can do it on his own motion; he can do it on foot of complaints, or for any reason that strikes him.  He can persecute a district justice if he wants to.  I am not speaking of what is likely to happen but of the possibility.  He can persecute a district justice by getting his conduct always brought forward for investigation and he can have different reasons, or a variety of reasons over a number of times, or at the same time.  &ldquo;His <Col N="2300" /> mental or physical health.&rdquo;  We had that before.  &ldquo;His conduct, whether in the execution of his office or otherwise.&rdquo; Then &ldquo;His conduct generally or on a particular occasion.&rdquo;  Finally, as if that were not sufficient, the Minister can refer the question of the removal of a district justice to this advisory committee for &ldquo;any other matter.&rdquo;  Surely there should be an explanation of what is intended to be encompassed by that particular phrase. Have cases occurred which were not of misconduct or misbehaviour, and does the Government think&mdash;I take the phrase of the Attorney-General&mdash;that &ldquo;the Government should have another course open to it&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>Supposing the advisory committee is properly asked to advise the Government, they may report in a variety of ways according to sub-section (3)&mdash;that no action be taken, that the justice be censured, that the justice be transferred, that the justice be removed from office on account of mental or physical infirmity or that he be removed on account of misconduct. As far as I can make out, reading this, the only recommendation of the committee which the Minister for Justice shall carry out is that in regard to censure.  Sub-section (5) states that when the advisory committee recommends that a justice of the District Court should be censured &ldquo;the Minister for Justice shall communicate such censure in writing to such justice.&rdquo;  On no other recommendation of the advisory committee need the Minister for Justice or the Executive Council&mdash;because they vary up and down through the section&mdash; take action.  They may do whatever they please.  They can do more than the committee recommends or they need not do what the committee recommends.</P>
    <P>This has got to be viewed from two angles&mdash;first of all, the persecution of a district justice who is doing things&mdash; let us take politics immediately&mdash;that are displeasing to the Government, who view his actions through political spectacles.  Or let us take the case of a district justice who is doing things which are displeasing to the community as a whole, but about which the Government do not bother because his <Col N="2301" /> actions are in accordance with their political views.  As we have it in Section 73 of the Act, two people come down on him&mdash;the Chief Justice and the Attorney-General.  As we have it in the proposal in the Bill, there is an advisory committee to which a reference is made, and then the Government can do whatever they like in the sense that they need not accept any of the recommendations of the advisory committee, save that in regard to censure, and the censure may be sent in writing.  There is no public notice that the district justice is to be censured. Is it to be considered that that section, analysed as it has been, is a good and proper substitute for Section 73 of the Act in the minds of people who want to see the justices independent?</P>
    <P>There has been too much attention entirely applied to the persecution of a district justice for things he is doing which the Government dislikes, but I want the other case considered &mdash; the case of the man who should be censured and who should be removed, and who is going to let off, or left alone, because what he is doing is in accordance with the particular political views of a Government at a particular time. Take one standard only.  If there is going to be independence of the judiciary, would it not be far better to have a single movement of the advisory committee&mdash;the findings of the advisory committee and the carrying out of these findings reposed entirely in the hands of a body completely independent of the Government?  If there has to be some link-up with this House, as the House that, in the end, governs judges as well as everything else, let it be through a report, to be made by the Minister, of what the committee has recommended and achieved in relation to a particular justice.  If there is to be any modification made in Section 73, it should be by the replacement of the Attorney-General by the President of the High Court, so as to leave it entirely in the hands of the Chief of the Courts, and the man who is, so to speak, second in control of the courts, that they should keep an eye on the conduct of those people who are themselves in the inferior courts, and that they alone should have the power to <Col N="2302" /> censure, remove from office, or transfer a district justice.</P>
    <P>It is clear that there must be some hold finally over district justices as well as over all other judges.  In that matter we used to have it that a vote of both Houses, for stated reasons&mdash; and only for stated reasons&mdash;meant removal from office.  Unless there has been something happening more than the public is aware of, which makes it necessary for the Government to take this middle line, which was the Attorney-General's phrase&mdash;that the Government must have some middle line&mdash;unless there is a better case to be made than merely a vague reference to district justices and indiscreet talk, I think this section ought to be completely abolished, not that Section 73 should be left as it is.  If there is any change in Section 73, it ought to remove any touch by the Attorney-General in the matter, or if thought necessary, leave him there and add the President of the High Court or a committee of three, or a majority completely divorced from the Executive Government.  It may be said that district justices are first of all more numerous and do not require the same experience in the way of legal training as judges in the other courts.  It may be said that they are more in contact with the people, and if I may say so with respect, are more vulgarised, that they are subject to more temptation in the way of indiscretion. Their conduct for ten or 11 years is the answer to that.  There can be nothing said about them as a body.</P>
    <P>Supposing that this is the thin end of the wedge, to be slipped in here, why should not there be something else later?  Is there not a good reason for some one later saying: &ldquo;We want the middle course with regard to the Circuit judges.&rdquo;  Are we eventually to have the position that we will want a hold over all the judges in the way of asking committees to report upon their conduct?  Remember it is in relation to their office they are to report finally as to their conduct and on any other relevant matter.  I do not say that this is the reason for this being put in.  But supposing someone wanted to get complete control <Col N="2303" /> over the judges and the courts, could he ask for anything better than to get power to make this frequent reference in relation to the conduct of any judge?  It is the small things that count at the beginning.  I do not suppose, if this is passed, that it is going to operate immediately to the detriment of any district justice.  But it is a bad thing to have this breach made. The appetite grows by what it feeds on.  Someone may consider that there has been an indiscretion and immediately the middle course is there, to get some advisory body.  The mere fact of being able to make frequent reference to it with the knowledge of what it is going to lead to is certainly going to harm him in his work, and is not going to aid him in the eyes of the people or the litigants who go to the courts.  We have had no reason given for this, except the veiled phrase used about some small indiscretion supposed to have been committed or that was hinted at by the Attorney-General.</P>
    <P>There are two other matters of minor importance, but both show the tendency. I referred to one of them already.  I take it that the system of justice is going to be increased in cost and that fees are going to be raised. Can we have any information as to how much, because calculations were made as to what amount the courts cost the people?  What proportion of the cost is borne by the litigants?  Can we have any information on the important point, as to how far the increase in court fees is going to go towards meeting the full cost?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the figure is 23 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Borne by fees? What percentage is proposed to be borne in future?  That is the important point.  I want to know if the fees are going to be up by 50 per cent.  Are they going to be doubled or what is going to happen?  It must be aggregated. Certainly there should be some indication of what is meant by this section.  While we are on that point, can we hear the increased charges that are going to be put on, either on the <Col N="2304" /> taxpayers or the litigants, by this measure?  In other words, what is going to be the cost, between travelling expenses, and salaries of the Courts of Justice Bill?</P>
      <P>Majority verdict has been talked of, the principle of majority verdict, or the verdict of the unanimous jury.  Again we have to go elsewhere.  What countries have the system of 12 jurors and majority verdict?  How many countries have not that system?  Is it so widespread a practice that you are elevating it higher, and saying it is a principle of justice?  If so, what is the principle?  Is it unanimity?  If you have a jury of 12, 15, or nine, do you want all the 12, the 15 or the nine to combine in saying &ldquo;Guilty&rdquo; or &ldquo;Not Guilty&rdquo;?  Do you want the weight of opinion, and that it would not matter if the jury was 12 if you got nine, or if the jury was 15 if you got 12?  Is objection being taken to having only nine, or having only a certain proportion of the people who heard the case? Is there to be any discrimination inside the jury room in whatever number you have, someone saying &ldquo;guilty,&rdquo; someone saying &ldquo;innocent,&rdquo; and someone saying &ldquo;the case is not proved&rdquo;?  Are you going to insist on this both with regard to innocence and with regard to guilt?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be some fraction of the number, up and down, in which majority verdict is clear.  Are you going to have any other repercussions when you have a small number not of the opinion that a man is innocent but that there should be a retrial? That gets us to the point of acquittal again.  Who in this House is able to say that 12 unanimous people are a good jury and give a good verdict; that 12 out of 15 are not; or that nine unanimous people out of 12 are not?  Where is the principle in it? There is only one thing to be said about this proposal.  That is the phrase Deputy Costello used, and that Deputy Geoghegan followed on, that this has been introduced into a permanent court of justice measure; that it is not being introduced as a measure for a temporary period dealing with the intimidation of jurors.  It is not being introduced after men have been <Col N="2305" /> slaughtered and men wounded.  It has been introduced without any argument except what the Attorney-General said, that personally he was not wedded to it, and he doubted if the Government was.  Yet it is proposed. As far as I am concerned, I take the nine out of the 12, or I will take 12 out of 15.  I have little experience in this matter, but people who have experience told us of their experience and of how cases ran.  Let it be put in on more than experience and if a change is to be made let a case be made for the change. If the change is to be made permanently, let a case be made for it.  I remember that when this was first introduced it was brought in because of the killing of a juryman and the wounding of another, and as far as this particular part was referred to, it was referred to in that context all the time: that if the intimidation of juries was going to become the normal practice in this country then in a permanent court of justice measure a case could be made for having a majority verdict instead of an unanimous verdict.  I hope that is not going to be the case.  Unless someone here is bold enough to say that he believes and fears that it is going to be the case, then there is not the same excuse as there was for having that majority verdict previously.  I remember that when it was introduced before it was regarded as the greatest engine of coercion and oppression that ever was thought of.</P>

Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's speech was perfectly sound.

At the time that proposal was regarded as a fearful weapon of oppression.  The President recited for the House all the Coercion Acts that had been passed since 1800, winding up with the Juries Protection Act. Now we get a Bill emanating from the Executive Council, of which he is the head, which contains this infamous proposal, and there is no argument with regard to the killing of jurymen or the intimidation of jurors.  Therefore, the only thing that we can think of is that the coercion spirit is an infectious matter.</P>

Will the Executive Council think it fair to stand over any body that holds criminal trials without a jury and in which unanimity is not the rule?  What would they think of establishing a new body, not the Military Tribunal, and of having people paraded for trial before it without a jury and having the decision of two out of a court of three the rule?  If they are in favour of that, why all this nonsense and all the talk in 1929 about trial by jury and of the unanimous verdict of 12 people as being the only real way <Col N="2308" /> in which you could properly say that a criminal was brought to justice?  It is too much to expect logic and too much to expect principle from some people, but really there are bounds, and when you are considering such a matter as this, which was elevated in 1929 to the region of principle, and it is now proposed to break it, surely some one man, whoever be that timid cowering creature in the Executive Council who thought of this ought to parade himself and tell us why he voted for it, and how he got a reluctant Attorney-General and apparently a defiant Minister for Finance to allow this to make its appearance even in a Bill.  Surely that requires an explanation.</P>
      <P>The last thing that I want to say of the measure is that it is to take its place in the scheme of things in regard to the judiciary in the country.  In 1924 a certain judicial system was set up in the country which was enveloped in the Constitution.  It is now proposed without great argument to make considerable changes.  We are going to have people appointed to the Supreme Court who, in the main, are not going to be Supreme Court judges. They are going to do High Court work and they are going to be out through the country for the greater part of their period.  Are these men going to be appointed without any security, or are they going to be appointed as the old judges were with this security: that, except for incapacity or misconduct and on a vote of the two Houses, they cannot be removed?  Are the men who are going to be offered Supreme Court posts going to have it put bluntly to them that a political majority in one House can get them shifted from office the moment that political majority likes to operate that power?  That is the position.</P>

      <P>That is the position to which we have got.  It is appropriate, at any rate, to have that thought around the discussion of this measure.  We are changing the courts of justice, to a certain extent.  I think that we are changing them for the worse, but that is a personal opinion.  I speak for no group.  We are going to appoint people to perform duties which are not detailed and thus place them in an impossible position. We are going to mix up the Supreme Court and the High Court and we are going to do away with a system which the Chief Justice and other lawyers of repute insisted upon.  We are to go back to a system which was limited to £50 cases and to apply that system to the whole jurisdiction of the Circuit Court.  We are going to establish that system, unique amongst the nations of the world, because of little historical circumstances that affected only £50 cases.  We are doing that in the teeth of evidence of men learned and experienced in the whole matter to the effect that it will open the way to greater perjury.  In this Bill we have omitted the only possible impediment <Col N="2311" /> suggested to&mdash;not a complete safeguard against&mdash;the extension of perjury. We are doing that while at the same time we are reducing the courts, which we built up on an independent basis, giving them power governing the Constitution, to a situation in which a political majority of one can fire out of office not merely the new appointments but every man who sits on the Bench without any reason, because the law states that a judge shall be removable only for incapacity or misconduct and that can be changed by the same political majority of one. That is what the courts are being brought to by the economy Government which now, without any reason, brings in this measure which is going to burthen the country with an undisclosed amount of expenditure.  Not a single argument has been put up by the Attorney-General as to why these changes should be made.  We have been told what the changes are, but in this Assembly, which is supposed to be a deliberative assembly where reason meets reason, the Attorney-General has used no argument in support of the proposals put forward.</P>

      <P>Having listened to Deputy McGilligan on the majority verdict, I feel, looking across at him, as a humble Hebrew might have felt when he looked at Moses after he had come down from the Mount with the light of sanctity glorifying his countenance.  He reminds me also of the old adage: &ldquo;When the devil is ill, the devil a saint would be.&rdquo; Deputy McGilligan, when in opposition, feels, like Deputy Cosgrave, that there is something to be said for the unanimous verdict of twelve good men and true, to use the description applied by Deputy Dillon last night. Of course, with Deputy McGilligan this is not a matter of principle.  He says that there has been far too much talk about principle in respect of the majority verdict.  I thought he was going to argue it as a matter of principle, but he said he &ldquo;would like to know who in this House was bold enough to say that nine out of twelve jurors could return a good and valid <Col N="2312" /> verdict?&rdquo; Deputy McGilligan said it Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney said it. Deputy Bennett said it.  Every member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, who was on this side of the House in 1929, said it.</P>

      <P>In the circumstances of the present time, I do.  I voted against this proposal originally, but I was coerced into doing that by the fact that insufficient time was given to the House in 1929 to consider the Jurors' Protection Bill.  That measure was passed here under closure, and only certain amendments were allowed to be debated in this House.  I did speak in favour of an amendment requiring a unanimous verdict on the capital charge <Col N="2313" /> for in a case where human life is at stake.  I still think, and I hope that the House will be given an opportunity of expressing a similar opinion, that is, that a unanimous verdict should be required in these cases, but, in the majority of civil cases and in the majority of criminal cases, too, I think that if nine men agree in the conviction of a prisoner, they are in position to return a perfectly good verdict.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a point on which there may be a difference of opinion, not a difference in regard to principle, but as to the most effective course.  I do say that, in the circumstances of the time, when it is so difficult to secure convictions in criminal cases and when it is not the desire to have recourse to special tribunals, we should be satisfied with a verdict of nine men out of 12.  Deputy McGilligan asked if there were any instances of intimidation.  Deputy Corry, speaking on this Bill last night, cited cases in which there must have been the most barefaced intimidation of jurors in court&mdash;instances in which employers and their employees were brought up on the same charges, and in which the employers were found not guilty and the men coerced by them were found guilty.  Nobody is going to tell me that the juries in that case were not interfered with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesIvanMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It was remarkable&mdash; so remarkable that the judge commented on it and said that only the labourers had been found guilty and that the prisoners who were farmers were allowed to go scot free.  Nobody is going to tell me that, where the charge was based on alleged interference with the sheriffs in the enforcement of decrees for land annuities or rates, farm labourers were willing to go out and take such action unless their employers forced and compelled them to do so.  It is against all reason and against all commonsense.  The reason that I am prepared to stand for the majority verdict <Col N="2314" /> in this case is not because I am fond of coercion, but because I feel that the law must run, that the law must be enforced, and that if the jury system is to be continued in this country we must, so far as we possibly can, render the jurors free from intimidation.</P>

      <P>This Bill has been criticised because we are dispensing&mdash; or, at least, it proposes to dispense in its present form&mdash;with the stenographers' notes.  That is a matter that can be argued one way or the other.  But after all, justice was dispensed in this country, as far as my knowledge as a layman goes, fairly substantially as between man and man up to 1923, and I do not think that the judges had the benefit of stenographers' notes up to that time. I do not think either that the country had any ill-reputation for perjury up to that time, and I do not think that, even if the stenographers' <Col N="2315" /> notes are dispensed with under this Bill, there will be such a recrudescence of perjury, if there was ever much of it or such widespread perjury as will interfere with the true course of justice.  Again, it is a matter for argument as to which is the best method.  The Bill, as brought before the House, proposes to deal with appeals in this way, but I am sure that the Minister for Justice has a more or less open mind in that regard.  Is it not desirable, in cases of this sort, that changes be proposed for the purpose of eliciting another point of view?  No one will say that the Act of 1924, under which we have been operating for the last ten or 11 years, received too prolonged consideration before it was passed.  I could not feel that, in the circumstances of the time, it would have received that consideration which it might have deserved. We have reverted in the Bill to what was, roughly, the procedure prevailing before that Act, but adapted to our present circumstances.  If it can be shown that there is a case for the notes, I am sure that the Minister for Justice will be prepared to give it his fullest consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill was attacked wholeheartedly by Deputy Costello who seemed to lead the Opposition in this matter.  Deputy Costello proclaimed that he was in favour of what is, after all, the main provision in the Bill, and that is the provision for strengthening the Supreme Court.  He said, however, that the time is not propitious. I should have thought that, in the view of the Opposition, there could not be a need more pressing than that of strengthening the Supreme Court. They have kept that court and other courts sitting overtime listening to arguments which, on their side, were neither dignified nor consistent nor seriously intended.  We are told&mdash;we have been told here time after time in the House&mdash;that the Opposition want justice; that they want it, they say, in the ordinary courts; and of course, as the aggrieved parties, that they want it speedily.  One would have thought, therefore, that they would all <Col N="2316" /> have been in favour of strengthening the Supreme Court.  But, once again Deputy Costello and Deputy McGilligan and other Deputies say that they would be in favour of strengthening the Supreme Court only that the times are not propitious.  And then, we are told that these are lean times&mdash;lean times at the Bar and lean times in the legal profession.  Well I, as a layman ask myself, reviewing the proceedings in the courts for the last 18 months, how could it be otherwise?  The general public during that period have had an excellent opportunity of seeing lawyers on the opposite side at work. They have seen case after case in the paper.  Lawyer after lawyer, leader of the Bar after leader of the Bar&mdash;all in the wake of the ex-Attorney-General&mdash; have got up in the courts calling black to-day what yesterday they were breast-high in advocacy of.  The public have seen that what was constitutional yesterday is unconstitutional to-day, according to these men.  They have seen these men contesting the validity of laws which they themselves drafted, passed, and enforced.  What confidence would any business man have in any advice given to him by the legal profession after the exhibition we have witnessed in the courts during the past 12 or 15 months?  Who is going to risk his cause on the opinion of men like these?  Who is going to venture a shilling on a cause which such men would have to argue? If there is a lean time in the legal profession at this moment, there is no one but the legal profession themselves to blame for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>Certain of them set themselves, by this process of sapping and mining of the judiciary, to wearing down the judiciary, to breaking down the Constitution, and to overthrowing this Government.  Now they are suffering for that themselves, and now they come along and tell us that it is not propitious to do what the Bill proposes in these lean times.  It would have been very propitious, however, I have no doubt, in Deputy Costello's opinion, at <Col N="2317" /> any rate, to strengthen the Supreme Court in July and August of 1932 if Deputy Costello happened to be Attorney-General.  A Bill was actually in draft to strengthen the Supreme Court at that time.  It has become a more urgent matter since then, because appeals to the Privy Council have been abolished.</P>

      <P>There has been great complaint about delays in the Supreme Court.  It is only natural, with the additional work there is, that that complaint should become more widespread as times goes on.  It is not an easy matter for a judge&mdash;looking at it from a layman's point of view &mdash;to give a decision in many of these cases.  They require, many of them, long consideration.  I am not one of those who would impel any member of the judiciary to a hasty decision. Therefore, I take the view when it is recognised that there should be at least three judges in one case, that the membership of the court must be further increased, so that those who have to sit will, from time to time, secure relief. I am perfectly certain that if we allowed the present position to continue much longer the general public, knowing the demand upon the judges, knowing the demand upon the Supreme Court, would lose faith in the judiciary, because they would feel that they were overworked and were not getting a fair chance of discharging their proper functions.</P>

      <P>We had a fierce attack made by Deputy Costello on one of the provisions of the Bill relating to district justices.  Deputy McGilligan criticised that position, also, but I think that there was a certain difference of attitude between the two.  Deputy McGilligan admitted that some sort of body was necessary; that there should be some method of making certain that the large number of people appointed&mdash;often at a very early age, and some of them comparatively inexperienced&mdash; act discreetly; that there should be some person who could on occasion remonstrate with them as to their public conduct, who could consider it in relation to their responsibilities to the people or the causes they had to try, and who would be able to make a recommendation for dealing with any breach of propriety of conduct of which they might be guilty.  I think our predecessors recognised the need for that. In any event, in the Act of 1924 they brought in this Section 73, and Deputy Costello, speaking last night, showed how he had availed himself of Section 73.  The difficulty about that section, so far as I can see, is that the people who constituted the original Committee, that is, the Chief Justice and the Attorney-General, can only do one thing, and that is certify for the dismissal of a district justice.  The consequences which such a course of action would entail are so drastic that many things that might properly be questioned and challenged are allowed to go unquestioned and unchallenged, because of that fact.  It was the old case of hanging a man for sheep stealing. Therefore, some procedure is necessary if public scandals are to be avoided.  District justices are not in the same position&mdash;and we must all realise they are not&mdash;as judges of the High Court or the Supreme Court. They live and move among the people. They have intimate contact with people who are potential litigants and <Col N="2319" /> they ought to be more circumspect, but, unfortunately, some of them are not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of them are not, and therefore it is necessary that there should be some machinery for the control and regulation of their public conduct.  Deputy McGilligan said, in his speech, he did not believe if our proposal in the Bill was adopted that it was going to be abused.  No one believed that Section 73 was going to be abused.  But I think Deputy Costello, when speaking last night, indicated that when he was Attorney-General he adopted a course of procedure which was a very questionable one.  He, the Attorney-General, charged with the prosecution of prisoners and the conduct of State cases in the courts, had ventured to advise the district justices as to their line of conduct.  I think an admission of that sort is much more likely to shake public confidence in the administration by the district justices of the laws which apply to the people in their districts than anything else that could be said.  I am perfectly certain it came as a shock to most people this morning to read that he, as Attorney-General, charged with the prosecution of prisoners, had been advising district justices as to their conduct.</P>

      <P>What is the proposal here?  Already we have the Attorney-General and the Chief Justice as a committee of two who can sit and who can decide whether they can give a certificate in certain cases.  That committee is going to be strengthened by the inclusion of the President of the High Court.  Deputy McGilligan, in criticising the proposal, said that if any man wanted to get control of the judges he would proceed by strengthening, if you <Col N="2320" /> please, the committee, which is already in existence under Section 73 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924.  Does any person believe that there is going to be in this country, at one and the same time, a Chief Justice, a President of the High Court and an Attorney-General who are going to allow their actions and their decisions and their advice in matters of this sort to be swayed by any politician, no matter how powerful he may be?</P>
      <P>If there were, and if that time comes, there is an end to true justice and the proper administration of the law in this country.  We would have no legislative assembly.  I am perfectly certain of that.  We would have, I think, no impartial public service, as we know it. We would have, in short, what our friends on the other side have been working for since General O'Duffy launched his movement, the Corporative State.  We would have Party government and Party justice and Party administration and Party police, and, of course, it may be as against a contingency of that sort that Deputy McGilligan wants us to take precautions. But if under his leadership and the leadership of his colleagues, this country decides to go Fascist, nothing that this Dáil will do will prevent us having on that day a partisan Chief Justice and a partisan President of the High Court and a partisan Attorney-General and partisan justice, and, therefore, it is only futile and a waste of time to consider Deputy McGilligan's argument as having any validity or weight in this matter at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of this debate, many people&mdash;I think one of them, a layman, and some others of them, lawyers&mdash; pleaded for cheap justice for the poor. Deputy Moore, I think, said that the poor man, when he had the misfortune to meet with a motor accident or an accident in the course of his employment, found it very difficult to get a lawyer to take up his case.  Unfortunately, that has not been my experience, at any rate.  I think that one of the evils which has followed upon the introduction of disability insurance and of motor insurance has been the growth of the speculative legal action, <Col N="2321" /> taken up by a solicitor and pressed, on the prospect of getting, not damages for the aggrieved person, but costs for himself.</P>

      <P>In any event, if we want cheap justice for the poor, there is a way to provide it.  Let the lawyers reduce their fees.  I have heard it said here that if a man falls sick, the State provides doctors and so on.  So they do.  But they do not, except in very special circumstances, employ the leaders of the profession.  They provide competent medical attendance for the sick, and I think that most people who have to have recourse to legal assistance could get legal assistance, and competent legal assistance, on perfectly fair terms, if the lawyers reduced their fees.  That is one way in which it could be done.  I am not averse to saying that possibly there are certain cases in which the State might contribute, as in the case of the capital charge, and does contribute.  Some of the defences I have seen put up in capital charges have been put up by these young, inexperienced men, as they have been called, but they have been defences which have received the encomiums of the court and of the people.  We are not justified in assuming that because a young man does not command a high fee, he is not in a position to give sound advice to any poor litigant who may have recourse to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other question of the fees under this Bill, the fact of the matter is that at the present moment the fees only defray 22 per cent. of the cost of the courts.  The figure I had in my <Col N="2322" /> mind originally was 18 or 19 per cent., and it turns out to be 19.3 per cent. 19.3 per cent. of the costs of the courts is at present covered by fees in this country, but fees in this country in many cases have not been increased since 1851.  I do not think Deputy McGilligan or Deputy Costello could say that solicitors' or barristers' fees have not increased since 1851, and while it is necessary that there should be cheap justice for the poor man, at the same time I think that, if it is to be secured in this country, there are two parties who will have to contribute to it, one, the State, and the other, the practitioners before the courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, on listening to the various references made in the course of this debate to Section 73 of this Bill&mdash;the section which provides that a majority verdict of nine to three should be sufficient to convict in criminal cases and sufficient to arrive at a decision in civil cases&mdash;I began to <Col N="2323" /> think that I was going to be a voice crying in the wilderness seeing that prior to Deputy McGilligan's speech, nobody on either side of the House seemed to have a word to say in its favour.  I quite agree that under normal conditions in a normal country, so long as the jury system exists at all, it would be desirable in criminal cases to have a unanimous verdict in order to convict.  But conditions here are not normal.  We have got to be realists.  We have got to face the fact that intimidation is liable to occur in this country in certain cases, and I think there is value in the suggestion that by making a majority verdict suffice for conviction you introduce an element of uncertainty as to who in the jury voted such a way&mdash;an element that may save the jury from being as exposed to intimidation as they otherwise would be.  Consequently, I support this idea of a majority verdict.  I would support it even in cases where human life was at stake.  It is provided in Section 73 (2) of this Bill that</P>
      <P>Whenever a jury finds a person to be guilty of a crime for which the penalty provided by law is death, the judge shall inquire of the foreman of the jury, and the foreman of the jury shall notify to the judge privately in writing, whether the verdict was or was not unanimous, and the number of the dissentients (if any), and the judge shall report to the Minister for Justice the information so obtained.</P>
      <P>Now I take that as indicating that where a verdict was not unanimous the Minister for Justice would normally grant a reprieve except in the sort of case where an element of intimidation came in.  I do not know whether the Attorney-General is in a position to confirm me in my reading of what the intention of the Bill is, but that is what at once occurs to me.  There can be no particular motive in making this notification to the Minister for Justice unless it is intended that in general he should intervene where no question of intimidation could arise and where the verdict has not been unanimous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, smarting <Col N="2324" /> under the jibes of Deputy McGilligan as to the changed attitude of himself and some of his colleagues on this subject, has explained it by &ldquo;experience.&rdquo;  What experience?  Experience of the fact that there is such a thing as intimidation in this country. Did he really require to become a Minister in order to become awake to that fact?  I venture to suggest that so long as the Minister for Finance had remained out of office no amount of experience would have brought him to the conclusion that the mere fact of being in office has brought him to.  In the days when the Party opposite was in opposition anything of this nature was the rankest coercion.  The country was told that the proper way to deal with people who were guilty of intimidation and of various brutalities was to show patience and brotherly love to them.  I have not the least doubt that the Party opposite would have continued in that line of argument so long as they were not in office.</P>
    <P>Now that they are in office they are embarrassed by a phenonemon which when they were out of office appeared rather to please them than otherwise by assisting them in their great general aim of getting into office.  Consequently they have introduced a measure such as this.  They have, as we all know, introduced other much more drastic measures to deal with the situation which they understood perfectly well when they were out of office but which they did not then deem it appropriate or necessary to deal adequately with at all.  That is the explanation of the conversion of certain Fianna Fáil Ministers.  They had as much time&mdash;they had in fact more time&mdash;to think out the subject when out of office than when in office. They were not so childish or so lacking in the power of appreciation of things around them that they could not have arrived at the knowledge of what dangers they would have to guard against before they became the Ministers responsible for guarding against them.</P>
    <P>The trouble is that there is a certain class of crime in this country which is <Col N="2325" /> labelled &ldquo;political&rdquo; and which has absolutely no right to be labelled &ldquo;political.&rdquo;  But once it is labelled &ldquo;political&rdquo; the person who commits it has a fair chance of being regarded as patriotic by a certain number of his deluded fellow-countrymen.  If for example the murderer of Mr. More-O'Ferrall were apprehended to-morrow and put on trial before a jury, I am not so optimistic as to believe that if a unanimous verdict was required for his conviction he would be convicted no matter what the evidence was.  I think that in crimes of that nature even when conviction involves the penalty of death, it is desirable that a majority verdict of nine to three should suffice.  I am not of course, overlooking the probability that at the present moment the person charged with such a crime would be brought before the Military Tribunal.  But the Military Tribunal may not be always there.  It may be that after the Military Tribunal has disappeared, the same dangers of intimidation in this country will to some extent continue. That is a very old and long-rooted mischief here and we cannot be so lighthearted as to think that it is likely to disappear soon.  Consequently I think it is reasonable and proper that Section 73 of this Bill should be passed by this House.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this Bill as a whole&mdash;passing away from that special provision&mdash;strikes me as a characteristic piece of shamelessness on the part of this Government.  The picture was made quite complete by the speech to which we have just been listening from the Minister for Finance.  Really political life has its compensations when one is able to appreciate and enjoy the humour of the situation of the Minister for Finance getting up here and recommending this Bill.  One can enjoy comparing the speech he made on this occasion with the numerous speeches he made to us not so long ago on the Temporary Economies Bill.  A similar comparison has been made between the attitude of the Government on this Bill and their attitude to very similar proposals a few years ago.  They objected then to these proposals on the grounds that <Col N="2326" /> the country could not bear the expense.  Is the country better able to bear the expense to-day?  Is there a single person opposite who would venture to say so?</P>
    <P>They objected to these proposals at a time when there was a heavy burden of work being discharged by the courts of this country.  They are now recommending them to us at a time when it certainly would not be true to say that the courts are overworked, at a time when they have been able to spare a judge, Mr. Justice Meredith, to go gallivanting off to the Saar for six months or so, at a time when many of his colleagues in Dublin and many of the Circuit Court judges around the country are doing considerably less work, sitting fewer days and sitting shorter hours than they used to do not many years ago.</P>
    <P>I listened with amusement to the explanation of the Minister for Finance as to why there had been this falling off in the volume of business at the Four Courts.  It was the greatest pity that the Attorney-General was not here to listen to his explanation. His explanation was that the country as a whole had completely lost confidence in the competence of the Irish Bar.  I wonder what bearing that has on this Bill?  Who are going to be the judges appointed as the result of this Bill?  Are they not to be taken from this incompetent body, the Irish Bar?  If not, where are they going to be got?  Has the record of the particular barristers most closely associated with the activities of the Fianna Fáil Party been so much more irreproachable than that of their colleagues that they would be available as satisfactory judges?  Supposing they are made available, supposing the few just, capable men, the few Fianna Fáil lawyers, the few men who can be regarded as competent at the Irish Bar, are taken out and appointed as judges, what effect will that have on the volume of business at the Four Courts?  Will it not diminish still further the number of capable advocates who are available for the general public?  I have the greatest difficulty in linking up that ingenious explanation by the Minister for Finance of the paucity of business <Col N="2327" /> in the Four Courts with the actual proposals of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I say that on the ground of expense this Bill ought to be opposed.  The country is ever so much poorer than it was at the time when the proposal to create new judgeships was first made. Furthermore, it is ever so much more heavily taxed.  The burden of taxation has greatly increased and, added to that, the volume of law business is very much smaller than it then was. Consequently, I think this Bill ought to be opposed.</P>
    <P>The leader of the Labour Party made a speech on this Bill.  I did not hear all of it, but I understand that he sat down without indicating whether the Labour Party was going to support the Bill or not.  It appears to me that if the Labour Party support this Bill they, in particular, will be guilty of an act of shamelessness and an act inconsistent with the general principles for which they are supposed to stand.  I regard it as not an exaggeration to say that one of the main purposes of this Bill is to provide unnecessary jobs for Government supporters.  The Government could do much to improve the administration of justice in this State, and they could do it without the expenditure of money, merely with the expenditure of a little more honesty and a little more courage, and that would be of far greater value to this country than the Bill which they are introducing and no legislation would be required for the purpose.</P>
    <P>I have only one other word to say. It is really hardly worth saying but, for some reason or other, the Minister for Finance thought it relevant or humorous to make several references to the Corporative State in connection with this Party.  The Corporative State is not, never has been, the policy of this Party, nor during the time when he was associated with this Party was it ever declared by him to be the policy of General O'Duffy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the whole debate on this Bill took its complexion from the speech which was made by Deputy Costello last night.  I think this is one of the measures which <Col N="2328" /> ought to be considered by both sides of the House dispassionately and on its merits.  There is nobody here who is not aware of the fact that a Committee was set up as long ago as 1929, and we have a report from that Joint Committee dating back to November, 1930. Anyone who looks at the recommendations in that report and who examines this Bill will see that in the main the Bill follows the recommendations then made.</P>
      <P>The only point that has been made is the question of whether this is an appropriate time.  It might perhaps be said that we have lasted in the present condition over a period of four or five years and that we could continue in the same condition for a further period. But I would put it to Deputies that it is most unwise to set up a Committee of this sort to examine into a matter of such general importance to the community as the administration of justice and to allow the recommendations of that Committee to be pigeonholed indefinitely.  I say, therefore, that if any fault has to be found with us, it is that we did not immediately, on assuming office, give effect to the recommendations of that Committee.  I quite confess that more than once I expressed the opinion that this Bill should have been brought forward sooner, and the only reason that it was not was that we have, as everybody knows, in this House Bills constantly coming in with regard to matters of industry and commerce and other matters of that sort and we had to give precedence to those things.  Therefore, I think we would be more justly blamed by the Opposition if it had been said to us that we allowed this report to remain for an unconscionable time and did not give effect to it.  In my opinion we are giving effect to it not too soon; if anything, rather too late.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next question that has been raised is the question of expense.  It is said we are creating two new judges.  The very people who complained about this expense admit that it is desirable that the Supreme Court should be strengthened, that, as it is our Supreme Court, it is desirable that it should have the confidence of every citizen.  For instance, not very <Col N="2329" /> long ago there was a case in which we had a unanimous decision on a very fundamental and important matter, a unanimous decision by the High Court. That went to the Supreme Court and we had a majority decision there.  If the majority decision had been in the other direction, as it might have been, we would have had a rather curious result in that two judges of the Supreme Court would be reversing a unanimous decision by the High Court. I think that that would be an undesirable situation and that in cases of importance of that particular kind it should be possible to have a court in which, if there was a reversal of a decision, the majority would at least be greater than or as great as the number which gave the decision in the High Court.  Nobody has attempted, in fact, to make a case against strengthening the Supreme Court which will have to be done sooner or later, and I suggest that the sooner it is done the better.  We cannot have it both ways.  If we want judges, if we think it desirable, we must be prepared to face the expense. There is no use in suggesting that we can have judges without that expense. That, at any rate, was the recommendation of the Committee and we have implemented that recommendation to that extent.</P>
    <P>Another recommendation of the Committee was that we should have a rehearing on appeal instead of the present system of appeal by notes. There again, the Bill follows the recommendation of the Committee. Deputy McGilligan, I think it was, made a case against this rehearing, but, at any rate, a layman looking at it can say that this change has been recommended by a Joint Committee after seeing both systems in practice. The only question is whether there should be a rehearing by two judges or by one.  I confess that there considerations of economy decided the question.  Probably it would be held that two judges in such a case would be better than one.  It would certainly mean, however, that twice the time would have to be taken over the cases, because under the Bill two judges can go on circuit hearing <Col N="2330" /> appeals, both of them going to the one town and sitting in separate courts hearing simultaneously the different cases.  It is quite obvious that if the two judges were sitting together in the one court they would not do half the business; because the two together would probably be very much slower about each particular case than a single judge would be.  I think that the extra expense that would be incurred in having two judges would have to be justified more completely than it has been by any views put before us.  Consequently, the Government took the view that the principle of rehearing in appeals which was suggested by the Joint Committee should be accepted and that considerations of economy should be kept in mind by having one judge instead of two.  I simply say on that, that probably if expense had not to be taken into account the Government would have agreed to two judges.  The expense, however, would be considerable and we do not think that there has been a sufficient case made to make it appear that there was such a necessity as would justify the expense.</P>
    <P>The third point raised was the question of stenographers.  I must confess that the case made for the retention of the stenographers taking notes has affected me considerably.  Personally, I think that a very good case has been made for a re-examination of that.  I have no doubt whatever that if the Minister for Justice were here he would take the views expressed very carefully into consideration.  Certainly if I were acting as Minister for Justice, I would be very much inclined to meet the points raised in that matter and to provide for note-taking.  I have been in court a few times myself and I have always considered it an extraordinary thing that the business should be held up while the judge took a lengthy note in longhand.  Consequently, I think that I can say that in Committee the suggestion about stenographers will probably be before the Dáil again&mdash;it may be by way of amendment by us.  I cannot go any farther at the moment because, unfortunately, the Minister for Justice, who has had the whole charge of this Bill, <Col N="2331" /> is unwell.  I will promise, however, that the matter will be most carefully considered.</P>
    <P>The next point is the advisory committee which is to be set up to deal with complaints against the conduct of district justices.  The moment you keep in mind the constitution of this committee, when you remember that it is to consist of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court, and the Attorney-General, you will see at once that, even if you were to regard the Attorney-General as purely partisan in the matter, you have a tribunal, at any rate, in which the majority will take the point of view of the need for the independence of the judiciary.  Most Deputies are aware that the Attorney-General occupies a relatively independent position under our Constitution and in our Acts.  It is altogether a mistaken idea that people have that the Attorney-General is a member of the Executive Council and is more or less compelled to take action in accordance with the majority, or something of that sort. He is not.  He is in a comparatively independent position and he does act independently.  He takes account, naturally, of the need for the safety of the community as a whole and matters of that sort, but, generally speaking, and particularly in relation to matters of this sort, the Attorney-General occupies an independent position.</P>
    <P>The position would be this: that if the Minister for Justice thought that a particular district justice was acting in an improper manner, he would bring the matter to the attention of the Attorney-General of the day and ask him to have the conduct of this particular justice reviewed.  I stand very firmly over the independence of the judiciary.  I think it is a very important principle.  I think it would be a great mistake on the part of any Government to do anything which would make it appear that the judiciary was in any way subject to the Executive of the day.  It has to stand in an independent position and that position ought to be one of safeguarding the interests of the individual citizen against any unjustified aggression <Col N="2332" /> on the part of the Executive.  At the same time, the courts ought to bear in mind that an Executive has responsible duties to the community; that it has to perform its duty.</P>
    <P>Whilst protecting the citizen against any undue aggression by the Executive Council a justice should at the same time have in mind the interests of the community as a whole, and remember that there is such a thing in a matter of that sort as unjustifiably leaning backwards.  I think I have heard it from the other side of the House, and therefore it will not be regarded as a Party attack if I say that I have been scandalised on more than one occasion, not alone since I came to those benches but even when I was on the other benches, by statements that have been made unnecessarily by justices, apart from their functions or their duties, and I take it that no member of this House wants that.  Justices are in a protected position.  They are given positions of great responsibility and great honour, so they ought to be most careful that in the exercise of their duties they keep within their own proper limit.  In cases where that is departed from, I think the Minister for Justice of the day&mdash;if he thinks remarks made by a justices are calculated to impair the administration of justice or the preservation of order&mdash;would be entitled to bring the conduct of such a justice to the attention of the Attorney-General. Is there anybody here who thinks for a moment that if a case of that kind were referred to the Committee which is provided for in this Bill&mdash;the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the Attorney-General&mdash;there would be a decision against the district justice unless it were well justified? It is no harm for anybody to have constantly before him the idea that he is not irresponsible&mdash;that there are some people at any rate to whom he is responsible.  Judges for instance are themselves responsible to the Dáil, in the sense that if they were to act in a manner which was obviously irregular and generally harmful&mdash;I forget the exact words of the Constitution at the moment&mdash;the Dáil could, by the <Col N="2333" /> majority that is provided for, remove a judge, and I think that the community does need some protection in that case.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the fact that the alternative would be to have the same rule for them here; there are judges to look after judges.  The Deputy will admit that the judges of the High Court are on a higher scale. At any rate, they are so regarded, and are paid higher.  They are in a position of greater responsibility than district justices.  We put the higher judges, so to speak, or a committee of them, as guardians over the other judges.  The guardian over the higher judges is ultimately this House, as representing the community as a whole.  I think that there is an understandable gradation there.  I want to point out also to the Deputy, who seems to be quite unaware of it, the fact that there is a distinction at the moment.  Under the existing law, the present position is that if the Attorney-General and the Chief Justice&mdash;there are only two on the committee at the moment&mdash;were to agree, they could remove a district justice for misconduct.  The only thing we are really doing is changing it from being a tribunal or a committee of two to a committee of three, and we are weighting it on the side of the independence of the judiciary by putting a majority of the judges on the committee.  I do not think that any reasonable person can suggest that there is, in that, anything which can fairly be described as an attempt to undermine the independence of the judiciary.  I am perfectly certain that the majority of our people will understand that it is necessary to have some tribunal to which a complaint can be made when justices act in an irresponsible manner, exceed their functions, or take advantage of the position they are in to say and do things which they ought not to say or do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next point which has been referred to is this question of a majority verdict.  I must confess that <Col N="2334" /> personally I do not share Deputy MacDermot's views.  I am more or less of the view which I held when I was in Opposition.  The Attorney-General&mdash;I do not think he was properly reported last night when speaking on this matter on the Second Reading&mdash;made it quite clear that the Government was not wedded to that system.  It may then be asked why we do not put the other system into the Bill.  The reason is that we have made inquiries from various sources, and got the opinions of district justices, Circuit Court judges and others on the matter, and the reports we have got would seem to indicate that the fears which I had when I was in Opposition were not justified, and that the system as a whole is not working badly.  Consequently, holding the view which I held when I was in Opposition, when I said that a matter of this sort should not be changed immediately at the will of any particular Executive, I think personally it was much better to bring the present position before the Dáil and hear the views that would be expressed.  There is admittedly a difference of opinion on those benches and a difference of opinion on these benches in regard to this particular matter.  You can hardly pick out half-a-dozen people who will not have different opinions about it.  As this was, therefore, a matter on which there was admittedly a difference of opinion, before finally going back on the old system&mdash;I must say that personally I very strongly inclined to the unanimous jury, certainly in capital cases &mdash;I think it was better that we should first of all hear the opinions of the Dáil, and see whether the Opposition, now that they have left these benches and gone to the others, have changed their minds.  It seems to me that if we are charged with changing our minds the same charge can equally be levelled against members of the opposite benches, who also appear to have changed their minds in the opposite direction.  I do not know whether we can fairly say that that is proof of what was said by a Minister who was accused of changing his mind when he went from Opposition into office.  What he said was:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2335" />&ldquo;Well, when I was in Opposition I was in a position of far greater liberty and less responsibility.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Whether that may justly be said to account for the change of attitude on the part of those who were on the went to the opposite benches, and on the part of those who were on the opposite benches and came here, I am not going to say at the moment.  I can say that, as far as I am concerned, I feel that in capital cases, before a man's life is taken by the State, we should have it determined as far as we can by unanimity that he is guilty.  I am only a layman, and the difference of opinion on this matter is perhaps as much amongst lawyers as amongst laymen.</P>
    <P>My view of it is this: suppose a mistake has been made in a case where imprisonment occurred, it is always possible for the State to give a certain amount of compensation.  They can release the prisoner and they can give certain compensation for the time he has spent in prison.  But if the State has taken a life it can make no compensation; it cannot restore or bring back that life.  The case may be made by lawyers&mdash;&ldquo;Well, if you accept the principle of unanimity at all you must make it range over the whole line of criminal cases.&rdquo;  I say I do not agree. I think there is very definitely a distinction between a case where a man's life is taken, which cannot be restored by the courts, and a case where the State has put a man in prison.  It is a very serious loss, no doubt, if a man is deprived of his liberty unjustly, but it is possible for the State to make some amends and it is possible to undo the wrong to a certain extent.  On the other hand, if a man has been wrongly executed, there is no chance of making restoration.  Therefore, if it were left to my judgment alone, I confess to the House&mdash;I would probably be guided by others on the question of a majority verdict in other cases&mdash;that in capital cases I would make unanimity necessary.</P>
    <P>When we come to the question of majority verdicts, there is also the question of what is to be the majority. Is it to be nine out of 12, or 12 out <Col N="2336" /> of 16, as, I think, is the Scottish system? The larger the number, in one sense, the better the chance of satisfactory results.  I think that is fairly sound, but we have had a system of 12 jurors and it is, apparently, considered that that is a sufficiently large number.  The question is whether nine out of 12 is a sufficient majority.  However, it would be possible, if a mistake were made, for the State to make amends of some sort in any case, except a capital case.  Undoubtedly, I would clearly distinguish between capital cases and other types of cases. As against the submission of Deputy MacDermot, I would say that the object of punishment in these cases is not so much that of exacting penalties from people or from the individual concerned.  It is mainly with a view to preventing similar occurrences; it is a deterrent.</P>

      <P>Looking at it from that point of view, I think the Deputy will admit that the very fact that a man knows that if he commits murder, and if he is caught, he will be tried, and that if the facts are sufficient to convince 12 men that he is guilty, he can be convicted&mdash;that from the point of view of a deterrent is sufficient.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>He is not likely to play on the chance that he may have one or two jurors who may not agree or who may not be convinced.  It is a question in the long run of securing the necessary evidence, I would say, and from the point of view of its being a deterrent, I think we would lose nothing if the verdict in capital cases had to be unanimous.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I intervene for one moment?  The weakness of the point the President is making is that where there is an element of intimidation expected, it is not true that the man who contemplates committing a crime believes that if 12 men are convinced of his guilt he will be found guilty.  He believes, on the contrary, that some of those who are <Col N="2337" /> convinced of his guilt will be intimidated from finding a verdict to that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>If he feels so strongly about that, he will believe that he can get not merely four, but six jurors who will not vote for finding him guilty.  If the intimidation is to be so effective as the Deputy imagines it will be carried much further than that.  However, I admit, and I admitted it at the start, that this is a matter on which people, looking at it from different angles, will hold different opinions.  We are not infallible, and we have, each one of us, only to think for ourselves what is the best thing to do.  Both systems have been tried, and both systems, according to the reports given to me, seem to work.  We put it to the Dáil in this way&mdash;I think it is no secret, and I think I can tell it to you&mdash; that unless very strong pressure is put forward for the retention of this provision as it appears, it will be changed in Committee, at least to exempt cases where capital punishment is involved.  That is the position as it stands at the moment.  We are quite frank to the Dáil about it. We wanted to have this matter discussed, and we felt that it would be better to leave it in the form in which it is at the moment, on its first introduction, and get it dealt with in that way rather than to take the other view and commit ourselves absolutely to it at the start.  I admit again that there can very well be a difference of opinion about this, and that we are not wedded to this proposal. I may say&mdash;I think I can speak for the Executive Council&mdash;that the view at the moment would be that if it depended on the Executive Council alone, we would favour exemption in capital cases.  What I mean is that we would favour unanimity in capital cases.  I think I have covered the main points that have been the subject of criticism by the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other matter which was raised by Deputy Norton.  To my mind, it is very important but I think it is outside the scope of this particular Bill.  This Bill is to provide machinery, in the existing circumstances, <Col N="2338" /> to strengthen the Supreme Court and to change the system of appeals.  I might say that these are the main provisions in the Bill.  There is no attempt in this Bill to make the cost of litigation less or to make recourse to law easier for the very poor. I think that is a question that should very properly engage our attention.  I think it is a matter that the Minister for Justice might very well consider as a subject possibly for new legislation. I do not think it reasonably or properly comes into this Bill.  If and when legislation is produced to deal with the matter, we shall probably again have different opinions about it. The Minister for Finance will naturally, whether here in the Dáil or in the Executive Council&mdash;certainly in the Executive Council&mdash;have very strong views about anything that would lead to an extra burden on the taxpayer, and very properly.  When there is a question of making it easier for the poor to have recourse to law, and of getting the defence of the law where their rights are in question, the cost of the availability at the moment of legal services will have to be taken into account and other matters will have to be very carefully examined.  I can only say that the question will be examined.  I am sure that the Minister for Justice, when he reads the report of this debate, will be inclined to consider whether there are any steps that he can take to make it possible for the poor to have recourse to law and to be protected in the same way that the rich can protect themselves by their wealth at the present moment.</P>
    <P>Coming back to the question of expenses in general, except for the expense of the two judges who are apparently necessary&mdash;if we admit they are necessary we have to face the expense&mdash;the only other expense will be that of certain judges sent out on circuit but our information is that that expense, relative to the total cost, will be slight.  It is not going to be very much.  What we have to ask ourselves is, whether we have a fairly costly machine, and whether we are to stop making it as effective as we want it to be by considerations of expense in <Col N="2339" /> a relatively small way.  We think the extra cost there is justifiable; that it means less for litigants, that it means justice is nearer, and in every way is better than the present system by note.  In all this matter, while there should be differences of opinion, we should take it from one side of the House, without any suggestion that this is introduced with any motive other than the motive of the general good of the community.  If on both sides we were to approach our Bills in that way, I think we would be doing our duty very much better than if we tried to score Party points, or by dealing with measures in the extravagant way that Deputy Costello dealt with this one last night.  A heading I saw in one newspaper ran &ldquo;Unsound in principle.  Vicious.&rdquo;  I was wondering where was the viciousness and what caused the former Attorney-General to suggest that it was vicious.  Vicious is a nasty word when you see a newspaper with such a heading.  The heading to the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; report was &ldquo;Proposed changes in the law.  Courts of Justice Bill under Fire.  Principle utterly unsound and even vicious.&rdquo;  I have spoken of the principles.  I am waiting to be shown where they are utterly unsound.  I have certainly not been shown, in any statement made by anyone who kept to the Bill, where there has been anything vicious in it. I think that in recommending it, as the Attorney-General did, we can stand over the Bill as a piece of legislation which will be in the general interests of the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Rice Mr. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to take any part in the debate on the Second Reading, for the reason that I was a member of the Joint Committee of the Courts of Justice Bill, and the views I formed are contained in the report of that Committee.  Consequently they are known to everyone who takes an interest in this measure.  Having heard the debate there are some matters on which perhaps I should say a few words now, because I intend to speak on them on the Committee Stage and may possibly propose amendments.  That will give the Minister for Justice and the Attorney-General <Col N="2340" /> an opportunity of considering the points in the meantime, if they think it advisable.  The big principle of the Bill is rehearing on appeal. Different views have been expressed upon that question.  I was a member of the Committee that heard the evidence on this matter, and it was overwhelming in favour of reverting to the system of appeal by way of rehearing. The evidence given by a number of members of my own profession was not the evidence of individuals, but of barristers who were deputed by the profession to express its views.  The same remarks apply to the solicitors who gave evidence in regard to their profession.  Evidence was also given on behalf of representative public bodies and Chambers of Commerce, in favour of reverting to the old system of appeal by way of rehearing. Any person who listened to the evidence could not fail to realise that the country wanted a reversion to the old system of appeal.  My own view is that even a lawyer who objects to that system, or who does not like it, has to recognise, whether it is good or bad, that the enormous majority of the people want it and are entitled to have it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am an advocate of going back to the old system of rehearing of appeals. From my personal experience as a barrister who went on circuit for 15 years, and with ten years' experience of the new system, the old system of appeal was very much cheaper and much more satisfactory to litigants.  It is a good thing for people, when they win or lose a case, in the first instance, to have an opportunity of hearing what has happened on the appeal.  What happens under the present system is that if a person wins in the local Circuit Court, the case then goes to Dublin, and the next thing he hears is that the decree which was given in his favour has been reversed and that he has to pay the costs.  He does not know what has happened, and is full of suspicion of the honestly of the solicitor and counsel that appeared for him. Under the old system of appeal the Senior and the Junior Bar went on circuit.  I was a member of the North-East circuit where sometimes a <Col N="2341" /> case of trespass would last half a day or a whole day.  It might be a case about a gate pass between a couple of small farmers.  The fee of the junior barrister for perhaps a half day or a whole day was £1 1s., and if senior counsel was engaged the best man on the circuit would get £2 2s.  On that circuit he need not have a junior.  That senior counsel would do the case if it lasted a half day or a whole day.  If the case was lost the legal expenses including barrister's fees and solicitor's fees would amount to something between £5 and £10.  Under the present system no one could consult a junior barrister at less than £4 4s. or £5 5s. and no one would ask senior counsel to act without a proportionately larger fee.  The country wants to go back to the old system.  In my experience it was a better system and more suited to the needs of the country.</P>
    <P>There is one thing I dislike in this Bill.  The committee recommended that there should be an appeal to two judges.  I think that is the proper system of appeal.  I know that some individual members of my profession say that one judge would be enough. A system of appeal to two judges is the proper system, and that was recommended by the committee.  I say that for this reason, that 80 per cent. of the appeals are mainly on a question of fact.  There is no reason to assume that a High Court judge is a better judge of facts than a Circuit Court judge, so that if you have an appeal from a Circuit judge to one High Court judge, you will simply have one mind against another on a question of fact.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to get the Deputy's views on this matter. It has been represented to us that a second judge knows when he comes to deal with the case what points of view have been expressed already.  He has got the advantage of the previous judge's notes.  Probably he has the case presented to him in a more complete form.  The whole tendency will be to confirm the previous judge's opinion, unless he can point definitely to something that was clearly wrong.  Therefore, <Col N="2342" /> when the second judge comes along, it is not a case of one man's mind against another man's mind, but the case of a person having a more complete survey of the case than the first man could possibly have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Rice Mr. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>The answers to the President's point is this, that in a system of rehearing you have in the first instance the hearing, say, on a question of fact, and you have perhaps an incomplete hearing.  On the other hand, you may have a complete hearing. The same witnesses will come forward, or there may be additional witnesses on the rehearing.  We will assume that it is a question of fact, as to which complete testimony has been given in the first instance before the Circuit judge.  Different minds will take different views as to questions of fact.  I am referring to the class of case where there is a near balance between the two sides.  The Circuit Court judge finds that it is a question of fact and in favour of one of them.  The case goes on to appeal. You have a single judge hearing the appeal, just one human mind which there is no reason to assume is better than the other.  One simply happens to be a High Court judge and the other a Circuit Court judge.  What I suggest as the satisfactory thing would be to have two judges hearing the appeal.  You will then have either two judges agreeing with the Circuit Court judge or disagreeing.  You may have one agreeing with him and the other disagreeing on the same set of facts.  You will have this satisfaction for the litigant that, supposing the Circuit Court judge has given a decision for the plaintiff and that the two appeal judges disagree, it means that you have two minds deciding on one side as against one on the other. If the two judges hearing the appeal disagree, then the order of the Circuit Court judge will stand.  In other words, you will have two minds agreeing in favour of one litigant as against one mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point on which I wish to criticise the Bill, namely, that I think it is a great mistake to get rid of the stenographers.  I think they should be retained.  I have not the report of the joint committee <Col N="2343" /> before me, but I think the recommendation we made was that the stenographers should be retained and be made whole-time servants.  The recommendation was that while the stenographers' notes would not now be the matter on which the Appeal Court would act they should be made available for any litigant who wanted them.  Speaking from experience as a barrister, I can say that it is extremely valuable to have a note of what witness said in the court of first instance.  I have found it so in the old county courts.  In those days I used to take a shorthand note myself, so that if a witness tried to change his evidence on appeal afterwards it had a very salutary effect if you were able to confront him with a note of what he had said in the court of first instance.  Of course, the note that a barrister or a solicitor would make in court and the note made by a stenographer would be entirely different. A stenographer's note would be much more authentic, while the other would be only useful for the purposes of cross-examination.  I think the Government should reconsider this matter of implementing the recommendation of the joint committee which suggests that the stenographers should be retained and their notes made available for any person willing to pay the prescribed fees.</P>
    <P>Quite recently we read the criticism made by the Lord Chief Justice of England of the system under which judges have to make notes.  I am sure the Attorney-General will agree with me in this, that no judge can make a proper note of a case that he is trying and try the case properly at the same time.  It cannot be done.  While the judge should be watching the witness, he is trying to get down on paper a note of what the witness is saying.  There is only one High Court judge, so far as I know, who takes a shorthand note of the evidence, but I think that even doing that must distract a judge from his real, vital business, which is that of watching the case, listening to every phrase and every turn of phrase and studying the expressions of witnesses.  A case cannot be properly tried by a judge who <Col N="2344" /> has to make notes, and who has to take into account that his notes will be before the Court of Appeal that is going to decide the question as to whether he was right or wrong in his decision.  Again I would strongly urge on the Government to reconsider that and to implement that portion of the committee's account.  I do not make any appeal to the Government on the grounds that they are putting out of employment a number of very deserving people, because every Government is obdurate and unsympathetic to those considerations.</P>
    <P>On the question of nine jurors I do not agree with some of the speakers who have gone before me.  I had three or four years' experience prosecuting in Green Street.  I have discussed this matter with some of my colleagues, some of the most experienced members of the Bar, within the last few days, and I have expressed my own opinion in this way: that if I were, say, an Englishman living in England, I would be against the idea of having to accept the verdict of only nine jurors in a criminal case.  I put my ground for that in this way: that I think an English jury will convict on a great deal less evidence than an Irish jury.  I am speaking now from personal experience. I never saw a conviction by a jury of the City of Dublin&mdash;I think, on the whole, that they are perhaps harder than jurors through the country&mdash;in a case in which there was any suspicion that the person convicted was innocent. I do not think that you will ever get nine jurors&mdash;pick them as you like at random&mdash;in this country to agree that a person is guilty unless the evidence is what you might call overwhelming against them.  I think there is a good deal in the distinction that the President has drawn between the case of a death sentence and other kinds of crime because if a man is wrongly convicted on the capital offence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not agree with the point of view that you should have a unanimous verdict in ordinary criminal cases.  I think it is safe enough in this country to have a verdict of nine jurors. I say that you will never get a conviction by nine people out of twelve unless the evidence is really overwhelming. There is this to be said about the case in which capital punishment is involved &mdash;that the jurors will be more cautious than ever when a man's life is at stake. With some other statements of the President, I find myself in agreement. He said that he was scandalised on occasions by pronouncements made from the bench not only when he was in opposition but when in office.  I was glad to hear the President say that.  I have always thought that sufficient notice was not taken of persons in judicial positions&mdash;minor or otherwise&mdash;pontificating from the bench. That is not their job.  I regret to say that it has happened in a very scandalous way since the President took office and that no notice, so far as I know, has been taken of it.  I welcome the statement from the President that he condemns it, and I hope that he will take steps to see that it does not recur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Attorney-General to another matter arising out of Section 77.  This is really a point which I should raise <Col N="2346" /> on Committee Stage.  I am putting it forward now so that it may receive consideration in the meantime.  This is the section which deals with what is known to lawyers as Lord Campbell's Act&mdash;that is, the Fatal Accidents Act of 1846.  That was an Act which gave a new right and a new cause of action to dependants where persons were killed by negligence.  Those dependants are entitled to bring an action claiming damages for the loss. The Act provided that a jury should try the action and that a jury should also deal with the apportionment of the damages amongst the different dependants.  I confess that, as Section 77 is framed, I do not really understand what is intended.  It is so obscure that I should like to have the matter cleared up.  The section says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Notwithstanding anything contained in the Fatal Accidents Act 1846, any action under that Act may be heard and determined by a judge without a jury.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The word used is &ldquo;may.&rdquo;  The section goes on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...when any such action is so heard, Section 2 of the said Act shall be construed and have effect as if the word `judge' were substituted therein for the word `jury' where-ever that word occurs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest, for the consideration of the Attorney-General, that the Act of 1846 being an Act which gives a new cause of action, when you substitute here the word &ldquo;judge&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;jury,&rdquo; it is open to the construction that you are taking away the right of trial by jury.  I could understand the section if it provided that, on consent of the parties, the action might be tried by a judge without a jury, but having regard to the fact that the Act of 1846 gave a new cause of action, when you make this substitution, it may be construed by a judge as imposing upon him the obligation to try the action himself without a jury. There are two limbs in that section of the Act of 1846.  One of these limbs provides that the jury are to determine the question of negligence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Rice Mr. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the statement of the Attorney-General.  The section as it stands is, however, open to the construction&mdash;I have consulted some of my most experienced colleagues on this matter and they agree with my view&mdash;I have mentioned.  One limb of that section in the Act of 1846 says that the question of negligence must be tried by a jury.  The second limb provides that the jury are to apportion the damages amongst the dependants. There is a great deal to be said for the view that the judge should apportion the damages amongst the dependants but I do not think that there is anything to be said for the suggestion that the judge should determine the question of negligence.  We know that the right to a jury was limited in effect by Section 94 of the Courts of Justice Act of 1924 to cases of tort.  This is really a case of tort and I should not like that a section of this Bill would be even ambiguous as to the right of the litigant to have a jury in cases of this kind.  I hope that the Attorney-General will consider the amendment of that section of the Bill so as to clarify the position.  Let us take the case of a man who is killed and who leaves a widow and a number of young children.  In that case the judge would probably be the better tribunal to determine the apportionment of the damages amongst the dependants but I did not think that the question of negligence in an action of this kind should ever be tried, except by consent, by a judge alone. Those are the main points that occurred to me.  I put forward the last point, the question of the stenographers and the question of two judges, in the hope that the Government will give them consideration between now and the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I hesitate to speak on this Bill but, having had occasion during the last four or five years to find fault with the present Minister for Justice and with his predecessor, owing to the non-functioning of the Circuit Courts, I think I should say that, in my opinion, the provision made by this Bill is very similar to what we have at the moment. On the last occasion on which I put a <Col N="2348" /> question to the Minister&mdash;a little over 12 months ago&mdash;he informed me that there were 262 cases awaiting trial in the Circuit Court and that over 60 of those cases had been for seven months on the list of the court.  I stressed the unfairness of that to the commercial community, because before these cases reached the Circuit Court the plaintiffs were possibly from four to five months endeavouring to get payment of their accounts.  As a last resort they tried to get the court to interfere on their behalf.  In most of those cases, which were listed after the parties had been three or four months endeavouring to get payment, 12 months elapsed before they got a verdict.  In many cases there was an appeal, and business was so congested in the appeals court that that involved a further delay of six months. Well, now, it was a most unfair thing that the business community should have to lie out of their money for such a long time, and I am not surprised at all at what Deputy Costello said yesterday about the state of legal business in view of this fact.  In the Circuit Court at the moment the Minister informed me that there were two judges dealing with these cases that came before the Court, and still this state of congestion has been getting, if anything, worse for the last four to five years, notwithstanding the two judges. In this Bill, I find that the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court is the same.</P>
      <P>There is one small matter that I would like to refer to, and that is the winding up of companies that is taken away from the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court and put into the High Court.  That is only a small matter, and otherwise the jurisdiction is much the same.  Consequently, if this congestion occurred under the existing system, and there is no alteration in the existing system or in the number of judges that preside over the Circuit Court, we may expect the same congestion under this scheme.  That, to my mind, is most unfair, and I intervene at this stage to point that out to the Minister for Justice and to the Attorney-General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other matter with regard to the Appeal Court to which I should like to refer before I leave <Col N="2349" /> that point.  The appeal is from the Circuit Court, and there it is very much the same under this Bill as it is at present.  One judge will be allocated to hear the appeals.  If there has been congestion and if it is found that that system has produced congestion in the past, there is no guarantee that the same kind of thing will not occur under the new system.  I should like the Attorney-General to look into that.  We have been suffering in the City of Dublin for at least five years owing to the delays, and it is the view of all commercial men&mdash;and I see a number of them&mdash;that the system is tedious, costly and unsatisfactory.  Those are the views, generally, on the Circuit Court at the moment.</P>
    <P>There is just one other point to which I should like to refer.  Under this Bill, the judges are to go on circuit at two periods each year.  It is necessary that some judge should remain here to hear cases such as the winding-up of companies and other matters that may come before the courts in connection with bankruptcy and things of that nature.  It is necessary that one judge should always be available in Dublin.</P>

      <P>I hesitate to enter into a discussion on matters of law, but, from a layman's point of view, I think that the Bill is all to the good in that it proposes to bring back to the country the rehearing of cases.  I think that it is a very good thing to have established in the minds of the people of our country that there is a <Col N="2350" /> means, and a ready means, of redress for their grievances, let them be supposed grievances, or otherwise&mdash;the courts will determine that&mdash;and I think that in that respect the Bill commends itself to us.  Another thing that I would like to say is that I was impressed by the President's statement on the question of majority verdicts.  I say that, because I think it is well that the country should know the Government's attitude towards the preservation of life.  Perhaps, circumstances, into which we need not go in detail, have helped the country to look less seriously on the taking of life than in former times, and perhaps the rising generation does not look upon it in the same way as the people of long ago.  However, I think that even the State should err on the side of caution.  I think it is a right principle, as the President has put it, that before the State intervenes to take a person's life, the verdict should be a unanimous one so as to put the matter beyond all doubt; and whilst it is necessary that the State should do everything in its power to deter crime, it should not, on the other hand, give any facility towards the lessening of its responsibility in regard to the preservation of life.  Perhaps there are people who might enter into a long debate on the question of whether life should be taken at all or not.  I am not going to enter into that, but I think that, as a Government and as the elected representatives of the people, we cannot be too careful in this matter, and I think it would be a wise thing, as the President pointed out, to have an amendment inserted on the Committee Stage that would put that matter beyond all doubt in such cases and that there should be a unanimous verdict instead of a majority verdict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also inclined to agree with Deputy Rice when he says that there should be an additional judge for rehearing.  I am not competent, and I do not wish, to enter into the question of the competence of a single judge on rehearing, but I think that it would establish more confidence in the law among the people of the country and among the litigants themselves <Col N="2351" /> if an additional judge were present at the rehearing on appeal. I was impressed with the point of view expressed by Deputy Rice, and I think that if we have rehearing on appeal in the country it would be well-spent money.  It would mean extra expense, probably, but it would be well worth it to have a second judge on appeal.  After all, the more we establish in the minds of our people the absolute fairness and absolute impartiality of our courts, the more our people will respect the courts and the more they will respect the majesty of the law.  I do not wish to enter into any further details and I only rose because I just wanted to express my mind on those few points.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>The course of this debate has been rather curious, and, to me, somewhat of a surprise both in the tone in which it opened and the tone in which it closed.  In opening the discussion on it and in moving the Bill, I made a very simple statement outlining the main proposals in the Bill, referring to the Joint Committee's Report, drawing attention to the part of that Report that was being implemented in the Bill, making clear to the House the recommendations in the Report which were not being adopted, and giving some reasons as to why the Committee's Report was being departed from in these respects.  That course was adopted because here we were introducing a Bill which has been in the air for a number of years.  It is many years ago since the pressure upon the then Government was so great with regard to the position of the administration of justice through the courts that they yielded to that pressure and set up this Joint Committee. <i>Prima facie</i> there must have been some dissatisfaction, something that the Government of the day felt called upon to investigate.  There must have been something that after a period of five years was thought to be a sufficiently important question to investigate, namely, the question whether the courts were working satisfactorily under a system established in 1924.  That was considered a sufficiently important question to find <Col N="2352" /> out how the courts had been functioning, and to find out how the system had been working, and they set up a formal Committee of the House to investigate the matter and make recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Joint Committee sat.  It began in 1929 and sat on throughout 1930.  I was one of the witnesses who went before it.  I went there as the representative of the Bar Council.  I had no axe to grind.  At that time I had been eight years a junior barrister.  I was out in the cold so far as the Government of the day was concerned, but I went before that Committee to give my impression as to how the system then working compared with the system in operation up to 1924. That Committee had before them judges, district justices and everybody who took an interest in the working of the courts.  All these people attended and gave their evidence.  They went there to help the Committee.  They were put through long and searching examination as to the working of the particular system in the courts, and they made any suggestions that they thought would help to improve the conditions.  That appeared to me to be a perfectly reasonable and rational way for the Dáil or Oireachtas to approach the question whether the system in their courts ought or ought not to be remodelled.  That was the system adopted in framing the Courts of Justice Act in 1924.  It obviously is the only practical way in which a system like that can be approached with so many technical and difficult questions to solve, problems in connection with which the ordinary layman is so remote that he is unable to form a judgment upon them unless he can get the experience from those who possess it.  Those who are in a position to do so offered their help in every way so far as they could to perfect the measure.  Again, I say that appears to me the only rational way in which to approach that particular type of question. After investigation, such as I have detailed, that Joint Committee made unanimous recommendations along certain lines, and it has been in the air, ever since that time, that there was going to be a change of the <Col N="2353" /> present system and that certain recommendations of that Committee were going to be fulfilled.</P>
    <P>I make bold to say that in 1931, if the Government then in office had remained in office, having that Joint Committee's report before them, one of the first things they would do would have been to introduce a Bill to implement the recommendations of that Joint Committee. It is all nonsense to pretend that the recommendations were not reached after full consideration of all aspects of the problem, or to pretend that they had not the backing of the opinion of men who had made most searching investigations into the matter, or that they did not represent what Deputy Rice said, namely, what the people really wanted with regard to the administration of justice.  In that state of things, when this Government came into office if, instead of doing what it reasonably might be expected to do, namely, bringing in a Bill founded on those recommendations, it proceeded with more important pieces of legislation to enable it to complete its programme, it might reasonably be complained that there had been much delay rather than overhaste in bringing forward this measure.</P>
    <P>I was astonished to hear the onslaught made on the Bill by Deputy Costello.  I have the highest respect for Deputy Costello.  I do not impugn any of the Deputy's motives and I accept quite sincerely what he says, but I find it very difficult to see how he can justify the language he used in reference to this particular Bill.  The President referred to two or three adjectives that Deputy Costello flung out and proceeded in a half-hearted way to justify.  For an hour and a half he was obviously endeavouring to make as much political capital as he possibly could out of the introduction of this measure by the present Government. That was followed by a similar kind of attack by other Deputies opposite. As I said, I was astonished at the tone in which Deputy Costello opened his speech but I was equally surprised at the speeches of some other Deputies and at the statements made that this measure was introduced at <Col N="2354" /> an inopportune moment and that it contained an unsound principle.  I would have expected an attitude of praise from the Opposition, who were themselves responsible for this Committee and who invited this report and who, I should have thought, if they were in office in the ordinary way, would have brought in a similar type of measure.</P>
    <P>We welcome the type of criticism on this measure that we got from Deputy Rice.  I am glad to see that he has had the courage to stand up for this report. I feel the tone and temper of his speech was wholly admirable.  When he asked us to look into certain points that he made, and certain criticisms that he offered, I have no hesitation in giving an undertaking that the two or three matters that he mentioned will be looked into.  He was the only Deputy opposite who referred to Clause 77.  As I indicated on a former occasion, it is not intended to deprive the plaintiff in fatal accident cases of the right of trial before a jury.  All that is intended is rightly to interpret a consent, and to enable a judge without a jury to hear Lord Campbell cases on the question of the apportionment of damages.  It was merely intended to do that and to allow the trial before a jury to be availed of in the ordinary way.  We had from Deputy Good the answer to some of the fulminations we heard in this debate, and the unfounded suggestions that such is the state of things in the courts that there is no necessity for any attempt to improve the machinery.  He has given the instance of the position with regard to the Dublin Circuit Court.  He holds an opinion as a business man and I am sure he has no motive inspiring him when he suggests that there should be further expenditure in connection with it.  He merely wants what business men have always been asking for&mdash; swift dispatch of business.  It is almost more important, in my opinion, that justice should be speedy than that decisions of the judges should be correct.  Unfortunately, the complaint has been made against more than one branch of the Judiciary in this country that one of the evils is that justice is not speedy or is not as speedy as it should be.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2355" /> In answer to Deputy Good, if I may, now that I have mentioned his complaint&mdash;I do not know whether he was here when I introduced the Bill&mdash;I did point out that it was intended to assign two permanent judges to Dublin.  He may reply, of course, that there are at present two judges, because Judge Davitt and Judge Shannon are, practically speaking, permanently assigned. Judge Shannon has been there since he was appointed, but it is the intention to enable business in Dublin to be dealt with with more dispatch by lightening the outside circuits so as to have a judge available to come in and assist the Dublin judges.  Hitherto, it was not possible, by reason of the wording of the Act, to transfer a Circuit judge from one area to another to assist temporarily in clearing up business. Whether that will be adequate or not, I am not in a position to say, but we hope it will help, and it ought to help considerably, the speeding up of business in the Dublin Circuit Courts.</P>

      <P>It is very late, and this Bill has been thrashed out at great length, and although I have a number of points raised by Deputies noted here, I do not know that it is necessary for me to go into them in detail.  The criticism of the Bill, and of what one might call the principles of it, which are the only matters which should be relevant on Second Reading, falls under certain main heads.  Some have already been dealt with adequately, and some of them have not perhaps been dealt with so fully. Deputy Costello selected four or five matters of major importance and applied the adjectives &ldquo;vicious&rdquo; and &ldquo;unsound&rdquo; to certain of the provisions, and with those I think I shall be justified in dealing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first principle which he attacked and suggested was &ldquo;vicious&rdquo; and &ldquo;unsound&rdquo; was this provision that Supreme Court judges should be available to deal with High Court work, and he enlarged upon the view, which we all hold and which nobody can doubt is correct, that it would be an ideal thing if one could have a Supreme <Col N="2356" /> Court completely aloof and away from the ordinary business of the courts, and which would be regarded with greater awe and respect than any other branch of the courts.  That, on paper, anyhow, looks to be the ideal thing.  I wonder if that is so in practice?  I wonder if experienced lawyers would not say that it might be a very good thing that judges sitting in the Supreme Court should from time to time deal with the ordinary work of the courts, sit as High Court judges, go on circuit, see the conditions in the country and have the experience of actually seeing and hearing witnesses who appear before them and be brought more closely into touch with the realities of life throughout the country?  I think there is a good deal to be said for that view.  I certainly do not see why the adjective &ldquo;vicious&rdquo; should be applied to it.</P>
    <P>You have certain instances and the President illustrated it very admirably in the instance he gave&mdash;it is agreed on by the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court and all those who gave evidence before the Joint Committee&mdash;in which cases are heard by a court of three in the High Court, where they go on appeal to the Supreme Court and where by two to one in the Supreme Court a decision of the three judges in the High Court may be reversed.  There you have four against two, and yet the verdict of the two stands.  It may be said that the two are Supreme Court judges whose opinion is entitled to greater weight than a decision of the High Courts.  I think Deputy Costello himself has suggested that very often you cannot see the difference between High Court and Circuit Court judges; in some instances, you have Circuit judges who in standing and ability and so on may not rank as high as High Court judges and the same applies in connection with the distinction between High Court judges and Supreme Court judges.</P>
    <P>You have also the position which has not been mentioned at all that in several important cases that have been heard during the last ten years the High Court Bench has been drawn upon, but perhaps I am going on to another point now.  Deputy Costello, <Col N="2357" /> as I say, first of all criticised the provision which enabled the Supreme Court to be drawn upon for the purpose of enabling the business of the High Court to be dealt with more expeditiously. As I said in introducing the Bill, that is a compromise.  It is admitted, I think, that the High Court needs additional judges and it is admitted that the Supreme Court needs strengthening.  The ideal system might be to give the Supreme Court their extra judges and to give the High Court some extra judges, but the compromise which we suggest here seems to me to have about it the recommendation that, if it can work in practice, it achieves in a much simpler and more economical way the two ends of enabling one to have a Supreme Court of five to hear important cases and to prevent anomalies arising, such as arose in the particular case already referred to, and, at the same time, to enable them, when less important cases have to be dealt with, to be drawn upon to deal with these cases.  With all due respect to Deputy Costello, there are less important cases.  There are degrees of importance in cases which go to the Supreme Court and I challenge his statement that all cases that go to the Supreme Court are all of equal importance.  Does he suggest for one moment that a motion for a new trial in a running-down case is of equal importance with a case involving the validity of a particular Act of the Oireachtas or some other constitutional question?</P>
    <P>It is absurd and ridiculous to say that you cannot have a workable system under which when a case of importance or a case which has been heard by a full court of the High Court comes up for review, five judges can be called on, and at other times, when the pressure on the High Court requires extra judges, either for the hearing of appeals or for the dispatch of the ordinary business of the High Court, a court of three cannot be left available to deal with the ordinary less important cases in the Supreme Court.  One of the excuses given for the use of the word &ldquo;vicious&rdquo; is that that particular condition of affairs should prevail.  I submit that there was no basis whatever for it.  The other <Col N="2358" /> aspect of it which is also relied on to justify the charge of &ldquo;vicious,&rdquo; namely, that you would have the colleagues of one man sitting in judgment upon him, that if he functions as a High Court judge he might have his colleagues in the Supreme Court reviewing his decisions. That is possibly not absolutely the thing that one would desire if it were possible to avoid it, but the thing has been happening during the last ten years and we have not heard a word about it from the opposite benches.</P>
    <P>Frequently cases have been decided by members of the High Court drawn to sit in the Supreme Court, and you had the particular position which arose in one case in which a Supreme Court judge was unable to sit, owing to very good personal reasons, on a case which lasted three weeks, and a High Court judge was called upon to sit in the Supreme Court and while the court was sitting, the Supreme Court judge owing to the position that prevailed up to the introduction of this Bill, could not be asked to do any other work, and for three weeks he went about without a thing to do.  In the Court of Criminal Appeal you have the exact position.  When I mentioned this to Deputy Costello, when he was speaking, he said it had nothing to do with it and that it was quite irrelevant.  I suggest that it is not irrelevant.</P>
    <P>It is not irrelevant to point this fact out&mdash;the President of the High Court goes down to Green Street and presides in the Central Criminal Court.  Appeals from his decisions come before the Court of Criminal Appeal.  The Court of Criminal Appeal is constituted of a judge of the Supreme Court and two High Court judges.  The two High Court judges are to sit in review of the action of their colleague in refusing a certificate or on his conduct of the case.  That is not a practice that one would desire, but I do not see anything in it which justifies its being characterised as vicious or unsound.</P>
    <P>I think it was unreasonable to open this debate on the note on which it was opened.  Charges were made <Col N="2359" /> upon the slightest justification.  That, I suggest, is the case in the reasons given by Deputy Costello.  The Deputy advanced to the second charge. The second charge was a wholesale attack upon the return to the system of appeals which obtained under the British.  Again, we had Deputy Vincent Rice speaking at the very end of the debate, with the responsibility attaching to a member of the Joint Committee which heard this thing at length.  The Deputy is, perhaps, in the best position of any of us here&mdash; together with the other members of the Committee who sat with him&mdash;to judge as to how far a genuine feeling prevails in the country against the system of appeals introduced in 1924.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan does not seem to realise any fault at all in the system introduced in 1924 however unreasonable it is.  However, one may argue that the system at present is a better and a more perfect one, but the real answer to that is that the people of the country&mdash;and there cannot be any reasonable doubt about it&mdash;want a return to the Assize Circuit.  Deputy Costello himself says he is a voice crying in the wilderness.  His only reason for opposing this provision in the Bill is, as he tells us, that he was always opposed to it.  He says it is, in his judgment, a bad system.</P>
    <P>The Deputy overlooks altogether the report of the Joint Committee which recommended this provision.  I gave evidence before that Committee.  I repeat now what I said that time.  The fact is that I gave evidence before the Committee with no intention or motive whatsoever save as a representative of the members of the Bar Council.  I put before the Committee my views as regards the working of the two systems. I suggested how the system ought to be altered so as to meet the needs of the people and to give better practical results to the man in the street.</P>
    <P>My experience as a solicitor for five years&mdash;an experience which covered the period immediately before the attack upon the system of the British courts&mdash; was put before the Joint Committee.  I was one of the leading lights myself in breaking up the Assize system in Mayo. <Col N="2360" /> I was able to bring to the notice of the Committee my experience of the Sinn Fein courts which I was responsible for organising in the West of Ireland.  I subsequently organised the Sinn Fein Land Courts, of which I was one of the judges.  I was one of those who drafted the constitution of the Republican courts.  I want to point out now that the provisions in this Bill are a much nearer approach to the constitution of the Sinn Fein courts than the system which some people imagine is approximating to that.  It approximates more closely in this way that it took some of the names which I envisaged for our courts and applied them to the system introduced in 1924.</P>
    <P>Our system was that of a judge going down from Dublin to the county towns and dealing with appeals from the district courts.  That is the system which is embodied in this Bill.  At the time I gave evidence I had eight years' experience at the Bar, and I had a practice which enabled me to bid goodbye to the county courts.  I said to the Committee that I did not view with any pleasure, nor does Deputy Rice nor any other member of the Bar view with any pleasure, the prospect of having to go down to the county towns; we do not view it with any more pleasure than do the judges.  I told the Joint Committee that I did not like the prospect of having to go down there twice a year on circuit.  At the same time I said that the appeal system though opposed was very popular.  It was very popular for the reason which I gave for the success of the district courts.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons given by one of the biggest solicitors in the country for the success of the district courts is that it has an appeal by way of rehearing to the Circuit judge.  One of the reasons given for the success of the old Assize system&mdash;and in the words of the Chief Justice it was not an English system at all, it was really unique&mdash;was the rehearing of cases.  I was speaking as a solicitor who practised for five years and who had County Court and Assize experience.  I take it after all that the <Col N="2361" /> system of the appeal to the Assize judges was quite popular with the country people for the reason that they were able to get a quick decision.  The Assize came round at regular intervals. As is intended here, a rehearing took place.  They had the benefit of having the case tried by one of the High Court judges from Dublin.</P>
    <P>I think anybody who reflects on it will agree with me that if you are to have, as Deputies Good and Haslett said, increased respect for the Administration, nothing will help to do it more than sending out High Court judges through the country.  I was quite sincere in the evidence I gave to the Committee.  I know it causes discomfort to most of the members of the Bar having to go round on circuit. I have been talking to solicitors who were unanimous in their expression of opinion that this Bill is wanted and that this is the proper way in which a system of appeals should be arranged.  Taking it all in all, this Bill is considered, by those who are competent to judge, as a quite good and excellent Bill.  So much for what a Deputy has called &ldquo;the vicious and unsound principle&rdquo; behind the Bill.</P>
    <P>When we had to adopt the recommendations of the Committee, we decided to abandon the recommendation that there should be two judges in the rehearing of appeals.  I know that there are a good many people who favour two judges as a court of appeal.  Deputy Vincent Rice has put forward very strong arguments in favour of two judges.  I think I may give my own views about that.  I am quite against having two judges hearing appeals.  I hold that an appeal to a single High Court judge is quite sufficient.  I have none of the recollections that some members of the Bar seem to have about the ill-treatment which cases got from the single High Court judges hearing appeals at Assizes.  I recollect that they went faster, that they did their work more quickly.  The net issues were raised on appeal.  Very often it was quite simple and easy for counsel who appeared to know what were the points to be dealt with.  The case was presented in a simpler way to the single judge of the High Court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2362" /> During my time these judges were very competent.  There were one or two exceptions who were great cranks and less competent to give a proper judgment than the County Court judge.  But, taking it all in all, it would be much better for everybody to have a single judge going down to the county towns than to have two judges dispatching the business.  The single judge on Assize is as likely to give satisfaction and be as acceptable to the great body of litigants as two judges.</P>
    <P>From my own experience I think the two-judge tribunal is a bad one, despite the reasons given, which do, undoubtedly, carry a good deal of weight in its favour.  A High Court judge in Dublin is allowed to sit as a judge of fact in a case involving any amount&mdash;it may be £250,000; there have been cases in the High Court involving that sum.  As regards the decision of a single High Court judge hearing on fact, it is almost impossible to reverse it and, unless some extraordinary circumstances in connection with some unusual and gross mistake are submitted, his judgment on a question of fact is final.  Does it seem reasonable to say that he is not a better judge of fact than, or that he might at least be given the position of reviewing a finding of fact of a Circuit Court judge?  I think in practice it will be found that the single judge is a satisfactory tribunal.  I agree with Deputy Haslett that the presence of two judges is a more impressive tribunal, but it is a much more difficult one to plead before; it is a much less expeditious one, because it will take more than double the time a single judge will take.  I do not think there is so much in the objection to the single-judge tribunal as some Deputies seem to think.  In fact, I may say that if I were to be left free to choose between one and two judges, with the question of economy out of it altogether, I would unhesitatingly plump for the single-judge tribunal.</P>
    <P>There was another thing with which Deputy Costello dealt, the transfer of minors and lunatics from the jurisdiction of the Chief Justice.  I do not know whether he <Col N="2363" /> included that in his wide sweep of vicious and unsound principles.  If he were aware of the circumstances, he might not be so whole-hearted and sweeping in his denunciation.  I made the matter clear before that was embodied in this Bill.  The Chief Justice was approached and the matter was discussed with him and the Chief Justice expressed his willingness, provided certain safeguards were given, such as that there should be one judge delegated to deal with lunatics and minors.  I have no hesitation in agreeing with what Deputy Costello said about the experience of persons concerned with lunacy and minors during the last ten years&mdash;that the Chief Justice has shown the most extraordinary care and interest in the wellfare and the well-being of every minor and person of unsound mind coming under his care.  The system at present has the virtue that there is continuity, that there is a certain judge in charge of these matters, and I have certain doubts as to whether it is advisable to make this change.  But I want Deputy Costello to understand that this change is not being made in any sense whatsoever as criticism or by reason of any suggestion that the Chief Justice has not carried out his functions with regard to the administration of lunacy and minors to the utmost satisfaction of everybody who has had any contact with his court.  He himself was aware of the suggestion that this change was to be made and he offered none of the violent objections that were made by Deputy Costello.</P>
    <P>Another matter which was trotted out here as an exhibition of the mentality of the Government, showing them up in a bad light and revealing their anxiety to deal a blow at the independence of the judiciary, was the position with regard to district justices.  I felt amazed when I heard some of the statements that have been made. Surely there cannot be any question as to the fairness and reasonableness of this proposal.  The President has explained and defended it in detail, and I do not know that any words of mine are needed to convince any Deputy open to conviction in the matter that <Col N="2364" /> the proposal, far from trenching on the independence of the district justices, as a matter of fact commits the control of them to two judges, one judge of the Supreme Court and one judge of the High Court&mdash;the President of the High Court and the Chief Justice.  They are two members of an advisory committee.  Deputy McMenamin talked at length and I do not know whether he was really aware of what the present position is.  Some other Deputies do not seem to have realised that a distinction has always been drawn between the district justices and other judges.  In the 1924 Act the district justices were singled out for separate treatment.  A certificate from the Attorney-General and the Chief Justice was all that was required to remove a district justice, provided the removal was for misbehaviour, misconduct or incapacity, or the usual grounds upon which a judicial personage could be removed.</P>
    <P>Giving my own experience, that particular provision is a most unsatisfactory and unworkable provision.  The section is lacking in any clear indication as to what is to happen when the certificate is given.  We have had a little experience of the working of it and, speaking personally, I found the onus thrown upon me as executive officer of the Government placed me as Attorney-General in a most difficult and awkward position, and I am to some extent responsible for transferring the burden and the responsibility to two judges of the courts.  And yet the thing is attacked here in a most thoughtless, unreasonable and unfair manner as indicating a willingness and an anxiety on the part of the Government to get control simply because, in the course of my opening remarks I said, and I think I was quoted by Deputy Costello as saying, that the Government wanted a middle course in dealing with district justices.</P>
    <P>An examination of the provision will show that, first of all, a complaint has to be made.  A committee then investigates it and no step can be taken by the Minister for Justice unless on the recommendation of the advisory committee. The burden of Deputy Dillon's argument was that the provision which <Col N="2365" /> enabled something less than removal to be inflicted as a punishment on a district justice was trenching on a principle, and once the principle was trenched upon there was danger. Now, I suggest that is not so.  I suggest that while the control of the district justices is ultimately vested in two independent members of the judiciary, it cannot be suggested that the Executive has any way of getting rid of an undesirable district justice unless he desires to go, that it has no means of punishing him by transferring him or reprimanding him unless the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court or either of them joins with the Attorney-General in agreeing upon a definite course of action.  Some of the Deputies suggested that they were waiting with interest to hear what I had to say about it.  But I think myself that the provisions of the new section are admirable.</P>

      <P>I heard the Deputy say that, but he can do that at the moment.  Can he not complain every day if he wishes to the Chief Justice and to me and let us consider whether or not we shall issue a certificate? He can, as I interpret the position. There have been very few instances, in fact I think only one instance, since we came into office, in which a district justice was dealt with under that provision.  The way in which the tribunal is worked is that a complaint is made by the Minister, and if the complaint <i>prima facie</i> reveals a justifiable ground for calling upon a district justice to explain his conduct in a particular matter, he is called upon to explain his conduct.</P>

      <P>I do not want to enter into a discussion with the Deputy on this matter.  It is more appropriate really to the Committee Stage.  We are only now on the principle behind the thing.  I make this remark, however.  It is not suggested that a judge of the High Court, for instance, would not be put on the carpet here by a resolution introduced about him if he conducted himself in some manner ill-befitting a judge outside his office.  Surely it is perfectly proper, if you admit the principle of control, at all, that you should not confine yourself to behaviour while sitting on the Bench, and that you must have jurisdiction to deal with him for conduct outside that?  I am sure that on reflection Deputy McMenamin will see that that is an absurd objection.  I do not think I need deal with what has been treated as a very important question, namely the majority verdict. Apparently, I was so vague in introducing this that I was unsatisfactory to Deputy McGilligan.  However, he has had his say upon it and he has had his usual pleasure of ransacking the volumes of the Dáil Debates and producing the statements of Deputies here to confuse them and I suppose he has gone away to bed happy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some things which Deputy Costello suggested with which I am possibly in agreement.  They are not in the Bill.  He suggested that we might consider that under the Judgments Extension Act a judgment given in England can be executed here, but that there are difficulties as regards the execution of an Irish Free State judgment either there or in the Six-County area.  It is not perhaps appropriate to this particular Bill but it is a matter that should perhaps be considered. I also agree with him about the question of enabling arbitrators to give costs.  That had already been mentioned to me.  I do not know whether it is appropriate to deal with it in this Bill.  I am told that it would take five or six sections to do it properly <Col N="2367" /> and it might possibly more properly be the subject of another Bill.</P>
    <P>One matter he criticised very severely was the distinction drawn between the appeal in jury cases and the appeal in non-jury cases in the Circuit Court.  We had some words as to what the present position was.  He seemed not to be aware of the fact that there is a section in the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, which does draw a distinction between the appeal in a jury case and the appeal in other cases heard by the judge alone.  The present system requires an appellant or a person who seeks to vary the finding of the jury in the Circuit Court to move by way of notice of motion for a new trial, and the grounds upon which he may move are set out in the section&mdash; I think it is Section 96.  It is a section the existence of which a good many people are not aware of.  Apparently Deputy Costello does not appear to be aware of the distinction between the two forms of appeal.  As I said to him across the House when he was discussing the matter, the section in the Bill is really a reproduction of the provisions of the 1924 Act with regard to appeals in jury cases.  There is a difference in it, I admit, on examination, and perhaps he may have been referring to that.  It allows the judges on an appeal at present from the verdict of a jury in a Circuit Court case not alone the ordinary power which the court has, on a motion for a new trial, of sending the case back for a new trial, if they think the verdict is against the weight of evidence, or if any of the other grounds prevail which can be relied upon, but it also enables the court to set aside the verdict altogether and enter judgment for the appellant on the notes.</P>
    <P>I do not know if Deputy Costello's suggestion is that that should be embodied in the section, but when we come to deal with the section in Committee that can be appropriately discussed if it merits consideration, and possibly the position of juries in the Circuit Court, as we are told by some judges, that possibly juries could be dispensed with in the Circuit Court in civil cases.  This may not be welcome <Col N="2368" /> to a good many Deputies, but the view is taken that owing to the fact that we are now giving a second hearing to litigants in the Circuit Court the desirability of having a jury available is not as great as it was.  I am sure Deputy Good will have present to his mind that on certain occasions there is great danger that the work in the Circuit Court in Dublin will be held up by notice being served requiring juries to hear cases.  A case that might be disposed of by a judge in an hour or two takes one or two days before a jury and this leads to the congestion which the Deputy complains of.  That is a matter which can be more appropriately dealt with when we come to deal with the section in Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>What about Section 21?  Has the Attorney-General anything to say about giving more than £300 damages in remitted actions?  That will have a tendency to increase the congestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I have noted what the Deputy said.  I do not know whether it is reasonable to expect me, at this stage, to deal with all the points raised on the different sections. I think that was dealt with by some other speaker.  The suggestion is that while the section does not explicitly suggest that the jurisdiction of the Circuit Courts is to be increased the trend and the effect of it is to increase the jurisdiction.  I do not think that is so.  If you examine the section as it stands and read it in the light of the judgment on which motions to remit are now heard&mdash;the Hosie <i>versus</i> Lawless decision&mdash;there is nothing to indicate that a person moving to remit an action to the Circuit Court must not bring himself within the terms of that decision.  If it happens that the person who is moving to remit satisfies the court that the case is a proper one to be tried in the Circuit Court, and it turns out on the hearing in the Circuit Court that in truth and in fact more than £300 damages should be reasonably awarded, the section is to enable the Circuit Court to award these damages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is reasonable to imagine a case in which while a judge listening to the <Col N="2369" /> motion in the High Court is satisfied that the case is proper to be tried in the Circuit Court, using his judgment on the amount of damages that would probably be recovered and so on, it may turn out, in fact, when the evidence comes to be given that £300 is an unreasonable amount, and that damages of £400 or even £500 should be awarded.  If I recollect the section correctly, it is to enable judgment to be given in the Circuit Court for a sum in excess of £300 in such cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">

      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for the Committee Stage, and I will discuss it with the Deputy when it comes up on Committee.  Deputy McGuire dealt with the question of district justices.  I think I have already dealt with that matter, and I do not think I need say any more in regard to it at the moment.  He also complained of the absence of any provision for an action against the State.  Some other Deputies also referred to the desirability of making the State provide for costs in aid of poor prisoners.  As a member of the legal profession I have not the slightest objection to seeing the State providing more money for litigation, but I think the Minister for Finance would receive that proposal very doubtfully.  In any case it is one which appeals to a good many.  I think the President also referred to it when speaking.  It is largely a question of ways and means.  In any case I do not think it is appropriate to this Bill. <Col N="2370" /> If it is to be considered, it should be made the subject of a separate Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burke and, I think, Deputy Geoghegan touched on a matter on which nobody else touched.  They asked that we should provide in the Bill for an appeal from an order binding to the peace.  That has been a sore subject for a number of years, but it is not a very big matter.  It has been a cause of complaint, but the reasons why an appeal from an order binding to the peace has not been granted flow from the particular nature of the jurisdiction which enabled a justice of the peace formerly&mdash;a district justice at present&mdash;to order a person to give security.  As judges or justices it came within their jurisdiction to ensure that order should be maintained in the particular area from which they were drawn.  If it is thought by the Dáil that there should be an appeal, it may possibly be considered by the Minister, but at the moment I do not think it is quite appropriate to this Bill, which really is supposed to deal with the machinery of the courts, and that particular type of legislation is more appropriate to a Bill dealing with summary jurisdiction or criminal administration generally.</P>
      <P>I think I have already referred to one or two of the matters dealt with by Deputy Dillon.  His complaint about the provision in regard to district justices is that the judiciary should be above reprimand.  I do not see eye to eye with him.  I think that the penalty of removal is a very serious one.  While the fact that a penalty is extremely severe makes a person who wields the power hesitate to execute it, you very often might have quite a different situation, when a man offends to such an extent that the person who wields the power considers that he should be dealt with in some way, and, if that is the only way to deal with him, removed. I think it is preferable that there should be a minor form of punishment&mdash;that transfers should be available, or that the minor punishment of reprimand should be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I pointed out already, in dealing with that particular section, their removal, transfer, or reprimand can only be administered after the Advisory <Col N="2371" /> Committee&mdash;which, although it is described as an Advisory Committee, really wields the power, and the Minister is merely an executive&mdash;has recommended it.  The Minister's jurisdiction, as Deputy McMenamin pointed out&mdash;I do not know whether by way of criticism or otherwise&mdash;is confined to exercising the prerogative of mercy. He cannot inflict a greater punishment than the Advisory Committee recommended; he may inflict a lesser one. The difficulty which the Deputy pointed out does, of course, arise; you cannot transfer a man if there is nowhere to transfer him to.  The Deputy worked himself into a great state of excitement about where a man was to be transferred to.  If he only reads the section he will see that the very provision to which I have just referred, enabling the Minister to substitute one form of punishment for another, meets the case.  That is one reason for giving the Minister discretionary power, even after the Advisory Committee has made a recommendation that a justice be transferred.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy means by dealing with the question of costs in general.  I should have said this in dealing with the appeals, that, as Deputy Vincent Rice said, my own experience was that the system of appeals formerly was infinitely cheaper than the present system.  I believe&mdash;I may be wrong in this&mdash;that when this new system of appeals is in working order there will be a reduction of at least 50 per cent. of the amount appeals will cost the litigants involved, and in particular cases the decrease will be much greater.  I do not know if that is the aspect to which the Deputy refers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>The Circuit Court costs were fixed by rule.  I am aware that one of the solicitors commenting <Col N="2372" /> on this Bill drew attention to the fact that the costs in the Circuit Court are unduly high.  From what I have heard that would appear to be so.  The costs are high, but it is a matter for the Rule-making authorities. The stenographers' note is a matter with which, I think, I need not deal. It has already been promised that the question will be considered.  I do not know if anything else that was said is of such importance that it calls for comment at this stage.  I think almost any other provision in the Bill which was touched on by speakers would be more appropriately dealt with on Committee. I have referred to what I think are the principles which are behind the Bill.  As Deputy McGilligan said, I think, in the course of his speech, it may be that when you balance one system against the other it will be found that you will not get better results from one than from the other, or that it is difficult to see which will give better results.  I think, as I said in the earlier part of my speech, it is also of very great importance that before this Joint Committee&mdash;which went into the matter at great length, and heard the evidence of witnesses drawn from all parts of the country&mdash; there seemed to be hardly a dissenting voice amongst those who spoke for the ordinary litigants throughout the country against the request that the system of appeals then prevailing should be altered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I know&mdash;and I have had some discussions about this matter since the time the Bill was first mooted, we have had questions in the House, we have had Deputy Anthony, time after time, asking when were the recommendations of the Joint Committee to be given effect to&mdash;I certainly know of no change of attitude in any part of the country in regard to the matter.  I believe that solicitors throughout the country, members of the Bar and the public generally have been waiting for this change to be brought about.  It had to be brought about some way and it is better to have the thing done now, as the President said, if it is going to be done at all.  The two main changes made by the Bill&mdash;that in regard to the <Col N="2373" /> Supreme Court and the alteration in regard to appeals&mdash;have been justified by the arguments advanced.  There has been a state of uncertainty about this matter for a long time.  People have been expecting this Bill, and I think that we may as well make up <Col N="2374" /> our minds that under any Government the proposals with regard to these outstanding matters would be precisely similar to the provisions which are contained in the Bill.</P>

      <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1935, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Oireachtas, including a Grant-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As indicated on the face of the Estimate, the supplementary provision asked for is required for the purpose of a contribution from State Funds towards the Oireachtas Restaurant, the contribution to take the form of a payment to the caterer of such amount as the Minister for Finance may determine in recoupment of the excess expenses of catering as shown by certified accounts.  The total sum required in the current financial year is £500, but as savings are anticipated on other sub-heads of the Vote, a token provision of only £10 is being asked for.  As the House is aware, in 1933 it was decided that the Restaurant services should be handed over to outside caterers.  This was duly done and, as a result of the first year's trading, a substantial loss was incurred by the caterers.  It has arisen mainly because of the high wages bill <Col N="2376" /> for service of food; the spasmodic rushes of business on two or three days, and the small receipts which are forthcoming during the rest of the week while, at the same time, a permanent staff has to be maintained. The caterers, in indicating their position to the Ceann Comhairle, stated that they were anxious to continue as caterers, but that they had not anticipated such a heavy loss as has, in fact, been incurred during the year, and asked that some alleviation might be afforded them.  In the meantime, the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach had renewed the catering agreement for a further period of one year from April 1st, 1934.  In connection with the Restaurant service generally, the Ceann Comhairle had enunciated the following principles, which have been accepted by the Minister for Finance, viz.: (1) That the provision of good food, well served and at a reasonable cost, must be considered as a necessary service if members are to discharge their Parliamentary duties effectively; (2) that the main purpose of the Restaurant should be, therefore, the provision of such a service and not the making of profits; (3) that if the proper working of the Restaurant should involve a loss some part of such loss should be borne by the State in the interests of the service; (4) that ample provision should be made from State Funds for the proper working of the Restaurant, such as maintenance and improvements, light and heat, cutlery, ware and utensils.</P>
    <P>The whole position has recently been most carefully considered in the light of the foregoing principles and in view of the caterers' representations and experience.  The conclusion has been reached that if a proper service is to be given it is necessary that the Restaurant be kept open during Recess periods, with a view, for one thing, to obviate the need for the frequent discharge and re-employment of staff which otherwise might arise.  It may be taken, in view of the intermittent nature of the business, that it would not be feasible to retain the services of outside caterers unless some provision is made to recoup them in part, at any rate, for any losses they may incur on the service.  It is accordingly proposed <Col N="2377" /> to make provision in the annual Estimates for the Oireachtas for a contribution to be paid, at the discretion of the Minister for Finance, in recoupment of the expenses of catering as shown by certified accounts.</P>
    <P>It is not the intention, so far as the present caterers are concerned, that any loss should be recouped in full, and as I said, the firm are not looking for that.  It has been agreed that the present caterers will continue the catering services for the present subject to the following new conditions, viz.&mdash;(1) No charge will be made for rent.  (2) The arrangements as to replacement, cleaning, laundry, etc., will remain unchanged. (3) The caterers' tariff will provide for certain additional charges. (4) In the event of a loss accruing on the year's trading as shown by certified accounts, recoupment will be made of half the expenditure on fuel, plus a further payment not exceeding half the loss as ascertained after deduction of the total expenditure on fuel.  I understand this arrangement is satisfactory to the caterers.  It has been ascertained that they are prepared to accept a payment of £500 as an offset against the losses incurred in the first year of their trading.  This payment will be made from the provision in the present Supplementary Estimate.</P>

      <P>I was surprised when I saw this Estimate on the Order Paper and I have been very much surprised at the Minister's statement. As a member of the Restaurant Committee I, with others, held that it was undesirable that the management of the restaurant should be handed over to a private firm at the time that it was. I thought then, and I think now that it was a very poor commentary on our capacity to do business: that in the <Col N="2378" /> management of the internal affairs of this House the occasion should arise for handing the restaurant over to any private firm.  I think that my views, and the views of those who held with me in that connection, have been amply justified by the sorry story that we heard from the Minister for Finance this evening.  I was not able to get down everything the Minister said, but I gathered enough material to base certain criticisms on it.  Judging by the Minister's statement, the new arrangement has not been a success. The private firm that have been given a monopoly in the control and management of the restaurant have found that it was not a profitable proposition.  I am rather surprised at that, because I remember that before this experiment was made the restaurant was in fact a paying proposition.  There was an old debt&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It has been stated that the staff have to be maintained during the period when the Dáil is not sitting. That is not entirely true.  It is true of a few members of the staff, but as regards a substantial number of the members of the staff employed during the time the Oireachtas is in Session, their services are dispensed with during the Recess.</P>

Surely such a Committee ought to be capable of managing the restaurant, of employing persons and so on.

Having regard to the nature and size of the building and the congestion of business in the architect's branch in the Board of Works, due to the increased school-building programme and the like, it has been decided to put the design to public competition.

      <P>Even at this late hour I have to make my protest in connection with this Vote.  It is now close on 12 months since a very representative deputation of citizens waited on the President, their object being to procure, if possible, the site of Maple's Hotel in Kildare Street, which has been derelict for at least 14 or 15 years, as a site for a new public hall.  Very pertinent representations were made by members of the deputation to the President and the President seemed. so far as one could judge of by his manner and the very few words he spoke, to be entirely in sympathy with <Col N="2384" /> the object of the deputation.  I asked a member of the deputation a short time ago if he had had any response to the request made and he said &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  I was foolish enough then to ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce what was to become of that site and he said &ldquo;That site is ours.  We are in a position now in which we must seek new offices.  Our staff is scattered all over the city and the inconvenience of that is extreme.&rdquo;  I quite admit that it is a much more important thing to have the staff of the Department of Industry and Commerce properly housed than to have a hall for the benefit of the citizens of Dublin.  But I suggest that, after all, this Vote presupposes that this Parliament is going to remain here for ever.  I do not think that it will.  I think the time will come when the members here will begin to think of a better position for it in the centre of the city and that at some future time that position will be availed of and the Seanad House restored, rather than having it used as a bank.  I believe that that will come about and then the inconvenience which the Minister for Industry and Commerce at present suffers will be intensified because he will have spent £100,000 on new offices which will be in an inconvenient position.  The House would not be troubled by me at all to-night, especially at this late hour, if the Dublin Corporation had power to erect a citizens' hall.  But we have not got power to spend a shilling on such a project.</P>

      <P>I should like Deputy Anthony and other members to remember that this is the capital city of Ireland and that no boundary will ever make it anything else.  We have not got the power to erect a citizens' hall. In respect of many things, we have not got the power to raise the price of a smoke.  That is the position in which representatives of the citizens find <Col N="2385" /> themselves in Greater Dublin.  If the Corporation had that power, I should not introduce this matter here at all. I suggest to the Executive Council that as they handle a good deal of national property in the city, they ought to have a survey made of it and see if they could not hand over to the City of Dublin space for the erection of a hall.  I am quite certain that, if they made a survey of the property they control, a convenient site would be found.  We have only two halls here&mdash;one, the Mansion House hall, which does not suit great entertainments, particularly entertainments of a cultural nature, such as high-class music.  The other large hall is certainly old enough and historic enough to be labelled as a national monument. Instead of that, it is a picture house. I allude to the Round Room of the Rotunda.  Quite recently, a monstrous proposal was made to erect a chimney stack in the square attached to the Rotunda Buildings.  I think that they would have power to do that, but there was such a remonstrance made that it will hardly go on.  I ask the Minister to see if he could accommodate the city by having a site reserved for a public hall.  I think that it is due to the City of Dublin that it should have such a hall.  I understand that those who formed the deputation which waited on the President over 12 months ago had certain assurances from influential citizens that the money for the erection of the hall would be forthcoming, but to buy the site and erect the hall would be too large a project for them to undertake. Citizens are, however, prepared to put down the money for the building provided they get the site.</P>

      <P>I should like to support very strongly the argument put forward by Deputy Kelly against the utilisation of Maple's site in the way in which the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary say it is to be utilised.  I should further support the Deputy's appeal to the Government to face, in a national spirit, having regard to the claim they make at times to a cultural aim, the problem of setting up a suitable hall in the City of Dublin which would serve <Col N="2386" /> as a national, cultural and musical centre.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go into the economic war, but there is one thing that is very patent all over the country in connection with the present position, and that is that nothing that the Government may say or nothing that they may do in the matter of fostering and helping on national culture, whether in musical matters or in any other aspect of it, has any chance of thriving at the present moment.  It is being throttled in the city and in every part of the country by all the economic difficulties and all the bitternesses and disagreements that are springing up around the country.  It may be that the Government would like to do something that would offset that and, in setting their faces to the setting up of a hall of the nature and description that Alderman Kelly speaks about, they would be making a present-day gesture that would be, to some extent, an offset to the blows that are being struck at national culture throughout the country and providing something that, in the near future, might help to foster the cultural side of things that, at the present moment, they say they have at heart. Anybody interested in the development of orchestral music and other types of music in the City of Dublin, apart altogether from people who want assembly halls, must be struck at the way in which all chance of having it is being throttled in the city.  The only large hall capable of being used for an orchestral performance was closed down comparatively recently and there is no hall to-day in which a reasonably large audience can be treated to an orchestral performance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The gesture, in the first place, is wanted on the part of the Government. In the second place, the normal civic requirements of the City of Dublin require a hall of that particular kind. In the third place, the cultural requirements of the city require it, and it would be apart altogether from the necessity of spending £100,000 on the provision of central offices for the Department of Industry and Commerce. The Ministry should not take a decision to utilise the site that is available <Col N="2387" /> behind the Mansion House without fully considering and again discussing with those interested in that aspect of things, and with the Dublin Corporation, the utilisation of that site for culural and civic purposes.  They should not utilise it in any other way without carrying those discussions to a further point and without giving the Oireachtas a further opportunity of discussing the disposal of the site of Maple's Hotel in the light of further arguments that may be brought forward by the bodies interested in this matter and by the Dublin Corporation with regard to the purposes about which Alderman Kelly speaks.</P>
    <P>In the second place, the necessity which dictates the spending of this money on new offices for the Department of Industry and Commerce ought to be further elaborated.  I think that the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce have been trying to persuade the country recently that we have less civil servants in the country than ever before.  Nevertheless, we are aware that the growth in the number of officials in the Department of Industry and Commerce is such that the offices attached to the Minister's Department are spreading themselves out in all directions.  They have invaded the precincts of the Dáil as far as Dawson Street since the other day and they are spread out in all sorts of other directions too.  It would be desirable, in passing this particular Vote, to have some discussion as to the staff development in the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I think it would be well also, in telling the House that they were proposing to spend £100,000 on a building like this and proposing to advertise for a design in connection with these offices, to tell the House what prize they propose to offer to the successful architect, and what connection the successful architect would have with the subsequent erection of these buildings, if they are to be erected.</P>

I should like to ask him how far the sum of £100,000 that is being asked for is going to be used for new premises and why it is that the present premises at the disposal of the Minister for Industry and Commerce are not capable of containing or holding the number of extra officials in that Department.</P>

      <P>Up to this, at any rate, certain premises in Dublin satisfied the requirements of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.  Now, we are asked for new premises and I want to know from the Minister, as he is here, will the new premises, which are going to cost the nation £100,000, suffice to accommodate all the officials, including the extra officials that have been engaged because of certain changes in the fiscal policy of this Government?  May I take it, or will the Minister give us an assurance, that if he or his Government persist in their present policy, they will not require another institution costing another £100,000 within the next couple of years, or so long as they remain in office?  I am always anxious to facilitate any Minister or Parliamentary Secretary who looks for extra money for anything he requires in his Department, but I think that our constituents are entitled to get information as to the reasons, which, by the way, have not been explained by the Parliamentary Secretary, for such expenditure.  I am not going to question the efficiency of the Parliamentary Secretary at all, because, although I may disagree with him in some things, I know that in a business way he is very efficient, but I suggest that it is due to the people and to the House to tell us why this money is necessary and why a new building is necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. T.J. O'Donovan Mr. T.J. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had two questions on the Order Paper yesterday in relation to the cultivation of flax in the Free State and in reference to the prospects of flax growers this year.  I put these questions down in the expectation of getting a statement with regard to a scheme for the development of the flax industry in the Free State.  I put them down after having had correspondence from a number of people in Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan and West Cork, in order to ascertain what was the scheme, if any, that the Government had for the development of flax growing in Ireland. The scarcity of raw material for the linen trade has gained great publicity. <Col N="2390" /> The price of flax has risen from something like 8/- to 12/6 or 13/- per stone.  Numbers of people in the flax-growing counties of Donegal, Monaghan, Cavan, Mayo and West Cork have the skill and the knowledge, and generations of experience behind them in the development of the flax industry. They have the scutch mills and the steeping dams.  They have not been able to take advantage of other schemes, such as beet, wheat and peat, and they are now anxiously waiting for some definite move in this matter. In these flax-growing areas beet, for instance, is no good to these people. They are cut off from the beet factories by very long distances.  Beet or wheat is no good to the Cavan people, to the Monaghan people, or to the Donegal people; but they are hoping now when the price of flax has advanced, for some scheme to help them over this difficult period.  They are paying subsidies for beet and wheat to the people who grow them, and they are hoping for some advantage out of a flax scheme which would help them out of the corner they are in at present.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward), some time ago, made reference to this flax scheme and I know many Fianna Fáil Deputies are interested in it.  After the pronouncement of the Parliamentary Secretary I expected that we should hear something authoritative that would let the people know where they stood in this matter.  The time is ripe now, I think, for such a pronouncement. If the farmer is to grow flax, now is the time to get the plough to work and the ground prepared.  Flax must be sown in April, and if the farmers do not proceed to prepare the ground now, they will be too late and they will lose the benefit they otherwise might secure this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter that I expect the Minister will be able to tell us something about.  It was stated in the Press of the 19th February that the farmers were about to ask the Minister for Agriculture for a flax guarantee. I have not heard that they asked for a flax guarantee.  They might expect <Col N="2391" /> some subsidy, or a minimum price, but the fact that I have mentioned got publicity in the <i>Daily Mail</i> which also stated that a deputation from the Federation of Irish Industries was to meet the Minister for Agriculture in order to induce him to take action to encourage the Southern farmers to grow flax for the linen mills in Northern Ireland.  If the Minister is going to receive this deputation, and if he is going to discuss his flax scheme with the Federation of Irish Industries I think he might have made that scheme known when I put down these questions on the Order Paper yesterday, and, in that way let the people of the flax growing areas know what the scheme is to be.  I asked yesterday whether there is a flax scheme outlined at present and whether the Minister is going to make a statement, and he replied &ldquo;not at present.&rdquo;  But if the Minister does not act immediately there will be no advantage derived from the growing of flax this year.  If there is to be any advantage now is the time to make the pronouncement about the scheme and not a month hence.</P>
    <P>I am not going to dwell upon my second question yesterday, but again I would say if there is to be a scheme it would be necessary to try and secure now, as far as possible, whatever quantities of mature seeds are necessary.  Furthermore, measures should be taken to ensure that a supply of flax-seed of good fibre and purity&mdash;Pernacrown and Dutch varieties&mdash;was secured in good time so that farmers going in for flax-growing again would have good seed.  I hope the Minister will take this opportunity of telling us what are the possibilities now before the flax-growers in this country.  There is no use in sending out one instructor to take charge of the flax-growing counties from Tory Island to Cape Clear.  One man cannot do it.  The thing is, in the flax-growing counties where they have the skill and experience, to have the seed sent to them in time.  Now is the time to send instructors to encourage the people to prepare the ground for the flax and to let them know that if that is done the <Col N="2392" /> Government will see that it is going to be a profitable crop.  Not very long ago there were as many as nine or ten flax-instructors functioning in the counties I mentioned.  It may be if this scheme materialises that you would need instructors in the scutching season in those counties where flax is grown to take control in the mills and see that it is properly milled.  But, for the sowing and subsequent handling, I do not think, unless there is a very big area cultivated, there would be any necessity for whole-time instructors this year.</P>
    <P>With regard to the marketing of the flax, if the scheme materialises, there is, unfortunately, no market in the Free State.  We have to depend on the Belfast spinners to buy the flax. My experience of them is that they pay very good prices and dealt fairly and squarely with us in the flax business, but the only hope now is that this Federation of Irish Industries may, if they have any money behind them, start a spinning mill in the Free State. We have no spinning mill in the Free State and, consequently, we have to go foreign to get linen.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, on, I think, a debate on unemployment here, said that we would have a linen industry, and I was wondering where the raw material to produce it was to come from, because we have no spinning mill to spin the yarn to make the linen. This Federation is a go-ahead body, composed of very good business people, who are interested in this matter and in industrial development generally, and as a result of the starting of the flax industry again, they may develop and we may have spinning and weaving mills in the Free State.  I hope the Minister will make a statement on the matter now.  There is no necessity for me to add anything further to what I have said.</P>

      <P>With regard to the question of seed, I said yesterday that I did not think there would be any difficulty in procuring seed in the Free State.  There would <Col N="2393" /> be enough pedigree seed in Ireland, between the North of Ireland and the Free State, to sow about 9,000 acres. Deputy O'Donovan knows quite well that the seed for Free State importers came from North of Ireland wholesale firms, and retailers in the Free State were offered a fair share of that pedigree seed provided they paid the price. That price was rather high as compared with the price of commercial seed.  I think the quotation was 60/- for the 8-stone bag as compared with 35/- for the commercial seed.  In addition to the amount of pedigree seed available, there is sufficient commercial seed to sow a very big acreage and, in fact, I should say much bigger than will be sown either in the Six Counties or in the Free State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, the information I have got from an inspector who visited the North and inquired into the matter and also information from a Canadian firm who sold most of this pedigree seed is that there should be sufficient to grow about 9,000 acres. I do not think there will be any difficulty about the seed.  The seed merchants in the Free State, who always got their seed from wholesalers in the North, can get sufficient to sow more, I think, than will be sown in the Free State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is very difficult to have any policy of flax growing for this year, and when I said to Deputy O'Donovan yesterday that I could not announce a policy for the present.  I had in mind exactly what Deputy O'Donovan has outlined himself, and that is, that we can have no long term policy of flax <Col N="2394" /> growing until we have our own spinning mills.  The Deputy knows quite well, and Deputies from the North will also know, that our only market at present is to sell to Northern Ireland spinners. Northern Ireland spinners will, I am quite sure, buy all the flax made here this year, or at least there is a very fair chance that they will, because they are not getting flax from Russia.  When they were getting flax from Russia, they were quite prepared to take that flax at whatever price they could get it at and they were not prepared to give their own growers a penny more than the price they were giving for the Russian flax, with the result that prices in 1931 went down to 5/6 a stone and our acreage fell off here and in the Six Counties.  Now prices have gone up very much because the Russian flax is not coming in, but if, by any chance, within the next nine months, the Russians were to change their policy or if any other country were to come along with a large crop of flax which would supply the Northern Ireland spinners, our flax would be left on our hands and, therefore, it is impossible for the Government to guarantee a market for the flax until we get our own spinners going.</P>
    <P>I did receive that deputation from the Federation of Irish industries to-day and I said exactly what Deputy O'Donovan advised me to say&mdash;&ldquo;We will grow flax if you start spinning mills&rdquo;&mdash;and until we get them going, I am afraid the position is going to remain as it is.  I think that there is a very fair chance that all the flax that will be grown in the Free State this year will get a good sale, because it is not likely, I take it, that the Russians will change their policy or that any European country will jump in and grow a big acreage of flax this year. Therefore, the North of Ireland people will take it.  We are quite prepared to supply a number of instructors if required in any area in which the flax is being grown.  Of course, in Monaghan, Donegal, Cavan and in West Cork, too, instructors are scarcely required for the growing of the flax, at any rate, because the farmers there know how to grow it all right, but it required they will be available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2395" /> Apart from that, as I say, I do not think we can do any more.  I should like Deputy O'Donovan and members of the Opposition to look at this in a reasonable way.  I think they will agree that it would not be fair for the Government to encourage flax growing on a big scale unless we could guarantee a market, and we cannot do that.  We can offer the opinion, just as any Deputy can, that there will be a good market.  I believe there will be, and I should like to see the farmers going into flax growing to a certain extent, at any rate.  We will give all the assistance possible.  We will see that they get seed; we will see that they get instruction; and we will hope <Col N="2396" /> that they will get a market.  That is all we can do.  We are approaching the question in a different way.  We are investigating the possibility of starting spinning mills and supplying our own linen factories from these mills, and if we get those going we will know definitely the amount of flax we can grow and we can guarantee a price for a certain acreage.  Of course, in a case of that kind, some special legislation will be required, such as we had in regard to tobacco, to license growers so that there would not be a surplus, but I am afraid that, until we reach that stage, we cannot do any more.</P>
