      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he had caused an inquiry to be made into the profits earned for individual promoters of Public Utility Societies registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts; whether he is aware that several such societies are carried on for profit and advantage of the persons primarily responsible for promoting them and whether he will take steps to secure that the advantages conferred by the State on Public Utility Societies engaged in house building will be passed on to the individual citizens for whom they were mainly intended.</P>

      <P>The answers to the first two parts of the question are in the negative.  With regard to the third part of the question no evidence has been produced to me that the grants under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts, 1932 and 1934 paid to Public Utility Societies have been improperly applied.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that the Kinsale Urban Council fixed the wage for unskilled workers on a housing scheme now being proceeded with at 30/- weekly; whether he is also aware that the local workers' organisation notified the urban council prior to <Col N="702" /> the fixing of the foregoing wage that they had fixed as the local rate 37/6 weekly; that the contractor now declines to pay a higher rate than 30/- weekly, on the grounds that he based his tender on the wage fixed by the urban council; and whether the whole matter will be examined with a view to seeing that the fair wage condition provided for in the Housing Acts will be given effect to in connection with that housing scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The answers to the first two parts of the question are in the affirmative.  The conditions of contract contain a clause binding the contractor to pay rates of wages and observe conditions of contract at least as advantageous to the persons employed under the contract as the appropriate rates and conditions generally recognised by trade unions.  I have not received any complaint that the provisions of Section 8 of the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932, are not being complied with in connection with this scheme.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state the various counties in which in the years (1) 1933, (2) 1934, and (3) 1935 the county councils adopted the Credit Note system, and the total amount of the notes in each county in each year which lapsed by reason of the fact that they were not duly presented in payment of rates by the appropriate day.</P>

      <P>In the financial year ended 31st March, 1933 allowances made in pursuance of the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1932, were made by every county council by the issue of credit notes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the financial year ended 31st <Col N="703" /> March, 1934, the following councils issued credit notes:&mdash;Cork, Donegal, Dublin, Kerry, Kildare, Laoighis, Mayo, Monaghan, Offaly, Roscommon and Wicklow.</P>
    <P>In the financial year ended 31st March, 1935, credit notes were issued by every county council except Dublin, Longford, Offaiy, and Westmeath County Councils.</P>
    <P>In the current financial year, the following councils have issued credit notes:&mdash;Carlow, Clare, Cork, Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Kilkenny, Louth, Mayo, Monaghan, Roscommon, Tipperary N.R., Tipperary S.R. and Wicklow.  It is open to these councils to extend the period for first moiety credit notes to 31st January, 1936, and second moiety credit notes to 30th April, 1936.</P>
    <P>A table will be circulated in the Official Report showing for each county the total amount of credit notes for the financial years 1932-33 and 1933-34 which were not realised and the total amount of the credit notes for the year 1934-35 (a) which were not realised by 30th September, 1935 and (b) which were unexpired.</P>

      <P>Expenditure in connection with the repair of labourers' cottages is not subject to my sanction where such expenditure is being defrayed out of the Revenue accounts by boards of health and public assistance. Sanction is required only where it is proposed to obtain loans to meet the cost of the repair works.  On the 5th July, 1935, sanction was expressed to the borrowing of a sum of £5,000 by the Laoighis Board of Health and Public Assistance for the repair of approximately 300 cottages.  No loan has been sanctioned within the period mentioned in the question for the repair of cottages in Offaly.</P>

The accommodation supplied at Bawnboy has, however, not been satisfactory, particularly in winter months, owing to the absence of adequate heating, lighting, and seating arrangements, and for these reasons the court has been held at Ballyconnell on several occasions when it should normally have sat at Bawnboy.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether in view of the inducements that have been held out to turf cutters in various parts of the country to cut additional turf for sale in the cities and towns, and the amount of money that has been spent in advertisements to this end, he will state if the Bureau of Information has taken any cognisance of, and proposes to issue any reply to or correction of statements made in the local press to the effect that Dublin was to take no more turf from the country; that owing to the consignment of wet sods which had been delivered to their homes, many persons had made up their minds to stick to coal in future, and that hand-won turf, after the experience of last year, must stay in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I am aware only one letter, containing the statements quoted in the question, appeared in the local press.  These statements were contradicted by the secretary of the local turf society.  It is incorrect to suggest that hand-won turf is not being brought to Dublin but at present only machine-won turf is being offered to Dublin merchants by the Turf Development Board.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state whether he is aware that complaints are being made that the lion's share of the profits of the turf scheme has been cornered by the middlemen, the railway company, and makers of bags and if he will state whether he is prepared to inquire into the matter with a view to ascertaining how the profits of the scheme are distributed.</P>

For that purpose it is proposed that High Court Judges will hold sittings in various parts of the country and, to meet the expenses of the appointment <Col N="735" /> of two Supreme Court Judges and the expenses entailed by the sittings of the High Court Judges in the various circuits, the money is required.</P>

      <P>We are being asked under this resolution to grant extra money in connection with the District Courts.  To-day I addressed an important question to the Minister for Justice with regard to the position in the Swanlinbar district.  I asked the Minister if he was aware of the serious inconvenience caused to the people in the old petty sessions district of <Col N="736" /> Swanlinbar by reason of the removal of the monthly court to Bawnboy, which is five miles away, and if he was aware that the position was made worse by the removal of the court every alternate month to Ballyconnell. I pointed out to the Minister that for the last year or so the court has been held almost every month in Ballyconnell and the people in the Swanlinbar district have been obliged on every trivial charge to attend a court nine miles farther away than the original court at Swanlinbar.  In view of the lack of facilities for the people in the Swanlinbar district, why should they be asked to pay additional moneys in connection with District Courts?  If we are obliged to pay this money I think the least the Minister might do is to arrange for the holding of by-monthly courts at Bawnboy, as was the custom.  If some facilities are not given to the residents in the Swanlinbar district, I, on their behalf, must protest very emphatically against the voting of this money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate Deputy McGovern for getting in Bawnboy on this Vote.  There are two points I wish to raise at this juncture, because the rules of procedure preclude me from raising them by way of amendment to the Bill.  It strikes me that in view of the fact that the Minister has announced his intention at this stage to increase the expenditure on the administration of the law, we should carefully consider how best to employ that increased expenditure, and whether there are not matters far more urgent than the creation of new High Court judges upon which expenditure might be justified in the circumstances that obtain in the country. When the Minister talks of increasing the personnel of the High Court Bench surely, he ought to realise that the people of the country are finding it extremely difficult to keep their noses above water at the present time. Surely he ought to realise that the taxation of the country is over £40,000,000 per annum, and that the sources from which money is to be derived to meet this expenditure are steadily shrinking.  Surely he ought to realise that it takes more than two <Col N="737" /> years of our total exports to pay for one year's Government expenditure in this country, and that, to that expenditure, the cost of two extra High Court judges, amounting to several thousand pounds per annum, ought not to be added.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, in view of the conditions of work in the High Court, a good deal might be said for increasing the personnel, if the financial conditions of the country were more satisfactory, but I think it is a grave hardship, at this stage of the various wars in which we are engaged, to pile Pelion on Ossa.  While I think there is room for improvement in the matter in the equipment of the High Court Bench, there are other matters I desire to bring to the attention of the Minister on the lines of general reformation.  When considering this Money Resolution we are discussing amongst other things the remuneration of District Court justices, and their pensions; but there is another class of public servants, co-operating in the work of the District Courts, who seem to be entirely overlooked in this <Col N="738" /> matter and that is the District Court Clerks.</P>
      <P>The practice has grown up in this State, in the last ten years, during the tenure of the late Government and the present Government, of leaving a class of civil servants unestablished&mdash; that is allowing them to do their work, but affording them no pension rights at all.  But all civil servants' salaries, in this State, are based upon the estimation that the civil servant is working not only for a weekly or monthly salary, but for that weekly or monthly salary plus pension rights. My submission is that Court Clerks are in receipt of salaries based on a scale which presumes the existence of pensions for them at the end of their service, and that the denial of that right of pension to them is, in my opinion, a legitimate grievance.  It is extremely difficult for civil servants to bring matters of this kind effectively before the responsible Minister. It is difficult, and in my opinion, undesirable for bodies of civil servants to combine in order to bring pressure upon the responsible Minister in control of the Department, in matters relating to remuneration.  And it seems to me that a special duty devolves upon the Oireachtas always to keep before them the condition under which each branch of the Civil Service is working, and to keep before them and secure conditions of justice and equity that would not be improved if any combination was made by civil servants in order to effect improvements in their conditions. In their case I would urge members of the Government, and the Opposition, to constitute themselves guardians of the legitimate interests of civil servants and so to be in a position, in the event of any attempt being made to organise civil servants for the purpose of improving their condition, to say to them, we have given all that it is legitimate to ask, and no external pressure will induce us to give a farthing more or to allow you to work for an hour less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under existing circumstances we are not free to say that with clear consciences to the District Court Clerks.  We are taking steps in this Bill to provide pension rights for <Col N="739" /> District Justices and temporary District Justices.  I think the conditions of the District Court Clerks should be examined, and proposals made for a permanent basis of remuneration in the future, which will include provision for their pensions when they reach the end of their term of employment. That is one net point which I wish to submit to the Minister.  He will recognise that I cannot bring that in by way of an amendment, because it is calculated to lay an additional burden upon the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The other point is of more academic importance.  This Bill envisages the provision of Assizes of Appeal.  That involves High Court judges travelling around the country to hear appeals in the districts where the cases were first heard.  In my opinion that makes an existing evil greater than it has been heretofore.  In the past, the Assizes went out as courts of first instance, and brought with them moderate law libraries, with the result that the law as pleaded in the provincial courts reflected credit on the profession, and upon the institutions of law in the country.  Books of reference were available to the barristers appearing before the courts, from which quotations might be given to assist the court in arriving at its decisions. Since the Assizes ceased in this country, and the jurisdiction of the Circuits Courts was increased to £300 in contract and, I think, in tort cases, a very much larger proportion of the legal business of the country is being transacted in the kind of court which used to be the County Court and which is now the Circuit Court.  No libraries are attached to those circuits. No facilities are available to a young barrister to borrow books from the Central Bar Library at the Four Courts, and so you have a situation in which the law is being pleaded in the majority of cases that come forward for decision in this country without authoritative books being available to the barristers practising before the Bench, or indeed to the judge himself, with the result that the practice of law tends to deteriorate in these courts.  It is subject to this <Col N="740" /> additional objection, that one barrister may be more fortunately circumstanced, financially or otherwise, than a brother of the same profession.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That interjection is unworthy of Deputy MacDermot.  He himself once adorned the Bar, and though he may have had an extraordinarily erudite mind, I think he scarcely preserved all the reports verbatim in his head, and even his authority would not be accepted by a Judge on the Bench as evidence that certain decisions <i>obiter dicta</i> had been handed down.  To continue the trend of my argument, one member of the Bar, more fortunately circumstanced than his brother in the profession, may be in a position to produce books, of which the judge will take notice, from his own private library or some other source to which he has access, whereas another barrister practising in the same court is unable to produce similar books because he has no source of supply wherein to seek, so that both from the point of view of barristers being on an equal footing in stating the cases of their respective clients, and from the point of view of the preservation of the law in the courts of the country, I submit it is now an urgent necessity that authoritative law books should be available to the Circuit Courts and to the Assizes of Appeal.  I do not believe in ventilating a grievance without proposing at least one practicable remedy.  The remedy I submit to the Minister is as follows, that Circuit Court judges should be invited to submit a list of the books which they consider would be necessary in order to facilitate the proper practice of the law in their courts.  Those lists having been gathered in from the several circuits in the country, of which I think there are eight, might be submitted to a committee of the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court, and there reviewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From them a recommendation would come to the Department of Justice which would proceed to furnish each of the eight circuits with the skeleton <Col N="741" /> library scheduled by the judges as essential to the proper practice of the law, and approved by the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court. Thereafter I think it should be open to any circuit judge to requisition the addition to those libraries of some book which might be rendered necessary by the legislation of this House, or some development of the law, but which would not be available to the circuit without the certificate of the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court that they were satisfied that it was necessary for the proper practice of the law in the provincial court.  I admit that the initial expenditure would be substantial, but it would not be prohibitive.  I am convinced that such an expenditure would be well worth while, inasmuch as the proper practice of the law is a very valuable thing from the point of view of the people of the country.  All subsequent additions to the library which might become necessary would involve the State in only a trivial cost.  In conclusion, before departing finally from this point, I would remind the Attorney-General particularly that in the days of the old assizes there was a library attached to every assize.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by practtitioners who practised in the old assizes that there was a library attached to the old assize, which travelled with it, and that books were available to senior and junior counsel in sufficient number.  Admittedly&mdash;and it is important to bear this in mind&mdash; we cannot hope to provide the same accommodation at the provincial courts as is available at the High Court, where, in theory at least, every book is available, both ancient and modern, but we can provide such a skeleton of legal literature as will preserve the practice of the law in its purity both in the provincial courts and in the central courts.  Deputies will realise that it is an injustice to the country people that their cases should be denied the full advantage of proper pleading in the courts of this country. Deputies will recognise that the <Col N="742" /> common law of this State must suffer if the judicial procedure of the vast majority of the courts in this country is not carried on as efficiently as it is practicable to have such procedure carried on.  For those reasons I urge on the Minister the favourable consideration of the proposal which I lay before him, or some alternative remedy for the evil to which I am directing his attention.</P>

      <P>The interjection I made just now was not intended as a protest against Deputy Dillon's suggestion, which seems to be an admirable one, but it is perhaps worth pointing out that the present system or lack of system has, at any rate, the advantage of giving a really well-instructed barrister a pull over his less-instructed contemporary.  What I should like to know, and what, perhaps, Deputy Dillon can tell us, is what became of the old peripatetic libraries which he said used to exist?</P>

      <P>I remember quite well that in some circuits, such as Cork, there was an excellent library.  There was also a Southern Law Association library which was there for assizes purposes.  But the ordinary County Court practitioners had to depend on the books they brought themselves in connection with the cases in which they expected to be engaged, or the books brought by the judges, or the text books which solicitors have.  It is only right to say that I found in the old County Courts some of the most difficult cases decided in a very satisfactory manner.  I know of at least two cases which, in the old pre-Treaty days, went to the House of Lords, and the County Court Judge's decision was upheld by the then highest tribunal in the United Kingdom.  Since those days I may say that the Circuit Court judges have transacted their business in a way that has not only pleased litigants, but their decisions, when they came before the courts in Dublin, were as a rule approved of and upheld by the highest judges in the land.  In my time I saw very few decisions reversed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon's suggestion is a most admirable one, and I highly commend it to the Minister for Justice.  I hope, however, that this is not putting in the <Col N="744" /> thin edge of the wedge and that Circuit Courts are going to be done away with, because the original object, and an excellent object it was, of the Courts of Justice Act was to cheapen law, which it has not done, and bring it home to the people, which it has done in a manner.  It would be a very good idea, if it could be carried out, that there should be, as Deputy Dillon said, a peripatetic library established in connection with the Circuit Courts. Of course there are many difficulties in connection with it, but I think that the cost of it, for really practical purposes, would be very small.  It would be very useful, not only to the lawyers engaged in the cases, but still more advantageous to the litigants, who, after all, are the people entitled to the greatest consideration in a matter of this kind.  I hope that the Minister for Justice, being himself for so many years connected with the law, will do his best to see that it is put into practical operation.</P>

      <P>I put in certain amendments which were ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle owing to the fact that they entailed expenditure. I, therefore, avail of this opportunity to ask the Minister if he will see his way to reconsider this particular matter.  Amendments Nos. 18, 44 and 114 have been ruled out of order. Amendments Nos. 18 and 44 deal with the question of court stenographers.  I am not going to go into the merits of the case.  I am simply putting it to the Minister that he should make financial provision for this.  I am dissatisfied, with this Resolution because it has not made provision for this.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 114 is also a very important one.  Again I will not go into the merits of the case, except to state that it is an extraordinary situation that, no matter how poor a man may be, except he is charged with murder the State will not assist him in his defence.  I think that justice is not fully done when a poor man cannot get adequate legal advice.  I think a judge should be in a position to assign counsel for the defence in all criminal cases.  I ask the Minister to reconsider that matter with a view to having it provided for.</P>

      <P>It looks as if we were discussing the original Money Resolution.  I think that has been allowed because of the introductory phrases of the Minister and because there are phrases in this which talk about amending the Courts of Justice Act.  That being the case, I want to make this attempt at a reasoned statement with regard to this money; which is additional to what has already been voted for the purposes of this Bill.  It was stated here when the Money Resolution was first proposed and on Second Beading that the case for this Bill is really the Circuit Court appeals. If the Circuit Court appeals were not causing some disturbance, either by reason of the method of hearing or the delay in their hearing, there would be really no case for the appointment of anybody.  There might be small points. There have been points urged about the enlargement of the Circuit Court jurisdiction, and the Chief Justice in his evidence stated there was a necessity for that.  But the special point emphasised by all speakers in favour of the Bill was the Circuit Court appeal system.  It is proposed to make a change, and the change is going back to the old system of a rehearing on fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand the scheme, it holds in no country in the world other than this.  That was stated in evidence before the Committee which sat on this matter, and people have been searching to discover whether there is, in fact, a rehearing with the witnesses paraded again.  But in the simple type of case no example can be got.  We are told, in answer to that, that of course the people have got used to the system of rehearing and ought to be obliged.  But oblige them, if it can be done, by some scheme in which there is some thread of principle.  It has sprung, unfortunately, from a very old, bad and degraded system which there was in this country whereby every case, I think originally it was under £10, raised by degrees until it got to the £50 mark, was not, in the first instance, heard by a judge at all, but by somebody called a revising barrister or who travelled in the way the revising barristers travelled for that purpose.  That was sworn to in the <Col N="746" /> evidence.  Then there came in a system that people said: &ldquo;Well, these cases have not got a judicial hearing at all; let us send around a judicial person,&rdquo; and a judicial person was sent around who galloped around&mdash;I use that phrase as taken from the evidence of the President of the High Court.  He started off with a programme, but the experience of those people on those circuits was that the programme never held for more than the first couple of days, and then time ran out and the towns at the end of the list saw only a fleeting shadow of a judge going through.  Countless instances have been given of cases being heard in the most slap-dash manner as a result of this system.  That was the system, at any rate.  First, there was the case of under £10, and then by degrees increased, then having a judge to determine in the first instance, and then the new stirring of conscience on it and the idea that a judicial hearing should be given, and so you had what was called an appeal.</P>
    <P>There were various schemes for preventing the growth of perjury, but I think I can say that all of those who gave evidence, or nearly all&mdash;at any rate, the great majority of those who gave evidence&mdash;said that the rehearing system did invite perjury: that the first hearing was simply regarded as a trial run and that you did not show your hand completely, or else&mdash;and it most frequently happened&mdash;that the case was changed.  It was not fundamentally changed, but changed in the little detail that meant the difference between a win and a loss.  We are now going to have the rehearing of the witnesses paraded a second time&mdash; paraded with the knowledge that they did badly on the first occasion and that now they are going to mend their hand, and that is going to cost more money.  The Minister said to-day that it is going to cost about £8,000.  Well, at any rate, that is an advance, if I may use an auctioneer's expression. Previously he said he did not know, and then it was to be about £l,000 travelling expenses and £500 for criers and so on.  At any rate, it is admitted that there is some expense, but there is also this: I recognise in this Bill the triumph of the Departmental officials <Col N="747" /> in the Department of Justice, and I think I also recognise the hand of the Minister for Finance.  For years I kept waging a battle against those people on one matter: that court fees should not be increased.  They have now won. Court fees are going to be increased&mdash; we do not know by how much&mdash;but litigation through the medium of the court fees is going to be increased, and this Bill is presented to the people of this country on the basis that it is going to make law cheaper.  If these fees are to be increased, how is that going to be done?  There is going to be more expense; the court fees are going to be increased, and the belief among the higher people is that justice is going to suffer.  It costs a lot to get counsel of senior rank into these appeals cases, and when you force out these seniors they will be willing to take less in the country, when they are getting two or three briefs in the day, than they will take in Dublin when the High Court is open and when they may have other eases offered.</P>
    <P>The view was expressed that there would be cheapening of the law in connection with the cutting of barristers' and solicitors' fees.  I think that most of those who gave evidence derided that view, and I do not know if the present Minister for Justice and the present Attorney-General are really, of the belief that it will result in cheapening in that, way and if they are further of the conviction that it should be cheapened in that way.  Again, there is a bad side that I want to stress in this.  Years ago&mdash;I do not know whether the experience of any people in this House goes that far&mdash;but certainly the common talk of those of long experience at the Bar is that the young man who entered the legal profession, particularly in the barrister's line, did not and could not earn his livelihood for the first seven or eight years he was out.  He had to spend money, or his parents had to spend it, and to travel the circuit, and he could earn nothing; and he earned nothing because the seniors, either in rank or the senior of the junior standing, went out on circuit and, naturally, got the briefs.  The present situation, certainly, <Col N="748" /> has opened up work for the man who has just gone to the Bar.  It has made a big difference to the junior members, and it means that young man's parents need not look forward to supporting him for six or seven years when he starts at the Bar. Under this system the young man is at least able to meet his expenses and I believe that, if it were only socially, that is a good thing.  Added on to that, we are going to appoint two additional judges, something hybrid between a Supreme Court judge and a High Court judge, and they are going to go around the circuit and help in dealing with arrears accumulated there.  The case for that is based mainly on the arrears of work. The arrears used to be about 200, or higher, but it was said that when a figure of 200 had been reached the courts were a year behind; in other words, that the appeals can be wiped off at the rate of 200 a year.  There has been an improvement in that.  The last return that I have been able to get at shows that on 1st January, 1935, the number of cases awaiting rehearing was 152; so that the number for rehearing had decreased.  Added on to that, there is the difficulty of getting those heard immediately, because the High Court judges we otherwise engaged on High Court work.  I asked for a return on High Court work and I got this amazing information.  I asked the question for answer on 23rd May, and the reply in the volume of that date was to the effect that the figures I required were to be found in the Statistical Abstract for a particular year.  Taking out the figures here, what emerges.  In the year 1929-30, the number of summary summonses issued amounted to 6,131.  In the year 1930-31, the number was 6,153.  In the year 1931-32, the number had gone down to 5,519, and in the year 1932-33, the number of summary summonses issued had gone down to 4,844.  In the year 1933-34, the number had gone down to 3,900.  In other words, there had been a drop from 6,100 odd to something less than 4,000.  That is only the summary summonses in the High Court.  The number of plenary summonses issued had gone down from 843 in the year 1929-30 to 807 in 1930-31, <Col N="749" /> and 639 in 1931-32.  The number was 668 in the year 1932-33, and it had gone down to 634 in the year 1933-34.  So that your plenary summonses had also gone down by about one-third.  The equity cases heard&mdash;I do not know whether the particular segregation of these is in the Statistical Abstract&mdash; went down from 413 in 1929-30 to 348 in 1930-31, 307 in 1931-32, and 291 in 1932-33.  Adding these three together, it means that between 1929-30 and 1932-33, summary summonses, plenary summonses, and equity cases heard have gone down from almost 7,500 to 5,800, and, of course, there must be a bigger drop still in 1933-34.  I cannot give the figure for that year because the Abstract does not contain the equity cases, but let us assume that they prove to be about the same as the year before; they would then be 4,800.  So, the drop is from about 7,500 to 4,800.  If High Court judges in the future are going to be occupied only with 4,800 cases, where previously they dealt with 7,387, surely they are going to have time, and yet in those circumstances we are going to incur expense at a time when the country can ill afford expense of any kind.  We are going to encourage the expense of sending certain judges careering around the country to introduce a bad system with the courts languishing, with the work not coming in in the volume it used to come.  In order to find out whether that meant that certain cases had been tried in the High Court that might have been and more properly should have been tried in the Circuit Courts, and that in that way the Circuit Court figures increased correspondingly to the decrease in the High Court, I got the figures as to these cases.  There is some difficulty in getting a certain comparison here.  But a certain figure emerges.  I got the figures for five years, from Michaelmas, 1929, to Trinity, 1934.  I have gone to the trouble of totting up all these figures and I find that the number of cases over that period in all the circuits was about 14,000.  I put down a question on the 4th June and got the table brought up to date.  I found that for the year 1932-33 the 14,000 average had dropped to 11,500.  In 1933-4, it <Col N="750" /> appears to have gone up to 15,000. There was an explanation for that increase.  The Damage to Property Act had been introduced.  That is the one type of case which will be exhausted in one year; it is not like the permanent type of case.  There were nearly 4,000 cases under that Damage to Property Act, so that you may take it the average in the last couple of years appears to be about 11,500 instead of 15,000 cases in the 1933-4 period.  Criminal work appears to be on the increase.  It is the only matter in which there has been an increase or an upward trend.  One somewhat interesting figure emerges from a comparison between the ordinary criminal courts and the Military Tribunal.  I find that as regards the number paraded before the ordinary criminal courts, the convictions were 73 per cent., as against the conviction of over 90 per cent. before the Military Tribunal.</P>
    <P>Criminals are increasing in number or it may be that they are being better discovered.  At all events, Circuit Court work has dropped from 14,000 to 11,500 and the High Court work has dropped from 7,387 to 4,300.  Some years ago the Circuit Court judges were hearing considerably more cases than now.  Then the appeals were likely to be more in number.  At a time when the High Court cases have dropped from 7,387 to 4,300 when arrears are less likely and when, consequently, there will be less work for the judges, we are asked to appoint two new judges and to vote money for them.  The basis of that charge is the Circuit Court appeal.  We are going back to the system which is a social disadvantage from the angle of the profession.  It is a system which certainly invites a greater degree of perjury. It is a system unheard of in any country.  Why, under these circumstances, should we vote money for the reintroduction of such a system?</P>

      <P>The matter before the House is an additional Money Resolution which is confined to a specific purpose.  But when the main Money Resolution was before the Committee of the House, Deputies were requested to restrict the scope of the debate.  At the request of the Minister the Committee Stage of the Bill was allowed to go through without much discussion.  Technically, Deputy McGilligan's arguments may have been out of order, but in view of the circumstances in which the main Money Resolution was submitted to the House, the Chair deliberately gave latitude to Deputies to discuss both Money Resolutions now.</P>

      <P>I merely intended to convey to the House that we were treading a well-worn, path and that, already, we had arguments for and against the new system proposed in this Bill.  We have had these arguments over and over again, in the House. Not only that, but there has been a Joint Committee sitting on this matter for a number of years.  Ever since the system which it is now proposed to change was introduced in the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, there has been discussion as to whether the new system thereby introduced was an improvement on the old system or not. Eventually, it was thought necessary by the Government of the day to set up a Commission to inquire into the working of the new system and to derive such lessons as could be derived from it in comparison with the older system.  Deputy McGilligan says now <Col N="752" /> that the main object of this Bill is to introduce a bad system.  It is an astonishing thing that that can be so glibly announced here after the Joint Committee had considered and inquired into this question and after it had a large body of evidence before it, evidence which, as the Deputy pointed out, from some witnesses was definitely in favour of the system embodied in the Courts of Justice Act and also, from other witnesses, definitely against it.  But the Committee unanimously found, first of all, that it was the intention of the 1924 Act that an effective appeal on fact should be given.  The Committee came to the conclusion, from the evidence before them, that while the change in the procedure of appeals by the substitution of appeal upon the stenographer's notes for a rehearing was a definite and deliberate change, it was not intended to deprive litigants of an appeal on fact.  Their advice that there should be a reintroduction of the old system of appeal flowed, to a large extent, from the information they gathered from various witnesses, that in practice it had worked out that under the system of appeal introduced in the 1924 Act, no appeal did lie on fact, although in the Act an appeal on fact was definitely provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Committee held lengthy sittings and I gave evidence before it.  Every source from which helpful information might be derived was tapped by that Committee.  It is rather astonishing to have it suggested now that they decided to reintroduce a definitely bad system.  If Deputy McGilligan looks up the evidence, he will see that my statement was to the effect that with five years' experience as a solicitor under the old system I was of the opinion that it was a system which, so far as we had experience of its working in the West, was definitely popular with the people and the members of the legal profession and was approved by the Bar and the legal profession generally.  While it possibly may have had some of the defects Deputy McGilligan has pointed out, we in Mayo certainly did not feel any serious evil arising out of this story of judges rushing through their lists.  I gave my evidence before the Committee to the <Col N="753" /> effect that, as a solicitor practising amongst the people and having had experience of both systems, I considered the old system was definitely much more popular and that there was an anxiety amongst the people to have it restored.</P>
    <P>It may be that the judgment formed of the new system was somewhat hasty, that it had not got a sufficiently long trial, and that there may be merits in it which in the course of time will be brought out.  But I think Deputy McGilligan must realise that the members of the solicitors' profession all over the country, barristers in the Library and the members of the public who have examined this thing, feel generally that the old system of rehearing on fact before a High Court judge is the most satisfactory way of dealing with litigation and, whatever the experience of other countries, there is no doubt this became the native system here, moulded to the ways of the people, acceptable to them and in practice I think it was found to work very satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan says that that system has social disadvantages so far as the members of the Bar are concerned. I think he is quite wrong in that.  I think the members of the Junior Bar are anxious that the system of the Assize Court should be re-esteblished.  From the public point of view, I said before the Tribunal that it was much more satisfactory that the High Court judges should go to the country districts, the various circuits, and have the cases tried out there, rather than have an appeal on notes.  My view is that if you are not going to return to the system of rehearing before High Court judges, then it would be much better to abolish the hearing of appeals from Circuit Court judges altogether.</P>
    <P>On the question of expense, I stated that litigation would be immensely cheapened by this change.  I make that statement because of my experience as a solicitor of the costs litigants incurred in the old days of appeals to the Assizes in contrast with the costs which are incurred at the present day by such litigants as can indulge in the luxury of a Circuit Court appeal in a case of any importance. <Col N="754" /> The returns show the large amount of costs which have to be met by litigants who feel obliged to have important cases thrashed out on appeal in the High Courts.  The cost of the stenographer's notes alone is a considerable item and the fees to counsel are also considerable.  While I have no desire to suggest that the Bar should reduce their fees, I think it will be found, as we found in the old days, that the fees to be paid to counsel on an appeal from the Circuit Court will be much less than the fees which have now to be paid to counsel on an appeal to the High Court. There is the addition of witnesses' expenses which the appellant will have to incur in taking his witnesses to a circuit town instead of having the appeal on the stenographer's notes; but I think that is completely wiped out when compared with the cost of the stenographer's notes under the present appeal system.</P>
    <P>The Junior Bar, before this present system came into existence, used to go to the County Courts.  Nowadays a junior barrister, if he wants to build up his business, must go on Circuit. They may have to wait for years, just as barristers in previous years had to wait, before they acquired business. I think the general opinion, so far as the effect on the social life of the Bar is concerned, is that first of all, from the point of view of learning their trade, the High Court on circuit will provide a much better school of education in practice and law than the present Circuit Court does.  There is no doubt that one of the great virtues of the old system was that it brought on to the circuit the leaders of the Bar on that circuit and they were an example for the junior members of the Bar.  I make bold to say that the whole level of legal education will be raised by the fact that High Court judges will go down to the circuits with the members of the Senior Bar who at present only visit the circuits on certain occasions and at very high fees; that if Deputy Dillon's suggestion is adopted about a proper library, that the level of the education of the Junior Bar will be raised; that there <Col N="755" /> will be at the disposal of the country litigants a better trained Bar, a better trained solicitors' profession, and that they will have the benefit of easy access to the High Court judges. These are arguments.  I think, in favour of the old system, and the arguments I myself advanced when giving evidence before the Tribunal, when I could not be accused of having any bias one way or the other.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon threw out the suggestion that the Circuit system by High Court judges would be much improved by the provision of law libraries.  I quite agree it would be a most excellent thing if that were carried out, and that an adequate library should be available in each circuit, or at least in those circuit areas where the judges who go on circuit would be likely to sit.  I think that is a matter which does not need any amendment of this Bill.  If the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Justice are both agreed I think it could be done, administratively, without the slightest trouble.  I can see that there will be strong objection, as it will be suggested that the members of the circuit could acquire an adequate library.  It will be suggested that the practice could be re-introduced of barristers going on circuit carrying about with them the necessary books, but that is a very unsatisfactory way to provide a library, or of having one available for use in the circuit of the High Court judges. Deputy Dillon said that the whole circuit would not require more than eight libraries, but I think there would be more than eight towns in which High Court judges would sit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It was my suggestion that it should be a peripatetic library and should travel with the judge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>If it was a peripatetic library, travelling with the judge, it should be limited.  The cost of course would not be very great.  I do not know whether we could induce the Minister for Finance to provide it. Possibly he might say if the cost was not great why should not the circuit provide it.  But a peripatetic library could not be very much good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="756" /> Would it not be better to provide a proper library in each courthouse where the judges sit?  To provide any sort of an adequate library would be very expensive, running into at least £200 or £300 if you were to provide any considerable body of law reports. However, these are matters that the Minister will deal with.  I do not know what he will say.  Probably he will consider the matter and submit it to the Minister for Finance for his consideration.</P>
    <P>There were other points raised which I think might more properly be dealt with by the Minister.  There is the question of the District Court Clerks, and there is the point raised by Deputy MacEoin.  I wish to say again, what I said already two or three times, that while Deputy McGilligan might be able to make out theoretical arguments which were rejected by the Commission, I think there is no shadow of doubt that if you take the large majority of those intimately concerned with the working of the courts system and those connected with the working of the courts, they, in almost overwhelming numbers, will agree that the system of appeals which it is proposed to introduce into this country will be regarded as a welcome change from the present system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFinlay" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>After listening patiently to the speech of the Attorney General I rise to express disapproval of the Money Resolution now before the House.  As a matter of fact I cannot see why two new High Court judges are required.  As far as I know the country I think the District Court justices are quite capable of dealing with the work.  Many courts sit for which there is no work.  I have known courts myself for which there was no work.  I think it is very unjust to the ratepayers at the present time to burden them with another £9,000 a year which will be required to pay the new judges.  £9,000 may look little in the eyes of some people but to many people outside this House nine-tenths of it mean a good deal.  As a ratepayer, and as a representative of the ratepayers of the country, I think it is a great injustice to bring this forward at the present time.  As my <Col N="757" /> friend Deputy McGilligan says&mdash;I do not know the figures myself but I take them from him&mdash;the legal work in this country to-day is about half what it was three or four years ago. Is it for fashion sake that the Government wants these two Judges of High Court standard to be appointed and this additional burden put on the ratepayers?  It is all jobbery to my mind.  I certainly think the present is not the time for such appointments.  We should wait until the people are in a position to meet their liabilities before putting additional expenditure upon them.  It is a sad business to saddle the people with another £9,000 a year in order to bring these two people into office. If there was justice in this matter I would not oppose it but I have seen Courts sitting in Leix and Offaly and no business to be done.  We are told that the legal business has fallen by 50 per cent. and I think it is wholly unjustifiable to put these two additional Judges into office at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.M. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with the speech made by the Attorney General and the suggestion of Deputy Dillon about a peripatetic wandering extravagant or erring library Deputy Doctor Rowlette asked me what had become of the old well-stocked wine cellars that used to be attached to the various circuits.  If these wine cellars are still left, the disposal of their contents would furnish a very fine library for every Circuit Court in Ireland and would relieve the exchequer of any responsibility in connection with the matter.  From my experience I am in favour of the restoration of the system of rehearing cases on appeal.  I am quite aware, and nobody knows it better, that it has many drawbacks and that there has been not a little perjury in the past in connection with it.  But on the other hand I feel and know that there are certain cases that cannot be decided upon a shorthand note.  In my opinion in cases of title, which occur in the country about a foot of ground, or a drop of water, no matter how efficient, and no matter how energetic the stenographer is he cannot convey to the appellate jurisdiction <Col N="758" /> the real facts of the case.</P>
      <P>There is certainly a great deal of truth in what Deputy McGilligan says, that in the old days the Assize Judges often rushed through their business.  I remember a case where a Judge, having 40 witnesses in Court, heard only one on each side, and then promptly arrived at his decision.  In connection with galloping through business I hope I will not offend the House or anyone in or outside it when I tell the following short story.  Dr. Webb was a County Court Judge.  He was a very distinguished graduate of Trinity College, and figured very prominently in the old Phoenix Park murder trials. Before his County Court some barrister quoted a case which had been decided on circuit by a very distinguished Judge who is now dead. Dr. Webb pulled his wig aside, and gave him a withering look.  &ldquo;My dear young man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do not give me a Circuit Court decision.  I have no doubt it was decided by a Judge who was rushing to catch the 3 o'clock train to go back to Dublin, and argued by two barristers who were drunk the night before, instructed by two solicitors who were always drunk.&rdquo; Of course that was an exaggeration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Finlay has talked to this Bill as if we were discussing an expenditure of £9,000. We are in fact discussing the cost to litigants.  The increased cost to litigants is going to be much more than what is represented by this £9,000. The figure now being cast around this House is the emoluments of two Judges and the travelling expenses of the Criers.  We are starting off with bigger expenses, because the Court fees are going to be raised.  I have asked by how much, and I will not be told.  Until we know that figure we do not know what is the extra cost to litigants.  They are going to pare something off that, they hope, by reducing the legal charges otherwise. It is certainly not an amount of £9,000 or £10,000 that is under consideration. The Attorney General has spoken in reply to me as if the system we were going back to were the system he would uphold on principle.  I wonder is it?  I would agree with the remarks <Col N="759" /> made by Deputy Burke, and which will be made no doubt by other people, that if you are going to have a fact question tried you cannot have that tried on the note.  You must see the witness who is swearing to the fact. Therefore, you may say that if you are going to have an appeal on fact you must have a rehearing.  So you must.  But why have it?  What country, other than this, has it?  Why, in this country alone in the whole world, do we think it is necessary to give your witness two bites at the legal cherry?  We are unique in that. This is the only place, I think, in the whole world where in regard to these small cases, you are going to have a second run of the witnesses.  I do not think the system can be upheld in principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is very good evidence on that point given by the present Registrar for County Monaghan, Mr. Murphy, who was a very distinguished solicitor before he took up that position.  He countered that argument, and the other argument which I am going on to later, on the amount of education which juniors got from watching the seniors sweep down to the circuit and take the briefs which they might have got if the seniors were not there.  Mr. Murphy uses the very apt phrase, that it was noteworthy that England, who inaugurated the system here, never tried it herself.  She tried it on the dog here, but had sufficient wisdom, after seeing how it worked here, not to adopt it herself.  In England the system is that for cases under £100&mdash; the figure has been raised; it used to be a smaller sum&mdash;where there is a compulsory resort to the County Court system, there is no appeal except what is in fact by way of a case stated on point of law.  You finish once and for all.  That is a good system.  If you are going to have any other system I agree that you cannot have a matter of fact heard on the note.  You must see the witness, and the man who is going to find out most from the witnesses is the man who sees them on the first occasion or on the second occasion.  I do not think he will get the truth on the second hearing.  He will get not merely a rehearing but a <Col N="760" /> readjustment of the facts.  You must make up your minds on the principle of this matter.  You will either have a trial of fact finished in the Circuit Court, without appeal only on a point of law, or else you will adopt this system&mdash;for no reason yet stated that I can ascertain&mdash;of having a second lunge at your facts.  In that connection it is worth while seeing what the Committee&mdash;on whose report the Attorney-General is prepared to stand when it suits his purpose, and probably will throw down otherwise&mdash; recommended.  One member of that Committee fought definitely against the prevalence of the idea that perjury was rife in the country and had been increased by the rehearing.  Although he fought strenuously against that, the Committee in fact accepted that point of view.  Their decision was this: have a rehearing, but have the stenographer's notes; in other words, their idea was to keep a record of what the man said on the first occasion, and that then you had some check on perjury. Are the Government carrying out that recommendation?  By no means.  We are going to have a rehearing unfettered by the notes.</P>
    <P>As between principles, I do not know where we are.  You can either say: &ldquo;We will give you good judges. They are good judges of fact, and, when they have judged it on fact, there the matter stops in regard to those small cases&rdquo;; or you can say: &ldquo;For some reason, which may be disclosed soon, we are going to have a second go at the facts, and we are going to do it without the protection which the Courts of Justice Committee recommends&mdash;the guardianship of the notes to prevent too blatant perjury, or too much evasion of what was sworn to on a previous occasion.&rdquo;  I do not know whether that was a scheme which the Committee put up because they were impressed with the delay in the hearing of the appeals, and the number of the appeals outstanding.  The phrase which I used about where the system developed has been challenged here. The Chief Justice gave evidence before this Committee.  It is reported at page 317 of the Joint Committee report, question 4636.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="761" />&ldquo;First of all, the `old system' as regards cases over £50 jurisdiction, was the same system that now prevails.</P>
    <P>There never was a rehearing of that kind of case.  The `old system' as regards cases under £50, that is the old County Court appeal, had an historical basis which no longer exists.  From inquiries that I have made it does not exist in any other country.  I cannot find that it was ever thought of anywhere save here. It has a curious explanation here. There is an actual historical explanation for it.  Before the setting up of the County Court you had a system of hearing cases by members of the Bar, what was known to the older generation as the system of the assistant barrister, who went over the country and heard cases.  He was not a judge.  The right, however, was given to appeal to a judge who heard the case over again.  That is the real explanation of the thing which is absolutely unique&mdash;simply that a man who was not a judge heard a case and the people were given the right of appeal to a proper judge.  That no longer exists.  Cases are now heard in first instance by judges.  Therefore that justification for it has gone.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The President of the High Court, when giving evidence on this matter, referred to the other point which I spoke of&mdash;the hurried way in which cases were dealt with.  It is reported at page 355, in the answer to question 5151.</P>
    <P>He said: &ldquo;My second comment is this,&rdquo; and then he talks about his experience of the circuits, and went on to say: &ldquo;My view of the hearing of appeals that went on under the old system is certainly not such as would make me recommend that system for the hearing of appeals, to any tribunal, at present. If I may say so, there is a certain amount of halo cast about the old system of appeal.  My own experience was nearly always a sense of dissatisfaction with the hearing of appeals on circuit.  I think there was a tendency in all towns, except the last town of the circuit, where the judge had unlimited time, to rush through cases, <Col N="762" /> and cases were rushed through in all the towns except the last town of the circuit.  I am also of opinion&mdash;perhaps this is a different branch of the case that you have put to me&mdash;that the work on circuit was not adequately prepared or adequately done by counsel.&rdquo;  He was asked then by the Chairman: &ldquo;So that the greater speed with which we have been told appeals were disposed of before was due, in part, to the lower jurisdiction as compared with the present Circuit Court jurisdiction, and also to some extent to the fact that, owing to circumstances, things were hurried?&rdquo; and the President of the High Court replied: &ldquo;That is my view.&rdquo;  Other witnesses said the same thing.  There is no doubt about it. Anybody who gets in touch with some of the older generation, who had experience, will find that there was that tendency to rush.  There was definitely the view prevailing that they had got their chance before and had missed their mark, and there was not so much thought for them on the appeal.</P>
    <P>That is the system to which we are to get back.  It is going to involve expense and, I hold, certain disadvantages to the community.  The Committee, although one member strenuously opposed the idea that perjury was either in the country or likely to increase by reason of this, was so impressed that they did bring in, and it is pointed out as a necessary safeguard, a recommendation that on the appeal by way of rehearing, the notes should accompany it.  That is a safeguard against the door thrown open to perjury at the rehearing.  We are going away from that and going to have an appeal by way of re-hearing, with witnesses paraded a second time, and nothing to check up on them with.</P>
    <P>I understand that this system in England sprang up in a way similar to what sprang up here, only it took another course and a better one.  There is a Commission sitting at present on the dispatch of business at common law in England, and evidence has been given that the County Courts Act of 1846 established a system of having debts of under £20 recoverable in a certain way, taking the place of certain ancient local courts.  They did consolidate that into a system in which <Col N="763" /> a judge went round&mdash;of always keeping to the system of a judge going round. Knowing that a judge has gone round, that finishes it.  It can go further, but only or mainly on a point of law.</P>
    <P>I do not think that on the ground of any particular principle this change can be defended.  I do not think that anybody would put it up.  Nobody would think of reintroducing it if it had not been for the trouble about the delay, in the hearing of Circuit Court appeals under the new system, and the fact that there was a big accumulation of arrears.  I place against that the facts that the Attorney-General has completely ignored in his reply.  There were accumulations.  You have got to the point when these accumulations were being eaten in on.  There are still about 200 outstanding, and that 200 represents a year's work.  It seems bad that cases, should stand over for rehearing on appeal for twelve months.  That number is being lessened.  Why is it being lessened? For two reasons.  There are fewer cases coming on appeal because there are fewer cases coming into the Circuit Court.  There are fewer cases originating in the High Courts, and therefore there is more time for the judges to hear appeals.  Occasionally some very big case will occupy the court for a long time and throw them out of gear, but, generally speaking, the figures bear out what I say, that you have work originating in the High Courts dropping from something over 7,000 cases to something in the region of 4,800.  Clearly there cannot be the same call on the time of the High Court judges as there was.  Then you have Circuit Court cases going down by one-third.  There is proportionately a fewer number of cases on appeal, and there is clearly fewer going to come up than before.  You have again, apart from the matter of principle, the argument on fact.  There is a fewer number of cases in the courts, fewer appeals, and more time to hear appeals.</P>
    <P>I point again to the recommendation of the Committee.  The Committee mainly founded themselves on the observation: &ldquo;Objections have been urged to the older system, but it <Col N="764" /> worked admirably and gave satisfaction to litigants and the public.&rdquo;  They recommend that the rehearing should be to two judges.  It must be either to one or two.  The witnesses were of opinion that the rehearing should be by two judges, and the Committee agreed with that opinion.  Finally, they recommend that the official stenographers should be retained and that their notes, at any rate, should be available for the judges.  They also say that they should be available for cross-examination by counsel of witnesses whose evidence differed from that which they gave in the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>When that Committee was established and reported, members of the Party who now form the Government objected to any increase in the costs until such time as either the increased prosperity of the country warranted it or the volume of business in the Superior Courts urgently required it. So far from the prosperity of the country warranting it now, there is less prosperity than there was.  So far from the business in the Superior Court urgently requiring it, there is less business than before.  Despite that, the Government, formed from the Party whose members signed the report with that objection, saying that whatever might be the arguments in favour of an increase, they could not agree to any increase until the prosperity of the country warranted it and the urgency of business in the Superior Courts demanded it, in circumstances where there is less urgency in business and less prosperity, propose to spend this money and to increase the cost of litigation, at any rate in the first instance, by the court fees to litigants.</P>
    <P>I think the only point the Attorney-General leant on was what I consider personally&mdash;I do not say it is a view universally held&mdash;an absurd view with regard to the benefit that the young man gets in the Circuit Court because the leaders of the Bar go down there. If the leaders of the Bar do not go down the young man gets more work. I think that being actually occupied in one ease, the facts of which he has to make up, where he is exposed to whatever can be done against him by counsel on the other side, is worth far more in the way of practical experience <Col N="765" /> than sitting listening to a dozen eminent men arguing cases about which he knows nothing, in which he has not seen the pleadings and does not know what use is being made of the facts or arguments.  In addition to that, if there is anything to be gained from sitting in court listening to eminent men arguing, the junior, for whom I am pleading, the man who is only starting, who has got some work under the old system where it is better spread, has many days of leisure and idleness in which he can sit in the High Court in Dublin and get all the education he can get in that way.  The new situation will mean, instead of the work being spread over the younger men, instead of getting an education through practical experience in cases, that there is going to be a new influx of the senior men of both ranks to remove from him his chance of getting these cases.  At any rate, it is going to delay the time at which the young man going out, the apprentice to the profession, will earn his expenses, and that, I think, is bad.</P>
    <P>There is a further point in this as to whether the standard of legal practice is going to go down.  Where can it go down?  Again, I would refer anybody who thinks there is anything in that to what the County Registrar for Monaghan said, and his experience. One would imagine, to hear the Attorney-General speak, that a junior sent out on circuit was in the wilds of Ethiopia for months after leaving Dublin and as if he had no contact with the Library on the days on which he would return.  He speaks of him going out under the present system as being completely detached and that the only guidance that he could get would be from those who accompany him on circuit.  That was answered very effectively when it was pointed out that they could easily get back constantly. In that respect, I do not regard the educational facilities under the system we are going to adopt as being worth anything, and the experience of those who gave evidence who held that&mdash; with notable exceptions who held the other thing&mdash;certainly on these figures would seem to indicate it was a matter of experience.  I think the change is <Col N="766" /> impossible to justify either on the ground of experience or anything else.</P>

      <P>In the speeches Deputy McGilligan has made, he has emphasised that litigation is going to be more expensive under the system proposed by this Bill.  That may be so, but I should like to remind the House that Deputy McGilligan is pleading only for the wealthy and comparatively wealthy in making that point.  What I am surprised at in his statement is that he could not see his way to go a step further, and that, seeing that he is concerned with the cost of litigation to those who use the courts, he would not say: Why not provide now for those who really need the courts, for those who are helpless to avail of the courts at the present time and who have to put up every day in the week with terribly severe injustices&mdash;often the loss of their livelihood&mdash;and who are unable to defend themselves? Why would he not even plead that the widow and family of a man who has been killed in his employment would be enabled to get the workmen's compensation at public expense and that such people as they would not have to go creeping to a solicitor and have to give that solicitor any fee that he demanded for that.</P>

Where two wealthy men go to law to dispute <Col N="767" /> whether &ldquo;and&rdquo; has the same meaning as &ldquo;as well as&rdquo; in some document that affects their interests, I do not think that, comparatively at all events, that is of very serious importance to this House.

      <P>During the course of the Second Reading of this Bill I was denounced by Ministers and spokesmen of the Government side in this House for the violent opposition I gave to the proposals in the Bill at that stage. Anything that I have heard since, any consideration that I have given to the terms of this Bill, any discussion I have had with my colleagues in both <Col N="768" /> branches of the profession, have merely confirmed me in the views I put forward in reference to the principles in this Bill on the Second Stage.  It this Money Resolution is passed by this House, the Government will be given a blank cheque to raid the taxpayers' resources and also to rob litigants, who are endeavouring to exercise their constitutional right of seeking free access to the courts.  We are not given, any information here, as Deputy McGilligan has pointed out, as to what the cost of this Bill is going to be&mdash;even approximately&mdash;and the reason for that is obvious.  The reason is that the Ministers do not know.  They do not know what the cost of the Bill is going to be, even approximately; nor do they know to what extent the Minister for Finance is going to exercise the very wide and unrestricted powers that are given to him by Section 65 of the proposed Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moore has just made a very moving plea on behalf of the poor people who wish to go into court, and if Deputy Moore considered this Bill, as I am sure he has, from that point of view, he would see that the whole purpose of the Bill, as embodied in Section 65 of the Bill to which I have referred, is to make the litigants&mdash; people who are going into the public courts of this country&mdash;bear a greater proportion of the cost of the upkeep of the public courts of the country than they have heretofore borne.  An effort will be made also, I am sure, by the Minister for Finance to exercise all the powers contained in Section 65 of the Bill to make litigants pay more fees and so finance the proposals in this Bill for which I say, and say without fear of any contradiction, there has been no great public demand.  Section 65, looked at casually, would appear to be quite an innocuous section, and the public have not yet realised what is behind that.  The Minister for Justice there, by order made with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may charge any fees he likes in any court to any litigant before that litigant can exercise what I call his constitutional right to seek the assistance of the public courts of this country.  Nobody with any experience of the administration of justice&mdash;the judges or <Col N="769" /> the representatives of either branch of the profession, or the rule-making authority&mdash;is to be consulted before these fees, provided for in Section 65 of the Bill, are imposed.  That eats into the very principle for which Deputy Moore, just a few moments ago, was speaking and which he was advocating.  I agree with Deputy Moore that the public courts of this country should be freely open to every person, no matter whether he is rich or poor, and that the poorer he is the greater facilities he should have for entering the courts to litigate his grievances or to ventilate his wrongs.</P>
    <P>This Section 65, which is put in for the purpose of financing or partly financing these unwanted provisions in the Bill, eats into the very principle Deputy Moore is advocating here to-day.  Nobody with experience is to be consulted but the Minister for Finance, whose inclination will be always to make litigants pay more and more for what he conceives to be the luxury of litigation, and he, unless he is restrained, will possibly make it impossible for litigants, unless they are very rich litigants, to enter the public courts of this country.  That is a very serious matter and one that requires very careful consideration by this House.  Neither Deputy Moore nor anybody else in this House need fear that any poor person who has suffered wrong which he wishes to see remedied, or who has any grievance which he wishes to have ventilated in the courts, will be unable to go into the courts of the country and get justice.  The Deputy has suggested that neither solicitor nor barrister will take up a case for him.  That is not so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">

      <P>Take the cases under the Workmen's Compensation Acts. Workmen there got their rights largely through the operations of the junior members of the Bar fighting their cases for them in the courts.  No barrister will take up a case saying he will chance his fee.  A barrister will go into court on behalf of a workman, and whether he wins or loses he will take no fee.  I do not know what profession or calling Deputy Moore follows, but I know that if anybody comes up to Deputy Moore in the street and asks, &ldquo;Will you give me your services free?&rdquo; I can see his laugh at the idea of anybody making such a fatuous request to him.  The Deputy suggests that lawyers and barristers are doing something ignoble or mean because they are charging fees for expert services.

      <P>I am afraid we are slightly wandering from the point I intended to pursue in speaking on this Motion.  I have listened to nonsense from Deputy Moore.  It is the sort of nonsense with which the Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party have been poisoning the minds of the people of this country for the past ten years. Surely it is about time they stopped that sort of nonsense.  It would be well if Deputy Moore would take the trouble to find out whether or not there is in the Law Library at the Four Courts an organisation to see that poor litigants will have the services of barristers freely.  I have already stated that this Bill was uncalled for. I have said that there was no general demand for the provisions embodied in it.  I think that the principles underlying <Col N="771" /> the Bill are thoroughly unsound. I do not, intend to go over that ground again, but there are one or two points to which I would like to refer.  One of the great principles in the Bill is the provision aiming at the return of the old system of a full re-hearing.  May I refer, in passing, to the fact that every time a criticism is put up in connection with the provisions of this Bill, resort is always had or endeavoured to be had to the Report of the Joint Committee. I wish to repeat again that not in one single respect does this Bill follow the Report of the Joint Committee.  Consequently the recommendations of that Committee are not a defence for any of the provisions contained in the Bill. Deputy McGilligan has already pointed out that even in the matter of re-hearing the recommendations of the Joint Committee have not been followed. I stated on the Second Reading of this Bill that I thought I was a voice crying in the wilderness when I was protesting against this system of re-hearing and of the judges going on Assize.  Somewhat to my astonishment, I have discovered that during the period which has elapsed since, the members of the profession are worrying about what is going to be the effect of this Bill on their practice. I would venture to say that if a ballot were taken amongst the junior members of the profession to-day there would be a very strong majority against the provision of re-hearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Attorney-General has stated that the cost of litigation will be reduced.  Deputy McGilligan has referred to the position in which the junior members of the Bar will find themselves under this Bill.  I would like to develop that matter.  That is in reference to the costs they will have to bear and the position in which they will find themselves then.  The provision of re-hearing has always been defended on the grounds that the junior members of the Bar will thus have a better chance of learning their trade when they see the senior members engaged at the re-hearing.  The fact will be that the junior members will, if this Bill is passed, have to have some private means if they are to carry on, for they will have to bear <Col N="772" /> two sets of expenses instead of one. Instead of going to the Circuit Court and having the appeal heard in Dublin, they will have first to go to the Circuit Court and then they will have to go to the Assizes to hear the appeal.  That is not a matter that can be brushed aside without argument. It is not the case that this Bill has any value for the junior members of the Bar.  My colleague, Deputy Burke, said that he was in favour of re-hearing and ended up by giving the most conclusive proof that the old system was properly changed and that it should not again be resorted to.  There are one or two points in the Bill which I should like to emphasise.  I understand from you, Sir, that some of my amendments are out of order, but I want to impress upon the Government the necessity of providing safeguards in the High Court as well as in the Circuit Court. I understood from a perusal of the President's speech that he was impressed by the reasons put forward for safeguards not only in the High Court but in the Circuit Court. Though the President said he was impressed by the arguments for safeguards, we have no indication that the amendments suggested are to be embodied in the Bill.  The only indication we have is that the Government are not to accept these amendments.</P>
    <P>We have no provision in the Government amendments for stenographers. If this Bill were to be justified at all, it should go the whole way in the reform of the legal system. There is nothing to be said for this Bill.  There might be something to be said for a Bill, even in the existing circumstances of the country, that would approach the situation in a comprehensive manner.  As it is, the Government have taken a middle course, a course that will give no satisfaction to anybody.  They have, in my opinion, taken a middle course and a very wrong course in reference to the Supreme Court.  They give lip service to the principle that there should be five members of the Supreme Court, but they intend to go to the extent of nominally placing two additional members in the High Court, leaving them what they will be in <Col N="773" /> effect and practice, High Court judges with Supreme Court salaries.</P>
    <P>They propose to revert to the system of rehearing.  I have always held the view&mdash;I still hold it&mdash;that it will not be possible to carry out this new system satisfactorily except at the cost of adding at least two new High Court judges to the existing judiciary.  In that respect the Government are only tinkering with the Bill and they admit that by the provisions they have put in for Commissioners of Assize.  They contemplate that even with the two new Supreme Court judges it will not be possible to deal satisfactorily with this new system of rehearing without some additional help.  If they wish to revert to the old system they ought to face the fact that it will require additional judges.  It is the same way throughout the whole length of the Bill.  They have not carried out in any single respect of major importance the recommendations of the Joint Committee.  They have not dealt with far more urgent problems in connection with the administration of justice than are indicated by the provisions here.  There are, for instance, a number of anomalies in our legal system that urgently require to be dealt with.  The Government ought to have dealt with such anomalies which are crying out for attention.  Instead of doing that, they merely produce a Bill which takes in every respect a middle course, a course that is in my view a wrong course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have one last word to say on this matter of poor persons.  I understand that the Committee of the Bar put up a recommendation in connection with this matter.  It was confined to lending aid to poor persons charged with serious offences.  I do not think it can be said that the members of the Committee who put up that recommendation were actuated by the sort of motive that seems to be running in Deputy Moore's mind.  If there is State aid for poor people charged with serious offences, it means that part of that will eventually flow down to members of the Bar.  As it is, there is a very big number of cases done <i>gratis.</i>  This matter was never raised <Col N="774" /> in an acute form before in the House, but it was raised amongst members of the Executive Council and there was then a definite conflict of opinion. There was the mind of the Department of Finance clearly expressed that court fees should pay for the cost of the courts of the State and there was even a suggestion at one time that so far from there being anything like an appeal or facilities allowed for an appeal, in addition to every other deterrent there should be a fee of £10 or £20 on every appeal, marked by a stamp, all with the aim of deterring people from taking appeals; and if people did go on taking these appeals where the Department of Finance thought they should not then they would pay for it and these stamp duties would pay for the cost of litigation.  There was the view-point of those who wanted to have court fees so raised as to cover the whole expense of the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It went even to this extent: figures were put up in a way that this can be implied from them&mdash;that the fees of civil courts were to cover not merely the cost of the civil courts but the cost of the criminal courts.  I do not think in any country was there such a case made that the fees charged should meet the cost not merely of civil business but of criminal business. That contention was made and frequently upheld and I consider a good deal was done in stopping that tendency. That tendency was in complete opposition to the other view that prevailed with certain members of the Council, that not merely should fees not be increased, but that they should be borne to a certain extent out of taxation and that aid should be given to poor people.  The suggestion of giving aid to poor people in any type of case was for the moment washed out.  It is a matter that we cannot get raised except on a ministerial motion.  I suggest the Minister should give us an opportunity of threshing out whether poor people should get legal aid and what are the limits.  I would say to Deputy Moore, if he is serious about this, that he should not try to raise that question in the atmosphere of a Bill in which court fees are being raised to litigants.  I know <Col N="775" /> that behind that phrase is the old mentality of the Finance Department, that court fees should be raised to the point where all State charges in relation to courts will be met out of the fees to be charged.</P>

      <P>There were one or two matters raised by Deputy Dillon about District Court clerks.  The position in regard to them has been that where these District Court clerks are regarded as whole time officials, they were offered establishment.  That matter arose a good while ago, before the present Executive came into office, and I understand that was then turned down.  A question was raised by Deputy MacEoin as regards stenographers. At present this matter has been taken up between the Department of Justice and the Department of Finance, and every effort will be made to ensure that those persons will be compensated in some way or provided with alternative service.  So far as stenographers' notes being used for the purpose of rehearing on appeal from the Circuit Court to the High Court is concerned, that question has been definitely decided&mdash;it is not going to be continued.  The system of having a stenographer will be discontinued as soon as this Bill becomes law.</P>

But that matter can be raised by amendment on the Report Stage.  That is the only sort of case in which it would be considered.  It could be considered on Deputy Costello's amendment.</P>

We had it out already to the extent of 40 columns in the Official Debates on this question that we are debating to-night on the other Money Resolution when it came up.  A good deal of stress was laid by Deputy McGilligan as to the question of the increase in fees.  As the Deputy knows the present position is that the rule making authorities are there to prevent an increase in fees.  There has been a good deal of communication between the Department of Justice and the Department of Finance to try and get what we consider a fair and equitable arrangement, and it certainly is not the aim to put it into the hands of officials to try and make the court a paying proposition from the narrow point of view of finance.  It is for that purpose that the Minister for Justice has been put, as it were, in the position of being an arbitrator between the taxpayers and the litigants.

      <P>That is assuming the worst.  But if there is a Minister for Justice there who has some comprehension of that, I cannot see how any legal man in the Ministry of Justice would take the line the Deputy suggests. The point is raised in comparing the existing with what may exist under the new system.  Deputies can see the evidence given and the recommendations made by the Committee in regard to hearing of cases, and the rehearing of appeals in the County Court, and <Col N="778" /> the costs of appeals from the Circuit Court in these cases, which are frequently so high as to amount to a denial of the rights of appeal.</P>
      <P>There was one practitioner whom Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney and others know.  He was Mr. P. O'Connor, Chairman of the Mayo Sessional Bar Association.  He has been for a long time a practising solicitor, and he is in a very high position in the legal profession. He gave evidence at page 341 and in question No. 5325 he was asked: &ldquo;Does your Association hold that the present system of hearing appeals from the Circuit Court should be repealed as being dilatory, expensive and a very unsatisfactory method of ascertaining the facts of a case&rdquo;; and his answer was: &ldquo;We certainly do.  I think any litigant who has had experience of appeals based on the Circuit Court system would be of the same opinion. I was in a case where the plaintiff got a decree in the Circuit Court for £60, with £7 14s. costs and £3 witnesses' expenses.  The defendant appealed and his costs of appeal as taxed against the plaintiff came to the sum of £106 10s. 1d.  That did not cover the entire cost of the appeal.  As claimed in the bill of costs the costs were £136 odd and these were taxed down to £106 10s. 1d.  I was in two other cases which were heard as one case. In one the plaintiff got a decree for £10 damages for assault.  The witnesses' expenses came to £12 10s. and the costs to £1 odd.  In the other case the same plaintiff claiming against another defendant got a decree for £5 and £12 10s. witnesses' expenses and costs £1 odd.  The defendants appealed and the decrees were affirmed by the appellate tribunal.  The cases were heard as one.  The Bill for respondents' costs as against the appellants came to over £100 altogether.  These are cases I was in myself.&rdquo;  That was a case in which Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney was engaged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows there was multitudinous evidence on that point, and one seemed to find in the lower and cheaper type of cases, so to speak, that the costs were very much heavier but got less in the more expensive type of case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>And they had varying views on that.  I think the summing up of the Committee was that on the lower scale the costs were higher under the present system, but when you got to the higher scale of charges the present system was cheaper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be something in that point, but my own experience, and that of every other solicitor with whom I have discussed the matter &mdash;I had not very long experience before the old system of appeals&mdash;was that in title actions and similar cases of that kind, the average costs came to between £16 and £17, and that was inclusive of witnesses' expenses, including an engineer, in many cases, if it happened to be a title action.  When we come to the new system, if it was, say, a title action or anything other than a frivolous action, and it went to appeal, the figure was never under £30. I have asked numerous solicitors through the country, and I think there is not one solicitor who will not bear me out when I say that as far as costs are concerned the new system has operated at double costs to the litigants as compared with the old system. In some cases it has resulted in costs going to enormous proportions, and you have that statement there to the effect that in many cases, according to the view of the Committee, appeal has practically been denied to the would be appellant because the costs would be prohibitive.</P>

      <P>I say that the Committee held the view that on £10 cases the new system was more costly, but when you got to the higher ranges, then the present system was in fact the cheaper system.  We have got to take <Col N="781" /> £10 cases into consideration as well as higher cases, when you are changing the whole system on the £300 jurisdiction scale.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>In the West of Ireland particularly the amounts were invariably small ones, and it is of those places that we had experience.  I do not think the Deputy will get any practising solicitor in Ireland at the present time to agree with him that the costs under the new system are not very much greater than they were under the old one.  Unless they have changed their minds during the last few months the Deputy will not get any of the practising solicitors to agree with him on that point.  The representatives from the Law Society, and everybody else I have been in touch with, were in thorough agreement that it is much more costly to the litigants under the new system than under the old one.  The Deputy may find exceptions, but I am prepared to leave it to the Law Society or anybody else to speak for themselves if that is not their opinion.  A great deal has been made of this question of witnesses mending their hand. In paragraph 23 of the Report, that is dealt with by the Committee.  It says: &ldquo;Objections have been urged to the latter system&rdquo;&mdash;that is, the Assize Court&mdash;&ldquo;but on the whole it gave satisfaction to the litigants and to the public.  The principal objection made by some witnesses to an appeal by way of rehearing was that the hearing in the Circuit Court would in many cases be in the nature of a direction of proofs, and that on the rehearing on appeal litigants would `mend their hand' to the great encouragement of perjury.  The Committee were not impressed by this objection.&rdquo;  I do not think it is an objection that will impress anybody.  My recollection&mdash;<Col N="782" /> and it is the recollection of other solicitors who had even a amall acquaintance with the former system&mdash; was that counsel were very anxious and solicitors were always very careful to keep the cuttings from the newspapers, and everything else, and if there was any attempt on the part of witnesses to mend their hand counsel and solicitors were able to meet that attempt because they had the evidence which was given by the opposite side when they were having the case heard in the old County Court.  I do not think it was justifiable in any sense to say that it lent itself to perjury.  In many cases, I suppose with results not satisfactory to the people they were dealing with, counsel were able to break down any attempt at perjury in that way.  I did not see it, but I believe it may have happened in other places that there was rushing for trains or anything of that kind.  I have heard of it, and know that it may have existed, but I did not see any of it.</P>

You have to bring down senior counsel, and you give him 25 guineas.  It may be a case in regard to a road into a bog, or something of that kind.

      <P>I should like to set some case made from the Government Benches for a reduction in the agricultural grant this year.  As a matter of fact, the sum proposed is £100,000 less than was provided last year.  I should like very much to hear from some responsible Minister what were the factors taken into consideration in the allocation of the grant this year. Did the Government feel that agriculture had suddenly become prosperous and that it did not require the same amount of aid as last year?  Did the Government feel, from the figures they have given us from time to time in the House in reply to questions, that the local authorities were in such a prosperous condition that they could continue to function and maintain the public services with less aid than they got last year or the year before?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we were to go back and consider the position since the present Government <Col N="785" /> came into office it would certainly throw a lot of light upon the ideas which the Government had when they came in, and the ideas which, apparently, they have now got with regard to local authorities.  When the Government first came into office the total agricultural grant was much greater than it is this year, and yet the present Government increased that grant by £250,000, bringing it to £1,200,000 odd. They have been consistently reducing the grant.  They never gave that amount since.  This year, apparently, they have, for some reason of their own which I should like to hear explained, cut down the grant by a further £100,000.  Is that what we should have expected from the Government?  Irrespective of the conditions prevailing in this country, is that what we should have expected?  In face of the conditions prevailing at present and the hopeless condition in which the local authorities are at present, I maintain that it is not £100,000 short we ought to be, but that we should have had an increase of £500,000 upon last year's figure.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the present state of the local authorities.  According to the replies we have got from the Minister for Local Government to questions last week and to-day, I say that the position really discloses a very sad state of affairs so far as local authorities are concerned.  When the Government came into office the total assessment for rates in all the counties was £2,403,948. There was carried forward that year £123,967 in arrears.  The total warrant, therefore, in that year was £2,527,916. Let us compare that year with the current year, in which the Government feel that they can afford to cut down the grant by £100,000.  Against a total assessment of £2,403,948 in 1931-32, the total assessment this year is £3,072,169, an increase of £668,221.  To show the prosperity which we enjoy at present in comparison with 1931-32, last year there was carried forward as uncollectable a sum of £364,655.  That was carried forward for collection this year as against £123,967 in 1931-32.  The total warrant this year was £3,436,824, but the net increase which the ratepayers have to meet this year, as <Col N="786" /> against the year when the Government came into office, is £469,924.</P>
    <P>I have given the prosperity figures which show that last year they had to carry forward £364,655 as against £123,967.  Even that does not disclose or nearly disclose the terrible condition in which local authorities find themselves to-day.  There was withheld from local authorities last year, owing to unpaid annuities, a sum of £716,009. Of that amount which was withheld, the local authorities made provision only for £159,884, leaving a deficit of £556,125 unprovided for by any means whatever.  There is no money to meet it.  Certain grants, I understand, have been paid to county councils under other heads which were forthcoming under the 1923 Land Act, but as far as the sum of £716,000 withheld from local authorities is concerned for unpaid annuities, in addition to what they have carried forward as uncollected and what they have written off as uncollectable, they have a sum of £556,125 staring them in the face of a deficit of unpaid land annuities for last year, and no provision has been made to meet it.</P>
    <P>That would be bad enough if we could just consider that at the present time the land annuities were being paid and that that represented the full amount which was to be withheld from the county councils.  I do not know what the condition of the Guarantee Fund is at the moment.  I do not know how land annuities are being paid, but I do know that, previous to some-Recess, a question was asked here and an answer given which showed, and figures in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> also showed, that the land annuities were not being paid nearly as well this year as last year.  If that is so, or if they are even being paid this year at the same rate as last year, how are county councils and local authorities to function and maintain public services with a condition of affairs like that confronting them&mdash;£556,000 not provided for by anybody?  In addition to that, we have, I am sorry to say, a reflex of the example of a type of spendthrift government in local authorities to day.  I am a member of a local authority myself and I have been Chairman of <Col N="787" /> a county council for a number of years, and I do know that very heavy expenditure to-day gets much less discussion and much less consideration by local authorities than it did formerly.  I wonder why is that?  Notwithstanding the fact that county councils have to write off irrecoverable rates and that they carry forward an amount of the rates uncollected every year, how is it they are giving less consideration to grave and serious expenditure than they gave in the past?  I should like the Government to consider that.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister for Finance is really conversant with Local Government figures or not, but I should be very anxious that some responsible minister from the Government side&mdash;I would much prefer the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to take his own responsibility in a matter like this&mdash;would consider, and seriously consider, what is happening in the country to-day with regard to local authorities.  If, after a perusal of those figures which he has supplied to this House, he still feels justified in cutting down the Agricultural Grant by £100,000, I should like him to tell the House how he has arrived at that and what factors he has taken into consideration. Local authorities have been increasing their indebtedness by loans for various purposes&mdash;all very necessary and worthy purposes&mdash;and they have been further increasing their indebtedness by overdrafts, and against all that we have this alarming situation: that no provision has been made by the majority of county councils to meet the withheld moneys on the foot of land annuities&mdash;no provision whatever.  Certain county councils did make provision or partial provision.  I think the number was 12, but only 12 made any provision whatever for those unpaid annuities, and they have staring them in the face a further repetition of that situation for the coming year.  Surely, with all the lip-service that has been paid to the agricultural community of this country when the present Government were seeking office, this should be a matter for serious consideration <Col N="788" /> by the present Government.  When the present Government were seeking office we had the Minister for Agriculture speaking down in Gorey and telling us that the farmers and agricultural labourers had to carry the country on their backs&mdash;of course he was not Minister for Agriculture than &mdash;that they had to carry the country on their backs and had to maintain an expensive and extravagant Government which cost something like £30,000,000 a year.  That was from the Minister for Agriculture in 1931.  Let the Minister for Agriculture, or the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, or the Minister for Finance, compare the situation that existed with regard to local authorities then and now, and compare the situation with regard to the Government finances then and now.  My colleague, Mr. Boland, the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, was down in Roscommon on November the 14th, 1931, at a meeting in Kilteevan.  He said on that occasion that Fianna Fáil held that derating could be financed by economies and, apart altogether from their case for the retention of the annuities, they held that there was room for economies more than sufficient to provide for derating. Now, however, they are actually cutting down the agricultural Grant by £100,000.  I would much prefer commending the Government for something they had done, but certainly any person who would go through those figures and see the situation that exists and what confronts the farming community to-day, and find that the Government expect that they are able to pay the increased rate&mdash;increased by £668,000 since they came into office &mdash;not to speak of the unpaid annuities, could hardly commend the Government. The requirements for the social services have been increased by £668,000.</P>
    <P>Last year we had figures given here by the Minister in reply to questions, which show that on the 31st of March, 1935, the total amount of arears uncollected was £1,034,551.  Of that amount, there was carried forward £364,000.  There was written off as uncollectable and irrecovorable £47,000. There was £54,256 uncollected on the <Col N="789" /> 30th September, which showed that, in addition to the new rate which was made this year and which is an increase of £500,000 odd, there was collected between the 1st of April last year and the 30th September last year the sum of £68,158.  That is the way the rates are at the moment, which the local authorities did not collect and which they felt they could collect and which they did not carry forward. Does the Minister for Finance think that that discloses a healthy state of affairs in this country?</P>
    <P>Does the Minister think that this is the time in which he can stand up in the House and say that he is moving for a certain grant which means a reduction of £100,000 in the agricultural grant?  Whenever the Government decided on reducing a grant of that type they must have taken into consideration something like lack of finance, or that the conditions have so improved in the country that they could afford to make the reduction. Has unemployment improved?  Have the prices of live stock increased?  Have the conditions of farming and agriculture generally improved?  What is the improvement?  We had here the other day a discussion on another matter in which it was mentioned by one of the Fianna Fáil deputies that land must be very valuable to-day because so many people are looking for it.  That was the statement made by Deputy Kennedy of Westmeath.  The Deputy said there were not so many questions asked in the House in connection with land distribution for a long time as there was just before the Recess.  He said he did not previously see so many people looking for land.  The conclusion he came to from that was that land must be very valuable and that it must be paying its way.  If it is paying its way, surely it is extraordinary according to the figures published here in reply to a question a week ago that in Deputy Kennedy's own county the local authority had to write off last year as irrecoverable, £4,000 in rates, and carry forward as uncollectable £8,000.  I do not think that Deputy Kennedy or anybody in fact would care to say that the Irish people have become dishonest overnight. <Col N="790" /> I would not like to hear anybody say that and I do not think it is true.  I believe the people would pay if they were able to pay.</P>
    <P>Some time ago there was introduced a new system of credit notes and on these on a few occasions I commented adversely.  Some Deputies on the Government Benches said that this was the whip with which they beat some Blueshirt farmers throughout the country into paying their rates.  In reply to a question which I had down to-day I got information from the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  I asked for a table setting forth in each county the amount of credit notes not realised&mdash;not cashed by the people to whom they were given.  In other words, the people were not able to pay before the required day and they lost the value of these credit notes.  Who were those people who could not pay?  In the year 1932-'33, there was a sum of £26,000 for which the people were not able to get any value.  In 1933-'34, the sum was £16,000 and last year it was £21,121. Who lost that money?  The very poorest of the people.  That is the new system that has been brought in and I always maintain that it is a bad system.  I hold that the people are honest enough to pay any rates they owe without any inducement to make them do so.  This is the first time on which we have had these figures presented to us.  These moneys are not lost in the county councils but they are lost to the individual farmers because they are not able to pay their rates in time to get the benefit of the credit notes.  In the circumstances, I do not think there is any justification whatever for the Government in cutting down the agricultural grant.  In fact, in view of the situation that exists, in which the county councils and the local authorities generally find themselves with increased deficits&mdash;with additional deficits to provide for rates that have been uncollected and written off as uncollectable or irrecoverable&mdash;I think the Government should seriously consider increasing the agricultural grant instead of reducing it.  I submit that the Government is deserving of condemnation for the manner in which they have dealt with this matter.</P>

      <P>We have heard a good deal of information from Deputy Brennan with regard to the agricultural grant.  I must say it is very hard upon the farmers of the country to have this grant reduced by £100,000. That means that Laoighis and Offaly, which I represent, have lost between them roughly, 7d. in the £ in the rates. Instead of reducing the grant the Minister should have considered very seriously increasing it.  Deputies are aware of the position in which the farming community finds itself to-day. Live stock is still the main industry of the country, and it was at least so until the coming of the Fianna Fáil Party to power.  But now, as President de Valera said in this House, our cattle trade &ldquo;is gone and gone for ever,&rdquo; and he thanked God for it.  I hope the President did not mean these words when using them.  The live-stock trade of the country is still the principal industry, and its destruction is placing the farmers in a bad position. This was the industry which the farmers of the country understood well how to manage.  They knew all about the rearing, the treatment and care of cattle.  I am not a big farmer.  My holding is less than 100 acres.  I produce 20 cattle in the year and these 20 cattle under the present conditions mean a loss to me of £5 each or £100 entirely.  Still, with that loss, as a matter of fact, I have to pay land annuities.  The part of my land on which these 20 cattle are fed is about 30 acres.  It is not the very richest land like Meath or Kildare.  I am supposed to get the annuity paid on my land reduced by 50 per cent., but in comparison with the amount lost on those cattle the reduction in the annuity is very little.  I maintain that I have paid the annuities four or five times over each year since we started on this economic war.  In the matter of fat pigs, which I rear and breed, there are very large losses at present.  Previous to the coming into force of the Pigs and Bacon Act I was getting a paying price for the pigs I reared.  To-day I am advised to take 32/6 a cwt.  As a matter of fact, the Pigs and Bacon Act did not make any improvement in the prices of bacon and pigs.  The one thing it is doing is putting pig production <Col N="792" /> below the average.  This is going to be a Bill that will control the birth of pigs.  We were supposed to have a Slaughter Bill for bonhams, but it was not introduced.  The reason why this Bill is going to control the birth of pigs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The labouring man had as one of his means of livelihood the rearing of pigs.  That man has my sympathy at the present time.  His means are being taken from him and, in future, he need not bother much about buying bonhams at the fair.  I want now to refer to the coal-cattle pact.  I am not going to go too far, but I will say that the Government have done an unjust thing to the labouring classes.  The labouring man has to pay more for his coal than he had to pay before the pact came into existence.  Instead of being allowed to look after the cattle trade, we are told we should sow more beet and wheat and if we do so the farmer can live. I may tell the House and the Minister that without cattle you cannot grow either beet or wheat.  You must have farmyard manure as distinct from artificial manure before you can successfully grow more beet or wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister would be well advised to endeavour to teach the position when he could use some such words as these: &ldquo;Thanks be to God, we settled the economic war inside a week.&rdquo;  The sooner the Government does settle the economic war and allow the people to make some effort towards bringing back prosperity, the better.  You have the labouring people at the present time reduced to such circumstances that they can scarcely live.  I grow beet and I pay £1 a week to a labouring man.  That is all they are getting in the country; in many cases they are <Col N="793" /> paid less.  That type of man has to do laborious work.  The managers of the factorics&mdash;the Sugar Company&mdash;can afford to pay their labourers 50/- a week.  Is not the man on the farm more entitled to a better week's wages than the man in the sugar factory? Deputy Flinn said that both the farmer and the labourer are carrying this State on their backs.  I earnestly hope that the Government will make a determined effort soon to settle the economic war and give the farmers and the labourers a chance of living.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather disappointed, and I think the House generally is disappointed, that the two Ministers who ought to be primarily interested in this Vote, the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Agriculture, are absent.  There are many matters that could more readily be discussed and answered by either of those Ministers than by the Minister for Finance, able as he is in other matters.  This Vote means a reduction in the agricultural grant of about £100,000 at a time when, as the previous speaker said, the money is probably more needed than ever before in the history of the Dáil.  The county councils are nearly all in the position that they cannot meet their liabilities. Much of the work they should do is left undone.  Labourers are in many cases three, four, and even eight weeks unpaid because there is no provision to meet the payment of their wages. Within recent years over £700,000 has been withheld from the county councils because of the unpaid annuities, and there will be probably further additions to that amount in the coming February.  One does not know exactly what will be the position of the county councils this day 12 months if things go on as they have been going on for the last few months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It looks as if most of the useful work of the county councils will have to be suspended.  In my own county affairs are so bad that many of the labourers are two months unpaid.  They are men with families, and they have been working for two months without any wages.  It is an intolerable position. Most of the farmers of the county are unable to pay their rates punctually. I am sorry to say the position in my <Col N="794" /> county is probably worse than in other counties, because the amount of unpaid rates is very big and there does not seem to be any possibility of getting the money in in a hurry.  In the coming year the ratepayers will be faced with the necessity of meeting a higher rate than this year if the grant is not increased.  I do not want to get out of order by referring to the many topics one would like to discuss on this Vote and which, perhaps, have some relation to it.</P>
    <P>I cannot lay too much emphasis on the pitiable position of the ratepayers, who are mostly farmers, because of the economic war.  I will not enlarge on that subject, because it has been very fully discussed in this House on many occasions, and, I expect, will again be discussed.  Perhaps the oftener it is discussed the better, because it may have an effect on the Government and possibly induce them to settle the dispute. The whole policy of the Government, particularly in relation to this grant, is such that they seem to be working in a circle.  They have no defined policy on matters pertaining to agriculture.  Sometimes when we venture to allude to the distressed circumstances of various farmers we are met by the Minister for Agriculture in a not very good spirit; he is more aggressive than otherwise.  He is one of the Ministers who are working in a circle, and he reminds me forcibly of the bull that went so fast in a circle that it overtook itself.  The Minister is generally in that position.  He makes a rush in an endeavour to solve particular agricultural troubles, and the next thing is that we have a complete reversal of policy.</P>
    <P>We had a year ago a declaration&mdash; perhaps on this very Vote&mdash;that the position would be better in a short time.  Satisfactory arrangements, we were told, were to be made to give guaranteed prices to farmers for their fat cattle.  That hope was not well founded, and indeed before people had very much time to consider it the Minister ran away from his own proposal. Much the same thing occurred in other directions.  The lot of the farmers is made very much worse by the policy of chopping and changing adopted by the Minister for Agriculture. <Col N="795" /> I do not think it would serve any useful purpose to debate this matter at any great length.  Every Deputy opposite, as well as those on these benches, knows full well that the grant is insufficient at the present time. They know it would need very much more to put the majority of the county councils in a working position.  At any rate, this is not the time for reduction. We on this side of the House would appeal to the Minister, if appeals are any use, on this matter.  The Minister for Finance, I am sure, would be willing to help, but I suppose the exigencies of his office would compel him to deny us the relief we are looking for.  I hope some Deputy on the Government side will get up and either attack or defend this particular Vote.  All contributions to this debate should not be left to Opposition Deputies.  There are as many Deputies on the Government Benches interested in this subject as there are on this side. For their own sakes, and for the sake of their constituencies, I think it ought to be their duty either to attack or defend this Vote.  It would make the debate much more interesting if they did so.  I do not want to say any more except that this Vote is entirely insufficient and that the circumstances of the time call for a very much increased Vote.</P>

      <P>I agree that no good purpose can be served by going deeply into the causes that make this Vote inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister took up office under normal conditions.  He came into office on the promise of complete derating. He did not carry it out.  Some of us were not surprised at that.  But he had revenue producing machinery installed by his predecessors a few years before to produce over £1,000,000 to relieve agricultural land of rates in addition to the relief agricultural land already had prior to 1931-32.  Relief of agricultural land was got prior to 1931-32, and agriculturists were entitled to it to the extent of £500,000 by the tenure under which they held their land embodied in the Statute of 1898.  In 1924 or 1925 they got relief equivalent to double that <Col N="796" /> original relief; and that second relief they got was considered equitable. Because of the question of the burden of industrial tariffs there was a good case in equity for it.  In 1931-32 a case was made for full derating.  So convinced were the Fianna Fáil Party of the soundness of that case, that every member of the Fianna Fáil Party holding a portfolio to-day, assured the country, from various platforms, that on their return to power there would be full derating.  I suppose that had an effect upon the Party then in power, and they proposed in 1931-32 to give £750,000 extra relief.  The present Minister for Finance was eloquent in opposition to that £750,000 as entirely inadequate in 1931-32, when there was a clear flow of trade between this country and Great Britain, and when the industrial tariffs were about £2,000,000 less than they are to-day, which, of course, has put up the cost of non-agricultural buying in this country.  That £750,000 was to be provided by a fourpenny tax per gallon on petrol, and a halfpenny a pound on sugar, bringing in about £1,100,000 in the full working year.  Increased burdens have been placed upon agriculture owing to the economic war. I am not going into the why and the wherefore of the economic war. This Government has benefited over and above what their predecessors benefited to the extent of withholding payments to Great Britain less than half the annuities.  What are they doing with that extra money?  I do not want to follow Deputy Bennett in his wail that the local authorities of this country are bankrupt.  I know the position of the local authorities as well as any representative man outside the Minister and his Department, whose duty it is to know how they stand.  I think the Minister for Finance knows or ought to make it his business to know, what that position is.  I do not want to mention it here. It would not serve any useful purpose to mention it.  Neither will it serve any useful purpose to mention the writs sent to local authorities to get judgment mortgages upon farmers.  Is it not a terrible condition of affairs when such an expedient has to be adopted, <Col N="797" /> and when it is recognised that rates cannot be collected on big farms?  As chairman of a county council I gave instructions within the last month to list such farms for a finance meeting. When they came up at the finance meeting there was not a member of that Council but stood aghast at the names which appeared on that list&mdash;the names of men to whose premises we had sent the sheriff, a return of &ldquo;No goods&rdquo; being made.  We are face to face with taking those people to court, piling on costs, and registering judgment mortgages against their holdings.  Of course the reason that we have to do it is that they can sell their holdings at any time, and when the farms are transferred to the purchaser only two years' rates can be recovered from the new owner, and we lose all the rest.  I am speaking now of cases that I know.  I am speaking of constituents of the Minister.  We have this policy of reducing the agricultural grant, of reducing the market prices of agricultural produce, and even going further&mdash;spending our money in Continental countries for the last three years in trying to get markets where there are no markets. Last week we had the market in Italy shut down to us.  It is true that the best market for foodstuffs is in Italy.</P>

      <P>I know that, but agricultural rates will be paid out of the sale of agricultural products, and if the best market available for our produce is shut down to us, we will be in a worse position to pay our agricultural rates.  And I am not shouting &ldquo;Up the Republic.&rdquo;  Were it not for the general financial position of local authorities&mdash;I myself am a member of couple of important local authorities&mdash;I would go more fully into this.  There is just a danger that while a criticism of the position here would be good from the point of view of airing the matter in this House, taking the wider and more national view it might not be productive of as much as if less were said. <Col N="798" /> However, I take the decision of the electorate, and while I see in broad indelible letters that the Government have deceived the electorate, and that the Minister for Finance has a lot to answer for between his promises in County Dublin and his actions subsequently, yet I daresay the Minister will be able to brazen that out some day when the time comes again.  But the people who are suffering most voted for this thing, and there is nothing like giving a fellow a good dose of his own medicine.  Now they have to pay for it, and when the Minister for Finance comes back again to County Dublin to appeal to the electorate, I say &ldquo;good luck to him&rdquo; if he is able to get returned again by the people who returned him last time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to again direct the attention of the Minister to astonishing figures, and I do so because as a member of the Roscommon County Council I was struck by the fact that when we were called upon to make provision for the moneys which were withheld in respect of unpaid land annuities, the Council&mdash; although it consists of a majority of the Minister's own supporters&mdash;refused to do so, and in fact struck a rate that only partially covered the deficiency which had arisen as a result of the Minister's withholding a considerable portion of the agricultural grant in order to build up the land bond fund.  Now, under the Minister's present proposal, not only are we going to have a more substantial reduction from the agricultural grant in respect of the unpaid annuities, but we are going to have another £100,000 taken off it.  Surely the Minister must realise that he will drive every local authority in this country into bankruptcy, and as Deputy Belton has said&mdash;there is no use in blinking our eyes to the verdict of the electorate&mdash;a considerable number of the local authorities consist of Fianna Fáil supporters.  Every one of them is going to go into bankruptcy. Has the Minister taken the Minister for Local Government and Public Health into consultation on this matter, or has he simply arbitrarily decided that he cannot give more than <Col N="799" /> the sum now proposed to be given, and that they will have to get their £100,000 wherever they can?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rates, quite apart from the deductions from the agricultural grant, have increased by £469,000 since Fianna Fáil came into office.  That is the rate warrant for the country. Last year more than half a million in money was due by the local authorities, for which no provision was made at all, and that problem will have to be faced at the end of this financial year.  We have no reason to believe that as large a sum of money will not become due on top of that at the end of this financial year, so that you will have half a million due from last year; you will have half a million accruing due during this year; and you will have £100,000 deducted from the agricultural grant; so that the local authorities of this country will be £1,100,000 down.  If the Fianna Fáil local authorities adopt the same attitude this year as they did last year we will end up this financial year and start into a new one with £1,100,000 due by the local authorities, and no provision of any kind made to meet it.  I appreciate Deputy Belton's reluctance to use any alarmist language lest essential credit should be made more difficult, but at the same time it is folly to close our eyes to inevitable developments, particularly when, by taking measures now, we might avert the evils that will otherwise accrue.  This much is certain, that if £1,100,000 is due by the local authorities at the end of this year, and no provision is made for it, bankruptcy awaits every one of them. It is in the power of the Minister for Finance to co-operate with the local authorities in order to avoid that situation; one method is by restoring the agricultural grant to what it was before he started cheeseparing on it, and the other method is to open discussions with the Minister for Local Government and Public Health with a view to funding those arrears, and finding ways and means of preventing their arising in the future.  I appeal most strongly to the Minister to take this action, and start negotiations of <Col N="800" /> that kind before March is upon us, because if he does not, a very grave situation indeed will arise.  I understand, Sir, that you wish progress to be reported at 7 o'clock.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>There was one matter raised here with regard to legal aid for poor persons. It has been considered and it is not considered that it could suitably be dealt with in this Bill.  If the Government decided to do something along those lines, a separate Bill will be required.  It could not be included in this Bill.  The only other matter I wish to deal with is in respect of the objections raised here with regard to appeals.  The only thing I have to say is that I contend&mdash;and if the contrary can be shown, I should like to receive some evidence&mdash;that the overwhelming majority of the Bar and the Solicitors' profession, who have the interests of the public at heart, and their own interests, is in favour of the adoption of this system for the rehearing of appeals.

      <P>In many of the smaller cases in the Circuit Court, the instructions for the proceedings are given by poor and ignorant people, and are necessarily hurriedly taken, and there is no formal direction of proofs, with the result that it is only when the case has been heard that the true legal issues are discovered and the necessary evidence ascertained.  In many of these cases the only chance of ultimate justice being done is by a rehearing on appeal, and so far as the encouragement of perjury is concerned, the Committee are of opinion that there is much less chance of successful perjury where there is a rehearing of the case on appeal.</P>

      <P>The others you have mentioned deal with the postponement of the operation of the Bill until certain dates set out.  They are not all the same, nor are the arguments in favour or against them the same, but if any of them was passed, something in the nature of amendment No. 1 would be required, because Section 3 simply repeals certain enactments scheduled, and if those enactments are to be repealed there must be something to take their place.  They cannot be repealed unless there is something to take their place.  I suggest that amendment No. 1 should not be moved at this stage, but it will have to be resurrected in the event of any of the ones you have mentioned being passed, but the discussion had better proceed on the separate items. Amendment No. 27, for instance, is completely distinct from amendment No. 2, which sets out that:</P>
      <P>This part of the Act&mdash;</P>
      <P>that is, the part dealing with the Supreme Court and High Court&mdash;</P>

    <P>Amendment No. 27 is that the next part, the Circuit Court part, shall come into operation on a certain date, and the arguments for bringing into operation the part dealing with the High Court are entirely different from those to be urged in opposition to the date of operation of the section dealing with the Circuit Court.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4, before Section 4 but in Part II of the Bill to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>This Part of this Act shall come into operation on such day not earlier than the 1st day of October, 1938, as may be fixed therefor by an order of the Executive Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The part of the Act to which this amendment refers consists of the sections dealing with the Supreme Court and High Court.  The changes to be made in the Supreme Court and High Court amount to an increase in the number of judges of the Supreme Court, with the removal of certain jurisdictions at present held by the Chief Justice to some member or members of the High Court, together with certain matters pertaining to the Constitution of the Court of Criminal Appeal, two detailed sections dealing with patents and fishery by-laws and two matters as to remittal, one dealing with costs.  The big matter that is outstanding in Part II is the appointment of two new judges.  There is no necessity, if we leave the Circuit Court and Circuit Court appeals and new High Court circuit system out of consideration, why there should be two Supreme Court judges appointed.  I think there was evidence given by only two people before the Commission as to the necessity of appointing extra judges to the Supreme Court, leaving <Col N="804" /> out of consideration the question as to whether the increase in the Supreme Court would be necessitated by the establishment of the new High Court Circuit system.  Leaving that out, I think the Chief Justice himself, and possibly the President of the High Court, were the only people who thought the Supreme Court should be strengthened.  There is, therefore, no immediate urgency about that matter.</P>
    <P>The cost is going to be something fairly big, and it is a cost which was objected to by members of the present Government Party when they were sitting on this Commission.  They said that there should not be any increased expenditure in the courts, and they adverted to that with special reference to the Supreme Court, until the prosperity of the country warranted it and the urgency of the business of the courts made it necessary.  It cannot be said that there is any special urgency at the moment with regard to the business of the courts.  The High Court business has failed; it has gone down by one-third.</P>
    <P>The prosperity of the country certainly cannot be said to warrant any extra expenditure at the moment.  The amendment now being moved on behalf of Deputy Bennett states that it shall not come into operation until a date to be fixed by the Executive Council, but with the overriding consideration that that date cannot be earlier than the 1st of October, 1938. In other words, if we are to consider this in a sort of abstract way, and agree that there is some change necessary in the Supreme Court, we can, having recorded our views on that, postpone the operation of it until a date three years hence when the country may have had a chance of recovering some of its old time prosperity. An entirely different set of arguments are to be used on this matter than on the Supreme Court or even on the High Court system.  Different considerations will apply.  I can see no reason whatever warranting the introduction of the cost of two new judges to the Supreme Court.  It has never put up anything more than that the court needed strengthening, and that by analogy with other places the court in personnel was limited.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="805" /> There has been used a mathematical argument which I could not understand, a calculation worked out which would go to show that, in certain cases, you may actually have a person a victor in a case where the view is a counting of heads, that as between the Supreme Court and the High Court judges who may have heard the case there would have been a minority in favour of the victorious party and a majority against him.  This mathematical calculation is possible and may result whether the Supreme Court is composed of three or five judges.  If, for instance, something has been accepted by a bench of judges&mdash;three in number&mdash;in the High Court, and if that happens to go on appeal and is accepted at the moment by two of the Supreme Court judges, with one objector, it may be said that there is a complete majority in favour of the individual.  You can get that situation the other way.  If, say in a case of first instance, there happened to be two judges against a person who takes an action&mdash;two judges sitting together &mdash;and that that case is appealed to the Supreme Court and there is a majority decision there, you have three against that individual and two for.  Exactly the same result will follow as far as a majority is concerned if you have five in the Supreme Court.  I could never see what force there was in that argument. I do not know what argument is going to be used to say that at the moment there is a necessity to increase the personnel of the Supreme Court. At most two people gave evidence in favour of it and they were not urgent as to the date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill, so far as it can do, is to make an effort to implement the Report of the Joint Committee.  The Joint Committee did not state that there should be a Supreme Court of five, but it did definitely state that it should be greater than three.  The Chief Justice, I think, in his evidence mentioned five, and it is to implement that proposal that this section is in the Bill.  The Supreme Court has to be regarded now as the ultimate and final court of the country.  There is no appeal from it.</P>

      <P>On the basis that it is the final Court of Appeal I think it is the view now that there should be five judges.  It was certainly the view of the Chief Justice.  He was the responsible witness who gave evidence on the matter, and his views should be taken into consideration.  I do not see any point in postponing this except, as I understood, when it was introduced first, that it was an attempt by a sort of a side-wind to raise the whole question of the economic war. I think that was the object of the amendment when first put in by Deputy Bennett.  My view is that there is no point in the Deputy's suggestion that it should be postponed for three years.  If it is going to be done let it be done now.</P>

The Minister for Justice is asking a lot in asking us to accept this on the &ldquo;say so&rdquo; of the Chief Justice. It is up to the Minister to make a case for this, but so far as I know he has not made any case in regard to congestion. There is a good deal of delay, very undesirable delay, in giving judgments, but that I think arises rather from faults in the judiciary themselves than from any under-staffing of the bench.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>He forgets entirely one recommendation, that the judges of the Supreme Court should not be called upon to assist in the work of the High Court.  Deputy Costello said that in hardly any respect do the proposals of the Bill follow the recommendations of the Joint Committee. Only two people gave evidence in favour of strengthening the Supreme Court and both expressed themselves more definitely on this point than on strengthening the numbers in the Court: that the judges of the Supreme Court should not be called upon to assist in the work of the High Court.  The Minister tells us that there is not going to be a great deal of expense in this.  Whatever it is, it weighed on the mind of the present Parliamentary Secretary to the President and on the mind of Senator Comyn, both of whom were on that Committee.  One of them proposed, as an amendment to the report dealing with this:</P>
      <P>That the Committee are, however, convinced that the considerations which it is stated in evidence weighed against any recommendation by the Judiciary Committee in 1923 for an increase in membership of the Supreme Court are even more compelling to-day.  The Committee are of the opinion that there should be no increase in the cost of the Supreme Court until the increased prosperity of the country warrants it and until the volume of business in the superior courts urgently requires it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I would like to have some figures showing that from the decreased number of cases at present running through the High Courts there is greater urgency in regard to appeals taken to the Supreme Court, or at any rate something more than the cynical phrase that the country is better off now; that there is increased <Col N="808" /> prosperity in the country.  At any rate, Deputy Little, as he then was, and Senator Comyn continued:</P>
    <P>Further, they recommend that any changes made in the Supreme Court should be accompanied by a revision of salaries in the light of a comparative study of the salaries paid to judges of equal rank in other European countries, for instance, in France, where the scale of judicial salaries is much lower than in the Free State.</P>
    <P>That, of course, is rubbish with regard to the two eminent members of the Committee who signed it.  I do not think that they themselves made any comparative study of the salaries and other emoluments that are paid.  At any rate, these two people were impelled by the then situation in the country and reported that there was no great urgency in the case of the Supreme Court and recommended definitely against any increase in the Supreme Court.  I do not know whether the Minister has thought out this question of salaries.  The Minister, although a member of the legal profession like his colleague the Attorney-General, did not scruple to use the flaring poster that was issued during the General Election.  In the forefront of this poster was the amount of judicial salaries.  Both of the gentlemen opposite used that in the elections.  Despite the fact that their colleagues, I suppose with Party support, recommended against any increase in the Supreme Court, we are now told it cannot even be postponed until 1938.</P>

      <P>I gathered from the Deputy that only one or two witnesses gave views in support of the strengthening of the Supreme Court. Let us look at the evidence of Mr. Price, K.C., on page 288 of the Minutes of Evidence, question 4295. The Chairman asked Mr. Price: &ldquo;Have you any recommendation to make regarding the constitution or work of the Supreme Court,&rdquo; and the answer was:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We did not, as a Bar Council, formulate any, but I know the opinion of the Bar on the subject <Col N="809" /> and I know my own opinion and can sive it for what it is worth.  It is this: The Supreme Court is right enough for trying matters of, say, practice and matters of importance, perhaps, to litigants themselves, but not matters of very general and universal importance in the Free State.  It is too small a court when you come to a big question of constitutional importance or very big important actions.  It is too small a court as a Supreme Court of the country and we think that there should be some power taken either to increase its number permanently, or to enable the Chief Justice to assemble a larger court to hear the more important cases.&rdquo;</P>

I do not mean a judge selected by Statute, but the Chief Justice could find out some other High Court judge who is not involved in the particular case; he might bring him in also so as to constitute a court of at least five or six judges.  That would mean having five <Col N="810" /> judges of the Supreme Court, three of them sitting regularly, and the other two being available for other work&mdash;something of that kind.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>He offers it, not only as his own judgment, but the opinion of the Bar.  Here is the practical suggestion made by him, which is almost exactly what is in the Bill:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;That would mean having five judges of the Supreme Court, three of them sitting regularly and the other two being available for other work&mdash;something of that kind.  I think in the important cases there ought to be a larger court, however you may arrive at it.  The Supreme <Col N="811" /> Court, being the Supreme Court of Appeal in this country, it sometimes happens that a previous decision of theirs, perhaps ten years ago, on more careful review of the Statutes is not right; they come to the conclusion that they were wrong.  They ought to have the power of reconsidering that decision, there being no further appeal from them.  In the old days what was done was this: The Supreme Court or the corresponding court consisted of three judges.  They could bring in as many as six or seven justices, the Chief Justice, the Chief Baron, the Master of the Rolls, and sometimes they had the ex-Lord Chancellor, making the total up to about seven.  They sat as a kind of Appeal Court on their previous decisions, which they revised in order to prevent the Statutes being wrongly construed.  There is no such thing now; they are absolutely bound by their decision no matter how wrong it is.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let us turn to the evidence of the President of the High Court, not so much for his evidence, because I think he also takes the stand that he had not considered the matter, but for the statement contained in Senator Brown's question to him.  At question 5104, page 350, Senator Brown says to the President of the High Court:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;You would perhaps be able to give us your view of whether it would be desirable to increase the number of permanent judges in the Supreme Court, in view of the fact that it is for all practical purposes the only final court.  We have had that question already before us here, and the suggestion is that the number ought to be increased either to five or four, because it is important to have the majority of judges in favour of the ultimate decision, which might not be the case if there was an appeal from three judges to two.  What would be your views on that matter?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The answer of the President of the High Court was:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If the Supreme Court is to be a final court, there is a great deal to be said for making it as strong <Col N="812" /> as possible.  Speaking for myself and for my colleagues of the High Court, I do not think that there is at present any feeling of dissatisfaction with the Supreme Court as constituted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senator Brown then said: &ldquo;There has been no suggestion of that,&rdquo; and the President of the High Court said: &ldquo;I can quite appreciate that the final Court of Appeal for the Free State ought to be a very strong one.&rdquo;  Then the questions went on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Chairman: Would you suggest four or five judges at present?&mdash; Well I do not know that I have given very much consideration to the question of the number.</P>
    <P>Senator Brown: Would it help you if we gave you this assistance as to the number of judges in other Dominions?  The Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal in Canada has the Chief Justice and five other judges, that is six judges.  In South Africa the Supreme Court has three judges.  Those are the only precedents we have had?&mdash;My own personal view&mdash;and it is only my own view, because I have not considered this matter and I have not discussed it at all with any of my colleagues &mdash; would be rather in favour of a Supreme Court of five than four judges.  Five would be more satisfactory than four.  I am aware that some of the judges are of opinion that the advantage of four was that if the judges were equally divided, two and two, that then the decision of the judges below would stand.  I do not think that that is a satisfactory way.  I think the decision come to by the Supreme Court in deciding a point at issue should be the decision of the majority of judges in that court. That would be my own view.</P>
    <P>Would it be your view that if the number of judges in the Supreme Court were increased to five they should be confined to the Supreme Court&mdash;that is, that the two extra judges should be confined to the work of the Supreme Court and not be available for work in the High Court?&mdash;I am very anxious <Col N="813" /> that the number of judges in the High Court should be increased. I would prefer that the judges in the Supreme Court were confined to the work of the Supreme Court.  I do not think having judges in the Supreme Court who are also judges in the High Court would be very satisfactory.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And so the evidence goes on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that that is so.  Mr. Binchy, K.C., gave evidence at question 5032, page 345.  The question asked was: &ldquo;How many extra judges would you say would be required in the High Court?&rdquo; and the answer was: &ldquo;At least two.&rdquo; Then, the question was: &ldquo;And you think it desirable that the number in the Supreme Court should be increased to five?&rdquo; The answer was: &ldquo;That five should be available if required, not five for every case.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but does the Deputy suggest that the scheme which is provided in the Bill, of increasing the Supreme Court to five, could be carried out, with the number of judges available in the High Court, by drawing on them for two judges in important cases?  My opinion definitely is that that would not work, even if you were to continue the present system.  You have the evidence of the President of the High Court, who all through his evidence stressed the need for extra judges in the High Court to discharge the business there, even if the present system were to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>One judge.  He asked for one additional judge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="814" />
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good, one judge.  Well, is it possible to argue that, if the President of the High Court asked for at least one judge&mdash;I think Mr. Binchy suggested two, but let us take the President's suggestion and he suggests that, as the business stood in the High Court at the time of his evidence, it would require an extra judge merely in order to carry out the work efficiently and keep it up to date&mdash;is it possible to argue&mdash;or does the Deputy suggest, that, if the two judges of the High Court were to be made available to sit in the Supreme Court from time to time, that would not require a further addition of two judges in the High Court?  I cannot understand how they can say that in practice it would be possible to carry out a scheme for increasing the Supreme Court by taking two judges from the High Court, and not increasing the strength of the High Court by at least two, if not three.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, on the question of the strength of the Supreme Court, as the President said at the time, there is no complaint about the Supreme Court as it stands at the moment. There is the feeling, however, which Mr. Price there expressed in his evidence, that a Supreme Court of five would be a much more satisfactory and desirable tribunal, particularly in view of the fact that, without any doubt whatsoever, it is now the final Court of Appeal.  I think, too, that most members of the Bar and most judges would agree, that, in theory, the Supreme Court ought to number five.  I follow Deputy McGilligan's argument that the argument which was used in support of that was based on the possibility at the present moment of having a majority of judges overruled by two Supreme Court judges: that an analogous danger exists even if you increase the number to five, and in that event you may have three overruling four.  That, possibly, is an argument for making a quorum of four judges.  Well, it is not quite easy to see how that difficulty can be got over, but as to the general opinion of those who were interested in having a strong court system and a system <Col N="815" /> which would appeal to everybody and give satisfaction, I think there are no two opinions on the question as to whether it would be better to have a Supreme Court of five than one of three.</P>
    <P>Some of the Deputies, I think, accept the position, apart from the arguments they advanced, that there is no urgent necessity to do it now or that there are reasons why it should be postponed.  They do say that if the Supreme Court is to consist of five, the judges thereof should not be assigned to the High Court. The President of the High Court gives that as his opinion very strongly.  I have the greatest respect for the President of the High Court.  Apart altogether from that, I quite agree that it is desirable, and that it would be desirable, that the Supreme Court should be a Supreme Court and nothing else.  I think that, on the Second Reading, I accepted that position but pointed out that if we are to carry out the scheme of the Bill, with regard to the strengthening of the High Court and the provision of sufficient judges to hear the civil Bill appeals, unless the judges of the Supreme Court are to be available to hear Circuit Appeals the system would not work.  Deputy Costello says: &ldquo;Why not frankly meet that position and add two judges to the Supreme Court; have a Supreme Court of five and have the High Court strengthened by the addition of two judges?&rdquo; While, in theory, it is desirable to have a Supreme Court aloof and away from any business of such a nature, I do not at all feel that the arguments which were advanced here, against allowing Supreme Court judges to be assigned to ordinary High Court work or to go around the country, have as much weight as apparently, the speakers who have advanced these arguments consider.  I do not quite see how it disables a judge from being an excellent member of the Supreme Court that he should have experience of trying common-law actions in the High Court, or dealing with chancery work in the High Court, or dealing with Civil Bill Appeals.  I cannot <Col N="816" /> agree that there is so much force in the argument that we are not entitled to endeavour to make this experiment and see if, by allowing the Supreme Court to consist of three or of live, according to the opinion of the Chief Justice as to whether the cases are of such importance as to require a court of five, and allowing the judges of the Supreme Court to be assigned to do ordinary High Court work and to go out around the country &mdash; I cannot see how their ability or capacity to deal with such Supreme Court work as they are called on to do will be affected.  While it may be desirable in theory, I imagine that, in practice, it will be found that a judge, who has from time to time to do High Court work or to go around the country and hear Civil Bill Appeals, will in no wise lose the respect of the practitioners who appear before him, and will in no way have lost any of that acuteness of mind which he requires for the hearing of the cases which come before him in the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello stated on the Second Reading that we were taking a middle course.  We are taking a middle course because we believe that the present system of appeals should be changed and that there should be a return to the old system of civil bills re-hearing.  In order that that should be workable, we must have more judges available for the hearing of these appeals than would be available if we were only to draw upon the present personnel of the High Court. We also considered that the arguments in favour of strengthening the Supreme Court are sufficiently strong to justify a strengthening of that court.</P>
    <P>We seek in the Bill to achieve two objects&mdash;one, to provide enough judges to enable the change to the old system of hearing appeals to be carried out and at the same time to provide that in the ordinary way there should be five judges in the Supreme Court. How it will work out is left in the hands of the Chief Justice.  Presumably, how it will work out is that when the President of the High Court finds it necessary for him to call upon the Supreme Court to assist in discharging business <Col N="817" /> of the High Court or, when the Supreme Court judges are required to go out on circuit, the least important cases will be heard in the High Court and the more important cases will be reserved for the full Supreme Court.  If I may prophesy or venture my opinion as to how it will work out, I believe that it will work out with the goodwill of everybody concerned. The ideal was to have a position in which we would have two extra High Court judges and two Supreme Court judges additional. That was I will not say impossible, but from the point of view of cost it is considered undesirable to go that far. The middle course will in the practical working out justify itself and it will give the results which we hope from it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather glad to hear the latter part of the arguments of the Attorney-General.  What he has said is a complete departure from what he started with.  At one time we were hit over the heads with the report of the Joint Committee. It was held over our heads and there was an attempt made to stun us with it.  I agree with what the Attorney-General now says.  We should have freedom in these matters.  I am all for that.  All I am saying just now is&mdash;why cannot we look at the evidence and see what certain eminent people saw and see whether that evidence is in accordance with the facts as we know them?  We should not be paralysed or stunned by the report of the Joint Committee.  That is more especially the case when we now find that the Attorney-General gets away from the report.  What is the report?  It reported in favour of a Supreme Court consisting not of three members.  That is the extreme of the recommendations of the Joint Committee&mdash;that it should not consist of three members.  The Deputy's colleagues on the Committee reported against an increase in the Supreme Court on the grounds that the finances of the country could not stand it and that there was no urgency in the business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Looking back at it one can feel, considering what the economic position of the country was then and what the economic facts staring us in the face now are, how much stronger are the arguments to-day against an increase than they were then.  The members of the Fianna Fáil Party on the Committee at that time argued that the appointment of those additional judges was undesirable on the ground that the finances of the country did hot warrant their appointment.  Yet these are the same Deputies who are now coming up here to vote for this additional expenditure. Surely the Government are closing their eyes to the facts of the situation.  The only condition then contemplated before the Committee was as to whether the judges should be four or five.  There was one thing at any rate which the Committee did advert to and that was that there should be no taking away of the Supreme Court judges to do High Court work.  I do not say that is a specific recommendation.  That was brought in and pushed forward by one eminent witness.  There was a recognition of the case for an increase in the Supreme Court with, at the same time the Fianna Fáil Deputies on the Committee crying out &ldquo;we cannot afford it.&rdquo;  One point made before the Committee was: &ldquo;Do not let your Supreme Court judges do any High Court work.&rdquo;  I was wrong in saying that only two witnesses gave any evidence on this point.  The only witness who appeared and went in to give evidence in a representative way in favour of the enlargement was the Chief Justice. The President of the High Court said that none of his colleagues thought that the Supreme Court was not to be cavilled at in any way.  They were Satisfied with its personnel.  It was only after a bit of leading by the members of the Committee that the President of the High Court could be got even to discuss whether or not there should be an enlargement.  And the most he said was this: &ldquo;If you are going to enlarge it, enlarge it to five, not four.&rdquo;  There was the question <Col N="819" /> raised of a divided judgment and the idea was that if the court was divided evenly the view that prevailed in the lower court, would then prevail in the Supreme Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were three other persons who mentioned strongly the question of the High Court.  As far as I could discover from a detailed leading of the recommendations and the evidence, Mr. Price referred to it, so did Mr. Moloney and Mr. Binchy.  These were the only ones outside the Chief Justice and the President.  The only one of the lot who advanced arguments of his own without being led to do so in cross-examination was the Chief Justice.  He said that he always had the idea that there should be a Supreme Court of four or five and that he was originally overruled on the grounds of economy.  You will find from that, that though it is considered a light matter now to increase the Supreme Court by two judges, in 1923-4-5 and onwards it was considered rather an important matter on the grounds of economy.  The Chief Justice, when he was Attorney-General, had some strong views on this matter, but he found himself overruled and gave in.  Perhaps, though that had an Analogy, he did not pursue it very far, but it is clear that the Chief Justice's mind ran to an increase in the Supreme Court.  Why he wanted that is another matter.  The President of the High Court was asked his view and he said that he was satisfied with the Supreme Court as it was, and in reply to a question he said: &ldquo;Well, make it five rather than four,&rdquo; and he added, &ldquo;Do not let your Supreme Court judges do any High Court work.&rdquo;  Mr. Price said he was not there for the Bar Council in that matter, but he gave his own view.  For what he called the ordinary routine of cases, he thought the court of three was sufficient, but in an odd constitutional or commercial case he would like to see the court enlarged.  How did he propose to enlarge it?  By calling in two High Court judges.  Mr. Moloney said he agreed with Mr. Price.  There was an argument based on the analogy I have talked about, and I do not think it <Col N="820" /> should count for very much.  The other person was Mr. Binchy, who thought there was a feeling that it would be better if the Supreme Court was increased in number.  There is the entire evidence as well as the recommendations.</P>
    <P>That is the first point&mdash;strengthen the court.  Are we to add to the numerical strength?  The second point is how are we to get the added strength?  The Chief Justice accepted a proposal and it was this, have a Supreme Court of three, but take power to call in in association with the Supreme Court the President of the High Court.  Then there was the scheme of bringing up from the High Court for a special occasion a judge of the High Court.  I do not think the President of the High Court gave any evidence on that point.  He objected to Supreme Court judges doing High Court work.  He did not say he objected to High Court judges doing Supreme Court work on occasions.  Mr. Price and Mr. Moloney thought that was the way to meet it and Mr. Binchy had no proposal on that matter.  You either appoint extra Supreme Court judges and say: &ldquo;You will do High Court work when the Chief Justice likes you to,&rdquo; or you can say: &ldquo;Leave it at three ordinarily and we recognise the court may need to be enlarged.&rdquo; Increase the power you now have in regard to the President of the High Court and take power to call in extra people from the High Court.  That can be done without expense.  Mr. Price said it would be a very infrequent occasion when it would arise.  That is a suggestion I will make in a series of amendments later.  You have one distinctive thing, the strength of the court, and there was nothing very definite other than from the Chief Justice in favour of an increase.</P>
    <P>I regard the argument of the Privy Council as not of any great weight. Anybody can see that the cases that went to the Privy Council, or in regard to which an attempt was made to bring them there, were not of such number or importance that their disappearance adds an extra burden to the Supreme Court.  The Privy Council was never an effective court of appeal here.  It <Col N="821" /> was stamped on from the very beginning and it never operated.  The Supreme Court from the start was and must be regarded by the people as the final court of appeal for litigants. There is only one person strongly in favour of an increase in the numbers and that person, the Chief Justice, was equally strong that Supreme Court judges should not be sent to the High Court.  I think that view is to be found expressed by a great many other people although it only arose incidentally.  Phrases did come in, but you did get definitely that viewpoint which the Attorney-General says he objects to.</P>

      <P>I am against the change in the system of appeals.  I do not think it will work for the good of the people.  I do not think, with the decrease in the business that is showing, that there is going to be such stress upon the judges of the High Court.  If the business remains at its present level, I do not see why they <Col N="822" /> could not do the odd cases in which they will be likely to be called into the Supreme Court while doing any other duties that may be put on them.  Let us assume extra business by reason of the appeals system being changed.  It may mean the addition of one or two judges to the High Court bench.  You will then have a new number in the High Court different from the present number.  Why cannot some of that new number be called in to do Supreme Court work, but left definitely and clearly as High Court Judges?  The Bill says we want an increase in the High Court because of the change in the Circuit Court system and therefore we will appoint Supreme Court judges. It is not logical, but that is the scheme in the Bill.  We want an increase in the High Court and the way we will get the new personnel is we will appoint two to the Supreme Court.  Is not that, in fact, what the Bill is? That is clearly the Bill.</P>

They are going to do the extra work thrown on the High Court because of the new system of appeals. That is against the recommendations of the Committee.  The recommendations were that if you want extra High Court judges for extra High Court work, appoint them.  If you have an extra personnel or only the present personnel in the High Court you can draw on it to do the odd cases in the <Col N="823" /> Supreme Court that will require more than three judges.

      <P>The Attorney-General read the statements of about four people.  The report refers to the evidence of two of the witnesses to whom the Attorney-General referred. The Committee point out that efficient as the Court of Appeal is, they do not think it ought to consist of only three members.  You have to go to the evidence to find out what else there was there, and I suppose I have said that <i>ad nauseam.</i>  As regards the increase of the Supreme Court, there is no great necessity for it.  There is a strong view expressed right through the evidence, do not let Supreme Court judges do High Court work.  I do not know why that was so strongly held.</P>

      <P>I look upon this amendment from the point of view of the ordinary man in the street; and the obvious fact is that litigation is declining progressively, and that only for sweepstakes disputes, and actions of a political nature, and murder cases, its decline would be more apparent. That is an obvious fact.  Now with regard to strengthening the Supreme Court, it is my honest opinion, no matter what anybody else may think, that three judges if efficient could decide the ordinary cases that come before them as well, or as badly, as 33 judges.  Mr. Justice Bridlegoose, of whom Deputies have heard, was a most satisfactory judge and, Sancho Panza, who never heard of Coke's Institutes or Blackstone's Commentaries, or the great Roman jurist Ulpian, was, at any rate, a good judge.  There is, in my humble opinion, at the present time, no necessity for increasing the number of judges in this country.  All I say, and I say it as briefly as I can, is, that the present financial condition of Ireland, and the present decrease in legal business does not justify this indecent haste in trying to appoint new judges, who are not in my humble opinion required in the present circumstances.</P>

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
    <P>(1)  So much of Section 5 of the Principal Act as enacts that the Supreme Court shall consist of three judges is hereby repealed, and in lieu thereof it is hereby enacted that the Supreme Court shall consist of five judges, of whom the president shall be the Chief Justice.</P>
    <P>(2)  The provisions of Part I of the Principal Act in relation to the Supreme Court and the judges thereof (including the provisions of Section 5 thereof in relation to the respective titles of the Chief Justice and of each of the other judges) shall, save as expressly repealed by this section, continue to apply and have effect notwithstanding the increase made by this section in the number of the said judges.</P>
    <P>(3)  Notwithstanding the increase made by this section in the number of the judges of the Supreme Court, any appeal to or other matter cognisable <Col N="827" /> by the Supreme Court may be heard and determined by such number, not less than three nor more than five, of the judges of the Supreme Court (including judges who are, by virtue of Section 6 or Section 7 of the Principal Act, additional judges of the Supreme Court) as the Chief Justice or, in his absence, the senior ordinary judge of the Supreme Court for the time being available shall determine in respect of each such appeal or other matter.</P>
    <P>(4)  Section 2 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1928 (No. 15 of 1928), is hereby amended by the deletion of all words from the words &ldquo;or in the event&rdquo; where they secondly occur to the end of the section and the substitution therefor of the words &ldquo;who is for the time being available,&rdquo; and the said section shall be construed and have effect accordingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4, Section 4, to add at the end of sub-section (1) the words &ldquo;and two shall be such judges as are, by virtue of Section 6 or Section 7 of the Principal Act, additional judges of the Supreme Court.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is an attempt to move along the lines of the evidence that was given, and to allow the scheme which was outlined by Mr. Price, amongst others, to take effect.  In other words, instead of having a Supreme Court with a nominal strength of three, as it is in the Principal Act, there would be a Supreme Court with a nominal strength of five. Under the Principal Act, when the number was three, the President of the High Court was <i>ex officio</i> an additional judge of the Supreme Court.  Section 7 of the Principal Act says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whenever owing to the illness of a judge of the Supreme Court or for any other unavoidable cause, the number of judges of the Supreme Court requisite for the transaction of the business of that court is not available, the Chief Justice may request any ordinary judge or judges of the High Court to sit on the hearing of any appeal in the Supreme Court, and any judge so requested shall sit on the hearing of such appeal and be <Col N="828" /> an additional judge of the Supreme Court for such appeal.</P>
    <P>I want to achieve that while establishing a Supreme Court with a nominal five as its number, it would still be the same three as before, the President of the High Court <i>ex officio</i> raising it at times to four, and with the Chief Justice given power to call on two judges of the High Court from time to time so that he could make the number of the court up to the requisite five when he considers that five are necessary. That is definitely moving away from the scheme that is in the Bill, in this detail, that it is trying to prevent Supreme Court judges as such being appointed and sent out to do High Court work.  It is allowing of the Supreme Court being strengthened by the calling in from time to time of two judges from the High Court.  It does not say whether the High Court is to be enlarged in its numbers or not.  That is left for another amendment.  If there are people who think that the Supreme Court should in certain cases be enlarged to five, but should ordinarily continue with the number three, then this would enable the Chief Justice, whenever he thought the number ought to be five, to call on the High Court to supply him with two of its personnel, and thus he would make up his full number.  It is definitely in accordance with the view-point which was expressed by certain witnesses.  It is better surely to have power to draw on the High Court instead of increasing the number in the Supreme Court for all cases.  It is better to have power to call on the High Court in the odd case, seeing it was the odd case of constitutional or commercial importance that was emphasised in the evidence.</P>

      <P>Again referring to the evidence of Mr. Price, I see here that he was in favour of sending <Col N="829" /> Supreme Court judges out on circuit to do High Court work.  The Deputy seems to suggest that his view as to how the strengthening of the Supreme Court should be carried out was by more members.  I do not think that is so.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me read first.  Question 4314 and the following questions are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;You suggested that if the mode of appeal were altered Supreme Court judges might go on circuit?&mdash;Yes, some of them.</P>
      <P>And try appeals?&mdash;Yes.</P>
      <P>That would be better than letting the High Court judges go out and making the Supreme Court judges do the absent judges' work in the High Court?&mdash;The idea is that the High Court should break up and spread over the country and the Bar would follow.  There should be very little High Court work done in Dublin during that time.  Under a system by which the High Court should break up and go out to the country you can get a good strong Bar.  They will follow the judges. Experienced men will appear for two or three guineas&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is, apparently, the bit of evidence to which the Deputy referred a moment ago, as coming from an experienced member of the Bar.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;whereas if you want the same man in the Circuit Court at the moment you will have to give him 25 gunieas, because he cannot come away from Dublin under a smaller fee.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if that is quite the question I meant to refer to, but it is clear from Mr. Price's answers that he was in favour of Supreme Court judges going out on circuit.  In one answer, on which I thought I could lay my hands, he said that he could not see why Supreme Court judges should not go out on circuit.  The Deputy's amendment I interpret as being an attempt to meet any requirement there is for strengthening the Supreme Court by utilising the sections <Col N="830" /> which at present exist, extending them and allowing the Supreme Court to be strengthened from time to time by taking on judges from the High Court.  I have already given my views on that and explained that, although I do not quite appreciate the reasoning for it, I agree that it is more desirable that the High Court should be drawn on to strengthen the Supreme Court than that the Supreme Court should be drawn on to do High Court work.  In the Bill, as I have said over and over again, we attempt to achieve two objects (1) to strengthen the Supreme Court and (2) to enable the system of circuit appeals, which is the main object of the Bill, to work satisfactorily.  It is a compromise solution and the only way in which we will be able to see who is right, on the question of how it should be worked, is by seeing how it does work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I suggest leaving it over until 1938 when we could see it even as a scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We can look at it as a scheme and view it in the light of the part of the Circuit Court that might then be operating with the Supreme Court part held over.  The Attorney-General wanted to refer me to what Mr. Price said.  I should like to read to him the bit I wanted to refer him to.  It is:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It is too small a court as a Supreme Court of the country and we think that there should be some power taken either to increase its number permanently or to enable the Chief Justice to assemble a larger court to hear the more important cases.  For instance, if there were the President of the High Court, if it were possible to bring him in in addition to the three judges and some other selected judge.  I do not mean a judge selected by statute, but the Chief Justice could find out some other High Court judge who is not involved in the particular case; he <Col N="831" /> might bring him in also so as to constitute a court of at least five or six judges.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the point that my amendment was really going on and that was because Mr. Price went in there as sneaking for the Bar Council.  Of course, he did definitely say, and I prefaced my remarks previously with this, that &ldquo;as a Bar Council we did not formulate any opinion regarding the constitution of the Supreme Court&rdquo;&mdash;but then the Attorney-General threw Mr. Price as a makeweight into the scales in his previous argument, that, at any rate, he had his opinion.  There is his opinion&mdash; let the court be constituted by getting in the President of the High Court and the Chief Justice selecting some other High Court judge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>Question 4274 is the question I was referring to:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If the Supreme Court were increased to five, there is no reason why three could not hear unimportant cases while the circuits were out and the other two go on circuit.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;If the Supreme Court were increased to five&rdquo;&mdash;that is, increased permanently.  But then, surely, he comes back to it that his suggestion is: &ldquo;Do not increase the Supreme Court to five except in this <i>ad hoc</i> way; increase it by letting the Chief Justice call in the President of the High Court and some other selected judge from time to time.&rdquo;  Mr. Price has a contribution to offer later on.  He says he would rather have members of the Supreme Court, if the Supreme Court were added to permanently, sent out on circuit than to send out High Court judges on circuit and letting these new adherents of the Supreme Court do High Court work in the absence of the High Court judges. The only people appearing before the Committee and giving evidence on the point were the four or five I have mentioned. They were all against Supreme Court people doing High Court work and none wanted a permanently increased Supreme Court excepting only the Chief Justice.  Some did want <Col N="832" /> it increased from time to time.  The suggestion was that that increase from time to time could be done in the way I have suggested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 4, section 4 (3), line 46, to delete the word &ldquo;three&rdquo; and substitute therefor the word &ldquo;four.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of the amendment is to give effect to the recommendation of the Chief Justice in the evidence he gave before the Joint Committee.  It is quite clear from that evidence that the Chief Justice was in favour of a Supreme Court of five permanent members and that the quorum of that court should be four.  I stated on the Second Reading of the Bill that I was entirely in favour of a Supreme Court of five members,, with a quorum of four.  Any other recommendation in connection with that court, to my mind, is not merely impractical but entirely objectionable. The purpose of the amendment is to insure as far as possible that the object of the Chief Justice will be carried out, to have a Supreme Court of five with a quorum of four.</P>
      <P>I have listened to-night to the Attorney-General stating that the proposals in this Bill were a compromise solution&mdash;I think that was the expression he used&mdash;for the purpose of achieving two objects.  In my view, that so-called compromise solution achieves neither object and is wholly objectionable in principle.  I can see nothing to be said for a Supreme Court, consisting nominally of five members, three of whom would only be more or less permanent members and the other two engaged on High Court and Assize Court work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the work of a High Court judge and the work of a judge hearing civil bill appeals from a Circuit judge is entirely and fundamentally different from the functions and work of the Supreme Court.  The nature of the work is different and the mentality that has to be brought to bear on the problems that come before it are entirely different.  I am not in the least impressed by any evidence brought <Col N="833" /> either before the Joint Committee or repeated here from practitioners of the old school with reference to what happened in the case of the old civil bill appeals, or in reference to the fact that the old members of the Court of Appeal in Ireland used, in fact, to travel on Assize.  Most of the evidence of that kind is based merely on conservative and professional feeling and very largely on personal experience. If you happen to be on one circuit you have one view, and if on another circuit you have another view.  If you meet one set of judges at one assizes, and another set of judges at another assizes, that may change your view. Evidence of that kind is entirely without any great weight at all.</P>
    <P>You have to look at this from the point of view of principle, and you start with the admitted basic principle that there ought to be in this court a Supreme Court consisting of five permanent members.  Any departure from that principle must be wrong.  I understand it is admitted by the Attorney-General that that is a principle which he himself would like to hold, but as far as I can gather either the Department of Justice or the Department of Finance or probably both together came and said: &ldquo;Not on your life; you have too many judges already; the judges have too soft a time; they are too highly paid and we will not allow that at all.&rdquo;  In order to try and get the assistance of both the Department of Justice and the Department of Finance, this mongrel provision is introduced into the Bill.  It is brought in as a compromise solution.  In my opinion it is not a solution.  It is a menace to the administration of justice and will bring disrepute on the administration of justice.  It bears on its face a so-called solution which, as far as I could gather from the observations the Attorney-General made on the Second Reading of the Bill and on this stage of it, he does not approve of in his heart.  It bears on its face a solution put forward by people who have no experience of the practice or the administration of the law.  That will bring into disrepute the administration of justice&mdash;the spectacle of two judges who will be Supreme Court judges only <Col N="834" /> in name and salary, but High Court judges in fact.  They will be doing, for the most part, High Court work.  It is admitted that there is work for additional judges in the High Court. It is clear that if the new system of civil bill appeals and of the travelling judges is brought into operation there must be additional judges in the High Court.  If this House is so foolish as to allow this compromise solution to go through, the result must be that these two Supreme Court judges will spend 99 per cent. of their time doing High Court work either in Dublin or in the country.</P>
    <P>I cannot see any justification whatever for that.  I think it would be far better for the Government to face up to the problem and say: &ldquo;We are of opinion that five Supreme Court judges are necessary and that we want two additional judges,&rdquo; but it is quite clear that apparently the Government were not able to drag from the Department of Finance or the Department of Justice, from both or either, support for the proposals which they wished to advance of permanent High Court judges or a permanent Supreme Court of five judges in it, as well as of the new system of rehearing.  Therefore, in order to get something across they bring in these mongrel provisions which are entirely unjustifiable.  They can be justified only on what the Attorney-General has said, that they wanted to get two things and could not get them, so they tried to get half of one and half of the other.  The result, in my opinion, will be that they will get neither.  They will also bring into disrepute the administration of justice and the Supreme Court itself.  We have heard a lot about strengthening the Supreme Court.  I think that is a rather inappropriate expression.  The country, as a whole, has been satisfied with the Supreme Court which has commanded the respect and admiration of the country.  As was pointed out by the Joint Committee:</P>
    <P>They were convinced that the peace and credit of the country will depend more than anything else on the impartial and efficient administration of the law by courts which <Col N="835" /> will have the confidence and respect of the people and of the legal profession.</P>
    <P>Because they were so convinced they made the recommendation that there should be more than three permanent members of the Supreme Court.  Now, if you have a Supreme Court of the mongrel character such as is put forward at the present time, you will have the position that there will be three members of the Supreme Court there more or less permanently.  There will be two members of the Supreme Court very seldom there, and other colleagues of theirs in the High Court perhaps will be sitting in the Supreme Court hearing appeals from them.  The thing reduces itself to a rather ludicrous state of affairs.  I think that even at this time the Government ought to face the fact that in principle they ought to have a Supreme Court with five judges or leave the thing as it is.  They ought not to try and put across this so-called compromise solution combining two objects merely for the purpose of bringing in the new system of rehearing &mdash; that appears to be at the back of it&mdash;and in order to get back to the old system of Civil Bill Appeals for which there is really no public demand, as distinct from the partial demand from members of both branches of the legal profession, they go through the elaborate farce of having two Supreme Court judges who will be paid the salaries of Supreme Court judges and will be acting for 99 per cent. of their time as High Court judges.  The thing is indefensible in principle and will, as I have said, bring the administration of justice into disrepute.</P>

      <P>The Chief Justice had the view that in his own time only should there be a Supreme Court of four as a minimum, but that the regulation made by the State should be that the Supreme Court should never consist of less than four, that is if it is to be enlarged.  Under the Minister's proposal it never can be less than three, and can be such as the Chief Justice will determine.  Why not put three out altogether.  The Minister attempts to answer Deputy Costello's amendment by saying that the Chief Justice thinks that four ought to be the quorum.  The phrase in the Bill is three or such number as the Chief Justice shall determine. Therefore, the Chief Justice will make it four.  Why does the Minister put in three?</P>

      <P>Why put in three? If we think that the Supreme Court ought to consist of four judges let us say so.  That is for the hearing of ordinary cases.  Let us give one extra &mdash;ordinary to call on as well as having the President of the High Court.  If we put in four the Supreme Court can never meet unless there are four.  Why not make that the provision?  Why should we not say so legislatively?  Let <Col N="837" /> us say that the Chief Justice, as a witness, impressed us with the necessity for four judges in the Supreme Court. There may be other Chief Justices to come, and they may not have the same view.  Why should we say that the number of judges in the Supreme Court, above the minimum, should be whatever the Chief Justice of the day says it ought to be.  Or, if we are going to say that, let us take out &ldquo;three&rdquo; and leave the matter entirely to his discretion.  The Minister says that he will leave it to his discretion, provided the number be not less than three. Deputy Costello says that the number should be not less than four.  The Chief Justice adverted to this question and stated that, if he got his way and the Supreme Court was increased in number, it would never sit with less than four judges.  That is what the proposal is in the amendment.</P>

      <P>This amendment bears out and follows the recommendation of the Joint Committee.  The members who constituted the Joint Committee recommended that the court should consist of more than three judges.  I say the minimum should be four and that, in my view, the number should be five.  There may be illness or something of that kind.  If there were a cast-iron rule that in every case the Supreme Court should consist of five judges, in the event of illness of one judge, the court might be held up. Therefore, there must be a certain elasticity in the matter.  That is provided for in my amendment.  The quorum should be four but, ordinarily, there should be five judges.</P>

      <P>So I thought. Although the Deputy attributes to me a belief in my heart in his arguments and complete disbelief in the practicability <Col N="838" /> of the scheme of this Bill, what I made clear was that, while I am prepared to accept the view that it would he ideal to have a Supreme Court of five judges and provide sufficient High Court judges to carry out the new appeal system, I yielded, just as readily as anybody else concerned in the preparation of this Bill to the argument of economy.  Deputies have been hammering us with arguments for economy and, yet, they say that, if we are to give practical effect to the new proposals, we ought to demand that the Minister for Finance and his officials should not stand in our way, but should do the thing decently.  I think it was the President of the High Court who was quoted this evening as saying that on the original Judiciary Committee, in 1923, he was anxious for a Supreme Court of five judges, but yielded to the argument of economy. I yielded to the argument of economy, and I am sure that that is what the Minister yielded to also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already made clear that I do not at all agree with the strictures passed by Deputy Costello on this arrangement.  He has used very strong language.  He has described this as a &ldquo;mongrel court.&rdquo;  He has gone the length of saying that it will bring justice into disrepute, that it is a menace to justice, and that two judges will spend 99 per cent. of their time in the country.  I think that Deputy Costello is carried away by his own oratory, and I doubt if his belief is as deeply seated as his words would suggest. Section 5 lays down the occasions on which the Supreme Court is to be drawn upon in aid of the High Court. Section 5 states that whenever, owing to the illness of a judge of the High Court or for any other reason, the full number of the judges of that court is not available for the transaction of the business or when, for any other reasons, it is expedient to increase temporarily the number of judges available for the purposes of the High Court, the Chief Justice may request any ordinary judge of the Supreme Court to sit in the High Court as an additional judge thereof. I do not agree with Deputy Costello that, during the ordinary term, the President of the High Court will be <Col N="839" /> constrained to apply to the Supreme Court for the loan of judges to carry on the business of his court.  No statistics that I have examined would justify the Deputy in stating that for 99 per cent. of the period, or anything like it, the full quota of five judges will not be available.  The provision is designed to enable the Supreme Court to be called upon if the necessity should arise.  As the Minister has pointed out, it is left to the Chief Justice to say whether, in particular cases, a court of three judges would be sufficient to hear the appeal.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot from Deputies opposite as to the absence of any complaint against, the present Supreme Court of three judges.  I cannot appreciate the force of the argument that four is such a wonderful improvement on three.  Its only virtue is that in case of a division of opinion, the judgment in the court below would stand.  If the type of case which the Chief Justice will decide can be properly dealt with by three judges, I suggest that a tribunal of three judges will be found just as effective as a tribunal of four.  Again, in theory, it would be desirable to say that, even if it is expedient to allow the Supreme Court to be drawn upon, at no time should more than one judge be taken away from the Supreme Court.  But, again, the object is to create a sufficient number of judges to carry out the objects which the Minister and the Government have in view&mdash;to add to the strength of the Supreme Court and enable the appeal system to work and, at the same time, to enable the pressure of business in the High Court to be relieved, from time to time, by the taking of a judge from the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>I really think the fears of Deputy Costello, for whose views I have the greatest respect, are not justified. Neither is there any menace to justice in these proposals.  In theory I suppose the work judges in the Supreme Court are called upon to do calls for a different attitude of mind, and a different approach than that called for in judges doing civil bill appeals and ordinary High Court work.  At the <Col N="840" /> same time I doubt if the Supreme Court attitude of mind will be in any way an evil influence on any judge called upon to do High Court work. On the other hand I doubt if any one who is practising at the Bar will think that the fact that a High Court judge has been used to doing the ordinary work of the High Courts, disables him from sitting as a judge of the Supreme Court from time to time.  At the present moment you have a Court of Criminal Appeal which, for all practical purposes, is the final Court of Appeal in relation to criminal matters.  There has been only one instance where a case was taken from the Court of Criminal Appeal to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>My argument was based upon this, that we have had, since the Courts of Justice Act came into operation, a Court of Criminal Appeal, consisting of two High Court judges and one Supreme Court judge, and I think it will be admitted that in dealing with criminal appeals they hold just as serious and as important a position, and ought to have the attitude of mind of Supreme Court judges in approaching the hearing of appeals. Yet for ten years that has worked satisfactorily.  I heard no serious complaint that High Court judges were disabled or unfitted from acting as judges in the Court of Criminal Appeal by reason of their being familiar with the work in the Central Criminal Court.  In fact, probably quite the contrary is the case.  I should say that just as strong a case should be made in opposition to what Deputy Costello said for his point of view.  Probably the truth lies midway between the two.  There has been no serious evidence given to support the fears which have been hinted at, that there is anything in the proposal we <Col N="841" /> put forward which will tend towards bringing justice into disrepute, or in any way to lower the prestige of the courts.  It is hardly necessary for me to say that there is no doubt whatever that the courts set up in this country since 1924 have inspired confidence in the public.  It is almost universally agreed that they have won respect for the administration of justice beyond that which was attained by any other courts.  I do not think it is reasonable for Deputy Costello to suggest that the Minister is being driven by the officials, or by the Minister for Finance in this matter; and that we accepted this compromise arrangement under pressure of officials.  There is not the slightest basis for that suggestion.  The Minister has to be just as much alive to considerations of economy as the Minister for Finance.  If my attitude of mind was that depicted by Deputy Costello I would certainly be ashamed to stand behind this Bill.  I would much rather have no change in the system than to bring about the state of things he fears.  I would much rather allow the present system continue than support any change if I did not think the provisions of the Bill were workable, and would not lower the respect of the public for those charged with the administration of justice.  I said that over and over again.  I think the scheme will be workable and will not be found to contain the evils suggested by the Opposition.</P>

      <P>I want to direct the attention of the Attorney-General to one aspect of the Bill which, perhaps, he overlooked.  In a further part of this Bill there is a proposal to take away from the Chief Justice a certain portion of his jurisdiction, and the reason that is proposed to be done, as I understand it, is that it is not considered right that there should be an appeal from the Chief Justice to the Supreme Court.  There is inconsistency on the part of the Government in that proposal.  While they say that there should not be an appeal from one member of the Supreme Court to his colleagues in this Bill they provide and contemplate the contingency, that there should be an appeal from four <Col N="842" /> members of the Supreme Court to their colleagues.  I should like to hear the Attorney-General on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I said nothing of the sort.  I said there should be a system by which judges should be called in name but be paid salaries of Supreme Court judges; whereas the fact is they are High Court judges.  The Chief Justice is a member of the High Court for the purpose of confirming in him additional jurisdiction, nothing else. I agree with the suggestion of the Attorney-General that there is nothing to be said for a Supreme Court of four. My amendment to put down four in this part of the Bill is merely to provide for the contingency which I think would not happen very frequently, of one member of the court being absent. It is not put forward in justification of the view that there ought to be four members of the Supreme Court habitually sitting there.  I think there should be five habitually sitting there, and in order that there should be flexibility, and not a cast-iron arrangement, the amendment is that there should be a quorum of four.  It is also put down for the purpose of endeavouring to hamper the other portion of the Bill which prescribes that Supreme Court judges shall go on circuit.  The Attorney-General stated that I used strong language and that I was carried away by oratory.  Whatever carried me away it was not oratory.  I feel very strongly on the subject of these proposals.  I think they are entirely wrong in principle, and ought to be abandoned by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene only for a moment to say that I support this motion.  I am not so sure that a select committee is a satisfactory method of achieving the kind of inquiry which Deputy Belton asks.  I do not, in fact, believe that a committee of this House would be a suitable body to make the investigations necessary.  I think that if the Government were to appoint a highly qualified commission of real experts to examine into the question, their report should be of considerable value.  It seems to me beyond doubt that an unfair proportion of the evils resulting from the economic war are being borne by one section of the community, that is to say, the agricultural interest&mdash;not only the farmers but the miserably-paid agricultural labourers&mdash;and that while the economic war has injured many other sections of the community there are some who have not had to bear any of the burdens resulting from it at all. Therefore, while I do question whether a select committee of this House would elicit anything very valuable in the course of their inquiry, I support Deputy Belton's motion because on general principles I think far more effort should be made, than has been made up to the present, to distribute the burdens of the economic war fairly between the different classes of the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interfere in this special subject to any great extent.  When first I saw this motion on the Order Paper, I wondered if there was even in the mind of Deputy Belton, a proper realisation of the part the agriculturist plays in the life of the community.  He proposes to have a committee set up to inquire into the incidence of the special duties collected by the British Government on Saorstát agricultural produce and to report on ways and means whereby the burden of the economic war will be equitably borne by all sections of the community. I should have thought that if I had made a remark to the effect that the agriculturist in this country supports the rest of the community, Deputy Belton would have concurred with me. That being the fact, and it is an undeniable fact, I do not see how it is possible to distribute more equitably the burden of the economic war.  You may transfer it in a sense to certain sections but in the end the whole stress of the economic war is going to fall upon the person upon whom we all rest in the community and that is, the agriculturist.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacDermot has said with some reason that there might be adaptations made here and there.  So there might but it is very unlikely that these adaptations would be made by any committee the Government would set up.  The Government have set their hands to this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I interrupt the Deputy for one moment?  I suggest to him to consider this: how very much more unbearable the lot of the agricultural community is made by their seeing that there are sections of the nation, even small sections, that are not suffering either at all or on anything like the same scale as they are suffering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that in the end it is true to say that we shall all suffer if the agricultural community has to suffer.  That is undeniable and this can also be pointed to.  This year we are taxing everybody, the tenement dweller as well as everybody else, on his tea, sugar, bread and butter.  That is what the Government <Col N="845" /> has reduced the country to.  I think it is a still more hopeless thing when it is thought that we are taxing these people and that that taxation is of no avail because if that taxation was being used with any hope of success to get a better economy in the country, then you might say: &ldquo;The farmers are suffering undoubtedly but there are better times ahead.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>A specially unfortunate situation in the country at the moment is this: In other countries there have been schemes for mortgaging certain assets of the community.  It has been done on a vast scale in America.  The country has been burdened with debt; there is present spending and future paying. There is a complete mortgaging of anything in the way of American assets and property.  There are immense assets there however while the money raised by mortgage is being spent to pay a couple of hundred million pounds here and there.  When that is pushed through the financial veins of the community, it does cause some flutter of life.  Here we are mortgaging steadily and not merely mortgaging steadily anything we have in the way of property, but we are taxing, and taxing in a savage way.  Notwithstanding that, there is no great benefit to the community from the spending power that is derived from the mortgages we are making.  A vast amount of taxation is being levied and the situation at the moment in the country is this, that if it were not for a certain amount of building, particularly building of labourers' cottages&mdash;building that is not being paid for&mdash;this community would have collapsed two years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a certain transfer of wealth going on but there is no new production. There is a huge amount of taxation imposed and a certain amount spent in an attempt to mask the situation and to prevent the clear facts obtruding.  The worst of it is that even though money is being levied in enormous sums relative to the burden-bearing capacity of the people, there is nothing that can be pointed to, outside building operations that is going on in any way to the benefit of the community.  We are wasting every resource we have.  Supposing this <Col N="846" /> committee met, I think that undoubtedly when they start to inquire as to where fall the taxes levied by the British, they must say primarily and immediately, blatantly for everybody to see, that they fall on agricultural goods.  They can start downwards and try to find reactions of the first impact and they will find that everybody in the country is suffering, the town dweller as well as the country dweller.</P>

      <P>The people who are getting subsidies are getting a certain amount of money they do not deserve, but the impact of this whole business is firstly on the agricultural producers, on their goods.  Let the committee, if that committee be set up, go a step further and look at the reactions of that.  They will find it reacting adversely on the town-dweller.  They will find a further reaction on the whole finances of the State, leading to further taxation and impoverishment of the community.  I said I would not mind, nobody would mind&mdash;there is scope always for a policy of tightening the belt if a lean period has to be encountered&mdash;if there was some hope for the future.  There is a Fianna Fáil policy, in relation to one article of produce in the country, which they describe as &ldquo;getting rid of the surplus.&rdquo; They are not alone getting rid of the surplus in that production, but they are getting rid of the surplus money of the people.  The surplus production which they had for sale with which to get in capital for the purchase of other goods is going.  We started with the slaughter of calves and that is being continued by various other slaughterings.  When it is not slaughtering by animals being killed, <Col N="847" /> it is a worse type of slaughtering&mdash; people being crushed out of their employment.</P>
      <P>There is very little good in a community such as this in having folk driven out of what is the natural economic structure of the country and made go into something else which they can only go into if they can be subsidised from the State, because subsidies must be raised from the people, from the agricultural community in the end.  If they are not in production, and in better production, they will not be able to pay part of these subsidies, let alone the increased volume that must be brought about if these schemes are to come to anything. You have this complete upset in the whole country at present.  The natural production, the production in which people made money, has been destroyed by Government bungling.  The attempt to meet that has led to worse bungling, the destruction of the surplus.  No country in the world would face up to that cold-bloodedly and inaugurate Bills for the destruction of wealth and hope to get that blessed as sanity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Belton will find that the farmer obtrudes everywhere, even in the urban areas.  Although there are people in the tenements to-day who can complain that their bread, butter, sugar, tea, and everything they get in for their homes, are all bearing an extra whack of taxation, they are also finding that the money they are getting &mdash;any of them who are getting wages &mdash;has not a purchasing power of more than three-fourths of what it was about five years ago.  They are supposed to bear an increased burden in their own little homes.  Then those of them who are lucky enough to get work are having to pay to put on extra stamps on cards to provide, not work that was promised, but merely doles, for the people who, being unemployed, had increased to such numbers that the Government had to mask the growth of their numbers and ease the situation developing by this unemployment assistance money.  In addition to that, we have a Government bringing in a piece of legislation whereby the Minister <Col N="848" /> for Industry and Commerce is allowed to deem certain people to be employed at a particular part of the year, although he must know well that thousands of people whom he put off the unemployment roll at a particular time, because he deemed there was work for them, were walking around idle and hungry until the period when his gentle mind thought fit to deem them employed was passed.</P>
    <P>There is one thing only that has developed in this country in the way of work, and that is house building. If it were not for house building, the numbers of the unemployed, that members of the Government have to apologise for in every speech which they make, would have been doubled. We are getting people into some sort of temporary occupation by a phenomenal spurt in building, and we are not paying for the building.  It is another of these mortgaging devices. We have a Labourers Bill brought in so that the full effect likely to come in a year or two from the building operations of the present day will fall, not upon the people who inaugurated the schemes&mdash;the Government are not going to raise taxation to pay for these things&mdash;but upon the labourers.  If agriculture perishes in this country, nobody can live.  Agriculture is being killed at present by the special duties. Agriculture, in some of its production, is being killed by the direct measures of the Government to slaughter off certain types of productions.  Where can the burden be shifted to?  The old problem of the man lifting himself from the ground by hauling at his own boots is simple compared with the problem which is to be set to this committee.</P>
    <P>If the burden cannot be borne by the best producers we bad, how can it be shifted to anybody else when everybody else depends upon these primary producers? I think there is considerable public agitation and annoyance at the amount of money that people who are just chancing it in certain ways in the country are getting&mdash;people, who are intervening between the producers and the subsidy granted by the Government&mdash;there is a certain growing irritation because, at times, with the connivance <Col N="849" /> of the Government, middlemen are getting subsidies that were intended for producers.  Even supposing you gathered all these subsidies, and skimmed off what is going to people for whom they were never intended when this House voted certain sums of money, what amount of money do you get?  It is a small fraction of the amount that is being wasted by reason of the impact of these duties on agricultural products.</P>
    <P>I suppose it will be regarded as almost playing lightly with this subject to remind Ministers of what they told us previously about the agricultural products of this country.  The Minister for Finance was one of the loudest in shouting that the British would hot dare to put any tax upon agricultural goods coming out of this country; they wanted our goods so badly.  The Minister for Finance was one of the men who repeated, even at a time when the folly of the remark struck every Minister except himself, that if the British did put a tax on our goods there were other Countries which would develop enthusiasm for what we produced.  There were these equivalent markets, the foreign markets, that we were to get elsewhere than in Great Britain.  Those two hopes, at any rate, have been falsified. Yet, those were the hopes Ministers had when they entered into this economic war.  When we had delegates in London in June, 1932, and the news came through, despite all that the Minister for Finance boasted, that these penal duties were to be enforced, the Minister even then stood up in this House and said that if Great Britain did attempt this we had a weapon in our hands far more powerful than Britain had in hers, because the things we send to Great Britain, Great Britain could not do without; but the things that were of much more value, according in the Minister, that we purchased from Great Britain, Great Britain could not sell to anybody else and we could get them elsewhere. That was another of the delusions that brought about the economic war.</P>
    <P>Great Britain hit us, and hit us knowingly, at the point where, to a <Col N="850" /> certain extent, we were weakest.  They struck at the roots because the roots of this country are in agriculture. One thing has been exemplified to the British Government that, up to the time the Fianna Fáil Government came into office, had been hidden from them, and that was our weakness in relation to them.  That is what has been exposed, and that is what the fatuity of Deputies, like Deputy Corry, has made plain.</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows, being on the inside of things, that at the time of the Sinn Féin movement here it was to a great extent a bluff. As far as it was a military effort, it was an immense bluff, and it worked. Apparently they were blind just to what were the resources here in a particular type of strength and the resources of the civilian population to hold out.  At any rate, our material resources are now displayed to them. We had these catch cries of the Minister that we could get markets elsewhere; that Great Britain must buy; that we could cut off British supplies and would have Great Britain on her knees in no time.  That has been going on for two or three years, and Deputy Moore must have had his eyes opened, and in a very unwelcome way, at the same time that the British eyes are opened, possibly, to things they did hot know before.  Whether they knew before or not, however, we have made a demonstration to the world&mdash; I should not say &ldquo;we,&rdquo; but the Fianna Fáil Government has made a demonstration to the world of what exactly our strength is.</P>

      <P>The farmers do not speak; they only groan.  I heard a remark made some time ago that might please Deputy Moore if he saw the Tattoo in the autumn.  It was to the effect that when all of Irish military history was being displayed there was one episode missing, and that was that they might have paraded at least two dozen farmers as representing <Col N="851" /> the last war in Ireland.  Does Deputy Moore deny that the farmers are fighting that war?  Who are fighting it?  Is it not the farmers?</P>

      <P>&ldquo;And delighted to be fighting it,&rdquo; Deputy Moore says. Has the Deputy, in his constituency, found that delight overwhelming him? When he goes out to meet these farmers are they pressing around him with delight and thanking him for what the Minister for Finance has brought on them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy says that they do not press around him. Does the Deputy even give them an opportunity to get near him?  But there is the type of mind to which Deputy Belton's motion is supposed to appeal, and Deputy Moore says that the farmers are delighted with the way things are going.  Was a farmer delighted at seeing an animal, produced in his area of the country, killed because he would get 10/- in his hand instead of having it grow and the 10/- increased to something else?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>He is not as materialistic as that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I see.  So, it is not materialism.  It is something spiritual, apparently.  The Deputy's idea, then, is that the farmers of this country are gleefully bearing what the Deputy must recognise is a burden because they are not overwhelmed with materialism but are thinking of some spiritual benefit they may be able to get hereafter.  There is a half-way house between bell and heaven, and it is purgatory.  Perhaps the Deputy means that the farmers are there at the moment, but is there a course upward or downward?  At any rate, is I was saying, I do not see that there is any use in appealing to a House that can receive comments like Deputy Moore's.  I do not think <Col N="852" /> there is any use in asking them to set up a committee to consider the incidence of these duties and to see how the burdens can be more equitably spread over all sections of the community, because Deputy Moore must feel&mdash;I am sure his constituents are not only spiritually inclined on the farmers' side &mdash; that there are others to bear the burden, and all he requires is to go and tell some of the others that they are not bearing enough of the burden and, probably, in a mood of high spiritual exaltation, they will then clamour to have the burden removed from the farmers to them.  This kind of thing is equal to the ridiculous nonsense that we heard previously about the British not putting tariffs on our goods, and that if they did try to put tariffs on our goods we had a stronger weapon in our hands than England could wield. Whether it is material or spiritual, the fact remains that the country has been sustaining itself by these spiritual aids for three years.  The people may be forgiven if they are beginning to ask when will it end and when will they get some benefit or recompense for all the sufferings they are going through.  It is well to see that the mood has changed somewhat.  It is well to see, even from Deputy Moore, that the mood has changed.  I remember the time when, if Deputy Moore had even breathed a hint of a belief that the farming community were suffering, his colleague, Deputy Corry, would rage at him for daring to suggest such a thing.  I am not sure whether or not he will even yet rage.  But Deputy Moore evidently now admits that there are sufferings by the farmers.</P>

      <P>The Deputy admits that that is so.  Well, that is to the good.  Even that much is all to the good, because two or three years ago Deputy Moore would have countered that suggestion.  Seeing that they are suffering, and that it is admitted, I should like to see a committee established, not so much to see how the burden can be borne, but how long it can be borne and whether or <Col N="853" /> not we are at the cracking point.  We may kill off calves and we are slaughtering animals, and the Minister brought in a Bill, and passed it as an Act, which gave him power to slow down pig production in the country and, apparently, he is going to slow it down.  The only things we are going to produce in this country, evidently, are the things we cannot produce economically, something the community cannot pay for, and the capacity of the community for paying anything is going down.</P>

      <P>He has not said that.  He said that there are no figures from which comparisons could be drawn of that, but he used to revel in comparisons.  That is the other side of the question, but, on the question of bankruptcy, does Deputy Moore think that if bankruptcy comes it is always immediately revealed when it has occurred?  Does he not know that when men are on the down grade there can be various devices for hiding it that they can get a certain spending power and can even appear to have affluence And case when they are within shouting distance of bankruptcy?  Supposing there is any man who has despaired of making good and who has a little property saved from good times, and supposing, instead of using that in an effectively economic way, trying to make two or three shillings out of one and trying to make his one produce several more&mdash;supposing he gives up that effort and says: &ldquo;I am for the rocks and I am going cheerfully; it cannot be helped now, so I am going to meet it cheerfully,&rdquo; and he decides to have a grand riotous period of five or six months, according to the resources he has, while he is spending his capital; if anybody said to Deputy Moore that that man was going into bankruptcy, Deputy Moore could say that he was not; Deputy Moore could say: &ldquo;Look at what he is spending, he cannot be near bankruptcy&rdquo;; but the day of bankruptcy nevertheless is near for that man.</P>

There is nothing that has occupied even the farmers and their sons except the building of those <Col N="855" /> labourers' cottages, the hectic pursuit of which has characterised the country in the last two or three years.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I made that remark. The thing explains itself.  If the Government spent £3,000,000 more than they are spending at the moment they might get a bigger return in Galway than they got at the recent by-election. But would the country be any nearer to economic salvation if you spend money and are careless of the future? I will talk to the Deputy on the results of the local elections any time he likes, when it is relevant.  Let me assume that the results of the local elections were up to my expectations&mdash;and I do not admit it.  But the Deputy must remember the dole money, the free beef, the free milk, even the 10/- for the calf skin, and all these things. That 10/- for the calf skin was money in advance that many a man was glad to get rather than to have that animal growing up and yielding him a big sum at some future date.  But that man's necessity may make him glad of the 10/-.  It is the same with the man on the dole, the man on the free beef, and the man on free milk.  All that may have an effect when we speak of the future of the community.</P>

Has it not been from these occupations that many farmers and their sons are making a living and not from farming at the moment?  How many would be making their living from the new type of farming were it not for the subsidies? How long are these subsidies to be paid?  Out of what are they to be paid?  Is it out of taxation?  Is it out of the exhaustion of the reserves of the country they are to be paid? These are the things that matter. Deputy Moore tells us there is so much occupation in this country that there is not a man unemployed in Blessington. Men are living in such a way that they have all spoken out loudly at elections, but why did the Deputy assist in taxing their butter, their tea, their sugar, their bread, and their other necessities this year?  Why had that to be done?  Why was it that taxation did not yield the same as before? What was the necessity for having to attack the necessities of the people? It was carefully and truly phrased in the Budget that they were to get after the things that the people must eat or drink, and thus they could not avoid paying this money to the Government.</P>

      <P>For instance, taking so much money off the unemployed and giving it to the widows and orphans.  Surely, if everybody is so much bettor off, if incomes are better and people employed who were previously unemployed, the revenue from <Col N="857" /> taxation ought to be increasing instead of showing the deplorable drop that so saddened the Minister if not the Deputy.  I do not know that these burdens of the economic war could more equitably be distributed.  There is an old fable about putting more weight on the back of a man who is riding a very patient ass, forgetting all the while that it is not the man's strength that is being taxed in the end but the beast of burden on which he is riding.  It may be that the urban population may be able to bear an increased burden, but they are all riding on the backs of the agriculturists and they are the people on whom the strain is to tell first.</P>

I do not see how we are to get much forwarder with a scheme like this, except that if the community likes, that committee can sit down and put their definition properly and if they get the figures paraded to them they would see that in the end the agriculturist would have to bear it and bear it always so long as there was this attack upon us by penal duties.  They might justify the impact at the first blow by putting in their heads but the rebound would come to the agriculturist. They may deride him as a beast of burden and they may treat him lightly as an uncomplaining or a complaining ass; but if that beast of burden goes there will be no ride for any of us.  It is not by paying subventions and subsidies&mdash;rung in the end from that very man&mdash;that you are going to make good this situation.  I would vote for that committee if I thought it would inquire into this matter and if I thought by that that it could be driven into the heads of the people that in reality there is no distinction between the different sections of the community&mdash;that they are <Col N="858" /> all welded together.  The urban community depends completely upon the agriculturist.  If that fact were driven home by the committee then that committee might do some good.

That was the natural type of production that was followed here for ten years by the Party opposite when they put 100,000 acres of land of this country back into grass instead of having it in tillage.  The very men working on that land were thrown out into the roadside and left unemployed. That was the only type of production in this country which in the last year of the Cumann na nGaedheal régime&mdash;1931&mdash;resulted in sending one and a half times as much agricultural produce into Great Britain as we sent in 1928 and getting £13,000,000 for it.  That is the natural type of production, and apparently we were to be the asses and John Bull <Col N="859" /> was to do the riding with the help of the people opposite.  We were told of labourers being crushed out of employment by the growing of beet and wheat instead of the breeding of bullocks.

      <P>Yes, if the subsidy is needed to give him a fair price, just as you subsidised the booty and the waterproofs.  We are told that people are driven out of employment by producing 52,000 acres of beet.  The suggestion is that you would have far more employment if you were to rear bullocks instead of growing wheat or beet.  I have noticed an enormous change within the last four months in the attitude of the farming population towards the Government.</P>

      <P>I can assure Deputy Dillon that when I want to learn manners I will not go to him, because I would be going to a very bad school. Deputy McGilligan said we had shown our weakness to the British Government. He apparently closed his eyes to the speeches made by members of his Party at election times when they actually asked the British to put a tariff on our cattle.  In case the British would forget anything, they were advised by Deputies on the opposite benches as to the penal measures they could bring into operation against the agricultural community. Apparently they were put in here for the purpose of advising Britain how she should conduct her war against us.  Deputy Blythe, now Senator Blythe, was then advising Britain what she should do, that they should extract £1,500,000 from all people before they would talk of negotiations.  That was suggested by Senator Blythe and Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney. I see very little use in setting up this committee, because Deputy Belton knows as well as I do, or any sane man in the country, that I can get a committee to report in favour of or against anything I like.</P>

      <P>I can produce any amount of proof if you only give me time.  We had another farmer to-day, Deputy McMenamin, telling us that we had ruined the pig trade.  I will bring another witness into the box on that matter&mdash;Mr. Cussen, released from Arbour Hill, having paid £60 after having done his duty as a patriot.  He said, as reported in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> last Monday:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It may be taken for granted that if the Pigs Marketing Board was not functioning at the present time, the price of pigs would be several shillings lower per cwt. than it is, and farmers would suffer a cumulative loss of several thousands of pounds in the period from the 1st October, when the factors of supply and demand were far removed from each other.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I will give my opinion. We have Deputies like Deputy McGilligan and Deputy McMenamin talking about farming and shaking their heads.  We have had a lot of talk about the bankruptcy of the country. Senator Jameson, speaking in the Seanad on the 6th November, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The credit of the Free State is good, and a 4 per cent loan, guaranteed by the Free State Government, ought to be a first-class security.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He went further and said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Looking at the amount of money for which the Free State has pledged itself in the loans it has issued, we have not at all transgressed the bounds of what would be called our solvency.  Our loans are not heavy when judged by the capacity of the people to pay interest and sinking fund.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>We were told that the country would be bankrupt eight months after the economic war had started.  That was the statement of Deputy Hogan, ex-Minister for Agriculture. A great many months have passed since then and, according to Deputy Jameson, we are better off than when we started.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then, again, look at the housing policy of the Government.  The Government's housing policy is breaking the backs of Deputies opposite. The fact that houses are being built for the ordinary agricultural labourer is enough to bring Deputy McGilligan up on his hind legs and Deputy Mulcahy with him.  They are shocked at the idea that the Fianna Fáil Party is building houses for the ordinary working people that their own Party neglected since 1922.  These are the facts that are killing them as far as I can make out.  I have a reply to a question which was asked by Deputy Norton on the 20th March, 1935, which shows that there was paid out for export bounties and subsidies the sum of £2,894,000 in 1934, and that in the years 1933 and 1934 the sum of £2,071,558 was paid out of levies collected under the Dairy Produce Act, 1932.  Let Deputy Belton count that up and put it against the £4,000,000, and let him count in addition the value of the half annuities, and the value of the market for wheat and beet, let him count all these up and put them against the £4,000,000 and he will see that the farmers of the country are on the right side of the balance sheet at any rate.  I am prepared frankly to admit that farmers for the 12 months of 1932 were hard hit; but now they have changed their farming methods.  They have taken into their employment men who previously had been looking over the fence at the bullocks grazing, and they put them to the plough.  I do not think there is a farmer in the County Cork who would change his position to-day for what it was in 1932.  I admit there are a certain amount of old lads who have made up <Col N="864" /> their minds that no good can come from the present Government.  Deputy Kent knows that and I know it.  We used to meet these so-called old republicans. These are the lads you can never convert no matter what you do. These old lads are there yet, and they will always be there.  They are people that will never be converted.  I never waste time any longer with that particular type.  They are not worth wasting time on.  There is another class that I do not like.  I do not like Deputies coming in here moaning and groaning about the condition of the farmers and the bankruptcy of the country.  When there is any attempt made to economise in any shape or form these are the very men who say you must not take even 2 per cent. off the Civil Service.</P>

      <P>I will give Deputy Kent his chance.  If Deputies here examine the Bills brought before them and study them they could see where here and there the loyal fraternity of the country are getting slices out of them. Let them examine Section 50 of the Courts of Justice Bill and there they will see some pensions that are to be increased.  They will be far better engaged in that study than bringing in motions for the appointment of committees that will do no good.  Let them study these things and pay a little attention to them.  Honestly I say the attitude of some Deputies here is irritating. I honestly feel irritated when I see lawyers standing up talking about the farmers, and when I see farmers' representatives closing their eyes and voting for Bills for the benefit of these particular lawyers themselves.  These are the boys that will skim the milk off.  I am going to vote against this motion because honestly I can see no good in it.  My opinion is that it is brought in here to give an opportunity of talking about the economic war.  It was brought in for nothing else in the world but for that reason alone.  Deputy Kent was probably walked into it with my friend Deputy Belton, who was then a member of the Party over there.</P>

      <P>You are heartily welcome. I assure Deputy Belton there is nothing I enjoy so much as listening to him. That is the position, so far as I can see, with regard to all this.  I can see that the speech made here by Deputy McGilligan was a speech about everything except that particular committee. He did not want to bother with that committee at all.  From my experience &mdash;speaking as a farmer and as a working farmer&mdash;of the position of affairs in my constituency, I would say that the farmers are a hang sight better off than they were when they were depending on the British market, and did not know what they were going to get for anything.  On the day on which they set their crops now they know the price they are going to get for them.  It is for us to see, as far as we can, that that price is high enough.  That is the view-point which I hold, and that is the experience which I have got from speaking to my neighbours, who are farmers also.  I could produce accounts kept by several farmers in my district over a period of a year.  They would amaze some Deputies.  I do not want to produce them, because I do not want the Minister for Finance getting down on top of them.  I do not think there is anything to be gained by spinning this kind of yarn here about the position of the farmers when they were growing bullocks for John Bull, and did not know what they would get for them, and the position of the farmers growing food to-day for the Irish people, which, of course, Deputy McGilligan says they should not do.  He would be ably seconded by Deputy Dillon, I am sure, on that particular point.  I think the position of the farmers is far more secure to-day than when they were growing beef for a market that did not want it, and growing agricultural produce for a market that did not want it.  That has been the experience of <Col N="866" /> the farmers in my constituency all through the years from 1927 onwards.</P>
      <P>There was an adjournment motion brought in here by a Cumann na nGaedheal Deputy from my constituency in 1929 calling on the Minister for Agriculture at that time not to collect the annuities in East Cork because the farmers could not pay them owing to the bad price they were getting for agricultural produce in that famous English market across the water.  That was the position then.  That resolution was brought in by a Government Deputy at that time, complaining of the agricultural policy of that particular Government in leaving the farmers of my constituency depending on that English market, in which they were not able to make enough to pay their annuities.  I read the resolution here. I think you will all remember it, and if not you will find it in the official reports.  That was the position of the farmers then.  What is their position now?  I cannot get a better author than Deputy Broderick.  I would advise you to look up that same adjournment debate, and get Deputy Broderick's statement, where he said that the farmers who followed the agricultural policy of Fianna Fáil were all right and were making money. Compare the two&mdash;the position of the farmers under Cumann na nGaedheal, as outlined by Deputy Carey when he was a member of this House, and the position of the farmers under the Fianna Fáil agricultural policy, as described by Deputy Broderick.  Compare the two.  I, at any rate, speaking for my constituency, say that as regards the farmers of my constituency the less talk there is about them the better they are pleased.</P>

If he does, he is an optimistic man.  I have no use at all for committees which are to serve as cloaks for the futility, ineptitude, and incompetence of the collection of Deputies who desecrate those benches where a Government is supposed to sit.  The people of this country know very well, from their, own experience, who is being hit by the incidence of special duties.  The direct impact of those duties must be on the agricultural community.  They do not manufacture cows in Hammond Lane.  Deputy Lemass does not issue licences for the laying of eggs.  Those things do not come within the purview of the Department of Industry and Commerce. The tragedy of this situation is that what a good deal of people do not recognise, and what this committee will not bring home to them, that although the impact of those special duties is directly upon the agricultural community, sooner or later it is going to recoil upon every section of the community.  We are providing social services in this country&mdash;social services which it is a very great pleasure to provide, but which it is a very great shame to provide in the certain knowledge that the political policy of Fianna Fáil is going to dissipate the resources of the nation, as a result of which those social services must collapse, and will collapse if the present policy continues, because the source of the entire national income is agricultural prosperity and if that is sufficiently destroyed for a sufficiently long time then every public service in this country will collapse one after another.</P>

      <P>As Deputy McGilligan aptly pointed out, if a profligate son inherits a considerable fortune from a thrifty father he cannot, to do his best, get into the bankruptcy court without the lapse of some time.  Deputy Corry may have relieved some of his lighter moments recently by attending a film in this city entitled &ldquo;Brewster's Millions.&rdquo;  He may have even whiled <Col N="868" /> away a prosperous evening in East Cork by reading the book entitled, &ldquo;Brewster's Millions.&rdquo;  He may remember that Mr. Brewster was set the task of dissipating £500,000 within a given time, and the reward for that enterprise was £6,000,000.  It nearly broke his heart and drove him into the lunatic asylum to spend it. Let me congratulate the Fianna Fáil Government on being able to undertake the task which so embarrassed Mr. Brewster, without making any visible change in their mental equipment. They are going exactly the same way to-day as Mr. Brewster and they are going quite nonchalantly. Yet I believe that the Minister for Finance has the intelligence and the Minister for Industry and Commerce has the intelligence to recognise that the logical result of what is happening in this country at the present time is national bankruptcy.  Both those gentlemen may be bereft of principle; they may be bereft of political honesty; they may be bereft of many virtues, but I think both of them have a certain limited measure of intelligence, and that is all that is necessary in order to recognise what is happening in this country.  We heard Deputy Corry wax eloquent to-night on the subject of wheat.  He remarked:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Deputy Dillon says that he will never grow an acre of wheat, but his leader says it is the policy of Fine Gael to promote the growth of wheat.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Let me repeat here and now that I will never grow an acre of wheat on my land so long as it is to be grown and paid for by taking the bread out of the mouths of the poor people of this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is costing £750,000 a year to grow the measure of wheat which we are at present producing. According to the statistics I have before me, the growing of wheat in this country has increased tillage by about 30,000 acres.  Each acre of that increased tillage has cost our community £20 and that £20 is not being levied upon the general tax-paying community.  It is being levied exclusively <Col N="869" /> on the bread caters of this country, and there is not a single Deputy in this House but knows that the bread caters of this country are the poor of this country.  That tax is being levied upon them in the belief that, they being largely simple people, will not recognise its incidence in the price of bread.</P>
      <P>That is the kind of intelligence that thrives and prospers on the Fianna Fáil Benches.  That type of political chicanery has admirable exponents upon the Fianna Fáil Benches and I regard it as one of the most shameful and disgraceful things ever done by this Oireachtas that we saddled the poor of this country with a bread tax when they were already put to the pin of their collars to carry on; that we went through the form of handing these people out the dole of public assistance and unemployment assistance; and that of that miserable dole we took back from them every week a substantial part in order to finance Deputy Corry and a few more of his prosperous neighbours in East Cork. I wish him luck with his money and I invite him, when he counts it and rattles it in his pocket, to remember that he took it out of the mouths of the poor.</P>

      <P>I am glad and proud to think that my leader has that sense of responsibility to recognise that, though we may see the folly of Fianna Fáil schemes, we are not prepared to make the people of this country suffer for it.  If Deputy Corry and his colleagues have succeeded in deluding a number of our people into the belief that wheat is an economic crop in this country, if the Minister for Industry and Commerce and President de Valera have succeeded in precipitating a situation in this country in which men must grow wheat in order to get the Government dole if they are to live, when we come into office, we are not going to attempt a revolution such as has been attempted, and drive a number of these people to destitution by withdrawing the bounty which Fianna Fáil has placed on wheat.  To <Col N="870" /> do it would make everyone of these farmers who have been forced into growing wheat paupers in the morning. It would upset their whole agricultural economy and destroy their whole system of husbandry, and I say, and I thoroughly endorse what Deputy Cosgrave says, that if and when we come into office, we have got to carry on the schemes which Fianna Fáil have set in motion in this country until we replace them with better schemes and until the people of this country recognise that the methods which we propose to them, and the schemes which we propose for their acceptance, are better and more profitable and willingly reject the futilities of Fianna Fáil.  We are bound to maintain these follies intact, lest in making an end of them, we do far greater injury to the community than we would do by saving whatever money must be wasted in their maintenance for the time being.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And the beet scheme is a wicked folly.  The Minister was once a humble Deputy with the perspicacity which I do attribute to him because I regard him as one of the moderately intelligent members of his Party.  I venture to say that he and the Minister sitting beside him have about all the intelligence there is on that bench, save, perhaps, that we must admit the President has some&mdash; he is a very astute Machiavellian politician. These two Ministers have some understanding of the situation, and when they were Deputies and free to speak their minds, not dancing to the tune which is punctuated by President de Valera's whip, the present Minister for Finance described the Carlow Beet Sugar Factory as a white elephant, and said it was one of the afflictions which Fianna Fáil had inherited, or was about to inherit, <Col N="871" /> from the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  To do justice to Deputy Hogan, who was the Minister responsible for its introduction, I must say that his answer to the Minister for Finance was &ldquo;Hear, hear&rdquo;; I quite agree.  We set it up as an experimental station to find out how the thing would work, and, having had it working under the most favourable conditions for seven or eight years, we made up our minds that it was hopelessly uneconomic and placing an unjust burden on the people and we determined to go no further with it.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister for Finance maintain his consistency in this matter? Not at all.  He is told that in this matter some passing political advantage might be derived, and, accordingly, as I have often said before, the white elephant calved, we had three more, and now we have a family of four to maintain.  Does any rational Deputy in this House suggest that because I believed them to be uneconomic and imprudent in their inception, if we were returned to office in the morning, we should close all the factories and tell the farmers who had arranged their economy to grow wheat: &ldquo;You can take it out and burn it; we will not take it from you?&rdquo; Not unless we were the irresponsible lunatics who have constituted the Fianna Fáil since its founding.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer that question, but I suggest to the Minister that he should intervene when I have finished speaking and make his own speech.  I shall not submit him to any cross-examination, and if I try, he will get extremely angry. Having provided that the farmers can continue to supply beet to the factories, I propose that a close examination should be made of the economic value of this to the community.  If I am satisfied that the agricultural community can be adequately catered for without a continuation of the <Col N="872" /> manufacture of beet sugar in these factories, and if I am satisfied that the economic burden placed on the community is out of all proportion to the community advantage derived from the wages paid to the persons employed in them, I will level the factories without the slightest hesitation.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt whatever that prior to the institution of these factories it was reckless to embark on them.  I have every reason to consider the proposal with due deliberation in the situation in which this country will find itself when the Brewsters of Fianna Fáil are finished with it, and a very different situation may obtain then.  They were relief works when they first started; they are relief works now; and it is necessary to maintain them as relief works for many years after Fianna Fáil goes out of office.</P>
      <P>Now we are told by Deputy Corry that Fianna Fáil agricultural policy has redeemed the farming community of this country, and that if the farming community will only adopt their policy, universal prosperity will abound.  What are the facts?  There are 12,000,000 acres of arable land in this country.  Four millions will produce all the wheat, all the beet, all the meat and all the grain to feed the live stock that the people of Ireland can consume.  I will throw in a 1,000,000 acres for good measure and make it 5,000,000 acres.  If you grow all the wheat we can consume and all the other foodstuffs the stomachs of our people will contain, what are you going to do with the other 7,000,000 acres?</P>

      <P>Practise Fianna Fáil economics on them?  Has Deputy Corry ever applied his mighty intellect to that problem?  Has it ever dawned on Deputy Corry that those 7,000,000 acres are to us what the coal mines and iron ores of England are to her, what oil is to America, and what gold is to South Africa?  Can Deputy Corry imagine John Bull, for whom he has such a terrible contempt, announcing that he is going to get along without the markets that buy his iron?  Can he imagine Mr. Baldwin going down to Cheshire and calling on the populace to thank God that the foreign market for iron was gone and gone for ever?  Can he imagine Mr. Hertzog, of South Africa, praying high heaven that gold will become as dirt in the world, and that no one will want to thank God that the day has gone when gold will be transported to the despised money market of London?  Does Deputy Corry not realise that all this is identical with all that President de Valera said when he went down to Ennis, when he thanked God that the British market was gone?  The source of the wealth which is going to provide a high standard of living for our people is the produce of that 7,000,000 acres of arable land, and, in order to make that wealth available to our people through legitimate trade and through social services, that wealth has got to be realised and converted into money. We have got to convert it into money in some external market if we are going to buy the raw materials for the industries which the Minister for Industry and Commerce says he desires to set up in this country.  If we are going to convert it into cash in a foreign market we will, unless we are madmen, do that in the most profitable foreign market we can find. We will not stake our economic future on the Spanish market where you have got not only to sell your goods but to intercede with the Government to let the money come out to pay for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to Deputy Belton that the only section of the community that is not going to suffer the incidence of those special tariffs are the tens of thousands of men whom the Minister for Industry and Commerce was going <Col N="874" /> to bring back to man the new Irish industries, but who never came.  They will not suffer because they have learned the truth of the old adage that distant hills are green, and that so far as they are concerned they are going to stay green.  They are not coming home to have a look at them with a pair of spectacles prepared for them by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Every blow that is struck against the Irish community as a whole is going to react eventually on the agricultural community of this country.  Every element in our community depends for its existence on the agricultural community.  I deplore the prospect that lies before the enterprising men who have established industries in this country, the men who have established industries in this country and who have undertaken the manufacture of boots, readymade clothing and the other commodities that are manufactured for consumption by our people, because so surely as we are assembled in this House everyone of those industries is fated for destruction if agriculture is destroyed. I deplore that because it is something of value to the Irish nation that those industries should continue.  It will be a great disaster to the Irish nation if they should fail and collapse in the first decade of our independence.  But what is to me a much more pressing nightmare is the danger that threatens the social services of this country. Deputy Norton himself knows that at the present time our social services stand very high, considering the natural conditions that obtain in this country.</P>

He went before the people and stood all the abuse for doing that.  He stood all the abuse that came from the Labour Benches, and from these benches when the Party opposite were sitting here.  I despise the man who takes it off behind the people's backs with oily phrases about administrative alterations.  The Minister reduced the Estimate for unemployment assistance by £200,000, and what astonishes me about that is that the Labour Party sat silent through it all.</P>

      <P>I am speaking frankly and do not care to say anything hurtful to the Minister but the immediate danger is that the social services of this country, which stand at a fairly high level considering the natural conditions that obtain here, are in peril, and they are in peril because the source of our national wealth is being steadily destroyed. The reduction in the old age pensions and in unemployment assistance are two danger signals.  The Government has cast about rooting for sources of taxation.  Having cast about and <Col N="876" /> made every economy that physically it was possible to make in other directions, they are now beginning to nibble at the social services that the State set up.  They are doing that not because they are men who have a high sense of duty&mdash;they are men who have consistently bought political popularity with public money &mdash; but because they have got to keep the ship floating or it will sink.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>On Thursday last I drew the attention of the Minister for Justice to a communication published in the <i>Irish Times</i>, which they had received from the Federation of Old I.R.A. Associations, a communication which attempted to deter them from publishing pictures of the Armistice Day ceremonies.  I asked whether the Government was proposing to do, or had done, anything about the matter.  I gave notice to raise the matter on the adjournment <Col N="877" /> because the Minister for Justice replied that he saw no reason for any kind of Government intervention. Now I do not believe in making mountains out of molehills, and, in view of the peaceful and dignified manner in which the Armistice Day ceremonies in fact passed over this year, I felt some hesitation about recurring to the matter to-night, but, thinking it over carefully, I came to the conclusion that, on the whole, it would be to the public advantage that something should be said about it in a moderate and temperate spirit.  The Government have three ways of preventing things of this sort from occurring.  They can prosecute where they think there is evidence of intimidation or attempted intimidation, they can exercise private pressure behind the scenes or they can express publicly their disapproval and disgust with regard to such courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the incident to which I am referring had been an absolutely isolated one or if the Federation of Old I.R.A.  Associations was a negligible body, the whole thing might, perhaps, be ignored.  But such is not the case.  There have been previous instances of traders being &ldquo;called upon&rdquo; not to stock certain goods, of cinema managers being &ldquo;called upon&rdquo; not to show certain films and now we have newspapers &ldquo;called upon&rdquo; not to publish certain photographs.  I find that phrase a sinister one and I think it does clearly denote intimidation or attempted intimidation.  The <i>Irish Times</i>, for instance, could not have any motive for complying with the demand that was made upon them except the motive of fear.  I quite agree that the attempt to intimidate was a bluff, but that does not make it any the less an attempt to intimidate.  I feel that we have to fight this sort of thing in this country or it will strangle us.  There is far more intimidation going on than is generally realised because, in general, successful intimidation escapes publicity altogether and it is only when some tragedy discloses an unsuccessful attempt to intimidate that public attention is aroused.  So I say we cannot regard this incident <Col N="878" /> as an isolated and non-typical one. Neither can we regard the Federation of Old I.R.A. Associations as a body of negligible importance.  It has, as a matter of fact, a semi-official character. Many Deputies and, I think, some Ministers belong to these associations. I have had occasion before now to criticise a speech made by one Minister to an assembly of one of these associations.  These associations claim to speak for all those who took part in the Sinn Féin rebellion from 1916 onwards and to be the custodians and interpreters of the true national doctrine.</P>
    <P>A fortnight ago, I said in this House that the task of Irish statesmanship was to combine into a tradition and heritage common to all of us the diverse memories, glorious and tragic, that are cherished by the various sections of our people.  The point of view revealed by the present action of the Old I.R.A. Associations is directly opposed to this.  They show an equal disregard for liberty, for tolerance and for the unity of our people, based on mutual respect and understanding.</P>
    <P>The freedom of the Press, although capable of abuse, is an essential element of liberty.  It may be right to forbid the publication of propaganda aiming at the violent overthrow of the State, but the truthful reporting of events that have actually occurred is something the newspapers should be allowed to carry out without interference. If the photograph of a public ceremony is a genuine one and is not faked, it is about as truthful a form of news as can be imagined.  If the State were to forbid the publication of such photographs it would be tyrannical; for any organisation other than the State to prohibit them is not only tyrannical but actually insolent.</P>
    <P>I have never believed in keeping alive past bitterness and it is not in a spirit of recrimination I feel obliged to remind the Old I.R.A. Associations that they have had extended to them a generous portion of the tolerance and charity which they refuse to extend to others.  The appalling futility of the Great War <Col N="879" /> is a cause of sorrow to every nation that took part in it but, here in Ireland, it was especially heartbreaking for all those thousands who suffered the tortures of Flanders and Gallipoli or who suffered the loss of their nearest and dearest to have to reconcile themselves to the fact that the rebels of 1916 and their successors had completely undone and rendered futile the work that those others had done for Irish nationhood and Irish unity.  Nor has it been easy for them to forget and forgive many of the horrors that took place between 1918 and 1923 in the name of Irish freedom. Yet, it has been done.  We have taken the most favourable view possible of the motives of those who were engaged in that struggle, and we have learned to think of the motives rather than of the deeds. Without opposition, pensions have been given even to able-bodied men who suffered no wounds or illness in the course of their service.  We, of the older tradition of Irish nationalism, have not only preached appeasement but we have practised it.  I suggest that these gentlemen of the old I.R.A. should do unto others as others have done unto them.</P>
    <P>Armistice Day is a commemoration in honour of those who made the supreme sacrifice.  There is nothing imperialistic about it.  It is not imperialistic to sing &ldquo;God Save the King,&rdquo; or even to carry Union Jacks, though no Union Jacks were, in fact, carried.  Imperialism means the spirit of aggression and conquest towards other countries, and a desire to remain part of the Commonwealth does not in the least imply such a spirit.  I doubt if there are 100 imperialists in this country unless you use the term as synonymous with narrow and jingoistic nationalism.  At any rate, it is not for the Old I.R.A. Associations to determine what events may be lawfully reported in the newspapers or what opinions may be lawfully held.  If they want to build up this country and make it great, I suggest that they could best do it by putting into practice the principle which I recommended a fortnight ago. <Col N="880" /> They are fond of quoting Pearse to the effect that those who love good must hate evil, but before you apply a motto of that sort it is very necessary that you should understand what evil consists in.  Moreover it should be evil you are really fighting, and not persons.  There are many people who do evil things out of blindness and thoughtlessness, but they ought not to be regarded as beyond the reach of conversion.  The greatest evil actually in this country is intolerance, and against those who practise it we must carry on a contest, not in any spirit of hatred but, as Campion the Jesuit martyr put it, &ldquo;with the determination either to win them Heaven or die upon their pikes.&rdquo;  It is in that battle that I venture to urge that the Government should do their part.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Deputy interpreted that in the letter sent to the newspapers, or at least if he did interpret it, once again he seems to have changed the interpretation later.  The first question submitted for the Order Paper was whether &ldquo;he is aware that newspapers have been circularised by the Federation of the Old I.R.A. demanding that they shall refrain and so on from publishing pictures.&rdquo;  The Deputy substituted for that, &ldquo;has been called upon,&rdquo; and again, I think, &ldquo;one daily newspaper has been called upon.&rdquo;  I am not going to follow the Deputy into what I consider in regard to this to be very extraneous matters that he introduced.  If the Deputy wants to secure an opportunity for making a political speech on this matter he has ample opportunities for doing so, and I am sure will avail of them.</P>

      <P>I have no desire to follow the Deputy into the extraneous matters he introduced.  This question was put to me the last night the House met, asking what action I was going to take to prevent any breach of the peace.  I cannot say in what other way the question could be directed to me as against any other Minister.  From what I know&mdash;and I think it is within the knowledge of everybody, including the Deputy&mdash; these organisations known as the Federation of the Old I.R.A. have not been guilty of any illegal act.  They have been perfectly lawful organisations, and nothing has been brought to the notice of the House, or outside it, to suggest that they have been guilty of any activities but activities that were perfectly lawful and above board.  When a question like this is put one has to consider the organisations that write to the newspapers.  I <Col N="882" /> submit, and the Deputy can ascertain from any legal adviser, that there is nothing to prevent either an individual or an organisation calling upon a newspaper, or calling upon anybody else, to refrain from doing a certain thing. There were no legal steps that I could take, and no legal steps that anyone else could take to prevent that organisation writing that letter and enclosing a resolution with the secretary's name signed to the letter accompanying it. Provided it was an organisation that did not come to the notice of the Government, or was likely to participate in any illegal activity, it calls for no action by me.  The newspapers were asked not to publish photographs. The newspapers need take no notice of that.  Newspapers are quite entitled to publish any photographs they wish. The newspapers did publish these photographs, and nothing happened, and it has been shown that no action on my part is called for.</P>
