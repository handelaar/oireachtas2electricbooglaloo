      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state what is the delay as regards the following water schemes in South Tipperary, namely, Cappawhite, Dundrum, The Commons, Ballingarry and Killenaule; if he will state when the grants will be made available for these schemes, and when an inspector from his Department will visit the areas and report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The initiation of water schemes for these areas rests with the Local Authority, and the Department does not usually make inspections until complete drawings have been submitted.  Plans were received for a water supply for Cappawhite, but the drawings were incomplete and were returned in March last for amendment.  It also appeared that the right to take water from the source proposed had not then been secured by agreement.  Plans for a water supply and a sewerage scheme were also submitted for The Commons in September, 1933.  The plans had not been properly prepared and were returned to the Board of Health for the preparation of new drawings.</P>
      <P>No plans appear to have been submitted to the Department for the other areas referred to.</P>
      <P>No grants can be allocated to public health works until the drawings submitted are approved.</P>
      <P>I am bringing these cases to the notice of the Commissioner.</P>

      <P>There has been no avoidable delay in dealing with the Scheme put forward by the Cork Board of Public Health for the provision of labourers' cottages.  The Board made seventeen Orders for the compulsory acquisition of sites for the building of 771 cottages.  Public local inquiries were held in September and October last into all the Orders, and my decision with regard to eleven of these Orders, comprising all sites in the South and West Cork areas, has already been conveyed to the Board. The inspection of the sites in the North Cork area has been made, and the Inspector is at present preparing his report.  When the report has been received every effort will be made to expedite confirmation of the remaining six Orders.</P>

His claim was disallowed by the insurance officer under Section 7 (1) (ii) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, on the grounds that Mr. Ferry was not unemployed. Mr. Ferry lodged an appeal to the Court of Referees against that decision and the appeal was due for hearing by the Letterkenny Court of Referees on Monday, the 13th instant.  The recommendation of the Court of Referees when received will be considered by the insurance officer without delay and Mr. Ferry will be notified of his decision at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>The position of the Saorstát Flour Milling industry is under constant review in my Department. I am satisfied that the most effective method of securing that unduly high prices will not be charged for flour is by the development of healthy competition between Saorstát mills and such competition is developing. The position of the flour-milling industry is now different to what it was during the period in respect of which the report of the Prices Commission dealt in so far as existing mills are now in a position to meet the full requirements of the country, and new mills for which licences have been promised will, it is anticipated, be in production in a comparatively short time.  It has not been considered necessary, therefore, to implement the recommendations of the Prices Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the Budget statement last year I ventured to estimate that the revenue for the year 1934/35, after allowing for substantial tax reductions, would be about £28,232,000; and that the expenditure, after making due allowance for the factor of over-estimation and for all contingencies in the way of new and additional services and unforeseen expenditure, would be about £35,442,000, of which we proposed to borrow, if necessary, on account of capital expenditure, local loans and other advances, and export bounties and subsidies, £7,212,750.  The revenue, tax and non-tax, actually collected for the year amounted to £28,770,688, exceeding our expectations by over £538,000, while expenditure at £31,203,499 was less than we had apprehended by over £4,238,000.  As a consequence the amount which we were called upon to borrow for capital works, for export bounties and subsidies, and for local loans and other advances was £2,432,811, as against the prospective figure of £7,212,750, to which I have already referred.  These are striking figures and show clearly that last year's Budget was a sound Budget. The country may therefore congratulate itself upon a year in which revenue was greater, borrowing lighter, and expenditure less than there was reason to anticipate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to emphasise that the satisfactory results obtained were not due to any unjustifiable deferment of expenditure on the part of the Government.  It is true that the introduction of the Widows' and Orphans' Pension Bill was delayed and that the outlay which we anticipated in connection with it did not arise, but that was due solely to <Col N="852" /> difficulties which were experienced in drafting the measure and in working out its complicated financial provisions. On the other hand, any saving which accrued because of the delay was off-set more than threefold by the increase of £893,000 which we were able to make in the original provision for export bounties and subsidies.  The whole of this additional sum was provided out of taxation.</P>
    <P>It may be opportune at this stage to refer briefly to the more significant features of the tax yield.  As the Dáil is aware, the principal sources of tax revenue may be divided into three categories.  Of these the first in order of magnitude is Customs Duties, from which we derived £9,438,000, that is £251,000 less than the preceding year, but nevertheless £587,000 more than we had estimated for.  On the other hand, the second great category comprising the Excise Duties at £5,555,000 fell short of the estimate by £21,000, but this was compensated for by the yield from the Inland Revenue, consisting mainly of taxes upon income and property, which at £7,611,000 exceeded the estimate by £27,000.</P>
    <P>In connection with the Inland Revenue figures, however, I should mention that two notable short-falls in the yield from the Income Taxes and Estate and similar duties were only partially compensated for by the prolific yield from Stamp Duties, and that it is ultimately to a substantial increase in the returns from Excess Profits Duty and Corporation Profits Tax that the good showing on this side is due.</P>
    <P>Continuing our examination of the tax yield, we find that the total revenue derived from the consumption of spirits, though it was almost £98,000 more than was estimated for was, nevertheless, almost £78,000 below the previous year's figure at £2,148,000.  The same dwindling tendency continued to manifest itself in the Beer Duty, which at £2,855,468 gave us some £25,000 less than the previous year and was £70,000 short of our expectations.  The Wine Duty gave us £172,281, which was £4,586 less than in 1933-34.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="853" /> The reflection that these liquor taxes produced about £108,000 less than the previous year is a sobering one for the Minister for Finance. Perhaps that is why I am not unduly intoxicated by the fact that the duties on table waters and cider were more productive by almost £1,000 than had been anticipated and at £29,959 yielded £445 more than in the preceding year.  In view of the decreased yield from the spirits duty it may occur to some people to remark that an amount of good soda water went to waste.  Others may take a different view, but I must confess that as Minister for Finance I cannot altogether withhold admiration from a beverage which continues &mdash;if I may say so&mdash;to stagger along under an imposition of 72/6 per proof gallon, and while I do not think that I, or any successor, will ever propose to lighten the burden. I shall at least give its due meed of applause to a performance which must leave the most effervescent products of the grape flat with envy.</P>
    <P>There is an old song which tells us how on the other side of the Border whiskey and tea sometimes have been blended.  I will bring them together now by remarking that last year was a good year for tea drinkers.  Thanks to the almost total remission of the duty which was granted in last year's Budget, the yield from tea-drinking was reduced by almost exactly £400,000, so that we collected from it a trifle less than £72,000.  In the case of sugar, owing to the fact that less home manufactured sugar than we had expected was marketed during the financial year, and that what was sold required a greater margin of protection than had been estimated for, the total yield from Customs and Excise duty exceeded the Estimate by £15,000.  A somewhat disquieting position in regard to the sugar duty, however, was disclosed in the course of the year, and as it has an important bearing on the Budget for this and future years I must refer to it at length.</P>
    <P>When the Government decided to develop the sugar beet industry here on a scale to provide our full requirements <Col N="854" /> of sugar, it had certain fundamental costs in mind.  Beet containing an average of 17.5 per cent. of sugar, it was reckoned, would be available at 35/- per ton, and on this basis the total field and factory cost of producing sugar was estimated not to exceed 20/8 per cwt.  On these figures, after allowing for the cost of distribution to the consumer and for an ultimate increase of about ¾d. or so per lb. in the cost of sugar to the consumer, it was assumed there would remain such a taxable margin as would enable the Exchequer to secure a revenue of about £800,000 or £900,000 from the consumption of sugar; so that without any undue increase to the consumer the commodity would have been able to bear an Excise duty of ¾d. or, if necessary, 1d. per lb.  These hopes so far have not been realised.  The price of beet has been driven up to a flat price of 37/6 per ton, and the factory costs of production were higher than had been anticipated&mdash;due undoubtedly in a large measure to the fact that the greater part of the factory staffs had to be trained during the actual working campaign, and that time did not afford an opportunity of tuning up and finally adjusting the new factory plants before they went into production. The combined effect in any case has been to so increase the production costs of sugar that instead of being taxable to the possible figure of 1d. per lb.  Excise, the native commodity so far has been able to bear only one-fourth of that duty.  This circumstance has had a most important reaction on the Budget for this year.  For it has meant that the total yield from sugar duties will be over £500,000 less than for last year, so that unless there is to be a very serious curtailment in the services which the State provides for the community this deficiency must be made good otherwise.  It is clear, therefore, that the establishment of the new sugar beet industry has created a very serious problem for the Exchequer, a problem for which a satisfactory solution will be found only when all those concerned in the industry co-operate effectively to bring the costs of producing <Col N="855" /> sugar down to such a figure that something of its old revenue-producing capacity will be restored to it.  If this be not done, continued heavier taxation of other commodities will be unavoidable and the future of the beet sugar manufacturing industry will, to that extent, be uncertain and insecure.</P>
    <P>Tobacco duties again made a good showing.  At £3,682,000 odd they exceeded the estimate by £156,000, and were better than the previous year by over £102,000.</P>
    <P>Matches, imported and home-made, were expected to bring in £135,000 and at £134,829 have just failed to do that by £171.  It is interesting to note in this connection that the collection from home-made matches was £137 more than was estimated and represented an increase of £6,600 on the preceding year.  The duty on playing cards, which yielded £2,600 in 1933-34, gave us only £398 last year.  In this case the fall in the receipts was due mainly to the action of one large firm which early last year commenced to purchase Saorstát made playing-cards instead of the imported article.  When one speaks of cards, on thinks of Culbertson, but I do not think that the most careful study of his works would avail to help the Exchequer out in such a situation.</P>
    <P>The duties on cinematograph films and clocks and watches continue to give increased yields, so that the return from films was up by £5,000 and from clocks and watches by over £1,500.  With an increased yield from cinematograph films, one may look without disappointment for an increased yield from the entertainments duty, which last year at more than £210,000 beat all records by over £14,000, and was in fact some £16,000 better than we figured.  The yield from Betting Duty, which after the abolition of the duty on course betting in August, 1931, fell from £201,000 for the year 1930-31 to £144,000 for 1932-33, last year reached £164,000, which was £4,000 more than for 1933-34.</P>
    <P>Some people might deplore the tendency which is manifested by the fact that while the yield from the customs duty on musical instruments, which of <Col N="856" /> course covers saxophones as well as church organs, declined from £25,000 in 1933-34 to £15,500 last year, the duty on wireless telegraphy apparatus, at just under £88,000 showed an increase of £16,900 on the previous year's figures.  I am sure it will be agreed that as Minister for Finance I have reason to honour the memory of the great mathematician who first propounded the fundamental theory upon which the achievements of wireless telegraphy, telephoning and broadcasting are based.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding that the development of the heavy-oil engine for road vehicles is beginning to have its effect upon it, another duty from which the yield continues to increase is the duty on mineral hydro-carbon light oils.  Last year it brought in £1,139,000, or almost £50,000 more than the preceding year and £39,000 more than was anticipated. I wish I had the same to say of the duty on motor cars and parts.  That is a duty which ought to appeal to the members of Deputy Belton's Party, which from its public pronouncements, I gather, as a Party relishes the sporting aspect of the uncertain return in all the transactions of life, and is not above a gamble even in pigs or pork. Well, when the Party comes to form its Government the motor car duty will satisfy that gambling instinct to the full.  In 1930/31 it brought in £509,000; in 1931/32 £393,000; in 1932/33 £245,000; in 1933/34 £375,000; and last year, when we had backed it to bring in about the same amount as in the preceding year, it gave us only £319,000.  On this in-and-out form, and in order to give the new motor-assembling industry a chance to establish itself firmly, we do not feel justified in counting on it for more than £230,000 this year.  As in the case of the sugar duties, it is obvious, however, that while the deficiency in the yield must for the immediate present be made up from other sources, nevertheless the costs in the new industry must be so adjusted that, at a date not too remote, it will yield to the Exchequer, either directly or indirectly, a commensurate return for the revenue which we have had to forego in developing it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="857" /> As a further illustration of the effect which the successful development of our industries is having on the Exchequer position, I may also mention that last year the aggregate yield from a number of protective duties, including those on boots and shoes, clothing and apparel, packages etc., fell by £190,000, and this year as a matter of course may be expected to fall still more.</P>
    <P>One other return which calls for special mention is the receipt from the motor vehicle duty.  The yield last year from this duty, which, as the Dáil is aware, is appropriated to the purposes of the Road Fund, was £942,000, representing an increase of £26,000 on the year preceding and bringing the total tax revenue up to £23,546,000.</P>
    <P>To the tax revenue we have to add what is known as the non-tax revenue, consisting of a number of miscellaneous items such as Post Office receipts, land annuities, surplus income of the Currency Commission, Interest on Exchequer advances, etc.  It was estimated that the receipts under these and other heads would amount to £5,301,000.  However, due particularly to a reduction in the rate of interest charged on Electricity Supply Board advances, only £5,224,688 or £76,312 less than the Estimate was realised.</P>
    <P>The total Exchequer revenue, that is the sum of the tax and non-tax revenue, for the year, was, as I have already said £28,770,688, and the total expenditure amounted to £31,203,499, and the balance in the Exchequer which at the beginning of the year amounted to £5,350,348, was reduced to £2,746,037.  Apart from that which was due to the borrowings for specific central fund and supply services, to which I will refer later, I may say that to the extent of nearly £500,000 the reduction was accounted for by repayable advances made under the various Shannon Acts and the Telephone Capital Acts.</P>
    <P>In the light of the foregoing figures the question which naturally occurs to one is: &ldquo;And did last year's Budget balance?&rdquo;  The answer depends on the standard which one chooses to set. <Col N="858" /> There are some, for instance, who hold that all expenditure, whether for capital purposes or otherwise, should be defrayed directly and immediately out of revenue.  I do not think that any who hold that view have ever been responsible for the management of the public finances.  In any event it is an extreme view, and I am afraid that nowhere in the world at the present day shall we find its requirements fulfilled. There is another school which would be content if all types of expenditures which may be expected to recur year after year under the same or varying forms were met out of revenue, leaving, if need be, all substantial expenditures for capital purposes and a reasonable share of expenses of an exceptional amount, incurred in special and transitory circumstances, to be defrayed out of borrowing, provided that the expenditures were unavoidable and that adequate and proper provision, by way of sinking fund and otherwise, were made for the ultimate repayment of the debt.  There is an even laxer school which would not cavil so long as interest was paid on the outstanding debt, and the provision for debt redemption left dependent upon the chance out-turn of the budgetary year. That is a view which recently has found great favour elsewhere, and which, if one may judge by the favourable comments which Irish newspapers have passed on certain latter-day budgets, has been generally adopted here also.  If our critics are prepared to judge us by the standards which they apply to others, I have no doubt that we shall pass the test.</P>
    <P>Let us now refer to the figure of £31,203,499 which represented our total outlay for the year.  That figure includes the following amounts:&mdash;</P>

    </table>
    <P>
      <Col N="859" /> Let us consider each of these items.</P>
    <P>The first item of £400,000 formed part of the Exchequer assets, valued at not less than £11,500,000, which have been transferred to the Local Loans Fund that has been established under the Act recently passed by the Oireachtas.  The money, in accordance with the general purposes of the fund, will be put out at interest, in the form of fully secured and definitely repayable loans, while the fund, in respect of this and the other assets transferred to it, will pay interest to the Exchequer at a rate not less than the Exchequer can borrow at.  Clearly the Exchequer in this case is acting merely as an agent of the fund and, more remotely, as the agent of the local authorities, who are the principal borrowers from the fund.  It is therefore entitled to raise the money by borrowing on behalf of the Local Loans Fund, and this is the procedure which henceforward will be followed. It is reasonable, therefore, to regard this £400,000 as an outgoing which need not be met out of revenue, and which if we borrow for does not disturb the balance of the Budget.</P>
    <P>Then there is the item of £550,000 issued as repayable advance to the Guarantee Fund in order to secure release to the Local Authorities of a corresponding amount therefrom.  This advance must be regarded as a first charge upon the unremitted balance of Land Annuity arrears, which accrued prior to the May-June gale of 1932, which in turn are fully secured upon the lands in respect of which they are charged.  That they should ever become uncollectible is not to be thought of, for if they did, all security of tenure and of private right and title in land would vanish in this country, and we should have a position in regard to it comparable only with what exists in Communist Russia.  I do not think that those who have been responsible for withholding those annuity payments in respect of which the Guarantee Fund has had to borrow, wish to bring matters to that pass, but in any event the Government is determined, for the sake of the general credit of the State, to enforce payment <Col N="860" /> of these moneys.  There is, therefore, no reasonable ground to doubt that the Advance will ultimately be repaid to the Exchequer, and accordingly with full justification it is to be regarded as a capital asset against which we may borrow.</P>
    <P>We come now to the £78,254 which has been repaid on account of the Dáil Eireann External Loan.  That is a debt which was contracted by the Irish people almost fifteen years ago.  The bonds covering it&mdash;which are held mainly in the United States of America&mdash;have been accepted by the Oireachtas as an interest-bearing obligation of the State.  In redeeming them out of moneys borrowed here we are not creating new debt, but are merely converting an external into an internal loan.  There can be no question but that we are entitled to borrow for that purpose.</P>
    <P>The expenditure under the Damage to Property (Compensation) Acts is an expenditure occasioned by the circumstances under which the State came into being and has always been regarded as a capital item.</P>
    <P>There remains the sum of £3,079,172 which was expended last year in the payment of export bounties and subsidies. That this charge is exceptional in magnitude is undeniable.  That it has been incurred in circumstances that are special and transitory we all hope and believe.  In so far as we proposed last year to borrow £1,500,000 towards it, we have provided for the ultimate repayment of that amount by the creation of an adequate Sinking Fund in respect of the loan.  We have also as additional security for its repayment an Exchequer asset in the shape of the funded annuities due in respect of the three half-yearly gales which accrued prior to January, 1934, all of which, of course, will be eventually collected by the Exchequer.  Again, therefore, according to the normal canon we are entitled, if need be, to borrow that £1,500,000 to meet a fair part of the cost of the export bounties and subsidies, so long as a provision for these services is necessitated by the very exceptional circumstances in which we find ourselves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="861" /> The items to which I have referred amount in the aggregate to £2,555,254. Deducting this sum from the gross expenditure of £31,203,499 we have left £28,648,245, against which we have a revenue of £28,770,688, leaving a surplus of £122,443.</P>
    <P>Some may say, however, that too much reliance cannot be placed upon the results of one year and that it is the long run tendency which is important.  Let us examine the position from that point of view. Between the 1st April, 1932, and the 31st March, 1935, the Fourth National Loan was floated for £6,000,000.  But against that we paid off the short-term deot amounting to £1,000,000, reducing the net borrowing to £5,000,000.  In the same period the amount transferred to the Local Loans Account and subsequently to the Local Loans Fund was increased by £3,100,000.  After writing off losses in the Industrial Trust Company of Ireland and in connection with the Dairy Disposals Board, the State's investments, excluding Local Loans, have increased by £2,905,000, due mainly to participation in the Industrial Credit Company and the Irish Sugar Company and additional advances to the Electricity Supply Board for electrical development.  Furthermore, the Exchequer balance at the 31st March last stood at £2,746,037, an increase of £1,006,312 on the balance at the 31st March, 1932.  Thus the position is that while within the past three years the net borrowings of the State have amounted to £5,000,000, there is held against that sum, either in cash or in sound investments, £7,011,000, and all our obligations in respect of Sinking Funds and interest, including all interest which, up to the 31st March last, had accrued due in respect of Saving Certificates, have been fully covered.  A consideration of these facts must convince balanced and unprejudiced minds that over the past three years the Budget has been balanced&mdash;and by referring to that specific period I do not wish to imply that the contrary holds true in regard to the preceding years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="862" /> It would be idle to maintain that this accomplishment has not demanded sacrifices.  But they were sacrifices, however, which were necessary if the whole purpose of the National endeavour was not to be frustrated.  We have embarked upon a reorganisation of our industrial and agricultural economy which would be difficult enough to carry through even in the most favourable circumstances, but would be impossible if the people once lost faith in the integrity of the Government, as they might well do if they saw us piling debt on debt and assuming obligations which we did not take adequate steps to discharge.  There have been too many examples in Europe and elsewhere of what such easy finance leads to for them not to become alarmed.  As it is, the majority of our investors are much too timorous about native issues, whether launched under Government auspices or otherwise. The bulk of their capital is invested abroad, and will not be brought back until its owners are convinced that they are secure against the risk of de-valuation and ultimate loss.  It is incumbent on us all, therefore, to inspire them with confidence in the financial stability of the State.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the fact that we, that is the people of Saorstát Eireann, have made full provision for all our Sinking Fund and Interest obligations; even in respect of Saving Certificates. In Great Britain it has not been the practice to make anything like full provision for the interest accruing on Saving Certificates otherwise than by borrowing; while if the Sinking Fund there were served on the scale to which we and our predecessors have bound ourselves, it would require about £100,000,000 each year.  So far from providing this amount the British Sinking Fund contributions, after reaching a maximum of £67,000,000 in 1930/31, last year were just under £20,000,000, that is to say, since 1931 there has been what the <i>Times</i> in a recent editorial described as &ldquo;the virtual suspension of the Sinking Fund.&rdquo;  And yet if we examine the Dublin Stock Exchange quotations for the comparable stocks of the two Governments we find that whereas the British 3½ per cent.  Conversion <Col N="863" /> Loan stands consistently at between 102 and 112, Irish 3½ per cent.  National Loan rarely tops 98. By every criterion of value and soundness the Irish stock cannot be regarded as inferior to that of Great Britain and yet our own people value it lower than the British people value thems.  The reason, I think, is clear.  All sections in Great Britain vie with each other in inculcating confidence in the public finances. There, everyone realises that to impair the public faith in the credit of the State is not good patriotism nor even good politics, and there would be short shrift for the politician or the Party which acted in the contrary spirit.</P>
    <P>Our neighbours have had long experience in financial administration. They are proud of their achievements in that domain.  They hold their reputation in that regard as a great asset of their people, and when, three and a half years ago, they were overtaken by adversity they turned, not to ascribe the blame to one another, but to join with each other in a united effort to retrieve lost ground.</P>

      <P>In 1932, less than one year after the crisis of September, 1931, they carried through, triumphantly, the greatest conversion operation the world has seen.  Its success was a manifestation both of their patriotism and common sense.  Our people will have an opportunity this year to prove that they, too, are in no way deficient in these qualities.  The First National Loan was issued in 1923, upon terms which were stiff, as in the circumstances in which the issue was made it was not unnatural they should be. They imposed a heavy burden on my predecessor's Budgets, as they have done on mine.  Of the total amount of £1,179,317 paid last year in respect of <Col N="864" /> interest on the National Loans the first Loan accounted for £376,255, and of the £620,769 allocated to Sinking Funds £373,745 was in respect of this Loan also.  The opportunity of converting the Loan to an issue upon more favourable terms will present itself on the 1st December next, for under the terms of the original prospectus the Government may give notice to call the Loan at that date.  We are in control of sufficient resources to enable us to undertake the operation with every prospect of success, provided that we are assured of the co-operation of all sections in the Oireachtas, a co-operation which I am sure will not be withheld.  The conversion operation will, I believe, mark a turning point in the financial history of the State.  In magnitude it will not be commensurate with what has been done elsewhere, but in one respect it may be unique. For I am not aware of a new State undertaking to repay and convert its first public Loan at the earliest possible opportunity.  If the conversion is carried through successfully it will be a triumph for all parties, in the continuing benefits and advantages of which not merely we who are here, but all who come after us, whether it be in Government or Opposition, will share. We shall have taken a very great step indeed to place the credit of this State where it ought to be, as high as any in Europe, and that will represent substantial savings in every coming year to the taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We come now to consider the provisions which must be made for the Public Services during the year.  The White Paper setting forth the Estimate of Receipts and Expenditure has been circulated to the House, and indicates that this year the Central Fund Services will require £5,049,290 and the Supply Services £29,507,710.  The figure for the Central Fund includes the sum of £450,000 required in further repayment of the Dáil Eireann External Loan.  As this is in fact a conversion operation the necessary funds for it will be raised by borrowing; so that the amount represented by it may be deducted from the comprehensive figure, leaving £4,599,290 as <Col N="865" /> the draw which the Central Fund Services are likely to make on revenue.</P>
    <P>The figure for Supply includes the sum of £1,330,000 for the services of the account in the Exchequer which was customarily known and referred to as &ldquo;Local Loans.&rdquo;  In pursuance of the Act recently passed by the Oireachtas, this account has been wound up.  The provision of Local Loans will thus no longer be a charge upon the Vote for Supply but will be undertaken by the Local Loans Fund, to which, as I have already said, we have transferred assets to the value of not less than £11,500,000.  A similar position exists in regard to the greater part of the sum of £300,000 which under sub-head O 9 is included in the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture for the payment of bounties on home-grown, millable wheat.  When I mention in passing that the amount provided for last year's bounties was only £125,000 we have some indication of the rate at which the new tillage policy is progressing.  The rate of expansion, in fact, is now such that certain changes in Acts which have been passed to encourage the production of wheat are being considered by the Oireachtas.  I have no reason to doubt that the necessary legislation giving effect to these changes will be passed, in which event, while the standard price for home-grown wheat will remain unaltered, the amount to be provided directly by the Exchequer as a bounty is not expected to exceed £40,000.  Accordingly the figures in the Supply Estimates for Agriculture and for Local Loans are to be reduced by £260,000 and £1,330,000 respectively.</P>
    <P>Included also in the Estimate for Supply are certain items of an abnormal and capital nature to which I should now refer.  The first of these is the provision for Property Losses Compensation, for which it is estimated the sum of £109,750 will be required.  It has been the custom to meet the cost of this service out of borrowings, and circumstances do not permit me to depart from this long-established practice. The Vote for Industry and Commerce likewise includes the sum of £120,000 for the erection of and the <Col N="866" /> equipment and working capital required for five industrial alcohol distilleries and one refinery, as well as for the cost of supervision and management.  It is safe to regard £100,000 of this as purely capital expenditure, and accordingly I propose to borrow that amount for it, if necessary.  In Vote 55, for Forestry Services, there is a sum of £109,000 odd allocated for the acquisition of land, upon the development and afforestation of which a further £129,000 will be spent.  There is no reasonable ground for anticipating that the land so developed will ever be worth less as a capital asset than the amount for which we shall buy it.  Up to a maximum of £109,000, therefore, I propose to borrow whatever may be required for its purchase.</P>
    <P>In the Estimate for Public Works and Buildings there appears an item for the erection of new Volunteer halls throughout the country.  This was originally fixed at £163,000 but, for reasons of economy, it is necessary to secure a reduction in the Estimate and the original figure is to be reduced by one-half that amount to £81,500.  The halls which it is proposed to erect will be substantial and commodious buildings, conveniently situated in urban areas, and among other features they will contain a large drill-hall and one or more class-rooms and committee rooms.  I have no doubt that if at any time the State wishes to dispose of these buildings they would be eagerly sought after for conversion into schools or places of entertainment, and that at least 50 per cent. of our expenditure upon them would be recoverable. Accordingly I propose to defray by borrowing that proportion of the cost of providing them.</P>
    <P>I come now to consider the provision proposed for export bounties and subsidies. It amounts to £2,705,000.  Last year, because of the fact that in the preceding year we had been able to avoid borrowing at all on their account. I agreed to borrow up to £1,500,000 for them if necessary&mdash;a provision which has been fully availed of.  Each year that this service continues makes it imperative to provide an increasing part of it out of revenue, and accordingly, <Col N="867" /> this year I do not propose to borrow more than £1,350,000 on that head.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, it is also proposed to borrow £450,000 which will be required for the repayment of the Dáil Eireann External Loan, and this and the other items to which I have just referred give us £2,159,500 to be found by borrowing.</P>
    <P>The borrowings which I have just detailed, together with the reduction in the original provision for volunteer halls and the elimination of the total amount originally included in the Estimates for Local Loans and of part of the original provision for wheat bounties, account for £3,831,000, which leaves us £30,726,000 still to be dealt with.  Before considering the tax measures which may be necessary to that end I have carefully considered the larger heads of expenditure in the Estimates.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied, and the Minister for Local Government and Public Health concurs with me, that a closer supervision and stricter enforcement of the law in regard to old age pensions would result in a considerable reduction in the cost of that Service.  It is felt that a saving of £100,000 can be effected without causing hardship or depriving anyone of the assistance the Oireachtas intended should be given to them.  This saving would make the figure for old age pensions £3,356,700, or still £650,000 above what it was in 1931-32.</P>
    <P>I must now draw attention to the fact that in the Estimate for Public Works and Buildings, after writing it down by £81,500 in respect of such Volunter Halls as it is not now proposed to build, there is an additional net provision under Subhead B for new works, etc., of £142,600.  This provision is mainly in respect of new schools and other small building works which will be widely distributed over the country, and to a corresponding amount will increase employment this year.  Furthermore, under Vote 55 the amount to be provided for Afforestation this year is £230,510 as compared with £121,869 last year, an increase of approximately <Col N="868" /> £110,000 which again will afford, in a corresponding measure, widely distributed employment.  In the Vote for the Department of Local Government and Public Health also the provision for grants under the Housing Acts has been increased from £414,500 to £650,000; and in the Land Commission Vote there has been an increase of £80,000 in the amount to be provided for the improvement of estates.  It is also proposed, in addition to the sum of £350,000 which under Vote 69 has been included in the Supply Estimates for relief schemes, to provide in this Budget a further £150,000 for that purpose, bringing the total provision for relief schemes up to £500,000.  This additional £150,000 is included in the figure of £770,000 which appears against the item &ldquo;Additional Services 1935/36&rdquo; on page 6 of the White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure.</P>
    <P>As employment upon relief works financed out of public funds in whole or in part will be confined to persons entitled to receive Unemployment Assistance, and as, since the estimate was prepared, two Employment Period Orders have been made, and as it has also been decided to introduce amending legislation affecting various changes in the Unemployment Assistance Act, the combined effect of which will reduce expenditure, I have decided, with the concurrence of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that the figure for Unemployment Assistance may be reduced by £300,000, that is from £1,600,000 to £1,300,000.</P>
    <P>With regard to the general question of relief for unemployment, I may mention that in pursuance of the announcement which was made last year, an Inter-Departmental Committee consisting of some of our ablest and most experienced civil servants has been set up under the chairmanship of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.  The Committee has been hard at work and has given constant and unremitting attention to the problem of framing an adequate programme of works calculated to reduce the expenditure on unemployment assistance to a minimum.  It was greatly handicapped, however, by <Col N="869" /> lack of information as to the nature and distribution of unemployment in the Saorstát.  The fullest possible information on these aspects of the problem is essential, and with this in view the Committee, on the 17th December last in co-operation with the Department of Industry and Commerce, undertook a classified census of those in receipt of Unemployment Assistance.  In this connection they sent out about 128,000 forms, on which they asked those who were in receipt of relief to give full particulars of their circumstances, occupation, martial condition, age, etc.; 98,167 forms were returned.  A preliminary analysis and classification of these has taken place and they are being closely considered by the Committee in connection with their task.  I may mention also that the Committee, in conjunction with engineering and other experts, has closely investigated some large-scale proposals which have been put before them but, so far, the results of such investigations have not indicated that the solution of the problem will be found in the execution of grandiose schemes.  For instance, in connection with one proposal which was estimated to cost from £3,000,000 to £5,000,000, the whole of the work was to be carried out in the wealthiest district in the country and it was unlikely that more than 15 per cent. of the cost would have been spent on native unskilled labour, and local skilled labour would receive an even smaller share.</P>
    <P>In connection with this whole question of works to provide employment I feel that it must be postulated that if public funds on a large scale are to be provided for the purpose, the works must be of such a character that the benefits to be derived from them will be distributed as widely as possible over the State as a whole.  For this reason I, personally, am inclined to think that the rational solution of this problem will be found in a coordinated programme of widely distributed works of moderate size, works which will require for their execution a minimum expenditure upon imported plant and materials, but in which, on the other hand, the labour content particularly of unskilled labour of the <Col N="870" /> type available in rural areas and small urban centres, will be the largest possible.  However, as I have said, we have provided considerably increased amounts for Housing Grants and for additional public expenditure on small building works, on land improvements, on afforestation, and on minor relief works generally as the most helpful solution of the problem.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned that the item of £770,000 for Additional Services, which appears on page 6 of the White Paper, includes a further £150,000 for relief works, to which I have just referred.  It also makes provision for the contribution of £250,000 which, under the terms of the Bill just circulated, the Exchequer must pay annually into the fund for Widows' and Orphans' pensions.  I should say in that connection, although it will not be found in the text of the speech, that the statement which appears in some newspapers this morning that the contribution will be discontinued after ten years has no foundation in fact. The eventual result may be indeed that an increased contribution may have to be made, but so far as we can gauge at the present moment a contribution of £250,000 for ten years will put the fund on a sound actuarial basis.  This amount will come definitely into charge this year, as soon as the Oireachtas has passed the Bill.  In connection with the Bill I may refer specifically to the provisions under which the widows and orphans of landholders who have a holding of less than £8 valuation will be entitled to a pension under the non-contributory scheme.  I have no doubt that this will prove a very great boon indeed to the poorer sections of our agriculturists.</P>
    <P>Under the heading &ldquo;Additional Services&rdquo; there is also included the sum of £370,000 which is to be provided for the additional Supplementary Agricultural Grant under a Bill which the Minister for Local Government and Public Health will introduce in the course of the year, and which it is presumed the Oireachtas will enact.  The Bill will follow generally the lines of the Act of last year with, however, such modifications as the practical <Col N="871" /> operation of that measure has shown to be desirable.  In this connection I would emphasise that as against an original provision last year of £2,250,000, the Budget Estimate this year provides £2,705,000 for export bounties and subsidies, representing an increase of £455,000.</P>
    <P>The allowances for borrowings, eliminations and economies which I have detailed amount to £4,231,000, and leave us with £30,326,000 to cover all other expenditure. As the Dáil is aware, however, almost every head and sub-head of an Estimate provides some margin for the unforeseen.  I am satisfied that in the aggregate, therefore, I would be justified in writing down that margin, in so far as it has been provided for in the figure of £30,300,000 odd to which I have just referred, by £950,000, which I propose to do accordingly.  This reduces our net requirement to £29,376,000, a figure which is not subject to any further reduction.  It includes indeed one new Service&mdash;the provision for Widows' and Orphans' Pensions, for which in any event we should have had to provide out of fresh taxation.</P>
    <P>Before proceeding to consider how this expenditure is to be provided for there is one proposed change in the basis of the existing tax revenue to which it is necessary to allude.  Included in the Estimate under that head is the amount which it was estimated would be collected over the 12 months from the existing Excise duty of 10/- per pig carcase and part of a pig carcase. The Minister for Agriculture has pressed me very strongly to remit this duty altogether.  I am not in a position to do so immediately, but I have agreed, when the board which is contemplated under the new Pigs and Bacon Bill has been set up and is fully functioning, to take steps to reduce and ultimately to remit this duty during the current year.  This will cost the Exchequer £240,000 and is a remission which must be made good by a new impost elsewhere.  In my opinion, the advantage which agriculturists will derive from the remission <Col N="872" /> of the pig duty would not be lessened but rather would be increased by a tax on foreign wheat.  Accordingly I propose to levy an import duty of 6d. per cwt. on that commodity in the hope that it will recoup us to the extent of £190,000.  The balance of the £240,000 will be found by an extension of the existing duty of 8d. per gallon on mineral hydrocarbon light oils, to cover all mineral hydrocarbon oils used in the propulsion of motor vehicles.</P>
    <P>This will produce £60,000, leaving an acceptable balance of £10,000 for the general purposes of the Budget.  I propose also to introduce a number of minor alterations in the law in relation to Income Tax and Death Duties so as to make plain the will of the Oireachtas as to the ambit of these taxes and to safeguard the revenue against evasion.  These changes will not be without fruit in the current year, but their most practical purpose is to check abuses which tend to develop at the expense of the public purse.  A few minor amendments in the Income Tax Code are also necessitated by the recent enactment of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act and the Aliens Act.  These will leave the law precisely as it is at present in relation to Double Income Tax-payers, and will not impose any added burden upon anyone.  The provisions of Section 7 of the Finance Act of 1932, under which relief is granted to Saorstát investors in native undertakings, will be brought into closer conformity with the provisions of the Control of Manufactures Acts and the Citizenship and Aliens Acts which I have already mentioned.</P>
    <P>At this stage it is necessary for me to refer to one characteristic of our existing tax revenue which will have an important influence upon our Budget for the coming year.  It is not a novel feature but it is one which has become increasingly important by reason of the industrial expansion which has been taking place here.  Five years ago, among the staple sources of State revenue were the Customs duties on boots and shoes, on wearing apparel and on other commodities like cocoa products, sugar and sugar confectionery; <Col N="873" /> and the total revenue from these amounted in 1929-30 to £2,117,000. In addition, the duties on wine, beer and spirits produced £6,802,000.  For the year 1931-32, which preceded the change of administration, the corresponding figures were £2,499,000 and £5,610,000 respectively.  For the year which has just ended they were £1,953,000 and £5,176,000.  For this year we do not expect that they will exceed £1,217,000 and £5,167,000.  It will be clear, therefore, that, due to two causes&mdash;the decline in the consumption of alcoholic beverages and the increasing development of our industries, accentuated by the further development in the cultivation and manufacture of the sugar-beet which has taken place since last year&mdash;the revenue from certain of the existing taxes has considerably declined, and accordingly it will be necessary for us this year to replace these by others.</P>
    <P>Possibly it might not be out of place if I were to give some specific instances of the change which has occurred.  In 1931-32 the Customs and Excise duty on sugar gave us £1,426,000.  There was then no duty on tea.  This year it is estimated that the total revenue from sugar will be £781,000 less than that, while the revenue to be derived from the existing duty on tea will not exceed £45,000.  There is thus a net deficiency as compared with 1931-32 of £736,000 to be made good in respect of these two duties alone.  Moreover, even if we take the figures for last year, when the yield from the Customs and Excise duties on sugar was £1,155,000 and the yield from the tea duty was £72,000, there is still a deficiency this year of £537,000.</P>
    <P>It will have been noted too from the figures which I have given that the revenue from what is colloquially know as the &ldquo;Liquor Duties&rdquo; has also declined since 1931/32 by about £443,000.  This might be borne philosophically and looked upon in fact as the Exchequer's contribution to the general weal.  But when we are assailed at once, as it were, from the right and from the left, when whosoever may be referred to as the &ldquo;topers&rdquo; combine with the &ldquo;teeto-tallers&rdquo; to deprive the Exchequer of <Col N="874" /> almost a million pounds between them some compensation must be sought somewhere for the loss.  Beer and spirits will bear no more.  They are strong, if I may say so, in everything but tax-bearing capacity.  What they cannot do, tea and sugar must.  Accordingly it will be necessary to increase the existing nominal Customs Duty on tea by 4d. per lb. all round, making the rates 4d. and 6d., which will bring us in £320,000, and to impose also an additional 1/4d. per lb. on sugar, which together with measures which will be taken to maintain the price of sugar constant when the home manufacture stocks become exhausted, will bring in £175,000.</P>
    <P>Let us now look at cocoa products, mainly chocolates, and sugar confectionery. Between them these delectable commodities brought in £164,000 in 1931/32.  This year they will give us no more than £5,000.  What cannot be got from them must be found somewhere else.  I have no doubt that formerly a large part of the proceeds of this tax was taken from the tribute which manly pride is accustomed to offer grace and beauty.  In this changing world I do not know whether the old customs still hold. But even if the fair nowadays prefer cigarettes to chocolates, I am sure they will not feel the less grateful to the donors by reason of the fact that henceforth they will cost an additional eightpence per lb., which is the increase we propose to make in the Customs and Excise duty on tobacco. This will bring in £160,000, thus balancing the loss on Cocoa Preparations and Sugar Confectionery.</P>
    <P>At this stage there arises to my mind the sad reflection of Burke that&mdash;&ldquo;To tax and to please, no more than to love and be wise, is not given to men.&rdquo;  In this spirit I should be content with the fruits of a number of minor changes in miscellaneous industrial and agricultural protective duties which would fill whatever gap is left between Revenue and Expenditure, but for the fact that I must meet the cost of the new Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Scheme, which as I have already said will amount to £250,000 per year.  That service therefore must be provided for.  As a first <Col N="875" /> step I propose to increase the assessments for Income Tax made under Schedule &ldquo;A&rdquo;, i.e., on income arising out of the ownership of property.  As the law stands at present these assessments are made upon valuations which are long out of date and are as a rule far below the true worth of the property.  It is inevitable that in due course proposals should be submitted to the Dáil to remedy this anomaly, but in the meantime there is no reason why the State should be deprived of its proper share of revenue on account of it.  Accordingly, the assessments will in future be made on five-fourths of the valuation, and this and the other minor changes in the law relating to income tax and death duties, to which I have already referred, will bring us in £60,000.</P>
    <P>The enormous numbers which flock week after week to the cinemas have become a matter of public comment.  I am sure that it will not be suggested that it is due to any narrow view of mine in this regard that I propose to increase the entertainments tax on all cinema seats above 6d. by approximately 50 per cent., and levy duty thereon in accordance with the new scale set out in Resolution No. 24.  I expect to get from this £50,000.</P>
    <P>The remaining £140,000 will be provided mainly by miscellaneous specific and ad valorem duties imposed for revenue purposes on a number of articles such as asphalt, bitumen, pitch tar, paper, linoleum, asbestos manufactures, roofing slates, tiles, wool, etc.</P>
    <P>After allowing for the alteration in the Excise duty on pig carcases and parts thereof, the new taxes will bring in a net amount of £945,000, which, when added to the existing revenue, will bring the total revenue for the year up to £29,386,000.  The Dáil will remember that out of this we must meet a net expenditure, after making due allowances for borrowings and savings, of £29,376,000, so that in the final result we hope to have a surplus of £10,000.</P>
    <P>I feel that this will leave us with a sound Budget.  We have not borrowed to meet any expenditure which ought <Col N="876" /> by any reasonable standard of public finance be defrayed out of revenue.  If we have imposed new taxes these have been largely occasioned by the fact that owing to the rapid expansion of our industrial and agricultural programme the yield from the old Customs and Excise duties has considerably decreased.  The only alternatives in these circumstances were to slow down that programme, to discourage tillage and to restrict industry, or else to reduce very drastically the expenditure on social services.  To adopt either in the present condition of our affairs would neither be prudent nor economical.</P>
    <P>Life in this island is in course of a great social transition.  An increasing population is pressing on the means of subsistence, and we have to shoulder now the major responsibilities of freedom and insure, so far as we can, that population against the contingencies of the future.</P>

      <P>Around us is a world that has been possessed by madness. Every unit of it is claiming for itself more and more of what should be the common stock of mankind.  More and more jealously the nations are reserving for the exploitation of their own natural-born citizens the natural advantages and resources of which fortuitously they have come into possession. The earth, the air and the sea are being appropriated to satisfy their greed and to serve their ambitions. Untold and uncounted, without stint or stay, wealth is being wrung from the militarist populations and spent upon armaments of war.  Women and children are being blooded for it; the peace-loving peoples are being goaded to it; and that it may be the more terrible the spirit of Christianity <Col N="877" /> is being driven from the breasts of men.  These are portents which cannot be ignored.  The storm will break one day.  When that day comes are we to be dependent upon the uncertain fortune of the seas for our bread, our sugar, our fuel, our clothes, our transport and our homes?  Shall we, too, join the mad race and spend and spend and spend upon instruments of death and destruction, in the hope that they will safeguard to our doors what the Almighty has fitted us to produce at home?  And yet that is the only alternative to the policy which we are pursuing. Which is the better&mdash;to spend what we ought upon the instruments of peace, upon the plough and the hammer and the loom, or upon fleets of the sea and the air?  Whether is it better to be as we were three years ago, dependent upon the foreigner for most of the necessaries and virtually all of the luxuries and mechanisms of life, or to be as we aim at becoming, a unit self-sufficient and self-contained &mdash;a unit that in a short space may well be the only harbourage of peace in a war-harassed world?  This nation has been given into our hands after centuries of sorrow.  We dare not let it perish for lack of foresight as to what may come upon us.  It must be secured against the vicissitudes of another world-war, against the possibilities of famine and against the economic coercion of the blockade.  This cannot be done easily or cheaply, but world developments are insistent that it must be done quickly.  Elsewhere millions are being spent freely buying tanks and aeroplanes and gas-masks.  We are spending to grow wheat, to make sugar and to win turf, and we are doing this so that this generation and the children of this generation may live.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first Resolution my desire, in accordance with the usual custom, is to make a few preliminary remarks on the general discussion, but I will speak in more detail on the last Resolution.  I think it is desirable, before we dodge in amongst the trees for the usual skirmishing, <Col N="879" /> that there should be some prospect of being able to see the wood for the trees.  Forbidding and dark as it is at the moment, I make this one comment on the speech to which we have listened: that it is a good thing that the curtain was separated by a considerable amount of his speech from that part of his speech about the effervescent products of the grape. Otherwise people may form a wrong conclusion as to where the emotions came from.  There has now come as a clear fact, what might have been determined by reflection.  The Minister puts in the forefront of his speech this sentence&mdash;did his Budget last year balance?  And I notice that he evaded that question by talking of the standards of those who would seek to judge and give a decision on that question.  If it did balance, how is the balance achieved?  One has often seen those who disport themselves upon a tight-rope.  Nobody would consider that a man had sustained his balance if he had been, three or four times, spreadeagled over the rope and had been shoved back into position by external aid.  And that is what has happened last year's Budget.  Ordinarily, if revenue was found to be failing, the Minister came before the House and got new Resolutions passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By his activities, Deputy Norton and the Deputies who surround him aided the Minister in imposing taxes.  The Minister was able to get £300,000 by the Excise charge on bacon.  Even then the Minister had not felt himself free from collapse.  That was clear from the failure in revenue.  The Minister hold over a measure which he told us this time twelve-months had been fully worked out in all its details, that was the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Bill.  In that way the Minister saved himself from having to introduce a fresh tax to meet the expenditure for this Bill, for which he had fortified himself by a tax last year. In addition to that operation and the operation of other facts, he proposes again to borrow for bounties.  Borrowings for bounties are becoming the ordinary feature of the year's financial <Col N="880" /> proposals and there is no apparent end in sight.  The Minister proposes to borrow for these things that are becoming normal and regular, and that on the strength of a fund which is supposed to produce an amount calculated at no less than £716,000.  If he can get that collected!  It is not balancing a Budget to hand over the deficit to the local authorities.</P>
    <P>The worst feature of this Budget is not the estimate of the questions which might be dealt with were last year's Budget balanced; but this year's Budget or any year's Budget, under the circumstances which the Government have now brought about, can never be balanced.  I do not mean that this country is not equal to bearing the strain.  I do not mean that if this country were taken in hand immediately it could not be brought around.  Deputy Cosgrave mentioned here recently how much quicker is the process of decay than progress and building up.  Decay has started and is running its length and the process of getting back is, year by year, becoming more difficult.  The resources of this country which might recover now may eventually be strained in such a way that it will not be possible to bring the country back to the point at which it was some years ago.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the situation in the country generally.  Need I do more than refer to the promise of the reduction of the £2,000,000, merely for the sake of pointing the contrast with what has happened? Deputy Norton helped the present Government and presumably will help them again this year to pass taxes which will enable him to say to his supporters that their sugar and their tea will be taxed and that there will be taxes on their bread.  Already they have taxes upon their butter.  He will be able to say that he is helping the Government to put on those taxes and that he will continue to help them to put charges on their coal, in a word, he is helping to tax their bread, their butter, their tea, their sugar and their coal.  Meat and bacon are taxed as well.  These extra taxes have been imposed and the Government has continued to increase them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="881" /> The Minister may remember that he promised a reduction of two million pounds.  But beyond the point at which he found the taxation the Minister has gone.  He is going far beyond that point.  By inflicting these charges upon necessities such as sugar, tea, bread, butter, coal, bacon and meat the Minister is taxing the necessities of the people.  He has accompanied that this year with the statement that though all these things weigh heavily upon them the administration of the Old Age Pensions is to be tightened up, its administrative strings are to be tightened and what is being paid in old age pensions is to be reduced by £100,000.  He is to reduce the money for the relief of unemployment assistance.  The butter tax this year according to the last statement we have from the Minister for Agriculture is likely to cost the people a sum of one million extra. A sum of £300,000 will be required for the Wheat Subsidy.  That is going to be found in a charge upon the people's bread.  Those who are already in employment have had to suffer an increase in the moneys they have to pay into the unemployment fund.  They have to pay into an unemployment fund in order to support those who cannot get work.  And that is to cost £250,000 extra this year.</P>
    <P>One section of the community has been bled more than others.  That is the farming community.  A saying was quoted here before with regard to a certain type of mosquito.  It is said of them that they bite not to hurt but to live.  What they want is not the people's pain but their blood.  Deputy Norton may go before his constituents and say when bleeding these people that the blood is being taken from them for the necessities of their leaders.  The Ministry are not anxious to hurt them, but merely because the Ministry must live and continue in office they are bleeding them.  There is increased taxation which I stress following upon these items but there are other and much more alarming features.  I have already spoken of the deficit of £716,000 in the annuities. The Minister knows that the local authorities with the arrears of <Col N="882" /> rates outstanding amounting to over one-third of the total warrant, cannot shoulder this burden.  The Minister believes that from the people who are crushed and broken down and who cannot pay half of their annuities, he can extract £716,000 and that in addition to that they can still provide the increased cost of government. He still hopes to get successful results. From time to time and for a little time revenue can be increased by extortion until in the end it begins to diminish from despair.  How can any country stand what we have seen revealed here from those people who are in arrear with both annuities and rates?  The Minister must confess his whole Budget speech is, in the main, a confession that Excise is still falling. But he walked very carefully around and away from any question of income tax receipts.</P>
    <P>People who appear in this House, when outside the House are fond of telling their supporters that the country with which we are having our economic war is suffering also from this struggle of ours and that she is failing. Let us take one test.  Last year the income tax in Great Britain was reduced by 6d. and it was also reduced here by 6d.  This year the Chancellor of the Exchequer in Great Britain was able to say that on the 4/6 income tax he got more money than he previously got on the 5/- rate.  In other words, there were signs of prosperity, of trade revival, and everything, enabling incomes to yield more on the 4/6 rate than they did previously on the 5/- rate.  We reduced our income tax to 4/6 and what is the result?  We are told we got in £4,206,000.  In 1927-28, when income tax here was 3/- in the £, it produced £3,600,000 and the calculation on which we worked, and which was always borne out by facts, was that an extra 6d. brought in an extra £500,000.  Suppose we had a 3/6 income tax in these years, we would have got at that rate, £4,120,000; but here, with an income tax which last year effectively was 4/9, because the lag of the 6d. remains out for the financial year, the Government got in £4,216,000.  On the 4/9 income tax last year the Minister <Col N="883" /> was able to achieve £100,000 more than the Cosgrave administration could have got from a 3/6 rate and the British, whom we are defeating, on a 4/6 rate can get in more money than in the previous year on a 5/- rate.  That is significant.</P>
    <P>We are told we have prosperity in this country; we are having a great change over in our economic fabric; industrial activity is becoming pronounced; agriculture is being helped out of its difficulties.  Where is the sign of all that in the income tax? Where is the sign of it in the wages paid to agricultural employees? Where is the sign in the wages paid to industrial employees in the new or even in the old industries?  Apart from the moneys paid to these people, can any one in the Ministry say that, owing to the increased cost of living in this country, even the wages these people are getting have anything like the purchasing power they had three or four years ago?</P>
    <P>There is one other item which certainly should impose itself on the mind of any Finance Minister and should have drawn comments from him here to-day.  In the last trading year there was an adverse balance of £20,000,000. It was an adverse trade balance of £20,000,000 on a total trade of £57,000,000.  At the same time that the trade balance is showing an increase adverse to this country, this country is drawing home its investments from abroad.  The bank returns show that. It would be a good thing for investments to be repatriated, if they showed signs of being used productively and remuneratively at home; but there is no such sign.  The two jaws of that pincers are snapping on us&mdash;our adverse trade balance, as far as the visible items are concerned, is going up steadily year by year.  Our total trade is falling; and the investments, from the dividends of which we used to bridge the gap, are being called in.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, the banks reported this year that the tendency observable throughout the country last year for people to draw on their small savings in order to live upon them is becoming more pronounced.  There used to be a <Col N="884" /> complaint in this country about the cost of government.  I remember when a serious attempt to discuss national finance was made by a man who, in the eyes of the Government of the day, was regarded as a great financier; he complained that in those days it took nine months of our total export trade to pay for the cost of government. What have we now?  An export trade of £18,500,000 and the total cost of government, as shown by this white paper, is £36,000,000.  Nine months of our export trade is no longer sufficient to pay for the cost of government. It takes two years of it to pay for the cost of a single year or less. Reduced to the irreducible minimum of £29,000,000, to which the Minister brought it down in his statement, if every penny gathered in from our export trade was put to defray the cost of government, it would fail by £11,000,000 to meet the requirements of the Minister in this year.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister made any attempt to discover what is the national income at present?  Again I refer to a comparison made.  Figures derived from the census of production showed that in 1925-26 the wealth of the agricultural industry in this country amounted to £88,000,000 and in those days the cost of government, central and local, was £27,500,000.  There was dismay, natural dismay, that the cost of government formed such a tremendous proportion of the entire national wealth or productivity of the country. That left out the investments from abroad.  What is the national income at present?  I have seen a calculation worked out in detail which brings down the cash value of the productivity of the farmer from £45,000,000 in 1929-30 to £26,000,000 in 1933.  How much further decline has there been in the cash value of what the farmers produce? What is the value of what is produced in industry in this country, and what is the fraction now of the total that we are paying for government in this country?</P>
    <P>Surely a Minister for Finance who is looking, not to whether his last Budget balanced, but whether future Budgets can balance, would have considered and told us why income tax <Col N="885" /> has fallen and why excise has fallen. What are the incoming items that will tend to minimise this adverse balance of over £20,000,000?  What is the decline in the balancing power of these invisible items if our investments abroad are being called home?  Where is the sign of productivity either in agriculture or industry here?  How does it come about, if we have a vast increase in industrial activity, that the Minister for Industry and Commerce must fall back upon the building trade to give him any figures over which he can stand for employment in the country? Has the Minister considered the serious encroachment there is upon the people's capacity to live by the increased costs that he has put upon them in a variety of ways&mdash;taxes, tariffs and everything else?</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke towards the end of his speech of social services.  Social services are ordinarily the winning card always playable.  But the Minister knows, and the people are beginning to discover also, that if standards of living are beaten down, as they must be beaten down in the process of financing the huge cost of Government activity, it will not be long until the social services must follow the same downward trend now shown in the standard of living.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, who controls the largest number of civil servants in the payment of the State, boasted the other day that, although certain civil servants could not be attacked on account of their contractual position with the State, he was aiming at getting a Civil Service with lower rates of pay.  Is that only to apply to the Post Office, or is the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, speaking in that fashion, speaking the mind of the Government? Whether the Government like that or not, have they come to realise that, carrying on as they are at the moment, salaries must be cut, social services eventually will go down and the burden of all this, now concentrated in the main upon the farmers, will have to be spread over everybody?  The signs are on it; we have started this year with tightening the strings of the purse on the old age pensioners and cutting <Col N="886" /> down unemployment assistance in respect of deeming certain people to be employed and putting them off the receipt of certain benefits.  They are all significant, and if they marked clearly that the Government had at any rate learned that this rake's progress cannot be continued and that its necessary reaction is a lowering in the standards of the people, accompanied by a lowering of social services, it would be good, because, then, a halt might be called before we had gone too far.</P>
    <P>It is almost cruel at this point to refer to old boasts, but still some mementoes must be given to the Minister.  &ldquo;When the British Government,&rdquo; as the Minister put it, contradicting his leader, &ldquo;inaugurated the economic war upon us,&rdquo; the Minister on 14th July said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;He must stress the fact that, whatever the temporary inconvenience caused to Irish producers, this tariff on our agricultural goods, whether it be 20 per cent., 40 per cent., or 100 per cent., will be paid inevitably by the British farmers and the consumers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does he believe it?  He went on to say, contradicting himself in the next sentence:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The trade relations between this country and Great Britain are such that for every penny piece she robs us of by tariffs, we can recoup ourselves by a tariff on her manufactures.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Have we done it?  Deputy Norton, the aid of the Government in these emergencies, was called to London about that time and in an interview which he gave to the correspondent of the <i>Sunday Independent,</i> reported on 4th July, he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If Britain adopts a policy of tariff reprisals, the Free State will not suffer alone.  The people of Britain will also suffer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then, there was this grand pointed example:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Take one instance&mdash;the British import of live cattle.  The Irish Free State has practically a monopoly of that trade and that was the strength of our position.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="887" /> I wonder will the Deputy lean upon that for strength at the moment? Apparently not, for, on 6th July, he advanced further to tell those who came to interview him that the British had recognised that reprisals were a bad policy, and then, he said&mdash;and one hates to mention it:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have a plan myself but I do not propose to disclose it for the moment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was in 1932.  Surely Deputy Norton ought now to relieve the anxieties of people who built upon that plan, even though plans are ill-omened phrases in this House.</P>
    <P>The Minister to-day finds himself caught for money.  Does he remember the time we were promised more and more and more and more money, and why should it ever stop if you vote Fianna Fáil?  I say that it is cruel almost to speak of these things, but that is what was said, and then precise statements were made in respect of one item of taxation alone.  Let me refer to it just here and now.  The President announced that the Free State Army was costing £1,500,000.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Why?  It was being kept solely for the purpose of keeping down the people, who, being denied representation in the national assembly, were thrown back on force.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is now more than £1,500,000.  Do the same conditions hold?  Further, he said &ldquo;the Gárda Síochána were costing £1,500,000 for the purpose of political propaganda.&rdquo;  The present Minister for Finance, speaking at Killeshandra, announced that Fianna Fáil were going to save £9,000,000 by a repudiation of the Ultimate Financial Settlement and the abolition of the Army.  The President was only going to cut it down but the Minister for Finance was going to save the whole of it.</P>

      <P>These were fantastic sayings.  Deputy Dowdall says they were only statements and not promises. He will probably dilate for us upon the difference between the two after a <Col N="888" /> while.  Those are the conditions we are in at the moment.  We have our trouble.  We were told it could never come.  The present Minister for Industry and Commerce said that, of course, no such thing will happen, and all three now sitting there promised us alternative markets.  We need only just pause silently and think about the alternative markets.  We are still waiting for Deputy Norton's plan and while all this is going on, the Minister finds himself forced to come in here to-day with proposals for cutting in on the unemployed and on the old age pensions&mdash;and it may be necessary&mdash;for putting taxes upon wheat and tea and sugar, raiding the Road Fund and the housing grants.  And he is going to tax tobacco.</P>
      <P>He said in the end that possibly this country would be regarded as the only peaceful haven in a war-scarred world. I waited for that phrase or something like it.  The Minister has always told us about prosperity waiting around the corner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a bad reputation that womenfolk have for being late.  Prosperity must be feminine and as the Minister waits for her, it seems to me that this year he will wear a greater air of disgust, as if he knew by instinct that she was, as usual, going to be late for her appointment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not of the Miss Prosperity.  The Minister told us finally in this, which should have been a serious debate, in which he might have attended to national income, decaying taxable capacity, the weight of taxation and the lower standard of living which he is imposing on the people, that you may read Culbertson but you will not get anything to affect these facts.  You will.  I suppose that present day Ministers could not think of holding kings or queens in their hands and I suppose that even aces would be dreaded as something of the Hitler or Mussolini semblance but the Minister might learn from Culbertson, at any rate, that you cannot go a grand <Col N="889" /> slam on a handful of knaves and if that sounds awkwardly put, let me say that you cannot go the same grand slam on all the low cards in the pack&mdash; and I mean low, from the point of view of scoring value.</P>
      <P>Intelligence, in the absence of experience, should have shown the Ministry that if you are going to try to keep up the same population in this country and have either only the same productivity or less, this standard of living has to be cut down.  We are now definitely clear on that because the signs are there.  The standards are down and they are going to be still further depressed by the impact of this Budget. The Minister might also have realised that when your adverse balance rises and when you are raiding your investments at the same time, it is an unhealthy sign, and the Minister might have still further realised that when your cost of government has gone to the point at which it is more than double your export trade, there is a danger mark flashing in front of you. Notwithstanding that, he introduced this Budget here to-day in a most casual way, with laboured jokes and with poor finance, and with no appreciation of the fact that it is not this year or even next year that we will have to pay for all this, because, when the process of demoralisation starts, it goes on quickly and the cure is very slow.</P>
      <P>The Minister has asked us to co-operate with him in having a conversion loan.  He will get our co-operation in anything sound in the matter of finance, but the Minister must know that people outside can read the signs of the times as well as the people in here can speak them, and if it is clear to those outside that this country is not operating in a sound way, and that this country has no capacity to pay in order to balance the enormous budgets which are being presented, he will not go before the people in anything except the rôle of a very necessitous type of beggar.  You do not get good conversion loans in favour of people who present themselves as mendicants, needy, seedy and greedy, as the present Government are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In many respects this <Col N="890" /> Budget will be an unpopular one with the people of this country.  There are many disappointing features in it.  The most glaring point about it is the absence of adequate provision for the relief of the serious unemployment problem with which the country is confronted.  In the course of his speech the Minister told us that £350,000 had been made available under Vote 69. He told us that we would find an additional £150,000 in the White Paper which was circulated last evening, but in the aggregate the sum made available for the relief of unemployment is not more than £500,000.  The Minister indicated, of course, that additional sums were being made available in respect of housing and in respect of land improvements, but in any case, even when those figures are added to the sum of £500,000 which is being made available for the provision of special relief, I think the Minister will be compelled to admit that the gross provision is utterly inadequate for the special unemployment problem which we have to meet here.  According to the latest figures published by the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Unemployment Assistance Act is now costing about £1,750,000 at the rate of expenditure which was in operation recently.  Even if we were to absorb these able-bodied unemployed persons into employment, and pay only the low rates provided under the Unemployment Assistance Act, it will be seen that the provision made in this Budget for the relief of unemployment falls very much below what the real needs of the country are in respect of making provision for that unemployment problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Disappointing as was the provision for the relief of unemployment, the report of the Minister on the working of the Inter-Departmental Committee dealing with the problem of large-scale schemes of public works was more dismal still.  The Minister indicated that it had been found that large-scale schemes would not meet the problem of absorbing the unemployed, and, passing from that, expressed the view that he thought a solution would be more likely to be found in the provision of moderate-sized schemes.  But we <Col N="891" /> were told nothing in the course of his speech as to what the moderate sized schemes were to cost, and I am still in doubt as to whether the £500,000 provided in the Budget is to represent the amount which the State is prepared to spend on the schemes of public works referred to in the Minister's statement.  If it is, then I think that the provision for the relief of unemployment and the provision for public works on a large scale will be regarded as extremely disappointing; as not making any impression on the serious problem of unemployment; as barely touching the fringe of the problem and leaving not merely the hard core but a very substantial proportion of the problem undealt with, except in so far as the provisions of the Unemployment Assistance Act go any distance towards dealing with the problem.</P>
    <P>There are other features of the Budget which do not make very heartening reading.  We were told that, as a result of the issue of two unemployment period orders under the Unemployment Assistance Act, it is anticipated that a sum of approximately £300,000 will be saved to the Unemployment Assistance Fund.  From that, apparently, we may deduce that it is anticipated that those who are put off the unemployment assistance rolls this year as a result of the issue of the unemployment period orders are going to yield up to the State this year, in the form of financial sacrifice, a sum of £300,000.  The Minister, in the course of his speech, did not tell us that those unemployment period orders were justified.  The last information which we had on that subject from the Minister for Industry and Commerce about a fortnight ago is that no special investigation was made to ascertain whether it was possible for the persons who were the subject of the unemployment period orders to obtain outside employment.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce told us he just issued the orders; it was assumed there would be work available, but no special investigation was made to ascertain whether in fact the work was available.  Apparently there was to be <Col N="892" /> no provision in the order and no provision in this Budget for dealing with the cases of persons who are unable to get unemployment assistance benefit as a result of the issue of those orders, and who are unable to get the employment which the Minister for Industry and Commerce thinks is available but admits that he made no investigation to ascertain whether or not it is available. I think that asking the unemployed to yield up £300,000 in the form of denying themselves unemployment assistance benefit is an unjustifiable sacrifice to ask the unemployed people to make, and I think this Budget, if it were otherwise good, has certainly a very heavy black stain on it in respect of that particular provision.</P>
    <P>We are told, too, that there is to be more rigid administration of the Old Age Pensions Act, so as to prevent persons not entitled to old age pensions from getting such pensions.  If there is any case of maladministration in respect of old age pensions, or if there is any flaw in the Act by which persons are unfairly taking advantage of the conditions of that Act, we could understand the problem being dealt with, but if this £100,000 is going to be saved, not after a specific investigation of maladministration or as a result of the discontinuance of bogus claims made under the Act, but merely to balance the Budget, then I am rather afraid that the test of saving that £100,000 will be the needs of the Budget rather than the extent of the abuse that is disclosed in the administration of the Act, or in respect of bogus claims for pensions under the Act.  In any case we have it that the unemployed are going to yield up £300,000 in respect of unemployment assistance benefit; the old age pensioners are to yield up £100,000, and in addition, on the same class of the community, there is to be imposed a tax on tea at the rate of 4d. per lb. and an additional tax on sugar.  It seems to me that in looking around for new sources of taxation, the Minister did not pay due attention to the burden-bearing powers of the poor and needy section of the community, because we have in tea and sugar taxes which have always been admitted to be taxes <Col N="893" /> which press most heavily on the needy sections of the community.  In the special contribution which unemployed persons are expected to make, we have evidence that the making of that contribution by that section will impose a heavy and unwarranted burden upon them.  In respect to old age pensions one cannot be sure that the provision is to cure cases of abuse.  My great fear, from the way in which it was proposed in the Minister's speech to-day, is that it was done not so much to cure abuse as to raid that social reform for a contribution to the problem which faced the Minister in compiling his Budget.</P>
    <P>These features of the Budget are a serious blot on it.  They will impose a serious burden on the plain people of the country.  They will impose a particularly heavy burden on the poor and needy people and to that extent I think the Minister might have scratched the surface much deeper before resorting to impositions of the kind I have outlined, or requiring contributions to be made by the sections of the community to whom I have referred.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that it is necessary this year to make provision for a widows' and orphans' pensions scheme.  We were told last year that £250,000 had been made available in the Budget for the provision of widows' and orphans' pensions and the delay which has taken place in the introduction of legislation has never been explained satisfactorily. It seems to me, and this Budget confirms it, that the delay in introducing the Widows' and Orphans' Bill had more a financial explanation than it had an administrative explanation. But even the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Bill, particularly in respect of pre-Act widows, will not make as serious a contribution to the relief of destitution as the Minister thinks. In any case, I do not think it is a justification to parade a Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Bill in a Budget in which old age pensioners will be required to contribute £100,000, the unemployed sections of the community £300,000 and in which all sections of the community, <Col N="894" /> but particularly the poor and needy, will be required to accept imposts on tea and sugar which are the staple articles of diet of those people. As a matter of fact, if provision has to be made by the State to the extent of £250,000 to finance the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Bill, then it seems to me that it is not the State that is providing that necessary financial support, but that the unemployed community, who will be sacrificed to the extent of £300,000, will in fact bear the State contribution for the Bill and give the Minister £50,000 over.</P>
    <P>I think this Budget will make dismal reading among the poor people. There are other classes to whom this Budget will be satisfactory.  It represents a raid on social services, a raid on unemployment assistance benefit, a raid on old age pensions, imposts on needy people by taxation on tea and sugar and possibly by taxation on flour, when we observe the Government dropping its subsidy for millable wheat and imposing a tariff on imported wheat.  There are other sections of the community to which the Minister might have looked in order to help him to balance his Budget.  The Minister might well have looked to other sections much more endowed with wealth than the unemployed and the old age pensioners. This Government at all events can claim that it has been very generous with the industrialists of the country.  They scarcely ever meet without expressing their appreciation and admiration of the Government. Yet in this Budget, apparently a difficult Budget so far as the Minister is concerned, no special contribution has to be made by that section of the community. Instead, the unemployed, the old age pensioners and the consumers of tea and sugar are to make their contribution.</P>
    <P>On top of it all the provision made for the relief of unemployment in the Budget is particularly disappointing and will be regarded as most disappointing by those who had expected the Government would have done something to produce a large scale scheme of public works.  I do not mean by that a <Col N="895" /> scheme of public works on a grandiose scale, but I do mean schemes of a widespread and of a socially valuable character.  There is no evidence in this Budget that we are going to have large scale schemes of public works, because the money made available for the relief of unemployment, if that is intended to finance such schemes, would be only adequate to touch the bare fringe of the unemployment problem.  I hope in the course of the discussion on the Financial Resolutions that the Minister will reconsider this Budget statement, that the poor and needy will not be asked to make the contribution which they are asked to make in this Budget.  I think the Minister might well have looked elsewhere to find sources of taxation rather than resort to the raiding of the unemployed, asking old age pensioners to make a contribution and imposing taxation on the section of the community least capable of bearing that additional taxation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words before the discussion closes.  What are the outstanding features of this Budget?  It provides two new boons, £250,000 for widows' and orphans' pensions and a concession as regards the duty on pig carcases, amounting to £240,000.  The two together amount to £490,000.  As against that there is a reduction in unemployment assistance of £300,000 and there is also a tightening-up in the administration of old age pensions which is to provide another £100,000. It will thus be seen that the cutting down in old age pensions and unemployment assistance goes most of the way to pay for the new boons that the Minister for Finance is providing. What difference remains would be more than covered by, say, the new arrangements with regard to income tax, Schedule A., and the tax on cinemas. These two would be more than enough to take care of the difference between what the Minister for Finance is giving to the poor and what he is taking away from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few weeks ago the Minister was telling us that he anticipated a comfortable <Col N="896" /> surplus.  What did he mean by that?  Have we got a different terminology in this country from what other countries have with regard to surpluses and deficits?  If you are told that a Chancellor of the Exchequer in England is going to have a surplus, you understand by that not that there is a small realised surplus on the year that is gone by, a surplus which is applied automatically to the reduction of the public debt, but that for the year which is to come the Chancellor of the Exchequer is going to have money in hand wherewith to make concessions and that he is not to be faced with a deficit which he has to make good by fresh taxation.  What is the situation in which we find ourselves?  I have explained how the new boons which the Minister for Finance is by way of providing are balanced by what he is taking away, with the addition of one or two of the smaller new taxes, and, on top of that, he is going to make dearer for the people of the country tea, sugar, tobacco, and bread.  That is a very odd way for the Minister for Finance to behave if he has got a comfortable surplus, but that is what has happened.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton has well said that this Budget will not be popular.  I am bound to say that I consider, to the Minister for Finance personally, that is rather a compliment than otherwise, because he, as distinguished from his colleagues, is not to blame any more than they for the general course of policy which has brought about the financial circumstances which result in this Budget.  It is just as well that the Budget should be of a kind that would make the country face the facts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton has complained that the Minister has not done more to extract the money which he requires from the wealthier classes.  I have no doubt that the Minister has done everything which he could do in that particular, but he is in the uncomfortable situation that income tax has reached saturation point and that he knows if he increased it, the likelihood is that its yield would diminish instead of the contrary.  In the circumstances in which he has found himself, I do not believe he had any choice except to <Col N="897" /> impose taxes which will spread their burden all through the community.  It is just as well that the community as a whole should begin to realise where we are drifting to, and it is just as well that the Labour Party should begin to realise where we are drifting to.  This Budget fills them with horror.  This Budget is their work perhaps more than the work of any other Party in this House because they had less excuse than any other Party for creating the state of things which made this Budget inevitable.</P>
    <P>I am not so optimistic as to suppose that the expenditure forecast by the Minister for Finance in his estimates will be the only expenditure that takes place during the year that is to come. I have no doubt there will be Supplementary Estimates, that there will be more and more money needed for meeting the necessities that arise for healing the war wounds that are resulting from the economic conflict into which we so unnecessarily precipitated ourselves. The time has come when the followers of the Party opposite are themselves beginning to cry out that the burden of that conflict should be more equitably distributed and the Minister for Finance is making his contribution towards distributing that burden, because he finds himself in such a situation that he really cannot do anything else.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a very long speech and a very ponderous speech, with a great deal of rather shoddy humour through it.  I think it is a pity that he could not find time to present his Financial Statement a great deal more lucidly than he did and that he did not find time even to tell the House whether in the ordinary sense of the word he had a surplus or a deficit.  Of course we have the use of our reason and it is perfectly easy for us to infer from all the new taxes that he had in fact a deficit.  But as he was devoting so much time to the subject of the Budget he might have paid us the compliment of admitting that instead of leaving us to discover it for ourselves.</P>
    <P>The Minister endeavoured to gild the pill which he is making us swallow by a great deal of rhetoric on the subject of world conditions and armaments, and <Col N="898" /> we were invited to clap ourselves on the back and thank God we were not as other men because we were not participators in the mad race for creating instruments of blood and destruction. After all it might be worth while to ask why it is we are not participators in that race, why it is we feel safe.  I think a little reflection will show us that the reason we feel safe from invasion is largely, at any rate, because we rely upon the protection of the British Navy, uncongenial as that thought may be to Deputies opposite.</P>
    <P>I do not know any excuse we could possibly have for indulging in expenditure on armaments unless, indeed, we were to take literally the metaphors so popular with Deputies opposite in regard to the alleged fight we are making for the liberty of this country. If these expressions were to be taken literally, no doubt we should stop at once wasting our money on bounties to get our goods into the British market, and doing many other things that are not at all consistent with the relations that would exist if there really was a fight.  We would not be having large sums of State money invested in British securities, and we would be spending money in building up armaments and preparing for the day when we would advance on the Six Counties and wrest them away by force from the British Commonwealth.  But, of course, these metaphors are nonsense, and they are not to be taken literally, and if we are not spending money on armaments it is not because of any special virtue with which we are endowed, but because there is obviously no object that we have to gain by spending money on armaments.  In point of fact, as Deputy McGilligan mentioned a few minutes ago, we are spending a great deal more money on armaments than the President and the Minister for Finance thought proper when they were in opposition.</P>
    <P>We are in no position to sneer at the world in general because of the madness that infects them.  We have had less excuse here for being led away by erroneous political and economic conceptions than other nations.  The madness with which the world has been infected, as the Minister for Finance <Col N="899" /> himself indicated in his oration, includes an absurd degree of economic nationalism.  There was no excuse for that in our case.  We were not, like other nations, threatened with the loss of our markets.  Our export trade was more secure than the export trade of any other country in the entire world. We are rapidly destroying that export trade by our own folly.  We see not merely a diminution in the total volume of that trade, but a constantly increasing adverse balance, an adverse balance increasing by terrifying leaps and bounds, and the general picture that surrounds this Budget is a picture of a nation forced by its necessities to spend more and more, with no prospect ahead but that of an increased expenditure and, on the other hand, a rapid diminution of the means wherewith to meet that expenditure.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has appealed to us to co-operate with him in maintaining and improving the financial credit of this country.  Nobody is more anxious to see the financial credit of this country on a high footing than the members of the Opposition are.  The last Government when they were in power worked to the very best of their ability to exalt that credit and I do not think that the record of the present Government when they were in Opposition was such as entitled them to give any lectures to us on the attitude that we should now adopt in regard to maintaining as high as it ought to be the credit of this country.  We shall always co-operate and those for whom we stand will always co-operate to secure that the public finances are in the best state in which they can be.  But it would be a false idea of patriotism and a very false policy in the long run for the credit of this State and the prosperity of this country to disguise from ourselves and from our people that the present economic basis of the Government's policy is unsound and must lead in the end to destruction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It struck me in the Minister's speech that he now feels that he is up against realities.  These were inevitable and while I have great <Col N="900" /> sympathy with his concluding remarks yet I am surprised that the Minister and his Government did not give more service to the ends he wants to accomplish as disclosed in his concluding remarks.  Briefly surveying the speech I notice he proposes to tighten up the old age pensions.  I wonder is that a suggestion that he is going to reduce old age pensions, or does it mean that the administration of them has been lax; in other words, that he has known apparently that some people who are not entitled to them are getting old age pensions, or that some people are getting more per week than what they are entitled to?  He must either mean that or he must mean that he must tighten up old age pensions generally. It seems strange to me that there is going to be a further tax on tea and that there are to be Excise duties on sugar.  I think, when the Sugar Bill was before the House, I pointed out to the Minister himself, and to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that the figures on which they were working were not sound.  The bases on which they were working were not sound.  It has now come to their knowledge that those figures were unsound and the Minister admitted it here to-day.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the difficulty in which that Act has placed the country.  However, it is part of the Government's policy.  Without looking carefully into the future the Government rushed the production of all our requirements in sugar.  I am sure Ministers have read the recent findings of the British Sugar Inquiry in which it is set forth that the British Government is paying the entire cost of the production of beet.  That is what their bounties amount to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister finds himself now saddled with the entire machinery of producing all our sugar requirements. He expects to get revenue out of that commodity.  That article is a necessary one for every human being in this country.  It is a necessary article in various manufacturing industries. He proposes to tax it and counts on a certain revenue out of that necessary article of food produced at home, protected by tariffs and with home-produced raw materials <Col N="901" /> for the industry.  I think the Minister will have to get away from the idea of getting any revenue from sugar.  Not only will he have to get away from the idea of getting any revenue from sugar but he will have to acquire the idea of subsidising sugar production so that the people of this country will get sugar at a reasonable price.  The price of 3d. or 3½d. per lb. wholesale for sugar is too high and nobody was more eloquent than the Minister for Finance and the President in enunciating that view to the House and to the country a few years ago.  There is in this Budget a big item of perhaps £100,000. That would be about the figure, I think, of the expenditure on that item last year, but it will not be an item of expenditure this year.  I refer to the bounty on wheat.  In future, I understand, it is the intention of the Government to have legislation that will provide for a percentage mixture of Irish wheat in the flour. The producers of home wheat will compete for that percentage and in that way they will fix their own price. Flour will not be allowed to be milled without having that percentage of Irish wheat in the grist.  In that way the people will have to pay what corresponded to what heretofore was a bounty provided and collected by the Exchequer in taxation.  The public will now have to pay that bounty indirectly in an increased price for their loaf and for their half-stone or stone or cwt. or sack of flour.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  There is nowhere else from which it can come. If a percentage of Irish wheat is to be milled into flour there is no need for a bounty.  Then a certain price must be paid for the milled flour. When that wheat is bought it is mixed with foreign wheat and the mixture is milled into flour.  The consumer then pays in the buying of his loaf.  He pays for the cost of milling plus the profit.  He there pays directly what heretofore was paid by a bounty or its equivalent.  I am only dealing with the principles of how prices will work out in future in an <Col N="902" /> economic way.  Personally, I have no fault to find with that.  I believe it is the better way of doing it.</P>
      <P>I must say that I had sympathy with the concluding remarks of the Minister. Events have happened in Europe in the last couple of months which have changed my outlook on the question of sugar production and wheat growing. I always believed in producing our own sugar and wheat, but I did not think it was sound economics to accelerate the production at a time when the wholesale price of sugar and wheat was so low.  The best wheat is about 12/- or 12/6 per barrel at present, and we have a guaranteed price of 26/-. Normally, and in the conditions that obtained last year, I considered, and would consider now if those conditions still obtained, that it was very bad economics to rush the production of wheat for our own requirements, because we could not produce it at anything like what we could buy it at, and could use the land that we were producing wheat from to a much better advantage by producing other crops. But a new element has come into it. The Minister touched upon that in his concluding remarks and with the views expressed by him I am in 100 per cent. agreement.  What I have in mind is that Germany is now armed and is producing aeroplanes and submarines, and I would not like to see this country in the event of another European war, which seems inevitable, not free to make its own decision whether it should enter that war with Great Britain or stay neutral.  I hope Deputies who think otherwise will visualise the position in which we would find ourselves in the event of a European War, if we were only producing enough wheat to give us bread for a fortnight or a month or two months, or three months.  What position would we be in?</P>

Let us consider <Col N="903" /> the position in 1918 when the question of conscription became acute.  The Deputy's family contributed honourably to the fight against conscription.  Conscription of that kind cannot come again; but supposing we are an independent nation, Great Britain will not have the same responsibility to provide us with flour in the event of a future war as she was during the Great War. We were then part of the United Kingdom; now we are on our own; and we should show foresight in managing our own affairs and our own defence; because I look upon the producing of sufficient wheat as part of the national defence, rather than a part of the national agriculture.  Supposing we found ourselves confronted with the position that we want wheat here to produce flour and we have not got it.  Great Britain could say to us: &ldquo;We will protect the trade routes; we will guarantee you Canadian or Argentine wheat, provided you put 500,000 men at our disposal.&rdquo;  If we were confronted with that position, which seems to me most natural and inevitable, what would be our answer?</P>

      <P>It will.  We are insured, not with the hope or expectation of having a fire, but as a measure of precaution in case we have a fire so that we will not lose all.  That is the position. If Deputies ponder over that well, they will not laugh so much. Some months ago I read on a Sunday morning that Germany was arming&mdash; not but she has a perfect right to arm&mdash;and that she was going to have submarines.  The rest of them would like to stop her, but nobody is going to stop her.  She is going to have submarines whether they like it or not.  If it comes to a European war Germany will not look to see whether the tricolour is floating from the boat bringing us wheat; she is going to sink it at sight. We do not want to be short of three square meals a day.  We do not want to have the black loaves we had before. We are not sure of having sufficient flour unless we grow wheat ourselves. Because of that, I say that not only is this policy sound from the point of view of national defence, but this policy should be accelerated at all possible speed.  It is a cheap national insurance. I will be delighted to see Deputies who take an opposite view to that in the course of this debate putting their cards on the table.</P>

That percentage should be such as would be measured <Col N="906" /> by the area under cultivation and the reports on the crops coming up to harvest time.  It can be easily mapped out, but I would remind the Minister that there is a hidden saving there to the Exchequer.  There has been no relief in taxation, and I take it that if this legislation which I have heard of comes&mdash;I forget whether the Minister referred to it in his speech&mdash;it will be the fixed policy of the Government and the Minister is going to save the amount which last year he paid in bounties.  There is, however, no corresponding relief in taxation.  I should like the Minister to tell us, when replying, why there is not that saving in expenditure.</P>

      <P>I wonder has the Minister convinced himself that sugar and tea are able to bear taxation.  I think the wholesale price of sugar before this was 3d. per lb.  That is too much.  I quite agree that the cost of production of beet sugar does not warrant selling it at a price lower than that, but I think it is too much to put the tax on that.  It is not good economics to impose a tax on a native product and a product which enters so largely into the food of the people and also enters so largely into industry as a raw material.  I suppose the Minister is committed to it now, but if there is any chance of his retracing his steps, he should consider it very closely.  We will have to pay more for our smokes, but I will leave that there.</P>
      <P>I will not take the Minister into the sobering effect of taxes on spirits and so on, but he is going to borrow for bounties.  We have been told several times that the farmer is getting back the double payment of the land annuities&mdash;and the double payment is not denied&mdash;in bounties.  Now, if the farmer is to be told: &ldquo;You will get bounties but you will have to pay your annuities two or three times and we will borrow on your credit; you will have to pay your share in the future; we are going to float a loan and we will pay you bounties out of that.&rdquo; the farmer will begin to wonder how many more times he will have to pay his annuities.  Surely if equity enters into this at all, the farmer should get in bounties the equivalent of the British special duties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not develop that point beyond saying that it strikes me as peculiar that when certain moneys are falling into the Exchequer, which, generally speaking, could be used to <Col N="908" /> provide bounties, the Minister finds it necessary to borrow to provide those bounties.  I do not want to develop that any further, as I appreciate, as the Minister has said, that further opportunities will be afforded for going more deeply into it and I suppose we will get ample opportunity, in the various subsidiary debates to this, to say all we have to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to make one or two remarks, and will reserve any analysis of the various parts of the Budget for a future occasion.  I must say that I welcome the changed attitude of the Minister for Finance, and his conversion to the principle that, as in Great Britain, we should vie with each other in inculcating confidence in the public finance.  That, in my view, is one of the most heartening things in the Budget.  There are other matters in the Budget statement about which the same cannot be said.  I wish to enter my protest against the imposition of a tax on tea and sugar, and the continuation of the tax on coal.  Those are commodities which enter very largely into the home economics of the working class people of this country. As the Government pretends to have so much sympathy and solicitude for the working people of the country, I was rather disappointed that the Minister could not see his way not to interfere in any way with the present position with regard to tea, and to refrain from taxing it to the extent of 4d. to 6d. per lb.  The Minister in the first portion of his Budget speech appeared to me to be making quite an apology for past misdeeds.  He spoke about our credit being as high as any in Europe.  I agree with him that it should be, and were it not for the activities of the Minister and some of his colleagues when they were in opposition the credit of this country would stand still higher.  It was frequently pointed out to the Minister himself when he was in opposition that he was crying down the credit of this country on every available opportunity which presented itself from time to time in this House.  I do not want to repeat <i>ad nauseam</i> the proclamation of the Minister that he was going to reduce the taxation of this country <Col N="909" /> by £2,000,000 per annum.  We all know that that promise has never been fulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one matter to which, notwithstanding the jokes of the Minister about mixing his tea with whiskey&mdash;I do not think he takes whiskey, by the way&mdash;I should like to refer.  The liquor taxes produced £108,000 less than they did in the previous year.  It appears to me that this industry will one of these days go out of existence altogether if it decreases at the progressive rate shown by the lesser tax being produced from it.  A number of people were expecting&mdash;possibly they might be considered optimists&mdash;some reduction in the liquor duty this year. However, in the present state of the finances of the country, and the large cost of public and social services, I suppose I am not exaggerating when I say they were optimists.  Again, the fact that the Minister finds it necessary to tax tobacco to the extent of 8d. per lb. is another very unwelcome feature of the Budget.  In conclusion, I want to say in regard to the peroration of the Minister when he referred to armaments, etc.&mdash;he spoke about the speeding of the plough and made certain references to other countries arming themselves to the teeth&mdash;surely the Minister must not have looked over his own shoulder.  In this little country we had one small army, but we were not satisfied until we got another army.  I wonder does the Minister contemplate now taking a lesson from Deputy Belton's speech about what is going to happen to us in the next war, and his rather intriguing statement about insurance and not having a fire. Is he contemplating building any boats to supplement the &ldquo;Muirchu,&rdquo; or building any airships?  I admit, of course, that an intensive wheat cultivation is a very useful thing and is a kind of national insurance, but there are other kinds of national insurance which we enjoyed for a considerable time, and I am wondering, in the event of this terrible and disastrous war which Deputy Belton spoke about a moment ago, whether, even with our two armies and the Navy, consisting of the &ldquo;Muirchu,&rdquo; we would have any <Col N="910" /> protection against invasion by any of those various powers with all their wonderful armaments.  I must confess my disappointment at the continuation of the tax on coal and the other articles which I have mentioned.  I do seriously hope that this will be the last Budget in which we will see those commodities taxed to the present extent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  That Section 7 of the Finance Act, 1932 (No. 20 of 1932), shall not apply to any stock, share, or security issued after the passing of the Act giving statutory effect to this Resolution unless the certificate of the Minister for Finance under sub-section (2) of that section certifies that (in addition to the conditions set out in the said sub-section (2) ) the following condition is complied with in relation to such stock, share, or security, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(e)  that such stock, share, or security is or was issued by a company of which&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  the issued shares are, to an extent exceeding one half (in nominal value) thereof in the beneficial ownership of a person who is, or of two or more persons each of whom is, either a qualified person or a qualified holding company, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  at least two-thirds (in nominal value) of every class of shares issued and carrying voting rights (whether immediate or to arise in certain future circumstances) are in the beneficial ownership of a person who is, or of two or more persons each of whom is, either a qualified person or a qualified holding company, and</P>
      <P>(iii)  a majority of the directors (other than a managing director giving the whole of his time to his duties as such director) are qualified persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  That, without prejudice to the provisions of sub-section (4) of the said Section 7 of the Finance Act, 1932, any stock, share, or security (issued after the passing of the Act giving statutory effect to this Resolution) to which that section applies shall cease to be a stock, share, or security (as the case may be) to which the said Section 7 applies if and when the Minister for Finance certifies <Col N="919" /> in relation to such stock, share, or security that he is satisfied, after consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that the company by which such stock, share, or security was issued has ceased to comply with the condition set out in the first paragraph of this Resolution</P>
    <P>(3)  That in this Resolution&mdash;</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;qualified person&rdquo; means a person who is a citizen of Saorstát Eireann, and the expression &ldquo;qualified holding company&rdquo; means a company of which&mdash;</P>

    <P>(ii)  at least two-thirds (in nominal value) of every class of shares issued and carrying voting rights whether immediate or to arise in certain future circumstances) are in the beneficial ownership of a qualified person or persons.</P>
    <P>Under Section 7 of the Finance Act of 1932, certain tax concessions are granted to Saorstát subscribers to public companies.  The purpose of this Resolution is to bring the terms of that concession more into conformity with the Control of Manufactures Act and the Citizenship and Aliens Acts.  It is being tightened up to restrict companies in respect of which this concession is granted so that they will be, in fact, as far as we can make them, purely Saorstát companies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  such individual shall not be entitled to any allowance in respect <Col N="920" /> of earned income under Section 16 of the Finance Act, 1920, as amended by sub-section (1) of Section 3 of the Finance Act, 1932 (No. 20 of 1932);</P>

    <P>(c)  such individual shall not be entitled to the benefit of the provision contained in Section 23 of the Finance Act, 1920, as amended by sub-section (4) of the said Section 3 of the Finance Act, 1932, whereby the first hundred pounds of taxable income is chargeable at half the standard rate of tax in certain circumstances;</P>
    <P>(d)  such person shall not be entitled to any relief under Section 32 of the Income Tax Act, 1918.</P>
    <P>(2)  That where an individual who is not resident in Saorstát Eireann proves to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  that he is a citizen of Saorstát Eireann, or</P>
    <P>(b)  that he is resident outside Saorstát Eireann for the sake or on account of his health or the health of a member of his family resident with him or because of some physical infirmity or disease in himself or any such member of his family, and that, previous to such residence outside Saorstát Eireann, he was resident in Saorstát Eireann, or</P>
    <P>(c)  that he is a citizen, subject, or national of a country of which the citizens, subjects, or nationals are for the time being exempted by an Order made under Section 10 of the Aliens Act, 1935 (No. 14 of 1935), from any provision or provisions of that Act or of an aliens order made thereunder, or</P>

    <P>the next preceding paragraph of this Resolution shall not apply to such individual, but no such allowance, deduction, or other benefit as is mentioned in the said paragraph shall, in the case of such individual, be so given as to reduce the amount of the income tax payable by him below the amount which bears the same proportion to the amount of tax which would be payable by him if the tax were chargeable on his total income from all sources (including income which is not subject to Saorstát Eireann income tax) as the portion of his income which is subject to Saorstát Eireann income tax bears to his total income from all sources.</P>
    <P>(3)  That any person who is aggrieved by a decision of the Revenue Commissioners under this Resolution may appeal therefrom to the Special Commissioners.</P>

    <P>This is another Resolution arising out of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act and the Aliens Act.  It relates to those cases in which allowances are granted under the Double Taxation Agreement and it does not make any change in existing law <Col N="922" /> beyond such consequential changes as may be effected by the Acts of the Oireachtas.</P>

    <P>This is an omnibus Resolution imposing a number of miscellaneous industrial duties.  I think in regard to these duties it will be found that the commodities are comparatively unimportant and that the alterations which are being made are trivial in themselves, though we expect to get about £40,000 or so from them.  They are not imposed as revenue duties but as protective measures.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="947" /> This Resolution imposes various import duties, some of them specific and some <i>ad valorem.  Ad valorem</i> duties are being imposed in those cases where there are wide ranges of qualities and consequent differences in prices as regards the articles affected. In such cases the incidence of a specific duty would be inequitable.  The articles are set out in the Schedule.</P>

      <P>Three pence per cwt. Why not take the money out of the Road Fund?  Does the Minister think it a very desirable thing to levy 2/- per cwt. on rice?  Rice is a commodity that is used almost exclusively by people in modest circumstances.  It is a valuable food.  The Minister taxes bread, tea, sugar, practically everything that the people of this country must consume, and now he is putting a tax on rice.  Why is the Minister putting a tax on dried peas?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to get some reason from the Minister for Schedule Part I, reference 1&mdash;Asphalt, bitumen, pitch, and tar of all kinds.  What is the object of putting a tariff on these?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am certainly a protectionist, but I do not want to kill the idea of protection by tariffs for revenue purposes.  It is the very antithesis of national protection.  The Minister knows that tar enters into all road making except concrete roads.  I notice that the Minister for Industry and Commerce put 5/- a ton on cement a couple of days ago.  Where is the need for that?  Local authorities are the principal users of these commodities that the Minister proposes to tax.</P>

With regard to the increased rates on the fruits mentioned in paragraph (b), they are being imposed for revenue purposes.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a duty on wheat, and it is only fair to point out that at the present time the people are being charged 36/- a sack for bakers' flour. The same flour, after the levy is paid on it, is obtainable in Belfast and Liverpool at 27/-.  It means that the consumers of bread in this country are paying £1,350,000 a year in order to finance the wheat scheme of this Government.  I think it is right, when we are going to add a further tax on bread, that the people should realise that over and above the 5/- they pay on imported wheat they are paying £1,350,000 per annum on their bread already in taxes to the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>

      <Col N="993" /> This Resolution provides for an increase of 8d. per lb. in the basic rate of the customs duty on unmanufactured tobacco.  Of course the increase will be passed on to the consumer.  We anticipate a total increase of £160,000 in the yield from these duties.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That, in the case of a person dying after the passing of the Act giving statutory effect to this Resolution, property which was previously subject to an annuity or other periodical payment limited to cease on the death of such deceased person shall, notwithstanding that such annuity or other periodical payment had been surrendered, assured, divested, or otherwise disposed of (whether for value or otherwise) in the lifetime of such deceased person to or for the benefit of the person entitled to such property, be deemed for the purposes of Part I of the Finance Act, 1894, to pass on the death of such deceased person to the extent of the benefit which would accrue from the cesser of such annuity or other periodical payment unless&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1014" /> (a)  such surrender, assurance, divesting, or disposition was <i>bona fide</i> made or effected at least three years before the death of such deceased person, and</P>
    <P>(b)  such deceased person was not, at any time within three years before his death, in receipt of any substituted annuity or other periodical payment limited to cease on his death and secured (whether by contract or otherwise) to him in return for such surrender, assurance, divesting, or disposition.</P>
    <P>This Resolution is designed to meet losses on estate duty which arise in cases such as the following:&mdash;A, before his death settled property on B, subject to an annuity payable to C for life.  If C continues to enjoy the annuity up to his death there is deemed to be a passing, on the occasion of C's death, of the property needed to provide the annuity, and a claim for estate duty arises accordingly. If, however, C for some reason, for example, on his death-bed, takes legal steps to release the annuity in favour of B, there will be no claim for estate duty when the death occurs. This Resolution is designed to enable a claim for duty to be made in a case in which an annuity is released in the same way as such a claim can at present be made in which life interests are released.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £27,238 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1936, for the Salaries and other Expenses in connection with Wireless Broadcasting (No. 45 of 1926).</P>
      <P>The amount of the Estimate for the Broadcasting Service for the year 1935-36 is £40,838, as compared with £38,796 for 1934-35 showing an increase of £2,042 mainly under sub-head B, which provides for expenditure on programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The revenue from wireless receiving licences last year amounted to about £34,000 showing an increase of about £7,500.  On the 1st October last the £5 licence fee for hotels, restaurants, and other public places, as well as the £1 licence fee for schools or institutions, were abolished and an all-round licence fee of 10s. was introduced.  It is anticipated that there will be no loss of <Col N="1016" /> revenue as a result of the reduction in the fees, owing to the increasing number of licences being taken out as a consequence of the reduction.</P>
    <P>Fees for advertisements and miscellaneous receipts amounted to £13,600, which shows a reduction of £9,200 compared with the previous year.  The general policy in regard to advertising programmes was reviewed in the course of the year in the light of the experience gained, and the present policy is to accept only advertisements relating to Saorstát products and enterprises. This involves a reduction in revenue, but there are obvious objections on the grounds of national policy to the broadcasting of non-Saorstát advertisements from State stations.  The total Broadcasting revenue amounted to £47,600. The direct expenditure on the Broadcasting Service out of Votes last year amounted to about £47,500, so that direct Broadcasting revenue and direct Vote expenditure were about equal.</P>
    <P>The number of wireless licences issued last year was 66,200, which represents an increase of 15,200 over the previous year.  The number of licences in the current financial year may reach 76,000, showing an increase of about 10,000.  Special Inspectors are employed throughout the country in detecting licence defaulters, with very good results, and a large number of defaulters were prosecuted during the year.</P>
    <P>The estimated revenue from licence fees in the year 1935-36 has been estimated at £35,000, and from advertisements at £10,000, but if the present rate of increase of licences continues and the receipts from advertisements are maintained the total revenue may reach about £50,000.</P>
    <P>The direct Vote expenditure during the year is estimated at £49,713, and it will be seen, therefore, that the revenue from licences alone without the advertising revenue, which is an uncertain item, would fall far short of the Vote expenditure.</P>
    <P>I have to explain, moreover, that there is no Commercial Account for Broadcasting, as there is for the Post Office, and in considering total expenditure <Col N="1017" /> on the Broadcasting Service it is necessary, in addition to the direct Vote expenditure, to allow for capital charges in respect of cost of erection of stations, interest, depreciation, etc., which can be provided for only out of general Exchequer revenue.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of criticism of the programmes.  Much of this criticism is perhaps unreasonable and reflects only individual views, but when criticism is constructive and helpful it is always very sympathetically considered by the director and every possible effort is made, so far as circumstances allow, to meet the views expressed if it appears that these represent the opinions of a considerable body of listeners and that their adoption would be likely to improve the general standard of programmes.</P>
    <P>There has, in particular, been much criticism of the broadcasting news service in the Press recently.  The provision of a satisfactory news service is, however, very difficult, owing to the fact that there is no general news collecting and distributing agency in the Saorstát and the cost of setting up a broadcasting news organisation throughout the country on the lines of a newspaper reporting service would be prohibitive.</P>
    <P>Efforts were made some years ago to secure a news service through the newspapers but a satisfactory arrangement could not be come to at the time.  The whole question of the news is, however, being examined afresh and it is hoped that in a short time an improved service will be given.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that much of the criticism directed against the programmes is based on the assumption that the revenue from wireless licences more than covers the entire cost of the broadcasting service but this is of course quite incorrect as is clear from the figures which I have already given.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the criticism, however, I have no hesitation in asserting that there has been an all <Col N="1018" /> round steady, although admittedly slow, progress both in the scope of the programmes and the general standard of their presentation, and I can only promise that special efforts will be made during the course of the coming year to effect a considerable all round improvement.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware Dr. Kieran, who has been Secretary of the High Commissioner's Office, has been appointed Director of Broadcasting and he is at present engaged in looking into the whole organisation of the service.  It will be observed that provision has been made in the Estimate for a production manager. This matter has been held up for some time pending the appointment of a new director, but it is now intended to fill this post on a temporary basis for an experimental period until the director has had an opportunity of examining the staffing arrangements generally in the Dublin Station.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I wish to refer to the recent reversion of Mr. Clandillon to his parent Department from which he had been seconded to the broadcasting service.  Mr. Clandillon undertook the arduous task of organisation of the programme side of the broadcasting service on the opening of the Dublin station and I am glad to take this opportunity of expressing appreciation of his valuable service as director, under difficult circumstances during the past nine years.  I may explain that the reason for the change in the directorship is that having regard to the nature of the duties of the position it appears desirable as a matter of general policy that changes in the programme control should be made occasionally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>At the risk of being classed as one of the individuals criticising the programmes from our national broadcasting service, I am moving &ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration,&rdquo; and frankly, if I were to express what I really feel about the broadcasting service, and not only what I feel but what most people in this country who <Col N="1019" /> have wireless sets and who try to listen in and who want to listen in to our own broadcasting station feel, I am afraid that I would be called to order by you, Sir, very quickly.  I am quite prepared to admit to the Minister that there has been a certain amount of progress made in the last few months, but, frankly, we have got to face the fact that this is supposed to be a national broadcasting service, that our programmes are listened to not only by the people of this country but, it is to be hoped, if we have a proper national broadcasting service, by the people of other countries.  So far as I am concerned, I would be heartily ashamed that people in other countries should listen to some of the programmes that are broadcast from some of our stations.  It is hard to describe one's feelings on some occasions with regard to this service.  The Minister said that there were individual criticisms, but that they were only individual points of view.  I venture to say that there is no branch of the Government administration of which you can have such unanimous condemnation as you get of this.</P>
      <P>The Minister talked about the difficulty of providing a proper news service.  I think it would be a decent thing to abolish what is supposed to be a news service altogether if there cannot be a very distinct improvement on what is now called the news service. It is not only the news, but even the presentation of the news that I complain of.  To be told on Sunday night &ldquo;I have no news to-night,&rdquo; I think is laughable; it is ridiculous.  We were told on many Sunday nights that there was no news when we knew well from the Sunday papers and from the morning papers that there were matters of importance happening in this and other countries that should have been available to users of wireless.</P>

    <P>There is another point that I wish to raise again.  I raised the matter on the Vote for the Office of Public Works. It is one of the numerous little irritants that we have to put up with.  When the announcer is giving the news, such as it is, you have talk, laughing, shifting <Col N="1020" /> of musical instruments, apparently by those who are to follow.  The talk apparently comes from the studio; perhaps doors are left open.  On some occasions you cannot get important parts of the news.  These are matters, it seems to me, for which there can be no real excuse.</P>
    <P>With regard to the programmes, I realise that one of the great difficulties &mdash;perhaps what has been largely if not wholly responsible for the quality of the programmes from Athlone&mdash;is that the service is being starved for want of sufficient money.  A director of production should have been appointed long ago.  Even now we are told that we may get a director of production on a temporary basis.  There is not the slightest necessity for anyone to buy the <i>Irish Radio News</i> or to look at the radio columns of the newspapers to see what we will get from Dublin, Athlone or Cork.  There is to be a bit of a change to-night; we are going to have the Minister for Finance.  Even that will be welcome.  It will give some idea of how people welcome any little bit of a change.  The sameness of the programmes night after night is most remarkable.  Without looking at the <i>Radio News</i> one can tell exactly what is coming on.  I am quite prepared to admit that it is impossible for anybody to please everybody.  People have different tastes.  I wish especially to refer to the traditional music.  There is a very definite demand for that, more especially in the country.  Personally, I should like to hear more than 15 or 20 minutes of ceilidhe music from the Mansion House on Sunday nights.  There is no reason why we could not get at least half-an-hour of it.  There are very many people, particularly in the rural areas, who enjoy that class of music and want it.  I am not a judge of music, I can only praise what appeals to me.  Many of the violinists or fiddlers I have listende to were exceptionally good in my opinion, but I do not know how some of the others ever got to the microphone.  I often heard infinitely better on a fair evening.</P>

      <P>The Deputy, I am sure, was often in town on a fair evening and he knows quite well what I mean.  There is another important matter about which there is a good deal of controversy.  Sunday is a day on which most people in this country are at liberty to sit down and listen to the programmes.  What do we get from our national broadcasting service?  We have gramophone records from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.  The less said about some of the gramophone records the better.  But after 3 p.m. there is a complete close-down, until 8.30 p.m.  I want to suggest to the Minister that that should be remedied.  So far as the ordinary household in the country is concerned, from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. on a Sunday is about the busiest part of the day, when the principal meal is being prepared.  It is from 3 o'clock, particularly in winter time, that people would have most opportunity to enjoy the programmes.  The same thing applies to week-days.  From 6.30 p.m., unless you are a native Irish speaker or pretty fluent at German or French, the broadcasting service is of no use to you.  You have nothing until about 8 o'clock and the station closes down at 10.30 p.m.  I want to say frankly that were it not for the sponsored programmes it would not be worth while tuning into Athlone at all.  That is, perhaps, a very hard thing to say; perhaps it will be said that I am unduly harsh and critical of our own station. It is because I want to see it improved. I think it is right that we should be critical of our own programmes.  They are supposed to represent the culture of this country.  They are being listened to by people in other parts of the world.  It seems to me from what the Minister has stated that the new director, Dr. Kiernan, is not going to get a fair chance.  In my opinion, he has not sufficient money to get the proper material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know quite well that you will not get good material in this country unless you pay for it.  The Minister tells us there was an increase of £15,000 last year.  We have 66,000 licences.  There would probably be four times that many if wireless and <Col N="1022" /> broadcasting were not being killed at the source by the Government through heavy taxes or duties.  There will, however, be another time in which to refer to that.  What I want now to get the Minister to realise is this, that broadcasting is either a national service or it is not.  If broadcasting is a national service it should be a national service worthy of this country, a service of which we should be proud.  In that case we should finance the service.  Otherwise we ought to scrap it.  I am satisfied that the majority of listeners-in in this country very rarely listen to Athlone.  They tune-in to other stations abroad.  The Minister may say that that is far-fetched.  It is not. I have been told on numerous occasions, and I am sure the Minister can ascertain the same thing from his friends in city or country, that they very rarely tune-in to Athlone. The programmes may be improved, can be improved, but they can never be improved, in my opinion, without additional staff and more money.</P>
    <P>I want to get back to the news service on this station, because that is a very important feature of the broadcasting. That service at present only exists in name.  The service is bad, the presentation of the news is not good and, as a matter of fact, there is not one bit of originality about the programmes from beginning to end. You can tune-in any night at any particular hour and you will know exactly what you will hear.  I am sure, from what we know of Dr. Kiernan, that he will do his best, but Dr. Kiernan, no more than his predecessor, can give you first-class programmes and first-class news service unless provided with the two essentials &mdash;money and staff.  Unless these are provided you cannot get a broadcasting service worthy of being called a broadcasting service.</P>

      <P>About two years ago when the Athlone Station was about being completed we were viewing the situation in this House and examining the prospects for the future. The Minister's predecessor in office <Col N="1023" /> replied and I recollect what he said. With that sanctimonious gravity that is characteristic of him he told the House that this station when completed would be a credit to this State, to its culture, and to its educational life.  That is two years ago.  I wonder is there anybody, the most enthusiastic admirer of that station, daring enough to-day to say that it is a credit to the cultural life of this State?  Let us be quite frank about it.  Before I go on to deal with that I would like to join in the tribute that has been paid to Mr. Clandillon by the Minister.  He is a man who undertook a very big job.  He undertook it with enthusiasm, with the enthusiasm that is characteristic of him all his life as an Irish Nationalist and Gael.  I join with the Minister in paying a tribute to the service he rendered under great difficulty.  The shortcomings of the station are not in their essence due to him.  They are due to the causes referred to by Deputy Morrissey&mdash;lack of money and lack of staff. About two years ago when the station was nearing completion I suggested to the then Minister that any money required to make this a first-class station should be voted irrespective of what the sum was.  Either that or the station should be closed down.  I still hold that view.  It is appalling when you listen-in to Athlone.  You are forced within three or four minutes to go to the keyboard and switch on to some other station.  That perhaps is putting it in an extreme way if you like, but that is what people do. People do not want to hear Athlone at all.  You have either to close down the station or make it a success.  The Minister apologised for himself.  He said the news system was due to the fact that they had no separate news agency in this State.  He is a very innocent man.  No wonder he gets the name of being a decent fellow. There is a Government employee in this State drawing £1,000 a year and I understand he has an additional staff in the Government Bureau.  What is he doing?  What is he getting £1,000 a year for?  In the broadcasting station you believe only in having a temporary man for the news service for the <Col N="1024" /> station.  Cannot this man who is employed in Merrion Street drawing £1,000 a year be put on to this broadcasting news service?</P>

      <P>Because of the fact that no definite expenditure can be undertaken with regard to this station it will be difficulty to make it a first-class station.  Everything about it is temporary.  And now the Minister is to make a temporary appointment in the case of the man who is to supply the news service.  Does anybody expect success from a temporary man? Let the Minister get a first-class man, pay him a first-class salary and make him permanent.  Then you will be going the way of making it a success. The present method is only tinkering. Success is not to be got by policy of that kind.  You are going on tinkering and tinkering and then on Sundays you have those horrible gramophone programmes from one to three o'clock. What is the position of the people in rural Ireland?  One half of the family go out in the morning to the eight o'clock Mass and by the time they reach home the other half of the family is going out to the last Mass.  These latter get home between one and two o'clock.  It is three o'clock by the time dinner is over.  It is during these hours that the station is giving a series of records when no one has time to listen to them.  When the family is ready to sit down to the wireless the station is closed down.  That surely is not good <Col N="1025" /> business.  I wonder how the Minister expects the station to be a success under such a system.  It is just during the time when the people are busy about getting the dinner and when one half of the family is not in the house that the station is giving its programmes. That is the time the records are broadcast.  Does the Minister think he can make the potatoes boil to the tune of the records?</P>
      <P>Apparently, the Minister is afraid to fight for these two Departments of which he is in charge.  He is afraid to give his Departments a chance.  He is afraid to stand up to the Minister for Finance and say: &ldquo;I am in this job; I am your colleague; you may make your job a success by gathering in taxes; but if I am to hold this job, I am going to make a success of it, and the money has to come from somewhere.&rdquo; I should like to hear from the Minister what money he would actually require to make this an assured success. I would rather he should tell us that than tell us how much revenue came in and how much money went out.  As I said two years ago, I would prefer to see the station closed down if it is not made a success.  I should like the Minister to tell the House what amount of money would give us a first-class station with first-class programmes and ask the House what they think about that.  If it is anyway reasonable, I venture to think that the House will agree to vote that sum, or otherwise will agree to close down the station. We get this news of the day at 10.30 at night and it occupies about two minutes.  I thing it is disgraceful.  All we get is a couple of mean, petty and miserable items and then it closes down.  All the news of the world is gathered in by that time and should be available.  A selection should be taken from that and given to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although I am not a music critic, I join with Deputy Morrissey in saying that there should be an acid test applied to the musical selections broadcast. No one should be allowed to slip through except first-class musicians.  I join with him also in asking that there should be better selections of traditional <Col N="1026" /> music.  Of course, the country generally is over-run with experts on traditional music.  Anybody who knows anything about it poses as expert and thinks he should be heard on the wireless.  They are like the people of this country generally who think they are all fit to be presidents, generals and ministers.  All those who know anything about traditional music think they are first-class and should be heard on the wireless.  I think the selectors should apply a very rigid test and that nobody should be permitted to broadcast except those of the very highest standard.  It would be good for the people who want to hear it and it would make these people, who are fairly good, improve themselves before they come along and inflict this unfinished product at us&mdash;this half-boiled stuff.</P>
    <P>The Minister, as in the case of the Post Office last week, is engaged in a balancing feat.  We heard no word about borrowing from him in order to get efficiency.  The Minister for Finance this evening was not afraid to throw out his chest and ask for millions; and that was not to benefit anybody outside this State.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has to send this all over the world as evidence of the cultured standard of this country and he is afraid to ask for a few thousand pounds.  The Minister for Finance, if he cannot get sufficient money directly, asks for power to borrow.  I ask the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to stiffen his back a bit and ask for funds to make this a success.  Let us try at least for one year and see what spending money will do and whether we can get something that will be a credit to the country.  If we cannot get something that will be a credit to the country, let us scrap the station.</P>
    <P>I should like again to refer to the previous Director, Mr. Clandillon.  I certainly would not like it to be thought, as many people throughout the country may think, that the failure has been due to him and that in consequence of his failure he was called upon to resign.  So far as I am concerned and, I am sure, most of the other Deputies in the House, that is <Col N="1027" /> not the opinion held of him.  Any shortcomings there were, were not due to him, but to the starvation of the station from the point of view of funds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a word with regard to the position of the Irish language in the broadcasting programmes.  I have a Bill before me, which the House will be discussing in a day or two, and which provides that where an industrial employer pays a worker by piecework there shall be hung up in every room in which industrial work is carried out a piecework particulars placard which shall be in both Irish and English.  We insist that railway tickets and such things shall be printed in Irish and English and, generally, there is a policy being pursued in the country which accepts that the Irish language is a living language with the people and that it is a medium of thought and expression at least equal to anything coming over the wireless.  Nevertheless, we have the position that while news is broadcast twice a day, and while we make provision that piecework placards and lots of other things must be in Irish and English, no news bulletin is sent out from the Broadcasting Station in Irish.  The news bulletin has been criticised here.  I do not want to go into that, but we hope it will be improved in future.  I am simply discussing the matter from the point of view of the future.  I was going to suggest that the earlier news might be broadcast in Irish and that the material in it should be worth listening to; and that the later news bulletin, perhaps, could be in English and perhaps sent out at 10 o'clock rather than at 10.30.  It does seem an extraordinary thing that in a country which is pursuing the language policy that we are pursuing here in the schools and in legislation, the language does not appear to be fit to report the news.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of the matter to which I should like to refer.  Such broadcasts as are given in the Irish language are to the extent of 90 or 95 per cent. nothing but an advertisement <Col N="1028" /> that the Irish language as a medium of expression or as a musical language should be scrapped, because the material dealt with in the broadcasts in Irish is hardly worth listening to, and the type of broadcast&mdash;the diction, the phraseology and the swing of the language&mdash;does not represent the living speech that people in the country recognise.</P>
    <P>The Minister has, and, no doubt, many members of the House, have sat down by the fireside in an Irish cottage or stood in the countryside in the Irish-speaking districts and listened to discussions going on there on nearly every subject under the sun.  Their own experience would tell them what Fr. O'Leary, in the preface he has written to the <i>Táin Bó Cuailgne</i>, declares to be a fact with regard to the language, that it is a vigorous and racy language. In the preface he describes two old men who had a dispute and who came to argue the matter with him and he tells of the beauty and vigour of the language which these men used in dealing with their case and the deep way in which they followed the intricacies of their arguments and their thought in dealing with the matter.  He compared the speaking and address to their subject and the ground covered by these two men with those of some of the very prominent and, one might say, world political figures of the time whose capacity for speech-making Fr. O'Leary was aware of.  His description of the capacity and range of the language and its vigour only bears out what anybody who has, as I say, sat down in an Irish-speaking district, where the language is a living thing, can bear out from his own experience.</P>
    <P>The language which we hear, however, from speakers who are permitted to broadcast Irish essays or Irish contributions over the radio is a very different thing.  It is a structure made up of rough lumps of crudely-put-together concrete compared with a building on which there was architectural design and splendid workmanship employed.  It is a fact that if the Irish language, as a medium of expression or a musical language, is nothing <Col N="1029" /> better than what we hear over the radio, we certainly do require an inquiry into whether what we are doing with regard to our legislation here and with regard to our tram tickets and railway tickets and particularly what we are doing in the schools, is not all utter waste of time and all utterly wrong.  I think this is a matter that requires the very special thought of the new director.</P>
    <P>There is a desire amongst the people in the country to improve their musical knowledge and to raise the musical standard in the country.  The position of music in our primary schools has been very neglected, and bad, in the past.  I am told that it is improving in the secondary schools, but the complaint can be made that we have no top to our musical education in this country at all.  There are a certain number of institutions working on their own, but there is no co-ordination of them and the Department of Education hardly provides any top.  In circumstances like those people, particularly in country districts, have to grope ahead to assist themselves in the best possible way to advance both their capacity to deal with an instrument and their musical appreciation.  There is one thing which the Minister could perhaps arrange to have done through the radio and that is to make himself, to some extent, an information bureau for persons in the country who, hearing music of a class with which they wish to make themselves more familiar, could write to the Broadcasting Director and ask where that piece of music could be obtained.  It would be a small matter, but it is really the only means that many people from the country have for following up their musical inclinations along the lines they wish to pursue.  If something could be done along those lines, the Minister would find that he was of considerable assistance to a much greater number of people throughout the country than he might expect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister will admit that broadcasting in this country has not reached the standard of excellence which we all desire so much.  It is really time that we recognised <Col N="1030" /> that it has gone beyond the experimental stage, and that the thing must be attacked boldly if we are going to catch up with other countries. One item to which I want to refer is the broadcasting of traditional music. That is a matter in which I am very interested and, as a matter of fact, I was a performer in that direction myself at one time.  I must say I think it is very undesirable that night after night and week after week the same programmes should be broadcast&mdash;they may be a little mixed up, and you may get No. 1 to-night and No. 6 the next night&mdash;by different players and sometimes very mediocre players.  We get people playing wind and stringed instruments who are not at all good exponents of traditional music, and looking at the broadcasting programme, one finds that to-night some man from Donegal is playing &ldquo;The Flogging Reel,&rdquo; and to-morrow night some man from Clare is playing the same thing. That is really disgusting people down the country.  If it is to be done, it ought to be done well and it is worth doing well.  I merely want to draw the Minister's attention to it and to express the hope that the new director will keep an eye to the matter.  If we want to popularise the traditional music of this country and to have it appreciated, we must give the very best, and only the best, of it and we must have the very best performers, and we must not repeat programmes even though we vary them by calling one No. 1 and another No. 6.  We must tackle the thing properly and systematically before it will come right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Brennan in this matter, and I would ask that we should have more variety so far as traditional music is concerned. As Deputy Brennan says, you have one man playing a thing to-night and another man playing the same thing to-morrow night.  It sounds more like a Feis than anything else, and I suggest that the new director should pay special attention to that.  Another matter about which everybody is complaining is the interruption in the Athlone programmes especially between the hours of 7 o'clock and 10 o'clock. <Col N="1031" /> I think there are two stations, Palermo and Stuttgart, around that wave-length and they are very hard to cut out, no matter how good your set is.  I think some effort ought to be made to get a new wave-length, or whatever is necessary to be done should be done.</P>
      <P>Another matter to which I should like to draw attention is the ridicule into which, in my opinion, the national anthem is brought at the close of the programmes each night.  There is an old record&mdash;it must be about ten years old&mdash;being played night after night. Surely, it should be possible to get the station orchestra to play the national anthem.  We have the national anthem played through the medium of tin-can music&mdash;that is how it sounds to me, at any rate&mdash;night after night and the tempo at which it is played is something like that of jazz music.  It is an insult to the national anthem and to the country to play it under such conditions and if it is not played properly, I should like to see it withdrawn.</P>
      <P>I support Deputy McMenamin so far as Sunday programmes are concerned. Nobody wants to listen to the radio between one o'clock and three o'clock on Sundays.  People have something elso to do, and something else to think of.  If they had a programme between two and four o'clock or between four and six o'clock it would be very much appreciated, especially in winter time. If you switch on to an English station on Sunday evening you get a religious programme&mdash;a religious programme which the people in this country do not want to hear.  The strange thing about it is that if you want to hear a Catholic programme you will not get it from Dublin or Athlone; you have to switch on to supposedly pagan England. During Holy Week, on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, the Athlone Station was turned off and we had to get Holy Week ceremonies from the Continent.  That is a disgraceful state of affairs.  I would call the new director's attention to those matters. If broadcasting is to be made popular in Ireland it is absolutely essential that they should be attended to.</P>

      <P>In regard to this matter, I personally was most interested in the question of the news, and probably that has been dealt with by the previous speakers.  It is positively ridiculous.  I can give the Minister a case in point.  I remember when there was an attack on a Guard on Sunday morning.  I switched on to Athlone that night at 11 o'clock to get further information.  The incident had created a certain amount of excitement in Government circles, I gathered from what occurred afterwards.  I duly heard &ldquo;Irish news.&rdquo;  Then I got: &ldquo;There is no news.&rdquo;  That happens again and again.  So far as news is concerned, I have heard criticism on account of the way in which political matters are reported, but I have not had any experience of that myself and therefore cannot speak on it; but as regards other news, if he listens-in I think the Minister will find it about as exciting and interesting as reading the <i>Iris Oiflgiúil.</i></P>

      <P>I have not the slightest objection to that publication. Probably the Government finds it necessary.  A number of things have to be published in it, but I do not think it has much circulation from an entertainment point of view.  Night after night, when there is a tram strike in Dublin and you want to know what is to be the fate of your feet next day, you hear &ldquo;The Minister for Industry and Commerce has issued a statement,&rdquo; or it may be his colleague the Minister for Agriculture, and then you get a most complicated statement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Minister will recognise that there has to be competition with other services, and some of the competing services are remarkably good.  I know that the task of the new director is an extremely difficult <Col N="1033" /> one, and that his resources are not unlimited.  He must get all the encouragement possible, because the competition he is up against will be remarkably good.  Unless there is an improvement in the Irish programmes I wonder whether it is worth the money we are spending on it, because a great deal of the licence fees would come in if that station were never there, and therefore all the cost of this station is spent on the station.  There is an almost unanimous criticism of it, and unless a great improvement takes place I wonder whether the Minister would not consider a still more drastic method of dealing with the matter.</P>

      <P>I think this is the first time this Estimate was referred back. It is a strange thing that when we are definitely tackling the job and have got a new director this is the occasion chosen for referring the Estimate back.  I think we should at least get a chance now.  It was not easy to get a new director.  We advertised, and did not find anybody considered suitable by the Civil Service Commissioners.  Those things involve delay.  Everyone who has anything to do with a Government Department knows that those things cannot be disposed of right away.  I have said that the whole organisation of the station is being considered.  I admit frankly that the news service can scarcely be called a news service. That is very largely because it would take a great lot of money&mdash;much more than I believe even Deputy McMenamin would be prepared to spend&mdash;to have a really efficient news service, and the most I hope to be able to do is to give a tolerably fair one in the future.  It is all very well to say a guard was shot in Dublin and the news was not broadcast.  He might have been shot in Ballyporeen or somewhere else, and it would be necessary to have a newsagent or Press representative in practically every village in Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is a fact.  I must admit that most of the speeches in regard to this matter have been reasonable: you have to be reasonable and listen to our case.  If we could get what we tried to get a few years ago from the Press here, a news service at a reasonable figure, it would simplify matters, but they would not give it to us.  That was tried in the time of the last Government.  They could not get a news service in this country for local news.  There is no general Press agency in this country as there is in England, and therefore the only alternative would be for our Department to set up something approaching the editorial department of a newspaper.  That would be a very costly thing.</P>
      <P>I have said in the statement that we are going into this whole question again, and are hoping to be able to get a satisfactory Irish news service. We are also trying to get a satisfactory foreign news service.  That is a very difficult thing, too.  We have tried to get it in the past and the figure was prohibitive.  I understand that there is now a chance of getting a reasonably good bulletin twice daily at a much reduced figure, due to the reduction in telephone charges and things of that kind.  Of course all this is going to cost a lot more money. It is the habit of most Oppositions to want all sorts of new services, but when it comes to paying they will not agree to it.  If a Department is paying its way everyone complains about taxing the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admit that the cash question has been an important one.  It has been at the bottom of the whole matter. If there had been plenty of money there may have been a better service, but even if we had twice as much money as we have I think it would be very difficult for&mdash;and very unfair for the House to expect&mdash;a station like ours to compete with the station that they mostly listen to&mdash;the B.B.C. Remember they have at least £1,500,000 for their own services. The total revenue to the Post Office there is from something like 6,700,000 odd licences, and the total amount of <Col N="1035" /> money received was something like £3,390,000.  I say that if any Deputy listened-in to the B.B.C. every night he would get as sick of the B.B.C. as he would of any other station.  If people would only choose their items and not do as Deputy McMenamin did&mdash;switch on; wait for a minute; say: &ldquo;The same old thing again,&rdquo; and switch off&mdash;there would not be so much criticism.  What sort of test is that?  Surely any reasonable man should not expect to judge a station by switching on and off.  I am surprised to hear Deputy McMenamin speaking like that.  I agree with Deputy Mulcahy that the Irish programme is certainly not what it ought to be, but he will realise that there is one difficulty about the news in Irish.  When we do get a better news service the difficulty will be that it will be sent in in English, and unless we are going to have people who are competent Irish speakers sending in the news bi-lingually&mdash;and it will not be easy to get them&mdash;the Deputy will realise the difficulty of having an all-Irish news service.  Is not that what he suggests?</P>

      <P>I do not realise the difficulty at all in looking at a piece of news and putting it straight into the Irish language in a country that considers that Irish ought to be in the position in which it is here to-day and wants to have it in that position.  The Minister does not suggest, I am sure, that there are not dozens of people in Dublin City who could look at a piece of news in English and translate it right off into good Irish.</P>

      <P>As regards news, that is a thing that needs to be delivered almost as it is got.  If it is to be news at all, you cannot send it to the translation department.  Deputy Mulcahy quite rightly expects the best possible service, and I admit it should be secured, but I do not see how it is going to be easy to get a person who will be able to translate what must be handed to him in English, because the news he gets will scarcely be other than in English.  I do not think it will be possible, but if it is possible, we will do <Col N="1036" /> it.  I anticipate great difficulty in getting a news bulletin in Irish.  The editor, whoever he may be, will have to translate it into Irish if it is going to be news.</P>

      <P>I have nearly been hit on a few occasions when I suggested that it was like tinned music.  That shows you how difficult it is to get people to agree on the subject.  I did not know that Deputy Morrissey was such a radio fan.  I thought he was selected to put forward this motion because he was the best loud-speaker on the other side.  I find that that was not the reason at all, and that the Deputy really does know a good deal about the subject.  All the same I think he was not quite fair.  I think he listens-in too continuously to our station or else, like some others of the critics, he has not listened-in for the last six months.  Perhaps, like Deputy McMenamin, when he tuned-in, on one occasion he felt inclined to say: &ldquo;It is the same old thing again that I listened to somewhere else.&rdquo;  There may be occasions when the programmes may not be good, but on the whole I am not prepared to admit that they are <Col N="1037" /> anything like as bad as has been stated here.  If any Deputy cares to go to the broadcasting station he will find testimonials there from all parts of the country and from outside the country also praising our programme.</P>
      <P>All that any Deputy here can say is that he is speaking for himself, and perhaps for a few friends.  It is largely a matter of opinion.  I agree there is need for a general improvement and every effort is being made and will be made to bring the programme to what it ought to be.  I will ask Deputies to bear in mind that they are comparing this station with a station that has almost £2,000,000 per annum.  I must say there has been some misinformed criticism in the Press.  In a leading article in the <i>Irish Times</i> they said that we were actually getting more in licence fees than we were spending on the station.  That is quite wrong.  We never got anything like it.  On this occasion, however, between licence fees and advertisement revenue we about balanced our expenditure with our revenue, but that is about all. Unlike the Post Office Estimate the other day, this is a service for which I will demand that we get as much money as will be necessary to make it what it ought to be.</P>

      <P>We cannot possibly expect to get anything like the revenue of another country, the revenue our neighbours have.  There has been a complaint made about traditional music.  I do not pose as an authority on music, but I have an idea about it. I often have to listen to the jazz.  I listen-in as a sort of duty since I took over responsibility for the station.  If I was not in charge of it I would go out when any broadcasting was on, the B.B.C., as well as Athlone.  However, I do listen-in and it strikes me as a non-musical man that the jazz music appears to be quite the same; it all seems to me to be the same, or very much alike.  I am told that as regards traditional music there does not seem to be such a selection.  Deputies should <Col N="1038" /> remember that there are seven days in the week and 52 weeks in the year and a programme has to be arranged for each day.  It is only natural that there is bound to be some sameness especially when it is dance music.  I like the traditional music when it is well played, but it gives me a pain when it is not well played.  Somebody suggested that there might be chloroform for some traditional fiddlers.  I will not go so far as that.</P>
      <P>I can assure the House that there is first an audition, and it is only when an item is selected by the musical director that it is allowed on.  They are allowed to broadcast only when passed by him.  If he finds a person not up to standard, that person is not allowed to broadcast.  I do not know whether anybody here poses as a musical expert.  I do not know if Deputy Morrissey poses as one.  He may be like myself, he gets an indescribable pain when some music is being played and he enjoys other tunes.  I think I know when music is good, but I am not prepared to swear it is good: in that respect I bow to superior musical authorities.  The House, however, may expect an all-round improvement in the news and the other items.  If people want to get the best out of any broadcasting station, ours or any other, they ought to select what they are to listen to. If they listen all the time to the one station, it does not matter if it was the best station that ever existed, they will get disgusted with it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 9, lines 9 to 15 inclusive, Section 15, to delete sub-section (2).</P>
      <P>This sub-section reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>An inspector may (subject to the production by him if so required of his authority in writing as such inspector) at all reasonable times enter upon and have free access to the interior of any premises in which he believes or suspects that butter is sold or exposed, kept, or stored for sale and may inspect and take extracts from any records found on such premises relative to dealings in or transactions relating to butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We object to that sub-section because we feel that its enforcement will mean an invasion of the rights of the individual.  An inspector may suspect that butter is being made in some farmer's house in the country.  He has the right to suspect once he sees a cow in a farmer's field.  The sub-section gives an inspector the right to go into any and every house, into any and every room in every house, to satisfy his curiosity as to how certain people are carrying on their work. He has not the right under this sub-section to search, but I see that the Minister proposes to give him that power under a later amendment.  We hold that what is proposed is a very serious invasion of the rights of the individual.  Any inspector can, on suspicion, walk into a house, go around that house, no matter whose it may be, and make all sorts of inquiries in order to satisfy his curiosity.  It now appears that the possession of butter is a much more serious crime than the possession of arms in a house, because police officers cannot go into a house and search for arms unless they have a search warrant.  But, according to <Col N="1040" /> the Minister, an inspector under this Bill can go into any house and search for butter.  I suggest to the Minister that he and his inspectors should find some other way of catching alleged offenders besides adopting this method of going into a house and searching every crevice, nook and press in it.</P>
    <P>People are entitled to have butter in their houses; they are entitled to sell butter out of their houses, without being registered if they sell to a person registered for that purpose. Consequently, people commit absolutely no crime, there is no breach of the law, if they have butter in their houses or even make butter in them. They can have any amount of butter they wish in their houses.  Hence, I think it is manifestly unfair that inspectors under this measure should be given this power to search.  If the inspectors want to catch-out people selling butter to unlicensed dealers, let them find some other means.  I do not think there is any need for this sub-section.  The Minister, I suggest, ought to follow the usual procedure for detecting offences against the law and not insist on a sub-section of this nature in the Bill.  Its enforcement will lead, or is likely to lead, to a grave infringement of the rights of the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the amendment.  I think I am correct in stating that under the Dairies and Cowsheds Orders, a person selling milk who is not a registered dairy owner, if caught in the act, is liable to be prosecuted, but I do not think that under that Order an inspector has the right to go into a house, or into premises, from which he suspects milk is being sold.  He can use his own ingenuity to catch a person who, he believes, is selling milk, a person who is not a registered dairy proprietor.  I think the Minister would be well advised to leave the enforcement of this sub-section to the ingenuity of his inspectors.  He should not give power to any inspector to enter premises from which it is suspected butter is being sold.  The privacy of the home should be respected, and I think the Minister <Col N="1041" /> should recognise that.  Surely the Minister should be able to find some other way of detecting offences under this Bill than that of giving free licence and liberty to his inspectors to go into and search any house from which they suspect butter is being sold.  It has to be remembered that, if the police authorities suspect that a criminal is in a house, they require a search warrant before they can go into that house.  I think the Minister should find some other way of dealing with this matter than the method proposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know why this question has been raised.  The Deputies who appear to be so anxious about this particular matter never raised it before.  Many Acts, some of which I had charge of myself, passed through the Dáil, contain a similar provision.  I would remind the Deputies opposite that at the present time I can send an inspector into any house in the country in which I suspect there is pure maize. The inspector has the power to search that house to see if there is pure maize in it.  I have power to send an inspector into a house to see if people are engaged in the growing of tobacco, or if they have tobacco stored in their houses.  Under the Sheep and Cattle Act I have power to send an inspector on to any land or premises to make a search to see if there are cattle on the land or in the outhouses on the premises.  There is power under that Act to send inspectors even into dwellinghouses, into the bedrooms, if necessary, to see if there is meat there. We all know the powers of search that are given with regard to the making of poteen, but I am only speaking now of Bills that I introduced myself and had passed through the House.  These are Acts now, and they contain a provision similar to this.  When these measures were going through the Dáil, the Deputies opposite did not object to the insertion in them of a provision of this kind.  They are very eloquent in raising the question on this Bill.  I do not see how it could be worked without a provision of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Deputies opposite ought <Col N="1042" /> to realise that it is perfectly ridiculous to move an amendment of this character.  Take a case like this: there is a shopkeeper in a town and perhaps we know that he is buying butter. According to Deputy Brennan, we should not be given power to go in and see whether he is doing so or not. That is the effect of the amendment. Under sub-section (1), if he is licensed, we can go in, but supposing that he refuses to take out a licence or to register, then we cannot go in although that particular shopkeeper may be doing a roaring trade in the sale of butter.  According to the amendment and the arguments of Deputy Brennan, we are not to be permitted to make a search to satisfy our suspicions.  I think this is the most ridiculous proposal that has come before the House for a long time.  I know, of course, that the Deputies opposite are trying to make the best case they can by saying that this power is going to be used mainly for the purpose of making searches in farmers' houses.  Where are you to draw the line between a farmer's home and a shop?  People familiar with rural conditions are aware that farmers sometimes carry on the business of a shopkeeper and vice versa.  The shop in some cases may not be very big.  A farmer who has a small shop, if there is any suspicion against him as a shopkeeper, may say that he is not carrying on a shop business at all.  A man like him may be dealing in a large way in butter.  I would ask some of the Deputies opposite who have had experience as Ministers how they would propose to work a measure of this kind if we had not a provision like this&mdash;if we had not the power to go in and verify what we believed to be the case, that some unlicensed person was dealing in butter.  Unless we had the power to examine the place to search and look up books and so on, then we could never bring a case to court.  There is absolutely no precedent for an amendment of this kind.  It is ridiculous for anybody to argue in support of it.  In practically every Bill brought in by me, regulating in any way the farming industry, there is a provision of this kind.  The Deputies <Col N="1043" /> opposite never objected to that.  Why they should be so terribly anxious now about their constitutents and so conscientious about their duty, I fail to see.</P>

      <P>I am speaking now, Sir, I would inform the Deputy, in regard to an amendment designed to eliminate sub-section (2) from Section 15, and sub-section (3) of that Section provides that if Deputy Davin made the answer that he indicates here to-night he would make in such circumstances, he would be judged to be a person who obstructed or impeded an inspector in the exercise of the powers conferred on him by this section and would be guilty of an offence under this section and liable, on summary conviction thereof, to a fine not exceeding £5.  If he did not pay the £5 fine, doubtless, the representatives of the court would go out to Dun Laoghaire and smash in his hall-door in just the same way as they smashed J.J. O'Kelly's hall-door up in the Botanic Road, and if he attempted to defend the house he would, doubtless, be arrested and brought to the Bridewell.  The Minister can see the attitude of Deputy Davin himself in this matter, and Deputy Davin wants to support him and has received the Fianna Fáil Whip to-night to come into the Fianna Fáil Lobby and has been told not to dare go against the Party again this evening because he reduced their majority in a vote here this evening when he ran amok and went into another Lobby. He wants to cover his face when he votes for this and makes a case which, thereby, convicts the Minister, because Deputy Davin was born in rural Ireland and knows the instincts of anybody who was born in the country and who feels a certain pride in the fact that people cannot wander into their houses <Col N="1045" /> whenever they like and go through their houses and disturb the family.

The butter-makers here contemplated are people who habitually churn their butter in the kitchen.  I object most strongly to giving a general power to inspectors to interfere with and pry into the houses of every person in a country district. The Minister has asked me can I make the differentiation for the purposes of this section.  It is not my job to draft sections for the Minister wherein such differentiations may be made, as to what is a kitchen and what is a shop. That is the Minister's job.

One never can make out what the Minister means or intends to say.  The fact is that, as usual, he is rambling and does not know where he is.  I hold that the Minister ought to accept the amendment or at least give an undertaking to differentiate between a shop and a kitchen.  Now let Deputy Davin be as good as his word and give the answer to the Minister for Agriculture that he intends to give the inspector when he comes to his hall door, and that is: &ldquo;Send no inspector to my house or to my neighbours' houses, if you do not furnish him with a warrant.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The House will remember that, last week, when we were discussing this particular section, the argument of the Minister was this: &ldquo;Will the Opposition tell me how I am to work this Act if I have not this particular sub-section?&rdquo;  Those were substantially his words, but I think he realises now that the sub-section which was to save him last week is of little use to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has used the same argument now, and that shows the value of the argument used.  He asked: &ldquo;Will the Opposition tell me how to work the Bill if I have not this particular power?&rdquo;  The House, however, heard him last week and to-night, and although, even to-night, he was challenged to show how the particular power he took last week and that he still has under sub-section (2) or even the power he proposes to <Col N="1047" /> take in addition, is going to help him. He admits that a man may have as much butter as he likes.  That is no offence&mdash;none whatever.  He has not shown in the slightest how these powers will help him to administer the Act. When he was challenged to do that, all he said was: &ldquo;Will the Opposition tell me how to do it?&rdquo;  He is here assuming the power and doing it on the alleged analogy of what he did before.</P>
      <P>Apparently, the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;and I put this seriously to him &mdash;so far as the privacy of the individual is concerned, makes no difference between a private apartment or a kitchen in the dwelling house of farmers and outhouses.  He put them on a level this evening, and assumes that the people of the countryside have the same objection to the inspection of their dairies and their cattle sheds as they have to the inspection of their private houses.  They have not.  Surely the Minister is in this country long enough to know that there is a very strong objection to anything in the nature of an inspection of a private house.  Even in more important matters than the one we are discussing, there has been grave objections to any power being given to the State in that respect. I remember, again and again, during the British régime where objection was voiced by different members of the community, especially on behalf of the farming community.  Neither in this section as it stands, nor in the proposed amendment, has the Minister really any more power than that of harrying and making it uncomfortable for those people.  All for what?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put it again to the Minister, why are all these inspectors necessary? Why is this objectionable power necessary?  There is a feeling on this side of the House&mdash;it may not be on the other side&mdash;that this particular power is objectionable.  Why is all this alleged power&mdash;I do not think it is anything more than alleged power of harrying so far as real effectiveness is concerned&mdash;necessary?  Because the Minister chose the particular method of financing it that he has <Col N="1048" /> in this Bill In the discussion on the Committee Stage last week he admitted that, in reality, either the consumer or the producer has to pay the expenses of this Bill.  Call it what you like&mdash;a levy or anything else&mdash;in so far as the consumer is concerned or the farmer is deprived of his profits when this Act is in operation it amounts to a tax.  If it is a tax, what does he mean by this particular method?</P>
    <P>All this necessity for inspection, all danger of the Act being side-stepped, and of every effort being made by farmers to evade its provisions could have been avoided had the Minister chosen another method of financing it.</P>
    <P>The House will remember that on the last occasion the Minister said &ldquo;Yes, put on a tax.&rdquo;  That is precisely what the Minister is doing.  In that respect the proposal has no merit over putting it directly as a charge on the Central Fund.  The cost must all be borne by consumers or producers. That is quite clear.  And not merely that, but he will require a great many more officials as a result of this method of financing, and particularly this power I suggest renders the Act unduly complicated on that account.  It could be worked more smoothly if the Minister had adopted the suggestions made from this side as regards financing.  He did not do so, and brings forward this amendment to the sub-section to strengthen his hands.  He has not indicated to the House how it will be made effective.  I admit that the Minister did not say that if he could find a method that would differentiate between the farmer's house and the shop he would accept it, but by using the argument he certainly implied that and until his indignant repudiation of Deputy Dillon, I was under the impression that that was the main objection.  I was then amazed to find that that was not his objection at all; that he had other objections.  Why then did he put that forward as an argument against it?  Neither on this occasion nor on the last occasion <Col N="1049" /> has he given any solid ground for the provisions in the Bill as it stands, or for the addition that it is proposed to make to the sub-section. For that reason, I hope the House <Col N="1050" /> will support the amendment in the name of Deputy Brennan.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 9, Section 15 (2), line 13, after the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;there search for any such butter and examine all butter found on such search and also&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising out of the discussion on Committee Stage, I had this section examined and it does appear that the inspector should have more powers than we had originally intended to give him under sub-section (2).  I do not want Deputies to be talking about these inspectors going in in the middle of the night and firing things around a house, because that can not <Col N="1051" /> be done.  The inspector can only enter the house at reasonable times. If he goes in at any other time, I take it that an action will lie against him. I think that it is fairly clear from the wording of the sub-section that the premises contemplated are a shop, because the sub-section refers to &ldquo;any premises in which he believes or suspects that butter is sold or is exposed, kept, or stored for sale.&rdquo; As the sub-section stands, the inspector could inspect and take extracts from records relating to butter on such premises.  In the amendment, I propose to give power to search for butter and examine all butter found as a result of the search.  It would be rather queer if the inspector, on going into the house, was to be informed by some owner as keen on the law as Deputy McGuire that he had no right to look at butter found on the premises, that he had the right to look only at the records.  It is only proper that the inspector should have, not only power to examine records, but to search for butter.  This sub-section is drafted for the purpose of enabling the inspector to search shops, but if I were asked to apply it to shops only and not to farmhouses I do not see how it could be done.  A shopkeeper could in these circumstances get around the Act by storing his butter in a farmhouse.</P>
    <P>I have already explained that, under all similar Acts, we have a right of search, but I do not think that that right was ever exercised without full justification.  In the case of maize meal, although the inspector has power to go into a farmhouse and search for such meal, he does not do that except to corroborate a case against a maize miller for selling maize meal illegally. He may go to a certain farmer customer of the mill and ask to see the meal delivered on last delivery.  If the farmer refuses to show it to him, he can insist on seeing it and search the premises, if necessary.  Why Deputies should take it for granted that inspectors appointed by the Department will take a delight in going into farmers' houses and pulling their beds about, I cannot say.  It shows their depraved <Col N="1052" /> ideas if they think it is a pleasure to anybody to go into a house at night and pull people's beds around.  I think that the sub-section would be improved by the insertion of these words.  Deputies on the other side said on Committee Stage that if the sub-section were to stand as it was the inspector would appear not to have power to search for butter or examine butter found, that he would only have power to look for records.</P>
    <P>Looking up the records might possibly be enough, but I think that we should give him power also to search for the butter if he suspects that the butter is on the premises, and where perhaps the owner of the premises might deny that he had any records to show, I think the inspector might have the power to search for the butter.  The only way in which he could bring a charge against any particular dealer, shopkeeper or producer, as the case may be, would be through searching for the butter, finding it and asking the owner to account for it.  In some cases the inspector might have a very strong suspicion that the charge was true. He could follow up that search by asking the owner of the premises to show his records about the butter, the reason for its being there and so on. It is only by getting those particulars that an inspector could bring a case into court if he were following up a case or if he had a charge against the person for carrying on business without being licensed.  I submit, therefore, that the words ought to be inserted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has really made no case whatever and he has not attempted to make any case for the application of this sub-section either as it stands or as it is proposed to be amended.  It would not be a difficult matter for the Minister to segregate the shopkeepers or dealers from the farmers or butter producers. As far as we are concerned, we are endeavouring to safeguard, as far as we can, the homes of the producers, not the shopkeepers.  The Minister endeavours to draw an analogy between the right to enter and look for butter and the right to look for <Col N="1053" /> maize meal.  The Minister knows as well as anybody in this House that there is no analogy whatever between the two.  The Minister fails to see the great difference there is between the homes of the people and the premises in which butter is manufactured. I do not know what the Minister's experience of country life is, but any person who is acquainted with country life knows what the position is in country houses where women are engaged at their business.  Any such person knows the objection women have to an inspection of their homes.  They strongly object to the inspector being placed in the position of being able to go into every room in the house.  If there was any necessity for it it would be different, but there is not.  If the Minister wants an inspection of the premises where butter is sold, it is not beyond the capacity of his draftsmen to draft a section that will meet the case. Instead of that he proposes to give inspectors the right to search the private premises of the farmers.  There is not much more to be said on this beyond what I said on the original sub-section.  I repeat that there is no analogy in what the Minister is suggesting.  If the Minister wanted to differentiate and to segregate the two classes of persons&mdash;that is, the people who deal in butter and the producer&mdash; he can easily do so.  The Minister's imagination has run away with him a whole lot when he endeavours to convince the House that we are possessed of a fear that the inspectors will go in and throw the pots, pans and everything around.  I am not possessed of any such fear but I do object on behalf of the farmers' wives in the West of Ireland to the inspector saying: &ldquo;I want to inspect your house, go into your best room and look into all your presses.&rdquo;  I think that is a great infringement of the privacy of the home and there is no necessity for it.  If a crime is being committed or if there is an infringement of the Act, it is not in the home it will be committed.  It is outside. Let the Minister catch the people who are doing the wrong.  Let him attempt to catch them out.  But this is a very <Col N="1054" /> degrading way of going about the business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to see what purpose will be served by the inspection of the farmers' premises.  The sub-section says &ldquo;inspect records.&rdquo;  Well, of course if it is not registered premises and the records are asked for, the answer will be: &ldquo;We have no records.&rdquo; I would like to know from the Minister what power the inspector would have then or whether there would be a breach of the law if the people of the houses or the premises said: &ldquo;We have no records.&rdquo;  I take it that the inspector could not pursue that line any further.  This amendment gives the inspector power to examine all butter. But supposing the inspector found one ton of butter on the premises.  I am not aware of any law that prevents a person having a ton of butter on his premises.  Even if he had a cwt. of butter, the cwt. would obviously be more than a person would want for his own requirements.  I would like to know is there anything that would prevent a man having in his premises a cwt. of butter?  There is nothing in this Bill which makes it an offence.  If the inspector comes in and says: &ldquo;I want to examine your premises,&rdquo; and the man says he has no butter in the premises, but the inspector finds let us suppose a cwt. of butter, that naturally arouses the inspector's suspicions, perhaps, as much as if he had a ton of butter.  But there is no breach of the law.  What is the object of going in unless he has already formed a suspicion?  What does he achieve except the confirmation of his suspicion?  The matter is beyond suspicion if he finds a large quantity of butter on the premises, and there would be a very strong presumption that that very large quantity is not there for the use of the family.  The suspicion will be that it is there for the purpose of shebeening if you like.  Then the inspector has to watch the premises to see people going in to buy the butter and to catch the transaction being put through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's statement is that he has already similar powers, and that <Col N="1055" /> this is to deal with breaches of the law. As many breaches of the law as you like, but that does not make a bad principle right.  At the same time it modifies my opposition a bit to that principle, when it is brought to my notice that this thing has been done under previous Acts. But the Minister has not shown in support of the amendment that he will gain any information from this intrusion into the privacy of the home beyond the fact that it will confirm his suspicions.  The most that he can discover from his inspection of those premises is that there is a large quantity of butter there.  But that is not an offence.  The inspector will still have to sit about watching.  I do not think that a violation of the privacy of the home is justified by the information that will be secured.  If the inspector comes in the front door and the person inside purchasing the butter goes out the back window, he cannot catch that person.  I do not think it is worth while to invade the privacy of the home for the sake of the information that may be gained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not have intervened again in connection with the section were it not for two considerations.  First, I am convinced from his statement that the Minister does not realise the objection that there is to inspection of this kind of private houses in the country.  It has been so for generations.  My other reason is this.  The Minister was challenged the last day and challenged on the previous amendment to make some attempt to show that what he was proposing here was in any sense effective.  The Minister stated that Deputies on this side pointed out the necessity for this amendment.  That is not so.  It was merely pointed out the last day that the section as it stood was absolutely futile; but the Minister used precisely the same arguments in defence of it that he used to-day.  It is obvious from the amendment that he realised the futility of the section as it stands in the Bill, and yet the same arguments are put forward to convince us on that particular point. <Col N="1056" /> I venture the opinion that the section is not quite so obviously futile now for any effective purpose, but I still think it is futile so far as the working of the Bill is concerned.  I think it will create a good deal of irritation, and I do not think the Minister realises that.</P>
      <P>The Minister is naturally anxious that the Bill should work.  He believes that certain parts of the Bill are absolutely necessary for the continuance of the dairy industry, or something like them anyhow.  He believes that other parts are also necessary.  I think he is putting obstacles in the way of the smooth administration of the Bill by this particular section.  I do not think he realises the feeling that there is in this matter.  Many persons in the country, especially farmers, have such a strong objection to inspection of this kind that they would prefer to get out of butter producing rather than have their house inspected in the way proposed in this section.  The objection is there and is very strong, and I do not think the Minister is benefiting his Bill in the slightest by this.  He is, it seems to me, raising unnecessary difficulties. Instead of removing obstacles he is piling them up.</P>
      <P>Surely the Minister realises by this time that there are sections in this Bill that are an invitation to something in the nature of smuggling.  There will be bound to grow up in the minds of the officials in the course of the administration of this Bill a suspicion, founded or unfounded, that there is something in the nature of smuggling in connection with the sale of butter, especially farmers' made butter.  The temptation is undoubtedly there.  I do not think that even the Minister can shut his eyes to that.  If the Minister thinks that his inspectors will not use this power against the farmers he is making a mistake.  They will, and if it is used to any extent the smooth operation of the working of the Bill will be a thing of the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not necessary to assume that the inspectors will act in an unreasonable fashion.  Let us assume that they will act with a full sense of responsibility and not overstep what they consider their duty.  No matter how <Col N="1057" /> they act, the Minister ought to know that their action will still be found objectionable by the ordinary farmers through the country.  This was put up to the Minister again and again not merely by the official Opposition, but by Deputy Belton as well.  He must assume that there is some belief on their part that there is objection to this inspection.  Supposing he takes the worst interpretation of our action&mdash; that we are doing it for Party purposes. There would be no point in doing it for Party purposes unless there was strong objection to it on the part of the farmers.  There would be no point in our wasting time here speaking against the provision if we did not believe that the farmers objected strongly to this provision.  That is what I am trying to get the Minister to understand&mdash;that there is that strong objection.</P>
    <P>When an inspector goes into a house, what will happen?  Supposing he inspects the records and finds butter there.  How does he propose to proceed after that?  How does that help him to bring a prosecution.  There is nothing illegal in any of the things he has found <Col N="1058" /> out as a result of the inspection.  All that will cause irritation.  I know that this Bill from many points of view has already caused irritation.  The Minister referred to other Bills brought in by him and spoke as if there was no objection to inspection.  That is not so. There has been irritation caused already in connection with dairy produce, but it is nothing like what it will be in this case, where, I say, owing to the belief that must prevail in the minds of the inspectors there will be a great deal of inspection and a great deal of irritation.  The Bill will have sufficient difficulties to contend with and, so far as the part dealing with farmer's butter is concerned, the Minister is making additional difficulties. I gathered from the statement of the Minister that it was mainly in connection with shops he wanted the amendment.</P>
