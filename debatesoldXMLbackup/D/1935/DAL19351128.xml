    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Article 2A of the Constitution.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the President whether it is intended to revoke the Order bringing into force the provisions of Article 2A of the Constitution in view of the unpopularity of the Article.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is in the negative.  Although there has been a decided improvement in the situation in recent months, organised crimes of violence are still occurring with which the ordinary courts could not effectively deal.  The Government, therefore, feels that the time has not yet arrived when it would be justified in suspending the operation of Article 2A of the Constitution.  I need hardly assure the Deputy that it was with reluctance the Government invoked the Article in the first instance and that we shall be only too anxious to suspend its operation when circumstances justify that course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the President's reply, is he aware that the provisions of this Article are bitterly resented by nationalist and democratic organisations throughout the country?  The terms of the Article were assailed by the President and by members of his Party when it was introduced.  Will the President say what set of circumstances now justify a continuance of the Article, in view of the unmeasured terms in which it was denounced when it was passing through this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite aware that there is considerable opposition <Col N="1536" /> to the operation of this Article of the Constitution but, in view of the fact that organised crimes of violence are still occurring, the Government does not feel that it would be doing its duty if it were at this time to suspend the operation of the Article.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the President think that the fact that there may be crimes of that kind committed justifies a continuance of tyranny of this kind, which is worse than any crime against the people's liberty that has been committed?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle (for Mr. O'Neill)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that two cottages in the Crosshaven district were let some months ago to Bartholomew Lane and Michael Jeffers, respectively, by the South Cork Board of Health, and if he can explain the delay in his Department in sanctioning the tenancy of the said Bartholomew Lane and Michael Jeffers, seeing that both are desirable tenants and both are in need of housing accommodation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  I have refused to sanction the appointment as tenants of the persons selected by the board as I am not satisfied that the applicants in most urgent need of housing accommodation have been chosen.  I referred the board on the 21st instant to the statutory provisions which must be complied with in the letting of cottages for which subsidy is being claimed under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.M. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the reply, is the Minister aware that Bartholomew Lane, one of the applicants, a married sister, her father-in-law and her children are all sleeping in a small bedroom, and does he consider that a proper or desirable condition of affairs to continue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have examined the particulars in the case of the tenancies referred to, and I am satisfied, from the information put in front of me, that the applicants referred to are not in as great need as other applicants in the same area.</P>

It is not anticipated that there will be any appreciable revenue collected from imports of rice husk preparations. The exemption of preparations made from rice husk from the Customs duty chargeable under the Finance Act, 1935, Section 11 and Second Schedule, reference No. 6, was found in actual practice to serve no useful purpose, and advantage was taken of the revision of the duty on rice, rice flour and rice meal to withdraw the exemption.

      <P>A German national has been appointed to the post of director of forestry.  Applications for the post were received from Saorstát nationals.  Having regard to the considerable expansion proposed in the work of the forestry division and the consequent importance of the post, it was necessary to secure the services of an officer having the highest qualifications in forestry science, together with experience of administration.  Applications were accordingly invited by advertisement and through the usual diplomatic channels from Europe, the U.S.A., and Great Britain.  Applications were received from highly competent men in most of these countries.  These applications were reviewed by a selection board appointed by the Minister for Lands for the purpose, and the post having been scheduled under Section 10 (2) of the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1923, the appointment was made by the Minister on the recommendation of the selection board.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to point out to the House that the Standing Orders, as framed, make no provision for such motions as this, proposing the annulment of a Statutory Order. Under Standing Order No. 23, the motion would naturally come up in private Deputies' time on Wednesday or Friday.  When a similar case arose some years ago, the Ceann Comhairle adverted to the fact that, if such a motion were to take its place at the end of private Deputies' motions, it might not be reached within the effective period of 21 sitting days.  Consequently, the matter was referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, <Col N="1566" /> and, at a meeting of that Committee, held on the 2nd May, 1929, the Ceann Comhairle being in the Chair, it was suggested and agreed that the following arrangement be given a trial: That such motions be given precedence over other private Deputies' motions in private Deputies' time, the day to be selected by the Ceann Comhhairle, keeping in view the statutory period prescribed; and that the time given should be one and a half hours. In pursuance of that minute, two such motions have been considered in private Deputies' time and concluded in an hour and a half.  The object of this motion is, presumably, that the House may reach a decision on the statutory Order.  The question of sanctions may not be reopened, as the Oireachtas has passed the Bill for sanctions.  The only matter for discussion is this particular Order now made.</P>
      <P>Taking that arrangement made by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges as my guide, which I am not only entitled but to an extent bound to do until the Committee on Procedure and Privileges come to some other arrangement, I consider that the House should, before 10.30 to-night, be given the opportunity of deciding on that question.  The question will accordingly be put before 10.30.  I would point out to the Deputy moving in this matter that on this occasion the Government has given time, but if the motion were then to flow over into private Deputies' time, I doubt whether I would be justified, in view of the arrangement arrived at by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, in giving such motion precedence for consideration in private Deputies' time.  No decision might then be reached within the effective period.  I will therefore put the question before 10.30 to-night.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask, in view of the limitation of time, whether there is an arrangement that the President will get at least 20 or 25 minutes to deal with this matter.  It is of importance by reason of the fact that, since the Bill was passed here, there seems to have been on the part of the principal members of the League of Nations a lot more talk and discussion with and about Italy than there was before the sanctions were asked for, and it is suggested in a certain number of quarters that there is a considerable amount of wobbling on the part of the League of Nations since regarding the policy of sanctions.  The House would, therefore, wish to hear the President at some reasonable length on the general question, and I should like to know if the President proposes to intervene in this debate, and, if so, for what length of time and at what time.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete Reference No. 2 and all references thereto in columns Nos. 2, 3 and 4.</P>
      <P>The proposal is to delete from the Schedule the reference to the imposition of a duty on almonds.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has told us that the duty which was here imposed upon almonds processed to a certain degree was imposed for the purpose of increasing industrial production, but he does not know what industrial employment it is going to give here; he does not know what wages are going to be paid; and so far as he has taken the House into his confidence, he does not know under what conditions that employment is going to be given.  He does not know the quantity or the value of these things imported in the past and he has made no attempt to give us any information with regard to that. He tells us that since the issue of the Order he has issued licences and that, in one instance, he issued a licence allowing a half ton of dutiable almonds, which at the date of the imposition of the Order were in port, in without payment of duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He told us that, in another instance, <Col N="1573" /> he recommended the issue of a licence in respect of 20 tons of these almonds on which further processes were to be carried out.  But although he has apparently been in negotiation with some particular firm asking for the imposition of this duty of 33? per cent., and although apparently that firm has approached him since and got from him a licence to import 20 tons of these dutiable almonds, he nevertheless refuses to give any information with regard to the new industry which is going to be developed here.  The position apparently is that anybody who wants a tariff is able to go to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, either by the front or the back door, and say: &ldquo;Give us a tariff; be a pal and give us a tariff,&rdquo; and they get it if they talk in the proper coaxing tone.  And they get it without any advertence to the rise in the cost of living brought about by that particular tariff, or the tremendous rise in the cost of living due to the cumulative effects of these tariffs.</P>
    <P>Someone has gone to the Minister in this particular way.  He has discussed the development of the new industry here and he has given a tariff of 33? per cent. on these things.  This House is entitled to know something of the proposals for the setting up of the new industry here; something of the amount of capital involved in it; whether it is one or two men, one or two women, or one or two children who are going to be employed in connection with the industry; whether in the meantime the cost of these things has gone up substantially; and what is the general policy of the Minister with regard to the licences which he is apparently issuing.</P>
    <P>The Minister gives us here, say, quarter after quarter, a whole list of these new duties, and I think it is time he should turn over a new leaf and give the House some information that he must have arising out of the discussions that have gone on between himself and the Department and the parties looking for this particular tariff.  He should not expect the House to impose substantial tariffs like these, even though on small matters, which <Col N="1574" /> are very definitely raising the cost of living all around and affecting, in this particular case, confectioners and people like that, and simply tell the House that this will lead to increased industrial production, that everything is all right, that there will be increased wages and employment, and that, after all, it is only a small matter and a small tariff.  That is no way to treat the House.  The Minister should turn over a new leaf and tell us something about the Orders and, on this one particularly, what are the general circumstances in which the industry will be set up and what employment it will give.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order which Deputy Mulcahy seeks to excise from this Bill has attached to it a licensing provision. I want to support Deputy Mulcahy's amendment, because I object most strenuously to any discretion being left in the hands of the Minister to issue a licence for the free importation of any dutiable merchandise to any citizen of the State so long as the present state of affairs continues to obtain.  It is impossible for anyone to forecast how the Minister will use this licensing power under this Order without examining how he has used other licensing powers he got under similar Orders made at an earlier date. I have no hesitation in saying that the licensing system, as at present obtaining in this country, is a poisonous scandal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Second Stage of this Bill, we explained at some length that, in view of the fact that the Bill contained a long string of Orders, it was necessary to deal with each Order <Col N="1575" /> on its merits by way of amendment. The Minister indicated his acceptance of that view.  I am objecting to this Order because it has attached to it a licensing provision.  I say that no licensing discretion should be put into the hands of the Minister.  I point out to you, Sir, that I cannot direct the attention of the House to the reasons why that discretion should be withheld from the Minister unless I show the House how the Minister has used similar licensing powers on previous occasions.  An Order identical to this was made in respect of china and it had a licensing provision.</P>

      <P>He has no right to put words into my mouth.  I have no intention of referring to the duty on china. What I do say is that in regard to a licence to admit china free of duty, exactly identical with the licence in this Order to admit almonds, the Minister calmly turned round and let it be known to all dealers in china that unless they got a certificate from a citizen of this State, by the name of Hoffman, residing in Middle Abbey Street, they would not get any licence to import china.  If any trader had a quarrel with Mr. Hoffman&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If the Minister gets this power in connection with almonds he may tell a trader in this country, &ldquo;You have to get a certificate from so-and-so living in Poolbeg Street, before I will issue a licence.&rdquo; I say that is monstrous.  If the Minister <Col N="1576" /> gets a discretion from this House, the relationship should be between the individual citizen and the Minister who represents Oireachtas Eireann.  That the Minister should arbitrarily bring in an ordinary private citizen and announce that he will not give a licence except on the certificate of a citizen, who has no official standing whatever, is, to my mind&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As I say, this licensing power was used by the Minister in the way I have described.  I regard that as a grossly improper method of handling licensing provisions.  I assert that an exactly similar Order to this was issued in connection with cotton sheeting and shirting and the Minister issued a licence for the importation of these articles to a certain merchant and <Col N="1577" /> refused licences to others.  I assert that he purported to impose a condition that these things would be imported free of duty only where they were used for manufacturing purposes, for conversion into shirts and ready-made articles.  I assert that these articles were imported free of duty under a licence issued by the Minister and freely sold up and down the country. That leads me to this conclusion: that this licensing system must stop unless the Minister will open a register in the Department in which the licences which he proposes to issue under this Almonds Order, and all other Orders, will be printed for perusal by authorised persons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill purports to make permanent Emergency Imposition of Duties (No. 72) Order, 1935, and Section 4 of which reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whenever the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, so thinks proper, the Revenue Commissioners may by licence authorise any particular person, subject to compliance with such conditions as they may think fit to impose, to import without payment of the duty imposed by this Order any articles chargeable with such duty either as the Revenue Commissioners shall think proper, without limit as to time or quantity or either of them or within a specified time or in a specified quantity.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that that power should not be afforded to the Minister for Industry and Commerce unless and until a register is opened in his Department in which particulars of every licence to be <Col N="1578" /> issued shall be entered, and this register should be open to perusal by any person on paying a nominal fee.  I suggest a nominal fee in order to avoid persons making a nuisance of themselves by calling, out of curiosity, to see this register.  I therefore suggest that no licensing power should vest in the Minister for Industry and Commerce unless he is prepared to implement the undertaking given by the Minister for Finance in these cases that if the Minister for Industry and Commerce issues a licence to any citizen to import almonds, it shall thereupon be open to any other citizen to go to him and demand as a right a similar licence. The House will readily understand that such a proposal could not operate unless such a register were open, a register where every citizen would be able to find out the details of every licence issued.  Let it not be said or suggested that the proposal I now make is a revolutionary one or that it is in any way calculated to discredit the Government.  An exactly similar proposal has been made by the Federation of Industries in this country, and it has been pointed out that the issuing of such licences should be entered on a register which would be open to the public.</P>

      <P>Some of these Orders contain no licensing provision.  Others do.  This particular Order contains Section 4 where there is specifically set out, for the purposes of this Order, a provision to empower the Minister to admit by licence.  I want that power used in this State in such a way as not to create a public scandal and to give rise to the abuses that are existing at the present time.  I want the equal and <Col N="1579" /> just administration of the law as between citizens.  I want each citizen to have the same rights against the Government as his neighbour.  I object most emphatically to one merchant or to one manufacturer getting advantages by licence which are denied to his competitors. The Minister may say that these licences are granted without any reference whatever to the personal qualities of the individual applicants. I may bring forward cases, as I have done in this House, which on the <i>prima facie</i> evidence that was available to the ordinary Deputy, appear to be grossly improper.  I am quite satisfied that some of the licences that have been issued cannot be defended either as the result of carelessness or as the result of political pressure whereby certain individuals are receiving preference over their neighbours.  There is one way to make an end of that disquiet and of any possibility of improper procedure in this licensing business, and that is to open a register in which every licence under this Order will be set out in full with the conditions and particulars advertent thereto.</P>

      <P>I have before me &ldquo;Statutory Rules and Orders, 1935.  No. 404.&rdquo;  That does contain powers to issue licences.  The Deputy is entitled to object to a licence on almonds, but not to make a general case against licences.  It is obvious that if a general case were made on one Order it would be equally applicable to all, and that it would raise many irrelevant cases of which the Minister would not have notice so as to be in a position to answer.</P>

      <P>I object to the Minister being in a position to issue licences for the free importation of almonds to one citizen without every other citizen being in the position to examine the register that should be kept&mdash;every other citizen should be in a position to claim as a right an identical licence to import almonds without duty.  I <Col N="1580" /> say that information cannot be made available to the citizens of the State unless and until a register is opened and kept in which the Minister is obliged by statute to give particulars of every licence issued for the free importation of almonds.  When that time comes it will no longer be open to anybody to say that there is any preference, concealment or favouritism in the granting of licences to import almonds free of duty.  He will have his particulars there before him; any Deputy of this House can have access to this register and ascertain what the facts are.  Concealment and secrecy in matters involving the discretion of the Minister are calculated to arouse public distrust and eventually to promote corruption in the public services. But let the light shine on such transactions and there can be no undesirable results.  That will ensure that no use will be made of the powers conferred upon the Minister by this measure that the House did not intend him to make.</P>

      <P>The imposition of a duty on almonds was decided upon because it seemed to the Government that there was no good reason why the processing of almonds should not be done in this country.  That is the only case I can make for it.  Deputy Mulcahy and apparently the members of his Party seem to think that the Government is under an obligation to apologise for or to make lengthy explanations of its design to promote industry here.  On the contrary, it is the Deputy and his Party who should make a case for the prevention of the promotion of industry here.  Of course the tactics of the Deputy and his Party are concerned with slandering or misrepresenting the position of those engaged in industry.  He asserted that in consequence of this duty the price of these commodities has gone up in the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is a licensing provision attached to this measure <Col N="1582" /> as there has been attached to a number of other Orders.  There is no complaint as to the manner in which these licensing provisions are operated.  It is true that persons may feel that they should have got licences when licences were refused them, or they may feel that they should have received licences for larger quantities, but no complaint has been made from any responsible quarter that the power in respect to the issuing of licences has been abused for the purpose of putting one individual, or a group of individuals, in an advantageous position as compared with others.  That type of allegation has been confined to Deputy Dillon, and Deputy Dillon never made that sort of allegation except in a manner and in circumstances which rendered it impossible to answer him effectively.  He always made it irrelevantly; he always made the allegation without giving notice of his intention to do so; he always made it when he was quite certain that the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Finance was not likely to be supplied with the information definitely to refute his allegation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fortunately, he is wrong; he miscalculated on this occasion.  He said that no licence would be issued for the importation of china until a person in Middle Abbey Street named Hoffman was approached for the issue of a certificate, in which circumstances that person was to get a licence.  That statement is not true. In order that Deputies may see the malice that lies behind it, I might mention that the Mr. Hoffman in question is a Director of the Arklow Pottery Company, the Chairman of which is Senator O'Rourke, and the Secretary, Mr. Heffernan, formerly Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  It is quite true that when the Department of Industry and Commerce receives a request for a licence to import china, we inquire from the company if they are in a position to supply the goods, the licence for which is asked. On receiving information from the <Col N="1583" /> company to the effect that the goods cannot be supplied from Irish sources, then a licence is issued.  I am quite certain that Deputy Dillon knew that; it was in his power to get that knowledge and he should have made the very limited inquiries that it would be necessary for him to make before coming here with his allegations about corruption and dishonesty and preferential treatment for individuals.</P>
    <P>Of course Deputy Dillon is not capable of acting fairly in these matters.  His sole purpose is to try to sling all the mud he can in the hope that some of it will stick.  Fortunately, Deputy Dillon has had no success in that direction.  Not a single allegation made by him on this or any other matter has given the Government the slightest concern. There was not one of his allegations in respect of which it could not be shown that it was entirely without foundation and that it was known to Deputy Dillon to be without foundation, or at any rate that Deputy Dillon was in a position, if he had made any inquiry in the matter at all, to ascertain the facts.  Here he is referring to something, information on which could easily have been ascertained&mdash;the facts relating to which could have been ascertained by one telephone message.  Deputy Dillon took care not to send that telephone message.  But he comes here with his allegations, hoping to get away with them before he is called to order by the Chair and hoping the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Finance will be unable to reply to him because the information will not be immediately available.</P>
    <P>So far as almonds are concerned, licences are not being issued.  Full information was given to the House in connection with the only two licences that were issued.  The power to issue those licences was taken for the purpose of ensuring that there would be no inconvenience caused to those who consumed these goods during the period between the imposition of the duty and the commencement <Col N="1584" /> of production.  As a matter of fact, the firm concerned started production immediately and, consequently, no licences, apart from those designed to meet the immediate situation, the clearance of goods already at the port, were issued.  As I have indicated, only two licences were issued and that ends them, unless circumstances should arise to prevent the goods being available from Irish sources, such as might occur if there was a breakdown of plant or any other interruption of production.</P>

      <P>The fact remains that the system of administering licences is anything but desirable.  I desire particularly to-day to refer to the licences for the importation of almonds free of duty.  This matter has been adverted to not only by me and every responsible person in the trade in the country, but by the Federation of Irish Industries which passed a resolution calling on the Minister to set up a register in connection with the issuing of licences for almonds and kindred products.  They asked that a register be set up in which licences for the free importation of almonds would be regulated. Does the Minister deny it?  He knows he cannot, because the representations have been made to him from every source.  I make a further representation to-day.  I shall take advantage of opportunities whenever they arise to direct the attention of the House to the abuses that exist under licensing provisions similar to the abuse which threatens to arise from the licensing provisions to import almonds free of duty.  The Minister may have this notice, that every time he comes before the House with proposals to get licensing provisions, all the discreditable activities of his Department in connection with the issuing of licences will be raised and fully exposed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When the Minister was trying to side-step a discussion on almonds, he said he was prepared to deal with the whole question of this new industry.  But the Minister has done nothing of the sort.  Again I tell <Col N="1586" /> him that he and his Department must have had certain discussions with people who were proposing to set up the industry of crushing, preparing and processing almonds, when he gave them the duty of 33? per cent., and he must have had some picture in his mind as to what kind of industry it was going to be, how many persons would be employed, and the ultimate extent of the industry.  He must have ascertained at some time the total quantity of unprocessed almonds that were going to be dealt with.  The Order was issued on 6th September, no doubt after a considerable amount of discussion and inquiry.  Two months afterwards, on the 31st October, the Minister, replying to a Parliamentary question asking him how much increased employment would be given as a result of this, said that the new industry about to be established as a result of the imposition of the duty would create new employment, the extent of which he was not then in a position to state. He tells us now in an outburst of candour that 25 people are employed in this industry.  It is a very interesting thing that that statement should be made, particularly in the same breath as that in which he tells us there was no increase in the price to the people in the country using almonds.  The Minister has told us nothing at all about the industry except that 25 persons are employed and that the price of almonds has not gone up. Is that all he is prepared to tell us? From one point of view, I think it is enough.  We can understand the attitude of the Minister on this matter.</P>

      <P>To delete Reference No. 3 and all references thereto in columns Nos. 2, 3 and 4.</P>
      <P>Under the Emergency Imposition of Duty Order No. 73 the Minister proposes to put and has put a tax of 60 per cent. on the ordinary enamelled saucepan and other articles of the vitreous-enamelled hollow-ware class.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All that the Minister has been able to tell us is that a new industry is going to be established, and that at the present moment he is issuing licences to everybody who asks for a licence; but, in asking the House to confirm this Order and leave him in the position that he can at once or when he thinks suitable make the Order effective, and put a 60 per cent. tariff on such articles of domestic use, we expected him to tell us when this new industry is going to be started, where it is going to be started, what employment it is going <Col N="1589" /> to give, what average weekly wages will be paid in it, and the reason why the tax is fixed at 60 per cent.  The Minister has already put a tax on other kinds of hollow ware, on tin plate, on wrought galvanised buckets and wrought galvanised articles for domestic use, of 30 per cent. preferential and, in one or two cases only, 45 per cent.  Why is the figure fixed at 60 per cent. in this particular instance, and to what extent is the 60 per cent. tax going to become effective in a rise in the price of those articles by 60 per cent?  It is important to understand, at the same time, that the figures which are quoted for imports in hollow ware generally, and given by the Minister in reply to Deputy Peadar Doyle on the 30th October, bear out the statements which have been made here from time to time that the purchasing capacity of the people in those ordinary articles is declining.  The total imports of hollow ware, not elsewhere specified or included as wrought and enamelled, in the six months period March to August, 1933, 1934 and 1935, declined from £33,975 in the six months in 1933 to £24,570 in the six months in 1934, and to £19,651 in the six months of 1935.  Those are articles in regard to which the Minister cannot state that the production in the country is making up in any way for the decline in the imports.  I submit to the Minister that it indicates in this particular line, as we have indicated in others, that the purchasing capacity of the people is steadily declining.  It is in those circumstances that he puts a 60 per cent. tariff on the ordinary enamelled saucepan, without up to the present or, at any rate, as recently as the 31st October last being able to tell us anything, good, bad or indifferent, about the extent or the nature of the industry which he says is going to be set up as a result of this tariff.</P>

      <P>I have often advised Deputy Mulcahy to be satisfied with the accuracy of his statistics, and not to attempt to make deductions from them, because his deductions are always wrong.  This tariff has been imposed to establish a new industry in the Saorstát&mdash;a rather important <Col N="1590" /> industry&mdash;the production of enamelled hollow ware.  It has been established by a firm called The Irish Enamel Ware, Ltd., which is at present constructing or has just completed construction of a factory at Tralee.  The value of the imports of the goods which will be manufactured there has averaged about £40,000 a year.  I am not in a position to state the actual number of persons who will be employed in the factory, but the number will not be inconsiderable.  At present, the production for stock has just commenced, but sales are not yet taking place.  Although licences were being issued freely for the imports of those goods free of duty up to now, the stage has been reached at which we will require persons seeking licences to prove that supplies from within the country are not available.  I do not know if it is the intention of the Deputy to push his amendment to a division.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister give us a reason for increasing the cost of an enamelled saucepan by 60 per cent?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is that the cost of enamelled saucepans will not be increased by 60 per cent.  It has not been, and it will not be.  I do not intend to pose as a prophet, but I will make this forecast of events &mdash;that, if the Deputies of the Fine Gael Party vote against the imposition of this duty, from this day-week onward they will deny that they ever did it; and when, if ever, this factory in Tralee is in full production, and any function takes place in connection with its formal opening, we will have the Fine Gael Members for the county present on that occasion, expressing their joy that the factory has been established, wishing it every success, and trying to get the public to forget that the attempt to establish it succeeded only against their opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Now we have indeed a model case made for the imposition of a tariff.  The Minister thinks that there are people in this country, outside of the individuals of the Fianna Fáil Party, who can surrender <Col N="1591" /> their intelligence and surrender their souls completely.  The number of the people in the country who can do that is limited.  We want to know from the Minister now the way in which a person anxious to establish an Irish industry&mdash;thinking carefully about it and examining the position in the country carefully&mdash;comes to his conclusions, and we want to know something of his proposals.  The Minister comes before this House and asks us to put a tariff of 60 per cent. on enamelled saucepans.  He says: &ldquo;It will not raise the cost of saucepans. That is all I am going to tell you.  The employment will not be considerable.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Then I misunderstood the Minister.  &ldquo;The employment will be considerable.  There is £40,000 worth of stuff to be turned out in the country, and I dare any of you ever again to go to Tralee if you vote against raising the price of enamelled saucepans by 60 per cent.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Minister is running away from the discussion to-day.  We are all anxious in this House to see the development of Irish industry, to see Irish industry properly rooted in proper circumstances, but not to see Irish industry put as a blister upon people whose purchasing capacity is daily, as a result of Fianna Fáil policy, being further reduced.  We want to see Irish industry growing in circumstances in which Irish industry can be supported by the people and can be adequately fed by Irish capital, giving a decent living to young people who go into it and giving them a decent hope that they will be able to live on that industry when they grow old. Does the Minister think, in telling us <Col N="1592" /> that this industry has been started in Tralee, that his statement shows that he has given the thought to the industry that should be given to it, that this is going to be a firmly-established industry, that it is going to be a help to the country rather than a burden on it?  I submit to the Minister that if he were in a position to paint a picture on the lines I suggest, that this was an industry likely to give decent employment and which would not be a blister on the country, he would approach the presentation of his proposal to confirm this Order in the House in a very different way.  I do not surrender my judgment or my mind to the Minister or his Party when they come before us and say that this Order putting a tariff of 60 per cent. on these articles will not increase the price.  I do not accept unquestioningly a statement of that kind from the Minister, who told us that the imposition of a duty did not raise the price of almonds in the country or the Minister who told us that there are 25 people employed in shelling and processing almonds in the country at the present time.  I do not believe the Minister.</P>

      <P>The Minister has stated that this firm has started manufacture. In this Order baths and component parts and gas cookers are exempt.  I should like to ask the Minister does this firm intend to enamel lavatory basins?  I would like an answer specifically on that point.  I should also like to ask him when they are going to commence the delivery of stuff in commercial quantities, because, according to most people, that is a long way ahead.  The Minister has said that licences have been issued, but certainly quite a number of people have been refused licences.  I should like if he would give us some information on these two points.  Is this firm going to manufacture or enamel lavatory basins, because it seems a senseless proceeding to put up the cost of one particular line that they are not going to manufacture at all?  I should like to ask him also when commercial deliveries are going to start from this factory.</P>

So far as I am aware, it is the purpose of the company concerned to manufacture all the classes of wrought iron and wrought steel to which the Order applies.  I am not in a position to say definitely when the company will be able to deliver in commercial quantities. They have commenced manufacture for stock, but at the moment I am not in a position to say when they will be able to start deliveries, but it should be at quite an early date.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete Reference No. 4 and all references thereto in columns Nos. 2, 3 and 4.</P>
      <P>I have pointed out already, arising out of answers given by the Minister in connection with this matter, that the Minister is here extending the tariff which he put on linoleum to get after the unfortunate people now using the cheaper type of floor-covering. It is interesting to see that, while the Minister for Finance tells us in connection with hollow-ware that the Customs duties going to be raised were considered comparatively negligible &mdash; comparatively negligible in the case of almonds; not appreciable in the case of leather; and comparatively negligible in the case of racquets and sports goods&mdash;in the case of linoleum and thread he tells us that it is not desirable to say what the Customs duties are going to be. The figures given by the Minister, in reply to a question asked by Deputy Doyle on October 30th, indicate that the imports of linoleum in 1935 fell by 92,344 yards when compared with 1934.  Only 67,671 square yards of floor-covering not elsewhere specified or included (not of wool, jute or fur) were imported for the six months March-August, 1934, but 438,723 square yards were imported between March and August, 1935, so that we have a development whereby persons are using a cheaper type of floor-covering, the price of which is less than one-fourth the price of linoleum, indicating, as I said in connection with other matters, and with hollow-ware, that people are driven to go in for cheaper things to equip their houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the general circumstances that exist, the Minister is putting on a tax that is going to be effective from the start, of 6d. per square yard on this cheaper type of floor-covering as well as on linoleum, but the Minister for Finance says that it is undesirable to let us know how much money is going to be raised by way of Customs duties this year, as a result. I pointed out already that the Minister for Finance has been using the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act to patch up holes in his budgetary position.  When the patch is any kind of a sizeable patch it is undesirable <Col N="1599" /> to tell the House the size of it. It is undesirable in the case of floor-covering, and it is undesirable in the case of thread.  And we are told quite pleasantly that it is not worth talking about, that it is comparatively negligible, nothing at all, or nothing appreciable in the case of other goods.  Here we have a duty imposed by the Minister for Finance, and although it is an appreciable duty, where the heaviest part of the imposition falls on people who are driven to buy the poorest class of floor-covering, we are not told how many holes in his budgetary position this tariff is going to stop.  But the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in the case of this tax, which is completely effective from the start, tells us that he has made no recommendation for the issue of licences to import these goods free of duty.  All he tells us, when the duty is about to be imposed, is that it will create new employment.  He does not tell us what that employment is.  I do not know whether the Minister's attitude is that a new industry is being established in some particular town, and that he dares any of us to go near that town if we vote against this tariff.  If that is not his attitude, or if he has an additional case to make for the imposition of this duty we expect to be told where the industry has been set up and, as in the case of Tralee, we expect him to tell us who is setting it up, when it will get into production, how many persons it will employ, the amount of capital likely to be invested and other details, to enable the House to make up its mind whether the establishment of this industry is going to be for the industrial good of this country; and whether it is going to provide an industry instead of being a blister on the unfortunate people, who have to use floor-covering, or if it will help them to get what they want and be an economic addition.</P>

      <P>On an earlier occasion I told Deputy Mulcahy that he should be satisfied that he got his statistics accurately without attempting to make deductions.  On this occasion neither his deductions nor his statistics <Col N="1600" /> are correct.  In fact, the average cost per square yard of imported material shows a tendency to increase &mdash;not decrease.  It is true that the quantities have decreased.  If the Deputy would only carry his inquiries a little further he would find another explanation from the trade and shipping statistics.  He would find that there was a very substantial increase in the quantity of carpets imported which rather suggests that there has been a tendency to use carpets instead of linoleum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not offered that explanation.  That is the Deputy's explanation.  Floor-coverings, linoleum and oilcloth were subject to a duty prior to the making of this Order. That duty was imposed solely for revenue purposes.  No one pretended otherwise.  The revenue derived from it goes into the Exchequer for the purpose of balancing the national accounts.  This duty was imposed for the purpose of affording protection to a new industry which is to be established for the production of floor-covering. The factory for the production of felt base floor-coverings and for the printing and finishing of linoleum is being erected in Tipperary by a new firm, a Saorstát company, with which a Belgian company is associated.  The company will have a majority of its share capital held by nationals and will not require any licence under the Control of Manufactures Act.  Licences for the importation of these goods free of duty are not being issued, but, as certain of the raw material, paper felt, is caught within the definition of felt base floor-covering, licences for the importation of the paper felt are being issued to the company which has undertaken the manufacture of floor-covering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In one or two cases licences were issued to firms assembling motor cars for the importation of special material used for floor-coverings in motor cars, which also came within the definition and which could not be excluded from the definition. It is estimated that about 600,000 square yards of linoleum, <Col N="1601" /> including felt base covering, will be used, but precise figures cannot be given, because they are not available, concerning the particular classes of linoleum and floor-coverings which will be made by the new company.  The company undertakes to keep its price as near as circumstances will permit to that for similar products sold under like conditions from their plant in England.  The intention is that that should be the position unless unusual circumstances operate to prevent it. It is not possible at this stage to say the number who will find employment in the industry.  The factory is not yet completed and production has not commenced. The number, however, will not be inconsiderable in a town like Tipperary, where the advent of the factory has been welcomed.  I do not dare or defy members of the Fine Gael Party to turn up at the functions attending the opening of these factories, but they will be there, anyhow.</P>

      <P>I observe that the Minister has secured from this company, which proposes to start the manufacture of felt base floor-covering, an undertaking that they will produce it and sell it at a price not greater than that charged by companies in Great Britain producing under similar conditions.  I should like to remind the House that an exactly similar undertaking was given by the Westport Thread Company&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Somebody questioned the Senator who was speaking and who had alleged that he was reading from an authorised list of prices.  The Senator in question handed the list of prices to the Minister.  The Minister said that he would examine them at the earliest possible moment, and added, &ldquo;I now repeat my undertaking <Col N="1602" /> that thread will be made available to the trade here by the Westport Thread Company at prices not in excess, quality for quality, of the prices for similar supplies from British companies.&rdquo; I now allege that 2,000-yard cops of three-cord sewing cotton, white, suitable for the shirt or readymade clothing trade, are being sold by the Westport Thread Company for 65/- a gross, and that the same thread is available from British sources of supply at 49/- per gross.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The proof of what Deputy Dillon says will be found in the figures provided by the Minister with regard to these floor-coverings and in his statements made here.  The Minister is putting 6d. per square yard on the cheaper type of floor-covering.  We have already protested against the putting of 6d. per yard on linoleum, which works out at 33? per cent. when you take into consideration the fact that the type of linoleum bought by the ordinary person, particularly if in poorer circumstances, costs 1/6 per yard.  What percentage is the Minister putting on these cheap floor-coverings? He is putting on 75 per cent. in the guise of a simple 6d. per square yard.  I suggest that this is the class of floor-covering which is used most largely by people in less well-off circumstances. It is being used in increasing quantities because of the reduction of purchasing capacity and the Minister <Col N="1603" /> is putting 6d. of a duty per square yard on this article, which costs 8d. per square yard.  The Minister says that he has got a guarantee from this company that they will sell the product of their industry at the same price as similar products are sold in Great Britain unless exceptional circumstances occur.  I am quite confident that the circumstances provided by a tariff of 6d. per square yard on an article imported up to the present at 8d. per square yard will be sufficiently exceptional to raise the cost here by the full amount of the duty.</P>

      <P>This class of floor-covering has been imported in tremendously increased quantities of late.  In the six months, March to August, 1935, 438,000 square yards were imported as against 67,000 square <Col N="1604" /> yards in the corresponding six months of the previous year.  The people who are driven to use this particular class of floor-covering are going to pay 75 per cent. additional for the material they require.  This Order was issued on the 6th September, no doubt after considerable discussion with the parties who stated they were going to set up this industry.  Two months after that, the Minister told us, in reply to a Parliamentary question, that he was not in a position to state what employment would be provided by the industry.  He is not in a position to give us that information now, either.  He tells us nothing about the capital of the company. He does not say explicitly, but he implies, that 600,000 square yards of cheaper floor-covering will be manufactured in this establishment.  The presentation of his case is not such as should persuade this House to put a tariff of 75 per cent. on these articles.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete Reference No. 6 and all references thereto in columns Nos. 2, 3 and 4.</P>
      <P>This is an astonishing Order and shows an astonishing state of affairs.  When the Budget was presented here, the Minister asked for a tariff of 40 per cent. on thread.  He had apparently examined the possibility of establishing a thread industry in the country without going deeply into it in the way in which he would wish us to believe he does.  The industry was going to be established; prices were going to be very satisfactory; it was going to be very flourishing; and a 40 per cent. tariff would do it, in May, 1935.  In September, 1935, he makes use of the Emergency (Imposition of Duties) Act to raise the duty from 40 to 100 per cent. We should like to know something about the reasons which made that necessary and something about what went wrong with the examination that convinced the Minister that 40 per cent. was enough; what transpired between May and September in the conduct of the business that made him come to the conclusion that 100 per cent. was necessary; and why he came to the conclusion that he should raise it to 100 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This Order is Order No. 76 and contains a licensing provision in Section 6.  I object to the Minister receiving a discretion to license the imports of cotton thread which carry a duty of 100 per cent. and for certain reasons.  The issuing of licences for the importation of thread leads up to a most disreputable transaction that recently took place in this country, at the instance of the Minister for Industry and the Minister for Finance.  In answer to a question by Deputy Mulcahy on 31st October, 1935, the Minister stated:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Numerous applications have been made to my Department for licences for the free importation of the goods mentioned in the question.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The question referred to Order No. 76.</P>
      <P>The Minister added:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;All such applications for normal quantities of the goods are granted if evidence is produced that supplies of cotton yarn are not obtainable from the Irish Sewing Cotton Company, Limited, Westport, or linen yarn from the Irish Linen Thread Company, Dublin.  Certain types of cotton threads and ply yarns which are not being produced here at the moment are being permitted to be imported free of duty under licence in normal quantities.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I invite the Minister to say whether, since that question was answered, he had an interview with the Merchant Drapers' Association and informed them that he was prepared to issue licences for the free importation of thread while Westport was getting under way and making itself ready to supply promptly orders for cotton thread for resale.  I believe he did give an undertaking to the merchant drapers of this country that, in the event of their being able to show that they could not get supplies of thread from Westport, he would be prepared to issue licences under Section 6 of that Order.  That is correct?  When that Order was made, the situation <Col N="1607" /> was that the central agency, which is the selling agency for a number of firms engaged in the cotton thread business in Great Britain, had imported into this country a very considerable quantity of cotton thread. I explained to this House before that this importation of thread took place during, and subsequent to, discussions that had taken place between Messrs. J. and P. Coates and the Minister's Department on the question as to whether they would be allowed to manufacture cotton thread in this country.</P>
    <P>It was decided that they would not be allowed to manufacture cotton thread in this country and that the manufacture thereof would be a reserved commodity for the Westport factory.  During and after these conversations the central agency continued to import quantities of thread. The Minister for Industry and Commerce, in collaboration with the Minister for Finance, then imposed an Excise duty of 40 per cent., not upon cotton thread in this country, but upon such cotton thread as might be in the possession of any person who held, at a given time, more than £10,000 worth of thread, with the result that Emergency (Imposition of Duties) Order affected only one individual in Saorstát Eireann, and could affect only one individual in Saorstát Eireann, After it had affected that one individual to the tune of £4,000 odd, the Minister for Industry and Commerce announced his intention to allow that Excise duty to lapse completely so that the Excise duty would operate only as a penal fine on these people who had brought in thread.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance then took the floor and announced that he would deal with acts of sabotage of this character.  The suggestion was that the central agency had brought into the country such quantities of thread that the Westport Company would be quite unable to get into production at all, because there were such large accumulations of thread in the country that there would be no demand for the Westport products. <Col N="1608" /> What are the facts?  Two months after the imposition of that Excise duty, two months after the robbery of this individual firm, the legalised robbery by that Excise Order, the Minister indicates his readiness to issue licences for the importation, free of all duty&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Deputy's explanation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;Customs or Excise duty, of thread of the same character as Westport is producing because Westport is unable to supply the current demand for thread.  So it emerges that there was never any threat to the prosperity of the Westport factory in the thread accumulated by the central agency in Dublin, but there was some affront to the silly, personal pride of the silly small man with whom this country is afflicted as Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He had told the central agency that he would not let them in; he had told them that he would not allow Messrs.  Coates to operate here; but somebody told him: &ldquo;They are here; they have about £10,000 worth of thread at the North Wall,&rdquo; and this silly man determines to show that he has power to wreak vengeance on any individual who attempts to slight him in this country. So we have the disgusting and scandalous spectacle of an individual Minister of this State having a personal quarrel with a citizen of this State and fining him £4,000 with the semblance of legality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is an outrage on every standard of decency that ought to obtain in this country, and the Minister is convicted of having done that for no other purpose than to wreak his personal spite on that individual, by his expressed readiness to use his powers under the licensing provisions of this Order to admit the same types of thread as he fined the central agency £4,000 for having in the City of Dublin three months ago.  That may amuse the Minister, but it creates a precedent in this country of a most deplorable character.  It not only creates the detestable principle that an individual Minister may visit his wrath, his private spite, on his neighbours under the <Col N="1609" /> appearance of law, but it also establishes the principle that the Minister may perpetrate a disgusting injustice of that kind and then attempt to wriggle out of it by refusing to bring the matter before Oireachtas Eireann, until a private Deputy of this House takes him by the back of his neck and drags him struggling into the light of day.  On the last occasion I raised this, he sat in embarrassed silence and allowed the Minister for Finance to cover his tracks as best he could.  To-day he has no excuse for silence; he has to try and defend himself, which he will do with all the powers of abuse and vituperation at his disposal.  I urge upon him now to tell the House how he justifies his vindictive spite against an individual who did something that was perfectly legal at the time of doing it; how he justifies having imposed a fine of £4,000 upon this firm; how he justifies his attempt to avoid rendering an account for that action to this House until he was forced to it by comments from these benches.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is time that all the facts relating to this business were known, rather than that the public should be left under the impression that the garbled account that Deputy Dillon has repeatedly given to this House should be accepted.  Deputy Dillon, of course, has only one explanation to offer for any set of circumstances, and that is an explanation discreditable to the Government.  In this matter, he has obviously made no effort to verify his information.  He cannot have possibly discussed the matter with any organisation, with the Drapers' Chamber of Trade, which has discussed the matter with the Government, the representatives of the manufacturing company in Westport, or the officials of the central agency to whom he made reference.  If he had gone to any one of these sources of information I think he would have avoided referring to the matter and not have put himself in the very foolish position he has taken up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an extraordinary thing that, despite the fact that very large quantities of cotton thread were imported into this country last year, we are still <Col N="1610" /> issuing licences for further importations. The Deputy, however, made no attempt to find out what was the proper explanation of that extraordinary fact.  The only conclusion he could come to was that these importations, although they are officially recorded in our trade and shipping statistics, and although I stated here in the past that they had taken place, could not have taken place at all.  But he is wrong.  He is usually wrong, but he is more flagrantly wrong on this occasion than usual.</P>
    <P>A duty upon cotton thread was originally imposed at the rate of 40 per cent. because we considered that a 40 per cent. duty was a sufficient protection for the industry.  May I say straight away that we had no discussions with Messrs. Coates on the subject of their manufacturing thread here; nor did they make any approach to the Department in the matter until an arrangement for the establishment of a factory in Westport had been concluded.  While they were in fact approaching the Department, they were engaged in these importations of huge quantities of cotton thread through the central agency to which the Deputy refers. I think that when he talks about an individual, he is talking about the central agency, which is not an individual, but an agency representing a big and powerful group of thread manufacturers in Great Britain, with millions of capital behind it and enormous resources which could be utilised, if they so chose, for the purpose of making the manufacture of thread in this country impossible and which, I submit, they decided so to use.  May I say that the increase in duty from 40 per cent. to 100 per cent. was necessitated because, in our opinion, there was an imminent possibility, if not a probability, of further huge quantities of thread being imported, despite the 40 per cent. duty, and stored in Dublin, as the thread imported previously is stored in Dublin.</P>
    <P>There is within a very short distance of this building over £30,000 worth of cotton thread in store.  Let the Deputy try to buy some; he will not be able to.  That thread has been <Col N="1611" /> in store for a long time and it is not being sold.  It is being held, as further thread, which might have been imported if this increase in duty had not been effected, would also have been held, for the purpose of those who are engaged in these tactics, whatever that purpose may be.</P>
    <P>That situation is causing us concern. An Excise duty of 40 per cent. was imposed upon certain stocks of thread.  That Excise duty did not catch all the stocks of thread that exist.  A sum of £4,000 was paid in consequence of that duty.  But the situation created by the existence of these stocks, and the menace which they constitute to the industry here, whenever those who hold them choose to release them, still exist.  It is one which may occasion other measures, if it is to be removed.</P>

I am sorry that Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Dillon should range themselves on the side of those adopting these tactics, despite their professed desire to promote industrial development here, and despite the new-found policy of their Party to encourage industrial development.  There is, so far as I am aware, no dissatisfaction whatever amongst drapers or manufacturers concerning supplies of thread.</P>

      <P>I intend to speak of that also.  I have here a Press report of the meeting of the Executive <Col N="1612" /> Council of the Drapers' Chamber of Trade held last week, and published in the Press.  It states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Michael O'Leary presiding at the meeting of the Executive Council of the Drapers' Chamber of Trade stated that the Chamber had been instrumental in removing some of the difficulties which were seriously interfering with the drapery trade. Among these he particularly mentioned the sewing-cotton question which had now been adjusted to the satisfaction of the trade, and no reason exists for any shortage of sewing-cotton.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I intend to.  Representatives of the Drapers' Chamber of Trade attended a meeting in the Department of Industry and Commerce, at which representatives of the Irish Sewing-Cotton Company were also present, and urged that the Department should adopt the practice of issuing a licence to the Sewing-Cotton Company only in so far as thread for retail sale was required.  I was very reluctant to adopt the recommendation of the Drapers' Chamber of Trade, for reasons which had no bearing upon the position of retail sales of thread, but for other reasons.  But, on the very strong representations of the Drapers' Chamber of Trade, I adopted that arrangement and it has been in force since.  The members of the Chamber have, in fact, testified that it is working to their satisfaction. Whether it is working to our satisfaction is another question; but it has, apparently, proved satisfactory from the point of view of retail traders.  At that joint meeting, the representatives of the Drapers' Chamber of Trade, who are, presumably, responsible people and know the circumstances existing in their industry, stated that the thread manufactured at Westport was equal to and, in some cases, better than Coates' thread in quality and that the prices were the same.</P>

      <P>If Deputies have information to that effect, I wish they would supply it to me rather than keep it to themselves.  The only evidence I have had is that supplied by the representatives of the Drapers' Chamber of Trade, who told me that the prices were no higher than before May last, and that the quality was as good, if not better.  It is true that the Westport company is not yet in a position to supply the full requirements.  Therefore, licences are issued despite the fact that this huge quantity of thread is stored in Dublin.  It is a rather curious and anomalous situation and it is one that calls for considerable care on the part of the Government to ensure that the motives of those who are responsible for that huge importation of thread are not inimical to the development of the industry here and that any such designs will not be fulfilled. The increase to 100 per cent. in the duty was not necessitated by anything that transpired in the conduct of the business at Westport&mdash;to use <Col N="1614" /> Deputy Mulcahy's phrase.  It was occasioned only by the fact that reliable information reached my Department that if that increase had not taken place, a further substantial importation of thread for storing purposes was likely to be effected.  It was to meet that that this duty was imposed and that this duty is going to be maintained.</P>
      <P>Progress in the industry at Westport has been steady.  As I explained already, they are working upon a definite schedule of operations, but the full process of manufacture will not be undertaken for some time to come. Though it has not been undertaken yet, the company are getting to the stage at which we will get them to undertake the full process of manufacture.  But so far there is no reason whatever to regret in any way any step that has been taken in this connection.</P>

The Minister told us to-day there was £30,000 worth of thread lying in storage in this city.  Did not the Minister put an Excise duty of £40,000 on stocks of thread in Dublin?  He tells us there is £30,000 worth of thread there.  Why did he not collect a duty of £12,000 on that at 40 per cent.?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question on which the House should be informed.  If there are £30,000 worth of thread in storage without having paid duty the Minister for Industry and Commerce should have placed a duty of £12,000 on it.  The Minister, in fact, realised £4,000 some months ago in fines on thread imports.  Either the Minister is too incompetent to draft an order to achieve what he has in mind or he is incompetent in that he cannot collect the revenue and vent his spite as he meant to vent it.  Here to-day we have it that the Westport Company is importing cotton thread under licence.  The Minister wants the country to believe that everything they do not import under this licence is manufactured in Westport.  Of course, the thread they import under licence is sold; nothing else is sold. They do not manufacture one inch of thread and never did.  The thread is coming in under licence.  It is put on reels at Westport and that is all that is done to it.  They may contemplate dyeing certain shades of thread, but at the present moment the process in Westport is to put the thread on the reels, and that they are doing none too well.  I do not complain of that. It will take some time to train the workers to put the thread on the reels as perfectly as it is done in Great Britain, but that is not making any great drawback.  The thread is imported. What the Minister intends to do is to manufacture yarn of all kinds at some central factory.  The yarns will be despatched to Westport for the sewing cotton-trade and to other centres for other trades.  But in the case of the undertaking at Westport he is recottoning the spools.  They are getting licences for these importations. But the people who have been buying cotton for generations on the markets of the world have now to buy that cotton from the Westport Company and pay the Westport Company such a margin of profit as they think well to charge for the services of importing the cotton and reconsigning it to the retail draper who proposes to sell it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1616" /> The Minister says that the case represented to him in the Seanad with regard to the price in Westport arose as a result of a misconception.  The matter was raised in the Seanad in connection with sewing cotton used by thread manufacturers.  Cotton bought in England at 49/- per gross is sold by the Westport Company at 65/- per gross.  A large part of that thread is used in the manufacture of shirts for export.  In so far as Irish manufacturers of shirts have to pay 16/- per gross extra for their thread supply now, it means that they are put to this disadvantage as against their competitors in England in the export markets of the world.  I do not know whether the Minister is prepared to say that he examined that statement made in the Seanad and found that it was not true?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>So the Minister says. These cops are now costing 65/- at Westport and they used to be bought at 49/-.  All I can say is that the Senator who took that matter up in the Seanad has told me that though the Minister promised to communicate with him he received no communication and he has heard nothing from him so far.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the Senator told me yesterday he did not hear.  Perhaps the letter has miscarried.  Will the Minister look into the matter and see if he has written to him?  This shirt manufacturer being a member of the Oireachtas, I am quoting him. Ordinarily, I am reluctant to name any merchant, but the fact that he is a member of the Oireachtas alters the situation.  The fact remains that licences are now being issued for the importation of the same quantity and quality of thread as was imported three <Col N="1617" /> months ago.  The Minister has stated that J. &amp; P. Coates were proposing to paralyse the Irish industry and that they sought to prevent its development &mdash;that is the allegation&mdash;and in order to prevent it they imported these huge quantities of thread.  Far from that being true, they had an option on a premises in Dublin where they offered to spin, dye and reel thread&mdash;an Irish company, which would be controlled by Irish nationals, on the board of which there would be a majority of Irish nationals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>To whom did they offer it?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>To you.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I assert that proposals were laid before the Department of Industry and Commerce by a group of business men in this city to manufacture thread in collaboration with Messrs.  Coates of Paisley and they informed the Department that they had an option on premises in which to carry on the process.  The Department informed them that they would not be permitted to do so because the Department's policy was to reserve the industry to Westport.  I state these facts are true, and if the Minister seeks to refresh his memory he will find it is true.  So there is no foundation for the allegation that there was any kind of conspiracy on the part of this firm to interfere with any legitimate Irish industry.  There was nothing in their action except that they were not prepared to fall on their knees and grovel at the feet of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  For that, in the name of this House, they have been scandalously and improperly mulcted in the sum of £4,000.  The money does not make much difference to them, but it is something for which the House should be ashamed and something for which the Oireachtas should condemn the responsible Minister.</P>

      <P>I am opposed to this particular Order being confirmed. I was surprised to hear the Minister say there was no increase in the price of thread.  It is a well-known fact that the price has increased from 50 to 75 per cent.  Every housewife can confirm that.  Complaints have been made to me from all over the Midlands.  One reason why I am opposing this is that there have been very grave hardships imposed on a certain type of merchant all over the country.  I have one case in mind, and, as I have an intimate knowledge of the details, I will confine myself to it.  There is a merchant in Lanesborough who is a wholesaler and has been a wholesaler for a considerable number of years.  He has a number of agents, travellers, on the road in connection with the distribution of thread.  When this Order came into force, and when Westport was the only place where you could get thread, he applied for a supply as a wholesale merchant.  They definitely refused to treat him as a wholesaler and refused to fulfil his order.  He was caused grave inconvenience because he was unable to obtain supplies elsewhere and was unable to give his customers their usual requirements.  That means that Westport has decided to select certain people to supply thread and exclude others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not to be taken as opposing the Westport factory in any way, but if they are working under special privileges given them by this House they are not to use them to the disadvantage of people who have been in the trade for a great number of <Col N="1620" /> years.  If Westport does not supply merchants in the ordinary way, these merchants should be entitled to import thread, on application to the Minister.  This man had a large number of people employed.  I sent the particulars of the case over ten days ago to the Minister and I have not yet had a reply.  I want an assurance now that the Minister will see that Westport does not discriminate between one merchant and another, and that where it is established that a man has been in the wholesale business, as Mr. Alfred McCrann of Lanesborough has been, for a number of years, that he will get the quantities of thread to which he is entitled and that he will not suffer any disability because of some antagonism the Westport factory bears towards him.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is not satisfied that the price of thread has been increased to the amount I say, I will get at least half a dozen people who will send in signed statements bearing out what I have said.  In the case of the labouring classes, the cost of living has increased in other directions, but in the very necessary item of maintenance of clothes they have to pay more for a reel of thread that may not be up to the standard &mdash;but that is a thing, as Deputy Dillon said, that can be overlooked. The thread is all right, but the people expect it at a reasonable price.  I was surprised to hear the Minister say that it was being sold as cheaply as Messrs.  Coates' thread. That is absolutely incorrect.</P>

    <P>Emergency (Imposition of Duty) Order No. 77 might almost be called &ldquo;The Ireland a Nation Order,&rdquo; because in reply to questions arising out of the Order the Minister for Industry and Commerce, I think, told us on the 30th October that the description &ldquo;cricket, hockey, golf, croquet and tennis materials&rdquo; was being cancelled on our import list.  Our import list will not bear any reference to those unnational games in future.  They will not appear on the list of imports.  On the other hand, a new industry is to be set up for the manufacture of those articles. The position with regard to tennis rackets, hockey sticks, and that sort of thing, as far as the information given by the Minister for Finance goes, is that a 15 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> duty was imposed as from the 12th May, 1932.  As from the 10th May, 1934, a 50 per cent. duty was imposed on them.  We are told that 15 persons were engaged in stringing rackets on 1st September, 1934.  I venture to submit to the Minister for Finance that it did not require any duty or emergency imposition of duty by the Fianna Fáil Government to secure that 15 persons would be employed on the work of stringing rackets in the country.  At any rate, cricket, golf, hockey, croquet and tennis materials are to disappear off our import lists. <Col N="1623" /> By the imposition of a 75 per cent. tariff in respect of rackets, a 75 per cent. tariff in respect of hockey sticks, and a 75 per cent. tariff in respect of cricket bats&mdash;that is an increase from 50 per cent. to 75 per cent.&mdash;a new industry is to be set up in this country. I should like to ask the Minister for Finance to give us some details of this new industry, so that the House may consider whether an increase of the duty on these sports goods from 50 per cent. to 75 per cent. is warranted.</P>

      <P>On a couple of occasions a proposal has been mooted in this House that Deputies ought to have free travelling facilities over the Saorstát.  When I listen to Deputy Mulcahy discussing a motion of this sort I often regret that such facilities are not in operation, because it would then be possible for him on occasions to visit towns in which new industries have been established, and I am certain that after some of those visits Deputy Mulcahy's contribution to a debate of this sort would be more valuable and very much better informed. If the Deputy, before he decided to oppose this motion, took a trip to Portarlington, he would have seen that a new factory is being established there for the manufacture of sports requisites, and he would apprehend from the size of the factory and from what is known about it in the town that the employment to be given is not inconsiderable.</P>

      <P>It would be much cheaper and much simpler for Deputies &mdash;who have something else to do than travelling around this country on a research campaign, to look after the new industries in the country&mdash;if the Ministers putting forward proposals for tariff impositions here in this House would tell us something of the industries that are going to result from those tariffs.  The only people who have free travelling facilities, paid for by the taxpayer, to enable them to travel around the country looking at new industries, are the Ministers.  The Ministers avail themselves to a considerable extent of those facilities provided by the taxpayer, but the House does not see any <Col N="1624" /> sign that they learn very much from their going around.  The position taken up by the Minister for Industry and Commerce is: &ldquo;Here is a tariff.  I am not prepared to go to any trouble to give you any information about what the likely effect of it is, or how it came to be imposed.  It is up to you to say why it should not be imposed.&rdquo;  Therefore, we get tariffs of 100 per cent on thread, 60 per cent. on enamel saucepans and 75 per cent. on something else, thrown at us here in the House, the House being simply asked: &ldquo;Make a case for voting against.  Whether you make the case or not I dare you to vote against it; you would be classed as being against Irish industry.&rdquo;  I am sure the Minister will kindly suggest &ldquo;There is not a man of you here who has spunk enough to run the risk of appearing before the people of this country as not being in favour of the development of Irish industry.&rdquo;  The Minister thinks if we were given free travelling expenses we could prowl around the country; that some night or some morning we might strike Portarlington, and that we would see a factory there for the manufacture of cricket bats, hockey sticks, tennis rackets, croquet balls, and things like that.  No wonder he calls it by its English name.  We do tell the Minister that when he comes here and asks this House to increase from 50 per cent. to 75 per cent. the duty on those articles, he should give us some information as to the number of people who are going to be employed in the making of those things; what the effect of the increased tariff is going to be on the price of those articles, and how the tariff is going to affect the revenue generally. It is nearly time&mdash;considering the difficulties which the Minister for Industry and Commerce has got up against in regard to some of his industrial developments&mdash;that the Ministers would take those things more seriously, and take the House more into their confidence when putting before it proposals which are supposed to be for the benefit and development of Irish industry, and for the purpose of increasing employment here.  The Minister for Finance is not able to tell us what additional employment is going to be given in this industry.</P>

      <P>The Minister might at least tell us why the 50 per cent. tariff has been found inadequate.  It is a very high tariff after all.  I think it would be a disaster if the playing of games were made more expensive in this country.  I do not regard games as a luxury but as a necessity.</P>

      <P>The Minister might, at any rate, tell us whether what is alleged to have occurred last year, when the duty was at a lesser point, is or is not a fact.  With regard to tennis rackets, it is alleged that there was certain activity in the country, and I think it gives us one way of measuring the new movement in the country.  I understand that firms who supply rackets wholesale took a census of the number of tennis rackets which would be required here.  They then entered into an arrangement with the retailers here, the result of which was that racket frames were sent into this country, and then there was one man&mdash; an Englishman&mdash;sent over here to string all the rackets that the country required; he did it in less than ten days.  The extra cost, as far as the racket was concerned, was the travelling expenses over to this country of that Englishman, and his keep here for ten days.  Of course, the actual charge that people paid would have kept many Englishmen in this country for a great many weeks, but the amount of employment, <Col N="1626" /> as far as the stringing of those rackets is concerned, was one man for ten days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>So far from its being ridiculous, if the Minister knew anything about the use of tennis rackets in the country, he could easily discover the number that are bought new each year.  It could be calculated in a very small number of thousands.  The stringing, of course, is not a matter that requires half a day to do.  A very big number could be done to the day. If the Minister could get the number bought new each year he would find that ten days is a fairly liberal allowance. I should say that the Englishman occupied a couple of days in sightseeing, probably looking for the new factories.</P>

      <P>I have already had some words with the Minister for Industry and Commerce as to whether or not his interest in the development of Irish industry is greater than mine after some doubts as to the effectiveness of his work.  I am interested, for instance, to see how a company like Irish Leather Goods, Ltd., is going to be helped.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> of the 16th November last and, subsequently, the <i>Kilkenny People</i> tell us that the directors of Irish Leather Goods, Ltd., are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Abraham Bayer, Jacob Zlotover, Montagu Buckhalter, and Morris Isaacson.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>We are anxious to know, among other things, how a company like that is going to be affected by this Order, and how the boot manufacturers in the country are going to be affected by it.  Will the Minister give us some help in making up our minds as to whether we should support a tax of 37½ per cent. that may adversely affect the company of Irish Leather Goods, Ltd., and that may adversely affect the shoe leather manufacturers in this country, or, alternatively, raise the price of shoes here? We have had to complain recently of the unsatisfactory attitude of the Minister for Industry and Commerce towards the House, and I hope the Minister for Finance will not put us in the position of saying that his attitude, on this matter, towards the House is worse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I will now answer Deputies who appear to have an open mind on this matter.  This Order imposes a Customs duty of 37½ per cent. of the value of the article, with a minimum duty of 9d. per lb. on all leather other than bridle leather, crupp leather, hog-skin leather, reptile-skin leather, chamois leather and leather commonly known as chamois leather imported into Saorstát Eireann on or after the 5th day of October, 1935. The Order was made specially to encourage the development of tanneries for the production of leather of the kinds other than those mentioned in the Order as excepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Arrangements have been made for the starting of tanneries in Gorey, Carrick-on-Suir, Dungarvan and Passage West.  The types of leather to be produced at these factories is, more or less, as follows: Gorey, the manufacture of leather known as greasy leather.  If Deputies expect me to tell them what greasy leather is, I admit frankly that I do not know.</P>

Passage West will produce chrome leather and leather linings, to some extent largely for export.  The <Col N="1634" /> tannery at Dungarvan will produce semi-chrome leather, leather linings and leather used in the manufacture of cloth and fancy goods.  It is anticipated that a considerable amount of employment will be given by the establishment of these industries, and that the selling price of the leather at the four new tanneries, when in full production, will be the same, like case for like case, as the selling price ex-British factories.  I do not know that there is any more information needed.</P>

      <P>It will be considerable. The fact is that the people in these towns put money into these industries to have them established is an indication that they are satisfied that the employment given will be considerable. As to the position of people who are engaged in the manufacture, I presume, of fancy leather goods, I consider that their position will be improved, because they will have available to them here a supply of reliable raw material and not be subject to the vicissitudes of sanctions and blockades which now afflict the civilised world. I am giving this information to those Deputies, who, I think, are entitled to it, because they have indicated that they have an open mind in the matter. I do not suppose anything I have said will effect any change of mind on the part of the Opposition, and that they will continue to adopt the attitude of Mrs. Partington, and, notwithstanding the general demand of the House and the country, will divide against this proposal, as they divided against all the other proposals to assist in the development of Irish industry which we have had before us to-day.</P>

Has he any satisfactory guarantee that the price of these leathers will approximate to the price of leathers which are at present being imported from Great Britain and the continent?  The boot and shoe trade is an industry that was founded in this country many years ago.  It <Col N="1635" /> attained a very considerable measure of prosperity under the moderate tariff policy of the last Government.  It is a solid industry, an industry that gives good employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If he did not have a Sam Browne belt he liked to think of himself as a warrior on the hillside.  At that time Deputies on these benches were trying to build up industries in this country, and were rebuilding factories that the Minister's friends blew up.  Let justice be done.  This is a useful industry, giving good employment and good wages to very large numbers of men.  Above all, it is a product of which we can be justly proud.  The fact is that there are many types of boots being produced at Irish factories that do not want any tariff at all, because, shilling for shilling, they are better value than boots that can be bought anywhere else.  That is so, because the industry was built up along the right lines, by modest protection which brought it into keen competition in external markets and that brought a high degree of efficiency into the industry at home.  In most of the lines they were producing without any tariffs they could meet and beat British manufactures in the matter of value and price.  Are the interests of an industry of that character, which is a genuine national asset, going to be jeopardised by an attempt to manufacture leathers in this country for which we have not got the raw material?  Frankly, I do not know, but I expect from the Minister, when introducing a tariff of this character, a full communication to the House as to the <Col N="1636" /> probable effects on the boot and shoe industry.  We certainly ought to have that information before we are asked to confirm a resolution which, at first glance, suggests that the cost of the raw materials of the boot and shoe industry will be substantially increased. I am an eager supporter of the boot and shoe industry.  It is the kind of industry I should like to see here.  It is the kind of industry for which there need be no subsidies and no doles.  It can exist independently and meet objection from wherever it comes.  It can show that Irish workers are as good as, and perhaps better than, the craftsmen of any other country in the world. Its interests are paramount and should not be sacrificed to the interest of some pseudo industry which may not have any future.  The Minister should tell us what effect this tariff will have on the boot and shoe industry, whether the raw materials of all the types of leather to which he has referred for these four centres of manufacture are available in the Saorstát, and whether, after a fair and scrupulous examination in respect of each of these types of leather, he is satisfied that this proposal is not going to involve the boot and shoe industry in this country in additional overhead charges.</P>

He himself should have known what the proposals were in the Order and how Deputy Mulcahy had misconstrued them.

      <P>Of course it is, and the benefit is to go to the manufacturers of leather goods.  This Order is going to operate to their benefit more than the Minister for Finance has told us.  If the Minister for Industry and Commerce had been here we would have got the full tale.  He never introduced a tariff that was not going to leave prices lower than they were across the water.

Surely the leather goods manufacturers will be better off if they believe all that&mdash;which I do not.  The Minister and the Deputy believe it.  I asked if they considered that the tariff was for the benefit of the Irish leather goods manufacturers.  They answered, as they were bound to answer, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Anybody who votes for this proposal is bound to answer &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; I am pleased to hear that we are only going to tan leather and that we are not going to tan Mr. Bayer, Mr. Zlotoyer, Mr. Buckhalter, or Mr. Isaacson, because the Deputy will remember that we set out to protect the two Whitsuns in the making of sausages and, apparently, skinned them.</P>

      <P>What was the first point raised on the amendment?  We asked the Minister to tell us about the tariff.  We have got a little information, and the purpose of this House is to debate matters of this kind with a certain amount of information.  The Minister should realise the difference between an open mind and an empty mind.  He ought to have his own mind full of information, and he should have read at first what he read subsequently as a result of provocation.  His brief is not well made up, because we have not an estimate.  I am sorry the Minister for Industry and Commerce is not here, because, with a blank sheet in front of him, he could tell us of the thousands who would secure employment as a result of the tariff.  I do not think he has ever given an example of an industry which would not employ a minimum of 300.</P>
      <P>Surely, it is a proper procedure in the House to say that the House ought to reject a proposal for a tariff when the proposal for a tariff is not backed by argument and is not backed by fact. I realised, when I saw this, despite what Deputy Briscoe seems to think to the contrary, that this is what we can call the two-tier tariff.  A plain tariff is one that can be considered by itself. It has no reaction on any other manufactory which it is intended to assist, but when you are going to protect a particular article which forms the raw material of another production, you are in a different region.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;before we came into power, and which were not helped by whatever little part the Deputy played in the destruction of the country.  The boot and shoe industry was always regarded in the same light as the apparel and woollen industries. They were the three industries which could have a good life in the country, and the biggest tariff we experimented with was the tariff on boots and shoes, and we took the attitude, which the present Ministry do not take, of realising that the tariff should not be a tax on purchasers and we remitted the tax on tea instead. Everybody is being taxed double, and that is not a good situation, but it is a worse situation if a manufacturer of a particular type is <Col N="1642" /> established and then, in a blundering effort to assist production lower down the scale, you find that whatever you have attempted to do is to be impeded; and that is what is going to happen here.  Personally, I would rather see the boot industry protected instead of protecting the manufacture of leather goods, which has never reached a high standard here, and on account of the variety that is required. I think that this tariff is just as absurd as the tariff on coffin-plates and on the bending of corrugated iron.  There was a time when the Minister for Industry and Commerce was most vehement with regard to the tanning industry. He said that there were outrageous demands being made by these people who were previously in the tanning business here, who were disappearing then and who have since disappeared under the sway of the present Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He told us they had made outrageous demands on him, and that he was not going to give into them, but when he made his suggestions to the trade they looked upon them as ludicrous and went out of business.</P>

I think a good point is to be made that people have a right to demand, with regard to this country, to know who is getting the benefit of the tariffs that are being put on.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing definitely to be discussed with regard to these tariffs, and that is whether or not there are certain people getting privileges.  Here is a tariff on leather, which may or may not do good to the manufacturers of leather goods, but it is supposed to do good to the tanners.  I have not seen that the tanners accept that.  They certainly rejected the previous proposals. I certainly do not believe that it will be of any advantage to the manufacturers of leather goods, and I think it is necessary, in discussing any tariffs, that we should find out what is going to be the spread of producing power as a result of the tariff.  Will the Minister put a figure &mdash;even a rough figure&mdash;of how many men will be employed as a result of the tariff, or give us a rough idea of the rates of wages to be paid, or how he is going to find it possible to justify the so-called guarantee that prices will be no higher than those in London factories?  We know that the salient facts&mdash;they cannot be <Col N="1645" /> denied&mdash;are that prices will go up and that wages will go down.  We know that the Revenue will gain to a certain extent by tariffs on some goods that will still come in and that a certain small number of small manufacturers will get away with the loot.  With regard to the industries on which the heavy tariffs have been imposed&mdash;and that can be said with regard to nearly all of them&mdash;there were industries in this country, industries which it was worth while protecting and industries which were getting along with moderate tariffs, which kept prices down and, at the same time, did not affect wages in an adverse way.  The impact of these heavy tariffs has worked out with regard to some hopelessly unsound industries in the country, industries which were not carefully picked, and, therefore where a tariff has not been to the benefit of the community, in the way that wages have gone down, there has been, generally speaking, no spread of purchasing power because either there are not very many extra people employed or the extra people, when multiplied by the decrease in wages&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Apropos of this.  I say that this will be the effect on tanning of this particular tariff.  I call to my aid what has notoriously happened in respect of others.  The Labour Party has spent its time going up and down the country saying that these industries are mainly sweat-shops.  We get the one objection from the Minister&mdash;when you say that in regard to one case in respect of which you know it to be a fact, you are told that you are traducing Irish industry as a whole.  It only reveals an incapacity to argue the particular case and the screen of the traducing of Irish industry generally has to be brought in.  Labour has, with some knowledge of the conditions, generally referred to these industries as sweat-shops.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to this tariff on tanning, I prophesy that the result is going to be another sweat-shop in the country.  There will not be very many extra people taken on; wages will not for the future bear any comparison with what they used to be, with what they have been so long as this tanning industry was flourishing; money will be yielded to the Revenue; the whole cost is being borne by the community; and benefit will only come to a few.  There are a small number of tanning firms which will get any benefit out of this.  That is why I think it is necessary, when you cannot get information in regard to any tariff in any other way, to put down a resolution to reject and to hope that the Minister will fill the gap even faultily.</P>

      <P>There are one or two matters in regard to which I should like to ask for information from the Minister, in reference, firstly, to what I gather Deputy Briscoe calls a subsidiary industry.  I am particularly interested in a couple of subsidiary industries from the point of view of the employment they give. Bootmaking, for instance, is a subsidiary industry and my precise objection is that this main industry has in the minds of Deputies opposite become a subsidiary industry.</P>

      <P>What I was wondering was whether the Ministry have given any consideration to the effect which this is going to have on some of the principal industries in the country.  There is power given in this Order to give licences.  Does the Minister contend that, at the present moment, whatever may be said of his prophecies about the future, the tanning factories in this country can supply enough leather for the boot-making industry?  I presume he does not.  Has sufficient inquiry been made to see that certain factories are not being held up, owing to the refusal to give licences, on the grounds that the needs of these factories can be supplied by home production?  I have heard instances of factories applying for licences and being refused.  I have been informed very reliably that, having gone to the Department, they were unable to get these licences and that they were told the goods were on the way, but the goods did not arrive. I have been informed that that would interfere with the business of that particular <Col N="1648" /> factory.  The information I got was from a reliable source.  Unfortunately, I am not in a position to give the name of the factory&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and I will tell the House why.  The reason given to me was that the factory was afraid that if it was given and brought up in the House the factory would be damaged.  The Minister says it is an old story.  It is, unfortunately, and I am glad he recognises it as an old story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true, or, to avoid controversial matters, this at least is true, that the belief prevails, and prevails to a very great extent in the country.  More than once, so far as this system of licences is concerned, I have been given information and asked not to mention names, and I take it for granted that the people knew what they were doing when they asked that the name should not be mentioned.</P>
      <P>The other point is: Is the Minister satisfied that this is going to give considerable employment?  He refuses to give any estimate as to the amount of employment this tariff will give or that will follow as a result of agreeing to this Order.  One of the reasons he gave&mdash;I hope I am not misquoting the Minister&mdash;for his belief that there would be considerable employment was that the people who put money into these industries were satisfied that there would be additional employment. I think I am not misquoting the Minister in that.  This is the first time I have heard the protestations of what the Deputy's opposite, a couple of years ago, used often to condemn as capitalists taken as a criterion of the amount of employment given.  I suggest that the amount of employment he gives is not what the ordinary man who puts money into an industry is particularly interested in, and any evidence of that kind adduced in favour of the statement &ldquo;This will give considerable employment&rdquo; requires very careful examination before it can be accepted as of any value in proving that any such additional employment can be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1649" /> The Minister ought to realise that when a tariff or tax of any kind is being put on the people of this country, which will or may have the effect of increasing the cost of living, the costs of the various articles they buy, it is the duty of the Ministry to justify that tax.  It is the duty of the Ministry to come to the House and make a case for the imposition of the tax, and until they have made that case, the House, if it had a sense of its duty, should not pass a tax of that kind.  It is, therefore, up to the Minister to show, firstly, the employment that may be expected, and, secondly, the necessity for the tariff, and it is up to the other Deputies of the House to refuse to assent to the tax until that has been proved.  Therefore, in challenging the Opposition to make a case for its rejection, the boot is on the other foot.  It is the duty of the person proposing a burden on the people to justify that burden.</P>

      <P>On the general question, the Minister for Finance objected to an amendment being put down that would secure that discussion on one of those Orders would take place.  What we want in connection with tariffs is as complete information as possible as to what industrial development we are going to achieve here.  We approached this question of leather by a certain number of questions addressed to the Minister for Finance and to the Minister for Industry and Commerce as soon as we could after the issue of this Order.  The Order was issued on 20th September, and the earliest date on which we could ask for information was 30th October.  We asked for some of it on 30th October and for some on 31st October, but we have not progressed any further from the position arrived at then.</P>
      <P>However, some information was given to us upon which I should like the Minister for Finance to comment upon further.  We were told then that the purpose of this Order was to bring about an increase in industrial production here.  We were told by the Minister for Finance that no appreciable revenue would be collected during the year as a result of the Order.  It was implied that all licences for the normal requirements of persons importing these materials would be issued.  Deputy O'Sullivan has indicated that that is not so, that there are firms in the country who require them to carry on their ordinary manufacturing processes and they are prevented from getting them.  In the absence of a licence they are forced, if they want to keep their business going, to import them at the cost of paying a duty of 37½ per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further industry was to be established. Although the Minister for Finance is able to tell us that four different industries were to be established here, we can get no further <Col N="1651" /> information from him as to the amount of employment to be given.  The Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce were asked with regard to the type of leather that was being imported and the amount that is likely to fall under this duty.  The Minister has spoken of various kinds of leather, but the fact is that, although sole, insole and harness leather are included in this Order, the tariff of 37½ per cent. was actually already on these for a considerable time before the making of this Order, and the Order, in fact, falls on a different class of leather.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce gave some information as to the amount and value of the other class of leather imported into the country in a reply given on 30th October last.  I should like to ask the Minister for Finance, in relation to the figures quoted there, if he would take these items.  During the six months, April-September, 1933, there was imported into the country dressed upper leather, other than patent, varnished, japanned and enamelled, to the value of £90,000; in 1934, £73,000 and, in 1935, £184,000&mdash; evidently a considerable increase in the amount of dressed upper leather for the new boot industry in the country.  I should like to ask the Minister whether leather of that particular kind is going to be manufactured here in the new factories.  If £184,000 worth was imported in the six months from April to September, 1935, is the Minister for Industry and Commerce not able to make some calculation as to the amount of employment that would be given here if all that leather was made here?</P>
    <P>The Party to which the Minister belongs were experts in that type of computation about the end of 1931. They carried their expertness in this matter into the year 1932, and up to the eve of the General Election in 1933. Have the formulæ that were worked to at that time been found to be all wrong, or has the expert left the Party?  At any rate, we would like to know whether that particular class of leather is going to be made here; whether he anticipates that the quantity formerly imported will be made <Col N="1652" /> here; and is there no means by which the Minister for Industry and Commerce or his Department can ascertain the average amount of employment that is given in the turning out of a particular amount of that leather?</P>
    <P>Again the import of dressed leather, hide calf and kip, other than bridle and upper, increased from £3,700 in the six months, April-September, 1933, to £12,800 in the six months, April-September, 1935.  Is that leather going to be manufactured here, and can the Minister not say the amount of employment that is involved in the manufacture of a particular amount of that leather?  Again, there is patent, varnished, japanned and enamelled leather, the import of which in the same six months has gone up from £2,100 to £4,500.  Other sorts of leather have gone up from £17,000 to £25,000, and the imports of leather crust, of which there was no import before, amounted in 1935 to £21,000.</P>
    <P>By means of question we endeavoured to find out from Ministers the fiscal, employment, and industrial effect of this new tariff Order.  The next means of endeavouring to get information from the Ministers was to hold the door of discussion open here by an amendment to this Schedule in order to secure that the proposal would not slip through the House without the Ministers being brought up against their responsibility in the matter of giving information when they claim to be establishing industry here.  The people of this country depend too much on the sound and proper development of Irish industry to allow proposals such as we have been used to from Fianna Fáil Ministers to slip through without the most careful examination.</P>
    <P>Ministers had better make up their minds that they will be forced to face the intelligence of this House and to face the general representatives of the people to explain their proposals and to give reasons why the House should put on tariffs of the size that we have been asked to put on to-day, ranging from 100 per cent. on thread to 60 per cent. on enamelled saucepans, 75 per cent. on floor-coverings and 37½ per cent. on the raw materials of many boot industries in the country.</P>

      <P>In case the House may be misled by the speech which the Deputy has just delivered into thinking that this has been a serious debate upon the proposal to protect industries of great importance to this country, I would ask the House to throw its mind back to the manner in which this debate was opened.  Every endeavour was made to secure a statement from me that this duty, which, on the face of it, relates immediately, directly and primarily to unmanufactured leather, was meant to cover manufactured leather goods.  I asked Deputy McGilligan, who put that question, if he had read the Order and he said he had.  I asked him to read it to the House.  Why did I ask him?  Because the moment he read the Order it would be clear that this duty related to leather goods and that Deputy McGilligan had some ulterior motive in asking his question, or rather that Deputy McGilligan in collaboration with Deputy Mulcahy had.  Sometimes it is a good thing to let a person expose his hand.  I said that possibly indirectly this duty might affect the manufacturers of leather goods.  Then, on the assumption that by doing so I had put Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Mulcahy in order, and that it would permit them to raise a red herring and to endeavour to bolster up the campaign which they have carried on through the country and to give some support to the assertion which they have frequently made that these industries which we are protecting are not being protected for the benefit of Irish citizens, Deputy Mulcahy got up and mentioned to this House the names of four citizens of the Free State.  The gentlemen are utter strangers to me. I do not recollect their names, but I do remember that one of them was named Isaacson.  Then Deputy Briscoe got up and allowed the public to glean from his statement that in circumstances of great difficulty during the Black-and-Tan days the gentlemen, or some of them, had shown themselves to be worthy citizens of the Free State to the extent of protecting Deputy Mulcahy's life just then.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to add one other sentence.  Deputy Mulcahy said that he has gratefully and publicly acknowledged the debt which he owes to these people.  Was it in grateful publicity of this debt that Deputy Mulcahy, having read out the names of these gentlemen, added a reference to Kelly and Burke and Shea?  If the Deputy will listen to me I will show him how gratefully and publicly he expressed himself. Having recited the names of these four men he sneeringly added a reference to Kelly and Burke and Shea.</P>
      <P>As I have already said, the primary purpose, the sole purpose expressed in the terms of this Order is to apply a duty on leather with certain minor exceptions.  When I told the Deputies, who indicated that they had an open mind on the matter and to whom facts and information might carry conviction, that the proposal was one that ought to be supported, I gave certain facts in relation to the industry.  I pointed out that in consequence of arrangements that had been made for this proposal to impose a tariff, I said that four new tanneries were to be established&mdash;one at Gorey, one at Carrick-on-Suir, one at Dungarvan and another at Passage West.  I said that they would manufacture leather of various descriptions&mdash;leather that has not previously been manufactured in this country or at least not manufactured for a very long period.  I said that when the factories were in full production the price of the products of the new tanneries, the circumstances and conditions being similar, would not exceed the selling prices of these commodities at the British factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally I think I proved to the satisfaction of the House that the motion put down by Deputy Mulcahy ought to be rejected and that this proposal should remain in the Schedule to the Bill.  Then Deputy McGilligan or Deputy Dillon got up and wanted to know what would be the effect of this proposal upon the boot factories&mdash;if you please, upon the boot industry which had been established by our predecessors. I asked Deputy McGilligan who, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, would normally be expected by <Col N="1656" /> the public, however mistakenly, to have some knowledge of the affairs with which his Ministry was concerned, to tell the House the name of one new boot factory that had been established under his régime.  Now, Deputy Dillon is a man who speaks always in superlatives. When he is criticising the Minister for Industry and Commerce there is no word too extravagant, too magniloquent, in the dictionary, expressive of meanness, of contempt, that Deputy Dillon does not apply to the Minister.  I do not know how I might characterise the statement which Deputy Dillon made here to-night.  He started off and praised&mdash;because praise could not be withheld&mdash;the efficiency of the boot manufacturing industry in this country.  He said it was an industry that could hold its own anywhere; that our products compared favourably both in quality and price with those made elsewhere.  And then he said, in face of all the knowledge which he must have had and which everybody has of the history of that industry, that this was an industry that had been fostered and developed and established on a sound basis by our predecessors.  Why, the fact of the matter is that during their régime, during the greater part of it, that industry was in a very sore plight. When we came into office I think not more than one-sixth of the boots and shoes worn by the Irish people were made in this country.  I think I do not make an exaggerated claim when I say that now almost 90 per cent. of the boots and shoes worn by our people are made in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>And yet the employment has not been doubled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon went on to express concern as to what the effects of this tariff would be upon this great industry which he claimed his associates had built up.  The fact of the matter is that those engaged in that industry are perfectly satisfied with the arrangements that have been made for the establishment of these new tanneries.  They, too, appreciate the importance of having here some suitable supply of raw material, just the same as the Irish Leather Goods Company, which was dragged into the <Col N="1657" /> debate, will benefit indirectly by reason of the fact that as a by-product of some of these tanneries the raw materials of their industry will be made here.  So, too, with those engaged in boot manufacture&mdash;they are quite satisfied to see tanneries established here. In fact, some of the boot factories have an interest in the project, and I am sure they would not support and finance and help to establish an undertaking which they would regard as being inimical to their main industry. Deputy McGilligan, following on Deputy Dillon's lines, stated that we had treated the native tanning industry here with such disregard for its interests that some of the firms had closed down.  I pressed Deputy McGilligan to give me the name of an Irish tannery that had been closed down since we came into office.  When I pressed him he said &ldquo;the firm in Limerick.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am trying to put the Minister right as to what Deputy McGilligan said.  Of course, if the Minister does not want to be put right, I shall not insist; but what Deputy McGilligan definitely made clear was not that O'Callaghan's, of Limerick, had closed down, but that they had made complaints.  He distinctly said they had not closed down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>On this matter my word is as good as Deputy O'Sullivan's.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The words that Deputy McGilligan used were that a firm had been closed down.  I challenged him to name that firm, before he got away from the point.  He did not mention O'Callaghan's, but he said &ldquo;the firm in Limerick.&rdquo;  What is the fact?  Since we came into office, since there was a Party occupying these benches that was concerned with the development of Irish industry, the production capacity of that firm in Limerick has been more than doubled. <Col N="1658" /> That is the firm that we were told by Deputy McGilligan had been closed down.  He said not merely that, but that this native firm was going to be replaced&mdash;that we were bringing in proposals for the establishment of another sweat shop.  Does the Deputy remember that?  The implication was that this firm in Limerick which had been closed down, according to Deputy McGilligan, but which, in fact, has doubled its capacity, was going to be replaced by another sweat shop employing, he rather implied, female and child labour, knowing, as everybody knows, that employment in the tanning industry is almost entirely confined to males.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we had Deputy O'Sullivan.  I do not know whether members of the House have sometimes seen alleged humorous films in which, when small boys get into trouble, they release at an opportune moment a quadruped that emits a very unpleasant effiuvia and, under cover of the discomfort experienced, they escape.  I think Deputy O'Sullivan in this debate has doubled for that quadruped.  He started by making a reference to Deputy Briscoe.  He said that what he was concerned about, like Deputy Dillon, was the effect which this was going to have on subsidiary industries. He alleged that Deputy Briscoe&mdash;and Deputy Briscoe is behind me now and he can tell what he said&mdash;had used a phrase which implied that we regarded the boot manufacturing industry, this industry which manufactures now 4,9000,000 pairs of boots approximately, as a subsidiary industry.  What Deputy Briscoe did say was that he regarded the manufactured leather goods industry as a subsidiary industry.  But Deputy O'Sullivan got up, and I was told when I was endeavouring to correct his misstatement and to allow the House to know what Deputy Briscoe really said, that I ought to behave myself, that I ought to conduct myself, that I could not keep from interrupting, and all in order that Deputy O'Sullivan might cover up his tracks and make a speech on a foundation of mendacity that has rarely been equalled in this House&mdash;because the whole point of Deputy O'Sullivan's statement, the keystone of it, was his <Col N="1659" /> assertion that Deputy Briscoe had stated that the boot manufacturing industry was a subsidiary industry to the tanning industry in this country.</P>
    <P>Then, he went on to say that the House would be interested to know whether the Minister for Industry and Commerce had inquired of the boot manufacturers as to what their attitude towards this proposal of ours was going to be; and whether those of them engaged in the industry were going to be subjected to any inconvenience by reason of the fact that until the tanneries came up to full production they might have to import certain boot components under licence.  He went on to say that he was aware that numbers of them were so affected, implying thereby that more than one had been seriously inconvenienced and held up in their manufacturing process, because they could not get component parts.  The Deputy saw that he was going to be asked to give the names of more than one factory that had been so held up, and immediately he covered his tracks and said that he knew of one case where a certain person had been seriously inconvenienced because of that.  Again, knowing that he was going to be asked to give particulars of that one instance, he proceeded to utter the slanderous and false statement that he has made so often here in this House.  He implied that, with the powerful Opposition on the other side of the House, and with independent members sitting here in this House, and the Labour Party ready to protest against any discrimination of one citizen against another or against the victimisation of any citizen, these people were afraid to protest because they knew that the wrath of the Minister would be visited upon them.  That might be all very well, and some people might believe it, if it was some poor individual who was stated to be under that apprehension.  But we are dealing now with a powerful, well-organised industry with huge resources behind it.  The boot manufacturers have an active and strong organisation. Does Deputy O'Sullivan expect the House, or anyone, to believe that if any one of the members of that association <Col N="1660" /> was placed at the disadvantage that he alleges, he would be afraid to come to the Minister, or that he would not go to his own association and ask that association to take up this question of inconvenience under which he was suffering and to put it before the Minister?</P>
    <P>I do not believe for a moment that Deputy O'Sullivan believes a single word of what he said.  He gets up here and speaks in a tone of oily hypocrisy, twisting and misrepresenting the words of Deputies, and putting words into their mouths that they never used, and then he talks of good manners, good breeding or good conduct.  He is well fitted to sit on the same side as the Deputy who got up and sneered at those to whom he owned he owed his life.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether there is anything else to be said on this motion.  I endeavoured to confine myself to things that I thought were relevant; but if I touched on things that might be irrelevant it was because advantage was taken to misrepresent this proposal to the people of the country at large.  The fact remains, whether a man's name ends in &ldquo;Berg&rdquo; or &ldquo;Isaacs&rdquo; or commences with &ldquo;Fitz&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mac&rdquo;&mdash;whatever the prefix or the suffix&mdash;that this is a proposal that will establish four new tanneries at Gorey, Carrick-on-Suir, Dungarvan and Passage West.  Deputy Mulcahy's amendment, if approved, would prevent those four towns having the benefit of this new industry and would not alone check the development of the tanning industry but prevent the general development of this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever the purpose for which the amendment was put down it has failed in the one purposed I had in mind.  I was told by the Minister for Finance, on 31st <Col N="1661" /> October, 1935, that the duty that was being imposed, was imposed for the purpose of increasing production.  We have not got the slightest idea of the volume of industrial production which has been created by this duty.  The Minister has compiled information as to the general types of leather, and the different types of leather, brought into the country, but even with that as a basis he has made no attempt to give us any idea of the volume of production which will be undertaken in this country as a result of the Order.  He has not given the slightest idea of the number of persons who will be given employment as a result of the Order.  So that the Minister can be quite satisfied that this nefarious amendment has not dragged, either from himself or any member of his Party, the information which this House wants, and the information that I endeavoured to see that the House should get.  We have not got it.  We know the 37½ per cent. is going on to these additional types of leather, but we are given no guarantee that the people who want this type of leather, to keep in production for the types of boots and shoes they are making, are going to get it.  The Minister's answer is: &ldquo;Do you think that a big group of boot manufacturers are not going to get anything they want in that particular line?&rdquo; Let him not tell us that the boot manufacturers have already developed into such a solid combine that they are able to control the whole position in this country; and do not try to persuade us that there is not a certain <Col N="1662" /> amount of competition still among the boot manufacturers in the country. We have got no information.</P>
      <P>With regard to the other matter that Deputy MacDermot said quite rightly he thought the House had heard enough about, I tell the Minister for Finance that the Jewish community in this country in the past were an orderly, decent community and no one had anything to say against them.  To-day they suffer from being defended by Deputy Briscoe and from the type of people who are washed into the ports of the Free State owing to the Minister's tariff policy.  I am just as determined to defend the interests of the Jewish community as any other section, whether against Deputy Briscoe's defence or the interference of the new importations that are coming in.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, at any rate, knows that members of the Jewish community have been driven out of businesses they established here before the new invasion. They have been done out of that business in the interests of newcomers. The Minister for Industry and Commerce knows about that; he does not want discussion about that.  If the Minister for Finance is interested in the people about whom he speaks, he might attempt to defend them from the inside; in the meantime, we will try to defend them from the outside.</P>

      <P>I put down this amendment for the purpose of having a discussion on the proposal to put a Customs duty of 33? per cent. on articles made of iron and steel that are laminated springs which are suitable for use as parts of vehicles, leaves which are component parts of such springs, axles, axle-boxes, axle-arms, etc., windscreens and component parts of windscreens.  With a view to helping myself and the House to understand the matter, I put down four questions addressed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance, but neither the Minister for Industry nor the Minister for Finance, although they have apparently gone into this particular matter, could tell us that the duty imposed by the Order has been imposed for the purpose of creating industrial production and that a new industry is to be established which will create new employment. Although they have carried on a discussion that enabled them to make that statement in the House, they have not in reply to questions been able to tell us what the amount or the nature of the production is going to be, or what amount of employment is going to be given in the country.  We simply have a negative answer to any questions on these points.  I do not think the House should impose a duty of 33? per cent. on these articles on negative statements of that kind from Ministers as to the employment given and the nature of the production.  If the <Col N="1665" /> Minister wants the House to agree to the proposal, and to allow this tariff to stand, he should give the House some information about this new industry, what the nature of the production is and the employment that is to be given.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear, although I am perfectly certain that the event will disprove the Deputy's statement, that he has not yet made up his mind to oppose this tariff because it is the first time, in the course of the debate on the Schedule to the Bill, that the Deputy has even made a pretence of having an open mind on the question of tariffs.  However, I think that possibly there may be some substance in his profession of possessing an open mind on this Reference because this tariff differs slightly from those imposed by other Orders.  It covers a considerable number of articles, most of which have been already protected, but in the case of most of them that protection has been at the rate of 50 per cent. It is due to the arrangements which have been made that we are able to reduce the tariff to the general level of 33? per cent. and at the same time enable a new factory to be established at Wexford.  It is not possible, nor do I think it is desirable, for me to make any quantitative statement as to the amount of employment which will be given by the factory.  I can assure the Deputy that it will be appreciable and that it will certainly justify the step which we are now asking the House to take.  Most of the articles covered by the tariff are articles which require a certain industrial tradition to manufacture successfully, and I should say 98 per cent. of which, have been imported into this country.  There is no doubt whatever that our people, particularly the people in Wexford, who have a tradition in these matters&mdash;they have been engaged in a kindred industry for a number of years&mdash;will be able to produce there articles which will not be inferior to those which we are importing.</P>

      <P>May I say, being familiar with the reason why this <Col N="1666" /> tariff is being applied, that I think it is only right that I should tell the House what I know about the industry established in Wexford.  The factory is almost completed and the company expect to enter upon manufacture early in the new year.  In a conversation which I had with the managing director about two months ago, he assured me that all adult labour would be employed and that anything between 500 and 1,000 employees would be working in this factory inside about a month from now.</P>

      <P>I do not understand how it is that the Deputy for Wexford is so much more able than the Minister for Finance to give information with regard to the tariff. One would expect that the Minister for Finance, in presenting his case to the House, would be able to tell us something of what has developed in Wexford.  He simply tells us that we may take it from him that the employment which will be given as a result of the tariff will be appreciable, and that, of the items mentioned here, some are already subject to a tariff of 50 per cent. I should like to test the Minister's veracity a little bit by asking him which of these items is at the present moment subject to a 50 per cent. tariff.</P>

      <P>I know that very well, but the Minister for Industry <Col N="1667" /> and Commerce and the Minister for Finance make this House feel that if they and every official in their Departments were walking books of reference the House would not get the information if it was inconvenient to publish the information.  The Minister is prepared to admit that by a smile.  However, with regard to this matter the House is now put in this position by Deputy Corish, that he knows of new developments in the town of Wexford arising out of the framing of this Order and that they are going to provide new employment in the town of Wexford for 500 to 1,000 men.  The presentation of the case that this House has got from the Minister is simply what I have said, that employment is going to be appreciable.  I, for one, am going to oppose the treating of important matters connected with Irish industry in this way.  Even if this House is only going to be a registering machine for the decisions of the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Finance, it should get the information that these Ministers have when they are dealing with matters of such importance to our people as the development of industry.</P>

I quite agree that members on the Opposition Benches feel themselves at liberty to talk in most extravagant fashion about private individuals, dragging in their names quite unnecessarily in the course of debate, and coupling them with &ldquo;Kelly, Burke and Shea.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>When we refer to private individuals and private concerns we have to remember that these people might not like their names to be bandied to and fro across the House in the manner in which Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy McGilligan sometimes think fit to endeavour to do.  Therefore, I am not in a position to come here and expose everything that relates to a private concern.  The Deputy has had the benefit and advantage of hearing a member of the House, one of the Deputies for the constituency of Wexford, say what he thinks of this new industry and what he has been told about it.  Yet, we were told by Deputy Mulcahy that he had an open mind on this matter when he put down this amendment, using the fact that Ministers have to discuss these matters with a certain amount of reserve as an excuse for carrying out the policy of his Party and opposing the establishment of this industry which we are told is, at any rate, going to give a considerable amount of employment in Wexford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not regard this as a matter concerning a private individual.  When the Dáil is asked to impose a substantial duty on a regular list of materials coming into this country and to do that for the purpose of developing sound Irish industry here, I do not regard that as a matter that in any way should be cloaked over as a private transaction between the Minister for Finance and some private individual who is going to run the industry, or between the Minister for Industry and Commerce and that particular person.  The very fact that a Deputy of this House feels that he can get up here and say that at least 500 persons are going to be employed in Wexford as a result of this Order makes this House all the more dissatisfied with the treatment of the matter by the Ministers.  Why could not the Ministers tell us that?  Will the Minister for Finance tell us that what Deputy Corish has said is substantially true to his knowledge?  Will he go as far as that?  The Minister will not. The Minister simply says: &ldquo;Here is the tariff; the employment will be appreciable; I cannot tell you how <Col N="1669" /> many of these things were ever used or how many of them will ever be made; I cannot tell you anything about the cost of them, the employment that will be given or the circumstances under which people will be employed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Again, I want to say that this is not a private transaction between any Wexford man or Wexford company or between a Galway man and a Galway company and the Minister.  It is the taking of a public decision here on a matter affecting the general public of the country.  I oppose dealing with these matters in this particular way and will continue to do so.  If Ministers were interested really in the proper development of Irish industry and in educating the House as to what can be done by means of tariffs to develop Irish industry, they would become more expansive, both on the question of their difficulties in the matter as well as on the question of the information that they have been able to acquire from people who come to them looking for tariffs, or to whom they go asking for assistance, in a commercial way, in the development of Irish industry here.</P>

    <Title>League of Nations (Obligations of Membership) Order&mdash;Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the League of Nations (Obligations of Membership) Order, 1935, be and is hereby annulled.</P>
      <P>This motion stands in my name and in the name of Deputy Kent.  This Order is the outcome of a Bill passed here a week or a fortnight ago.  That Bill gave powers to the Executive Council to make certain Orders.  It gave that power in that they make the Orders and in the exercise of that power, so conferred, they have made the Order which I move to have annulled.  In putting down this motion, we in no way challenge the authority of the Executive Council to make the Order, but we question the wisdom of the Order, and on that line I propose to give the reasons why we consider it unwise-and injudicious to make this Order now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case made for this Order is based on our obligations to the League as a member of that body. We should examine this position especially in the peculiar circumstances in which we find ourselves and ascertain what are our obligations under the Covenant of the League of Nations.  Under Article XV of the Covenant, a matter in dispute can be referred to the Council and the Council can decide whether it is the domestic affair of the particular member or not.  That has a peculiar significance for us here.  We have the most stringent sanctions <Col N="1679" /> imposed on us, and if the matter of those sanctions were ever introduced by way of complaint at Geneva, we must take it that the ruling of the Council was that it was a domestic affair of Britain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputy is leaving the Order already?  He is endeavouring to discuss sanctions which the House has decided on and whether the Executive Council had any authority to impose sanctions.  He has no right to discuss that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not discussing sanctions.  This House passed an Act enabling the Executive Council to do certain things and I am questioning the wisdom of the Executive Council in doing those things.  The Act did nothing except to give power already in this House to the Executive Council.  The Executive Council then had the power of this House vested in them and they made this Order by virtue of that power.  In making that Order, they must have had regard to some considerations and I am reciting those considerations.  The considerations must be that we have obligations under the Covenant of the League of Nations as a member of that body, and if we have obligations under that Covenant, surely we must have rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>What are the considerations that weighed with the Executive Council?  I can only glean these from the background of this Order.  As I said at the outset, and as I repeat, I am not challenging their authority to make the Order but I am questioning the wisdom of making it.  In doing so, I must go over the reasons that actuated them in making the Order and these reasons must be that we are a member of the League of Nations.  The President has at no time said, so far as I am aware, that we should take this line regardless of whether there was an obligation on us or not.  I have carefully read all the speeches delivered on <Col N="1680" /> this question and the only person who made that point was Senator Blythe in the Seanad.  The President did not go as far as that.  He staked his whole case on our obligations.  I want to endeavour to show that we have no obligations.  We can have no obligations, if we have not got rights and surely, if we have not rights as a member of the League of Nations, we cannot be bound by obligations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that, as, in fact, you have ruled, that line of argument is completely out of order.  It is perfectly easy to answer and no one would wish to shirk a debate on the general background, as the Deputy calls it, of this Order.  But if it is not to be in order for other Deputies to go into these matters, it is certainly not in order for Deputy Belton to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I take strong exception to the intrusion of Deputy MacDermot in the way in which he has obtruded himself in this debate.  He can laugh <Col N="1681" /> but his sneers should be made in another place and not in this House. We have a short time at our disposal. I endeavoured to economise that time as much as possible and Deputy MacDermot has had plenty of say in this matter, both inside and outside the House, and he has made very bad use of it.  It does not redound to his credit.  I did not say that I wanted to debate the background of this Order but I said that to find out the reasons which actuated the Executive Council in making this Order, I had myself to search in the background.  That is a very different thing from proposing to discuss it here.  I said, and I repeat for the benefit of the interruptors if there is any intelligence amongst them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that I recognised that the authority under the Act passed by this Oireachtas is the authority of the Executive Council for making this Order.  We accept that, and we must accept it.  But we question their wisdom.  If this Order was not made, the Act was a dead letter, but the Order is made implementing the Act and the Executive Council have absolute freedom of choice as to whether they should or should not make the Order.  We question their wisdom in the exercise of that freedom of choice.  If Deputy MacDermot's intelligence is so sluggish that he cannot appreciate that point, I pity him.  I said that where there are obligations there must be rights.  The question of sanctions against us was not raised anywhere to my knowledge. If it were raised, it must have been ruled by the Council that it was a domestic matter.</P>

We are joining in this League, but not to fight the manhood of Italy.  The President said: &ldquo;There will be nothing of that kind; we will never conscript a man, even though we are bound under our obligations.&rdquo;  He has made an Order by which we are cowardly to help in our small way to starve the women and children of Italy, but we have not the pluck to fight the manhood of Italy.  What kind of gratitude is that? I read a few days ago in an American paper that the Italian Government was the only Government in the world that sent us a message of sympathy when the Black-and-Tans were here. I suppose Deputy MacDermot knows all about that.</P>
      <P>Now, our first international act, so to speak, is to join with other nations in starving out the Italian nation. That in itself should be sufficient for this House to annul this Order. Circumscribed as I have been in not being&mdash;according to your ruling, which I accept&mdash;able to give fully the reasons why this House should reject this Order, my speech will be a short one. It is certainly a poor recompense for us who, in our hour of trial, got only one message of sympathy from a foreign Government&mdash;from the Italian Government.</P>

      <P>We have now to make our choice.  Are we going to do our little bit to starve the nation that has given Europe her civilisation, the nation that has been the cradle of Christianity and the spiritual home of all Catholics in all ages?  I thought the President would hesitate when the Rector of the Irish College in Rome spoke.  I thought he would hesitate when his friend, Arehbishop Mannix, spoke.  I thought he would hesitate when Father Coughlan of the United States spoke.  Evidently he did not listen to them.  But he is <Col N="1686" /> listening to another viear-on-earth&mdash; Deputy MacDermot.  We came to an arrangement in this matter.  The President is to speak at 10 o'clock and I will not take up any more of the time of the House.  The House understands the situation quite well, even though the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has been very meticulous in his ruling.  Even so, the case is pretty well known to every member of the House.  Every Deputy here will be called upon before 10.30 o'clock to register his or her vote for or against this un-Christian and un-Catholic act, as described by Monsignor Curran, the Rector of the Irish College in Rome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, there can be no sanctions without this Order.  The Rector of the Irish College knew very well that this was coming, otherwise his appeal was meaningless.  The Executive Council made the Order and it was this Order the Rector was anticipating.  It could be nothing else but this Order.  This is the time when we can annul it.  I hope that annulled it will be.  This Order will do us no good.  On the contrary, it will do us harm.  This House can, by annulling this Order, exercise its choice now.  When other breaches of the Covenant were not punished&mdash; when others who broke the Covenant were allowed to go unpunished&mdash;then surely that Article of the Covenant became a dead letter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we make this Order absolute we start a new chapter.  We reimpose all those conditions that we had before anything went by default.  If we make this Order absolute we will not have an opportunity again without dishonour of getting out of our entanglements.  I would appeal to the President to weigh very carefully the whole situation before he reimposes conditions now.  These conditions he cannot afterwards get out of without dishonour or without <Col N="1687" /> conscripting the youth of this country. That is quite plain to anyone who reads the Articles of the Covenant.</P>
    <P>The President has stated that he has the country behind him in this matter.  I question if he has this House behind him on the question of these sanctions.  If he wants to give a fair chance to this House, I ask him to give every Deputy here freedom of choice to vote for or against the motion I am moving. I ask the Opposition to do the same. If they do not do so, Deputies on both sides of the House will be entitled to hope that they have heard the last word as to the condemnation of dictators in this country.  Give the House and the Deputies a chance to speak their minds.  Take off the Whips.  Every Deputy was sent in here by eight to ten thousand voters, I want to say that I have not met one man, woman or child outside the House who is not against this Order. I ask the President and the Opposition as well to give the people that each Deputy here represents, a chance.  Every individual to whom I have spoken is against this Order. Deputies know the views and the feelings of the people in their own constituencies.  The Deputy is the custodian only of the views of his constituents and of their votes for the time being.  In every democratic organisation the delegate from the branch or from the area must voice the feelings of that area.  I submit that every Deputy here owes a prior duty to his constituents and to his country&mdash;a duty far above his Party affiliations.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the President, if he wants to know what this House really thinks, to let this go to a free vote.  I suggest the same to Deputy McGilligan, who occupies the Opposition Front Bench at the moment.  If you do not do that, you are afraid even of the members of your own Party.  Constituents would like to be able to go to their own representatives and either congratulate them or ask them why they did so-and-so.  But if they go now, what is the answer?  &ldquo;The Party Whips were put on and we had to <Col N="1688" /> vote the way we were told.&rdquo;  Let each man stand up to his responsibility and vote according to his conscience and then face the music.  If the President does not allow that, then he cannot claim to have this House behind him, much less the country.  I challenge the President and the Leader of the Opposition to take off the Whips and let this go to a free vote.</P>

I am really at a loss to know after the ruling of the Chair, where I shall commence to support this motion.  I consider when this Order was brought into the House it was rushed with undue haste and there was no serious consideration given to the consequences which would follow its passage.  I wish to give my views on this matter as plainly, as explicitly, as I possibly can, and I shall do it in an honest and patriotic way.  I consider it my duty to ask that this Order, which imposes sanctions on a great Catholic country such as Italy, be annulled.  I was rather surprised to hear from the Vice-President of the Executive Council the announcement that through all the years of persecution and through the Black and Tan régime there was not one word of sympathy from the Italian nation.  What sympathy did we get from the English Government when they let loose&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I consider, also, that it will be one of the black marks in the history of our country when we are dead and gone and perhaps completely forgotten&mdash;it will be sad history for generations yet unborn to read of this Order, imposed on one of the grandest Catholic countries in this world by an Irish Parliament.  I repeat that it will be one of the blackest pages in the history of our country.  I sincerely hope that my words will not be misinterpreted or my statements misconstrued. One thing I can say is this, that our President went to Geneva as the representative of our people and he discharged his obligations honourably, as we expected.  I must say, also, that not since the days of Parnell, the great leader of the Irish people, had I such implicit confidence in any leader as I have in our President.</P>

      <P>I regret that Deputy MacDermot did not put down a comprehensive amendment which would enable us to discuss most of the matters now ruled out of order.  I approach this matter from a somewhat different angle from that of the Deputies who preceded me I am very concerned about creating an atmosphere of world peace.  I regard this Order, and Orders similar to it, as so many acts of war.  Deputy Belton said, and said rightly, that if we have rights we have also obligations, and if we have obligations we have also rights. We claim the right to do certain things. Notwithstanding what Deputy Norton said, we, in this document, are imposing certain obligations upon our citizens, and, if you like, certain rights.  I say this by way of preface because I want to give the President ample time to reply.  Some Deputies think that we are not taking military action.  Deputy MacDermot suggested as much.  Well, if Part I of the Schedule is not military action, I do not know what military action means.  It is set out that, amongst other things, we cannot export to Italy rifles, carbines and their barrels.  They are not used for ornamental purposes.  Machines guns are not used for purposes of ornament. Guns, howitzers and mortars of all calibres, their mountings, barrels and recoil mechanisms are not used for ornamental purposes.  Then we come down to Category II&mdash;vessels of war of all kinds, including aircraft carriers and submarines.  There is not one word about the &ldquo;Muirchu.&rdquo;  Then we have Category III, covering aircraft, etc.  I would suggest to the President that, notwithstanding our membership of the League of Nations&mdash;I am not going to touch on sanctions, and I do not want <Col N="1694" /> to put forward an interrogatory of the President's action on that occasion &mdash;we should not be called upon to enforce this Order.  We are called upon to put this Order into effect because of the action of our President at Geneva.  I am relating this document to the attitude of our President at Geneva.  As I have said, I am more in favour of creating an atmosphere of peace than I am in favour of creating an atmosphere of war, but I do feel that if the President, instead of making himself busy in moving in the direction which now finds its expression in this document&mdash;I have to be a little verbose in trying to explain what I mean, as I want carefully and meticulously to avoid that word &ldquo;sanctions&rdquo;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Well, Sir, this Order states amongst other things that we cannot export rifles, carbines, and their barrels, etc. to Italy.  It also sets out in Category III: &ldquo;Aircraft, assembled or dismantled, both heavier and lighter than air and their propellors or airscrews, fuselages, aerial gun-mounts and frames, hulls, tail units and undercarriage units; also aircraft-engines.&rdquo; All those things in my view are acts of war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other things contained in this document, the League of Nations (Obligations of Membership) Order, which, in my view and in the views of many other people, are acts of war. Any encouragement given by way of this Order or similar Orders to either of the countries engaged in this conflict in Ethiopia are and should be regarded as acts of war.  If we are encouraging either of the parties to that great conflict we are engaged in an act of war. I would ask the President&mdash;he is very fond of bringing his metaphysical mind to bear on those things&mdash;if he does not consider that I am perfectly correct in saying that this document and all it purports to contain is an act of <Col N="1695" /> aggression and an act of war?  It cannot be denied.  We are, whether we like it or not, engaged in it just as much as if we had been exporting all those howitzers and all the other lethal weapons mentioned in this Order.  We are to as great an extent, if perhaps not as actively, engaged in an act of war as if we had conscripted and sent out some of our manhood.  Of course, I feel that that is quite a fantastic idea on the part of Deputy Belton&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In my approach to this question I also differ from those who have preceded me in this way: I am not altogether concerned with what the President of the Irish College in Rome said; I am not concerned with what other great ecclesiastics have said in this matter, but I am concerned as an ordinary citizen of this country who does not want to see this country involved in any kind of war. I do not want to see it involved either directly or indirectly in a war which, after all, is of little concern to us.  I am not going to go into the lack of civilisation on the part of the Ethiopians or Abyssinians.  All that Deputy Belton has said, of course, in relation to their lack of civilisation is perfectly true, while on the other hand, Italy is a grand and noble country. I feel that we could have kept our hands out of this, at the same time remembering that when we went into the League of Nations if we had our rights there were also obligations, and I think Deputy Norton would like to stand up to our obligations.  On the other hand, it is rather extraordinary, to say the least of it, that out of the seven great Powers represented at that conference only three of them subscribed to the arguments which in their case also will bring <Col N="1696" /> forth such documents as the one I hold in my hand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just saying that those discussions on the part of three great Powers resulted in those three great Powers having to issue Orders such as the one we are now considering. That, I submit, is quite in order. I regret that our President who, after all, has had a good deal of experience, did not take the line that I and others like me would wish to see him taking. Whilst not shirking any of our obligations, he should at least see that he would throw in his weight on the side of peace, and not on the side of war. I am now concluding because I know that the President has not very much time in which to reply.</P>

      <P>I will not delay the House for more than a few minutes.  I want to know whether the President has consulted the manufacturers in this State of rifles, carbines and their barrels before he issued this Order.  I want to know whether the various factories employed in the production of machine guns, automatic rifles, machine pistols, and so on have been consulted, because I am sure the interests of those firms will be very severely handicapped if this Order is enforced.  We have had so much trouble and labour building up those factories that I think they should be fully consulted before an Order of such importance is issued.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that that would be fair, because there is a contract that the workmen employed in those factories have to continue in work at least 48 hours a week, and I do not think they can strike.  Of course the manufacture of bombs, torpedoes and mines is a very serious matter.  I remember that one of the factories, when it <Col N="1697" /> was started, suffered very great hardships and handicaps in finding suitable occupation.  I do not know whether or not they are still in action, but if they are I should like to hear whether they were consulted before the Order was issued.  That also applies to aircraft, and so on. I should like to say, Sir, that, as we decided to take the action that we did, this Order must necessarily follow, but I should like to know from the President if in the meantime there has not been considerable wobbling on the part of some people who decided to impose similar Orders, and if it is now definitely intended to impose sanctions or impose Orders on the export of petrol and all those things to Italy.  If the export to Italy of petrol, and all the various components thereof, is allowed freely to go on, I do not think there is any great point in this Order, and I do not think anything is going to be effected by it, except the one thing&mdash;we are going to allow the military machine to be used to its full limit, and the people at home will certainly suffer very grave hardships through the lack of food supplies which would be exported from the various countries to Italy.  In that sense, I am in agreement with Deputy Belton that, if the Order is to have any effect, all the nations should definitely see to it that the military machine would be stopped.  I maintain that if petrol, oil and all those things are allowed to be exported freely to Italy then the Order is absolutely worthless, and will go to inflict hardship on the people of Italy.  What I would suggest is that instead of the Order being approved, the putting of it into effect should be postponed until it is finally ascertained what is going to be the action of the Council in applying the prohibition against the export of petrol and its constituent parts to Italy.  If we are going to continue exporting these commodities to Italy, then I think we should not put this Order into force at all because it is of no importance.</P>

      <P>In any case I shall only detain the House a very few minutes.  It seems to me that this Order could legitimately be challenged only on the ground that it did not conform with the decisions taken by the Dáil a fortnight ago, that it went beyond them or that it failed to carry them into effect or else that the Order is made at the wrong time.  None of these things can be said.  The terms of the Order to which Deputy Belton is objecting are terms that are entirely within the scope of the Bill as passed by this House.  There is practically no detail in the Order that could not have been discussed in Committee on that Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that Deputy MacEoin has undervalued the importance of the Order.  I quite agree with him that if we really mean business and that if the nations forming the League could be got to act together with sufficient determination, the most useful thing they could do would be to prohibit the export of oil to Italy and I hope that may be done.  Even if it is not done, however, the mere fact of cutting off the Italian export trade is bound to have a very big effect.  If the Italians had only known a year ago that aggression towards Abyssinia would result in the destruction of the Italian export trade, I believe that we should have a very much less unpleasant tale to tell of the last 12 months.  Deputy MacEoin says that the effect of the Order will <Col N="1699" /> be to inflict hardship on the people rather than on the military machine. Well, you have to hit the people in order to hit the military machine, unfortunately.  You hit the military machine by creating a bad financial situation in Italy such as you will create by destroying the export trade. In modern warfare it is impossible to separate the civilian population from the military machine.  In striking at one you strike at the other, too.  There has been a lot of talk about military action.  It is said that this action amounts to military action. If words have any meaning at all, it seems to me that that statement has no sense.  Military action means that you fight, and it has never been suggested that you go to war by refusing to export munitions of war to a nation.  If so, the United States would be at war with every country that is ever involved in a war, because they have forbidden the export of munitions of war to countries at war.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>If you refuse to export munitions, that is not military action.  It is injuring the military machine but it is not military action.</P>
      <P>Is this Order untimely?  Is it being brought into force unnecessarily soon? Deputy Anthony spoke as a man of peace in favour of methods of peace rather than of strong action, but he seems to have ignored the fact that methods of peace were tried out <i>ad nauseam</i> for a long period.  The most tremendous efforts were made to arrive at a peaceful settlement before strong action was taken and before we were driven to carry out the obligations of the Covenant by Orders such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case put up by Deputy Belton against the Order, as far as I can make out, is that it is unpopular.  Well, of course it is unpopular.  It is unpopular with everybody in this House probably.  None of us likes having to do these things.  None of us likes sacrificing the goodwill of a nation which has done no harm to us and for which we have a good deal of sentimental <Col N="1700" /> feeling, but the fact that it is not popular should not deter us from performing a duty, if it is a duty.  He and others have talked about the wickedness of starving the women and children in Italy but the answer to that has been already given and is a complete one.  There was a letter in the English <i>Times</i> not very long ago answering a suggestion just of that kind in which the writer told a story of a little girl who was shown a picture by her mother of a number of Christians in the arena in ancient Rome being devoured by lions.  Her mother expected her to express horror at the fate of the Christians, but all she said was: &ldquo;Mammy, there is one poor lion who has not got any Christian.&rdquo;  People whose tears come into their eyes about starving Italian women and children should remember what is happening to the women and children in Abyssinia.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say just one word?  I do not accept Deputy MacDermot's interpretation of the Rules of Order as he attempted to raise them several times to-night.  The one point that it is necessary to consider here is that the Executive Council have thought fit to bring in this Order because they believe that it is necessary to implement the provisions of the Bill which has just been passed.  It is necessary fully to implement what is in that.  People should remember when they vote for this&mdash;I expect the House will vote for it by a huge majority&mdash; against Italy, Italy being, undeniably, a great Catholic nation, that they are doing it and doing it properly and that they are going to, if necessary, starve women and children in Italy.  Let no one shirk that issue.  It is not so much that we are prohibiting exports from this country that is going to count as far as this country is concerned, but rather that we are prohibiting the importation of Italian goods to this country.  If Italy is not allowed to export her goods then she cannot have the money to buy anything even, possibly, food.  People must vote with a clear mind as to what they are doing: that, if necessary, they are going to vote for starvation, that being better than allowing the Italian nation aggressively to massacre the Ethiopians.  That is the sole issue for us.  It is ludicrous for people to attempt to believe that there is no possibility of starvation.  In this we are stopping all credit transactions.  We are stopping the export of our goods to Italy, and taking steps to see that no Italian goods will be imported into this country.  That is as clean a split as one could have, and we are doing that against a Catholic nation because we believe that that nation has behaved scandalously.</P>

      <P>I never accepted that.  It would have led to destruction in this country, and it is a bad phrase.  At any rate, people should know what they are doing in this.  If any Deputy has any hesitation about it, because he believes it is going to mean starvation, let him falter now instead of later.  This is something that no one can have any joy in voting for, and no one should vote for it except under the stern condition of duty, and there ought to be a conscientious belief in the rectitude of what is being done.  There ought to be an absolute, definite clear-cut and precise clarity of mind about the effect of what is being done, so that there may be no nonsense hereafter and no weakling attitude in respect to Italy on the grounds of religion.</P>
      <P>If we take this step there ought to be no complaint afterwards that people did not know that, in the end, this may mean the break-up of Italian civilisation as it is at the moment.  Some people might welcome that and others deplore it.  Something was said about hitting at the machine, but if you cannot hit at the military machine there is this danger of hitting at the civilian population through the food of the people, and the necessities of life may bring about a state of revolution, the last stage of which will be worse than the first.  We have got to take that risk, and people should remember that that risk is being taken by us because we believe that it is proper to take it in the circumstances that have ensued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (The President)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is impossible to attempt to reply to some of the arguments that have been put forward here this evening because to do so would, in my opinion, at any rate&mdash;and the Chair has so ruled&mdash;take us altogether outside <Col N="1703" /> the terms of the motion.  The terms of the motion are that this Order ought to be annulled.  Some reason for annulling this Order should be given, but no reason for annulling it has been given except, in general, that sanctions should not be imposed. I take it that is a question the House considered when power was given to the Executive Council to bring in Orders of this sort.  There is nothing in this Order that is contrary to the principle which was accepted by the House when the Bill was passed two weeks ago, and, because there is not, speakers have avoided the issue and have gone back to discuss the general principles which were debated when the Bill was before the House.</P>
      <P>There has been some suggestion of wobbling that might be related to this Order: the suggestion that at this time we should hold our hands and that the time for this was not appropriate.  I do not see any indication whatever of wobbling.  The proposals in question here were decided on and agreed on by 52 States.  These States agreed that Italy had acted the part of the aggressor.  Fifty-two States agreed to the major part of these proposals, 48 to another portion of them and 44 was, I think, the smallest number that we had assenting to any of these proposals. These are being carried out.  As a matter of fact, proposal No. 1 is in effective operation in 48 State-members of the League; proposal Nos. 2 is in effective operation in 47 State-members of the League; proposals Nos. 3 and 4 are in effective operation in 43 State-members of the League, and proposal No. 5 is in effective operation in 42 State-members of the League. There is no indication of wobbling in that.  Apparently, there is the question of further sanctions and the disposition to examine these: to see how far agreement can be got about the imposition of them, and whether these further sanctions would, in fact, effect a purpose for which these sanctions were intended, the purpose behind them being to prevent, if possible, aggression such as Italy has been held to be guilty of in the case of Ethiopia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the whole issue here.  I have <Col N="1704" /> not heard any argument except one of wobbling which could properly be related at all to the Order.  I have nothing, therefore, to answer&mdash;nothing except that.  I am not going to go back again on the broader question as to whether we should or should not impose these sanctions.  That question was very definitely decided by the House on a former occasion when, I think, only two Deputies dissented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems strange that the President finds nothing to reply to in all that has been said by the various people.  He claims that because the Bill was passed by the House it is just a matter of form to make an Order.  But, does the President overlook the fact that the Act itself says that the Executive Council may make an Order in such and such terms? Therefore, the Executive Council has freedom within the terms of the Act as to whether it will or will not make an Order.  There is nothing obligatory on the Executive Council to make an Order so far as I can gather from my reading of the Act.  Deputy Norton said that we should reject my motion, even though that may mean starving the women and children of Italy.  In effect, I think the Deputy said that we should remember that Italy is trying to starve the women and children of Abyssinia.  The League of Nations was set up as an institution to put down slavery, but slavery is rampant in Abyssinia and the League of Nations has shut its eyes to that.  Deputy McGilligan says that we must not blink the fact that Italy is a great Catholic nation, and that, if necessary, we must starve the women and children of Italy.  Why did we not starve the women and children of Japan, which was the first nation to break the Covenant?</P>

      <P>Article 16 of the Covenant says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Should any member of the League resort to war, in disregard of its covenants under Articles 12, 13 or 15, it shall <i>ipso facto</i> be deemed to have committed an act of war against all other members of the League...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Sub-section (2) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It shall be the duty of the council in such case to recommend to the several Governments concerned what effective military, naval or air force the members of the League shall severally contribute to the armed forces to be used to protect the covenant of the League.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If these are ineffective will the President say if the next step must be the application of that Order?  Is he prepared to come to this House and say: &ldquo;We have burned our boats now.  I want the authority of this House to send out so many men, so many guns, so many aeroplanes, so many tanks, and so many ships of war&rdquo;?  If that is not enough is he prepared to say that we must have military service for the manhood of this country to support it because it is our duty?  Is the President going to say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to that?  Is there one Deputy who, under any circumstances, would vote for conscription?  Not one.  Surely anyone who would vote for it without being prepared to go the whole hog, and to conscript every man, would be a hypocrite or dishonest.  Deputy McGilligan said: &ldquo;Let us do things with our eyes open.&rdquo;  I say to Deputy McGilligan: &ldquo;Let him do it with his eyes widely open.&rdquo;  There is no one better able to comprehend the English language than the Deputy.  He cannot contradict the sub-section of the Covenant that I have read.  When the League delegates did not impose sanctions against Japan we have a way out.  They did not come to our assistance when sanctions were imposed against us, and they are still <Col N="1706" /> operating against us.  The President as our representative in Geneva never asked the Council of the League to consider that question.  He has accepted the position that, according to the Covenant, it is a domestic matter.  Otherwise he neglected his duty.  The road is quite clear.  I do not suppose any other Deputy will put up a motion dealing with this question. If the House turns down this motion, and if the Order becomes absolute&mdash; and we have a way out because sanctions were not imposed against Japan&mdash;that way out will be gone, and we will have to fulfil all our obligations and with the various Governments we will be asked to say what military help we will give.  What will be our answer?  Are we to break our word?  Are we to dishonour our bond or are we to send out our Army and to follow that up with conscripts? That is the situation and that is what the House will vote on to-night.  I will read a letter that Lieutenant-Colonel Cyril Rocke, D.S.O., British Military Attaché in Rome 1918-20, has addressed to the Archbishop of Canterbury. Perhaps it would be better if I read a paragraph, as it will be illuminating on the civilisation that Deputy Norton referred to.</P>
