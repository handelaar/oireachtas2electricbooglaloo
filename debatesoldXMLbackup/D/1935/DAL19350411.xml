      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett (for Major Myles)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that poor rate collectors have been notified by the secretaries of county councils that in accordance with the provisions of Section 6 of the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1935, rate receipts are no longer exempt from stamp duty; and that an adhesive stamp value twopence must be affixed to all rate receipts for amounts of two pounds and upwards; and whether the Minister proposes to issue instructions to the country councils to make provision for the cost of these stamps out of the county funds; or whether it is intended that these expenses shall be borne by the rate collectors who are the employees of the county councils.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.</P>
      <P>The poor rate collectors will not be called on to bear any additional expense by reason of the abolition of the exemption of poor rate receipts from stamp duty.  I do not propose to issue any general instructions on the point, as local authorities are aware that the extra cost will fall on local funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that the Donegal <Col N="2294" /> County Board of Health recently accepted the tender of a contractor resident in Northern Ireland for the construction of a water supply at Carrigart; and, if so, whether it is his intention to sanction the placing of this contract with a firm domiciled outside the jurisdiction of Saorstát Eireann, or in the alternative, whether, having regard to the fact that the Minister for Agriculture in Northern Ireland made it a condition of granting a licence to the Cork and Kerry creameries, that they would not introduce Saorstát workers into Northern Ireland, he will insist on the insertion in the contract of a provision that only nationals of the Saorstát will be employed in the execution of this work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first part of the question is in the affirmative. The acceptance of the tender is a matter for the board of health.  It is the practice to give a reasonable preference to Saorstát contractors for such works, but I understand that the tender accepted was much lower than the tenders submitted by Saorstát contractors.  As regards employment of men on the work, preference must be given to local men in receipt of unemployment assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tadhg O Murchadha</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he can state for each of the years 1929 to 1934, inclusive, the number of deaths in each registration area attributable to pregnancy and chidbirth; further, whether he is in a position to indicate if any special measures are in contemplation to lessen the mortality under this heading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The work of tabulating the deaths attributable to pregnancy and childbirth in each of the 640 registration areas for each of the six years 1924-1934, inclusive, would absorb the services of the staff for a considerable period and would be entirely incommensurate with any use which could be made of the figures.  Particulars of the numbers of deaths from <Col N="2295" /> puerperal sepsis and other puerperal conditions which comprise the deaths attributable to pregnancy and childbirth are published in the Annual Reports of the Registrar-General in respect of each county, urban and rural district and this information would probably be sufficient to meet the object aimed at by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>As regards the measures taken or contemplated for lessening mortality due to pregnancy or childbirth, the following action has been taken or is in contemplation: (1) The provision of improved institutional accommodation for confinement and gynæcological cases; (2) the appointment of county medical officers of health who act as supervising officers over the midwifery system; (3) the extension of maternity and child welfare schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state the authority under which the Unified Society limited to four weeks the period for which they would pay for the maintenance, in Drogheda Cottage Hospital, of Robert Nugent, 84 Dalymount Cottages, Drogheda; whether it is a fact that Mr. Nugent entered hospital with the knowledge and consent of the Society's local agent on January 13th and remained a patient until February 23rd; and whether he is aware that under the scheme of additional benefits sanctioned in respect of Mr. Nugent's former society there was no provision limiting the period for which maintenance was payable to four weeks: and, if so, whether he will state the circumstances in which this limitation is now imposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the scheme for granting hospital benefit as an additional benefit the period during which payment may be made is within the discretion of the Committee of the Society.  The local agent has no powers in the matter.  In the case of Mr. Nugent benefit was allowed for a period of four weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2296" /> The amount available for hospital benefit is limited to a fixed annual sum depending on the amount of the surplus disclosed on the last valuation of the society to which the member belonged.</P>
    <P>It became necessary for the Department in May, 1934, to draw the attention of the society to which Mr. Nugent belonged to the fact that they were overspending the amount available for hospital benefit and that they must keep within the limits of that amount.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that recipients of unemployment assistance in Waterford were recently notified that the amount of their unemployment assistance will be reduced by 2/- per week in all cases where the recipient has the use of an allotment granted by the local authority; whether <Col N="2299" /> this deduction is made irrespective of the productivity of the allotment; and if he is aware that in certain cases the total produce of the allotment would not realise 2/- per week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a different question.  A person holding an allotment would have a calculation made as to the value of the income derived from it, and that would be taken into account.  There was no such notification as is indicated by Deputy Corish. In any case, I should imagine that where an allotment was the only property possessed by an applicant, the income derived from it would be insufficient to make any difference in the amount of assistance given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware.  The position is that most of the officers in the Department of Industry and Commerce dealing with the administration of the Unemployment Assistance Act are fully occupied in the various duties arising under the Act.  In fact, considerable overtime is being worked, and if there were numbers of questions relating to individual cases of this kind it would have a very disorganising effect on the Department.  That situation will be eased off in time, when I would have no objection to dealing <Col N="2301" /> with individual cases in the ordinary way.  For the present I ask Deputies not to put down cases of this kind, because the time and trouble involved in getting information are very considerable and mean a delay in dealing with applications that are pending.</P>

      <P>An application for a qualification certificate was received from Mr. Daniel Gallagher at the Dungloe Branch Employment Office on the 5th April, 1934.  At the time of its receipt the Unemployment Assistance Act had just been launched and consequently there was a very large number of applications to be dealt with.

      <P>The duty on coal imported from Great Britain continues to be levied with the objects of securing a revenue for the Exchequer and of affording a limited protection to native fuels.

Accordingly, I am not prepared to accept Clydesdale sires for registration under the Department's Horse Breeding Scheme, 1935, for any area of County Cork save that included within a ten-mile radius of Cork City. Importers of pure-bred Clydesdale stallions in County Cork must submit such for inspection for licence purposes under the Horse Breeding Act, 1934. Any such stallions, passed sound and suitable, are entitled to be licensed.</P>

I am informed that fish landed direct come under the latter heading, but if the same fish were landed at a British port and subsequently imported the import would appear under the heading &ldquo;Great Britain.&rdquo;  It would appear that the circumstances of the landing of the fish determine whether the imports happen to be classified under one heading rather than another.</P>

      <P>Speaking on this Estimate last night I referred to the fact that Deputy Mulcahy had put before the House lengthy statistics designed to show that the cost of erecting 16,000 houses under the Housing Act, 1932, had been £2,216,000, as compared, he said, with an expenditure of £1,609,000 in the erection of 24,000 houses under his administration.  In reply to a question by me during the course of his speech Deputy Mulcahy stated that portion of the £2,216,000 was spent in allocating substantial subventions towards interest charges in the matter of slum clearance schemes, those schemes alone costing, as a capital estimate, £1,220,000.  He indicated that £54,000 had been spent in subventions <Col N="2339" /> towards interest charges in respect of houses erected under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, and that £541,000 was the estimated capital cost of the subventions towards interest charges in respect of the erection of labourers' cottages.  In all, he admitted that £1,816,000 had been spent by way of subventions towards the erection of houses under those three categories.</P>
      <P>As I said last night, the whole philosophy of Deputy Mulcahy's speech last night was that house building was costing too much.  I think he will hardly object to my interpreting his speech as an indication that so far as he was concerned he doubted very much whether we could afford to spend that sum of money on houses.  I think his whole point of view was that we ought to stop and take stock to see whether we could continue to spend such sums of money on house building. There may, perhaps, be good reasons from the Deputy's point of view why there should be that stocktaking.  My curiosity in the matter is sharpened by the speech made by Deputy Minch, who came into the House last night and threw Deputy Mulcahy's cautious policy to the winds, advocating the mobilisation of every conceivable kind of publicity, including the films, to push forward a mass scheme for house building.  Apparently Deputy Minch was not much impressed by Deputy Mulcahy's point of view that we could not afford to spend so much money on houses.  Deputy Minch wanted to have a whole-hog house-building policy. Here I am tempted to ask whether Deputy Minch's policy or Deputy Mulcahy's policy really represents the official policy of the United Ireland Party&mdash;whether their policy is that adumbrated by Deputy Mulcahy, who casts doubts on our capacity to continue spending money on house building, or whether their policy is the policy indicated by Deputy Minch, who wants mass scale schemes of house building, and the utilisation of the films in order to ensure that there would be sufficient publicity for schemes of that kind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that question, I should <Col N="2340" /> like to ascertain from Deputy Mulcahy what precise aspect of this expenditure it is that he objects to.  It is perfectly true, of course, that we can save money on house building if we do not give such substantial subventions towards slum clearances, but does Deputy Mulcahy want slum clearance schemes impeded?  Does he want the slum clearance problem to continue?  Does he want to slow up the housing progress which is being made by stopping the present substantial subventions in respect of slum clearance schemes? Does he want the rent of houses erected as part of the slum clearance schemes to be increased by 100 per cent., because, as the Deputy knows, the fact of withdrawing the subventions will not only impede the slum clearance schemes but will have the effect of purely economic rents being charged for such houses.  If Deputy Mulcahy wants to be economical in respect of expenditure on house building he can, of course, advocate the abolition of subventions in respect of slum clearance schemes. If that is done, of course, we know that the slum clearance problem will get back to the same position in which it was under the Deputy's administration. We know also that economic rents will be charged for such houses, and that the tenants of such houses will be required to pay rents 100 per cent. greater than are charged to-day.  If there is more money being spent on houses to-day than there was during the Deputy's administration it is due to the fact that the State is now treating slum clearance as a problem of urgency, and is doing more to-day to rid the country of those dens of disease than was ever done during the Deputy's administration.  We could, of course, save money on house building if we were prepared to say &ldquo;The slums must remain with us.&rdquo;  We could, of course, save money on slum clearance schemes if we were prepared to say that rents twice the existing rents must be charged, but is Deputy Mulcahy prepared to advocate that policy?  It seems to me that the Deputy must realise on reconsideration that unless we are prepared to continue the policy of substantial subventions in regard to <Col N="2341" /> slum clearance schemes there is no possibility of our being able to rid the nation of those dens of pestilence, and no possibility of our being able to house people at rents bearing some proportion to their capacity to pay.</P>
    <P>The Deputy, of course, made a point of the fact that £541,000 was spent in subventions towards interest charges in respect of the erection of labourers' cottages.  The Deputy might have said that during the period of his administration they did not spend £541,000 in the erection of labourers' cottages, though perhaps it would be quite unnecessary to point that out, because the plain fact of the matter is that not a single labourer's cottage was erected during the 10 years from 1922 to 1932. If £541,000 is spent to-day in the provision of labourers' cottages it is because of the fact that the State to-day is providing for the erection of labourers' cottages, though during the Deputy's administration apparently no consideration was given to the question. I think the expenditure of every halfpenny spent in the erection of labourers cottages is fully justified.  If the Deputy had been able to say in his speech last night that his administration spent £1,541,000 in subventions towards interest charges for the erection of labourers' cottages I think he would have been able to show that his Party, whilst in office, had been able to make a substantial contribution to the provision of labourers' cottages throughout the country.  I do not think that Deputy Mulcahy will object to my interpreting his speech as being calculated to throw doubts on the capacity of the nation to continue to finance house building to the present extent.  I think the nation's health position and its housing condition are such as to make it absolutely imperative for the State to continue spending large sums of money on house building activities. There is no greater form of waste and no greater form of extravagance in health than to allow the slums to continue, and to allow our people to go on residing in rain-soaked mud cabins throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I would advise the Minister not to <Col N="2342" /> take any notice of the excessive caution advocated by Deputy Mulcahy last night, but to continue the comprehensive house building policy which is a feature of the work of his Department. Right throughout the country there is considerable admiration for the house-building activities which have been inaugurated.  If there is any feeling in respect of house building it is a demand for more and still more houses to be erected, and that house-building should be carried through much more speedily than is the position to-day.  While on the speeding up of house-building, I would invite the Minister's attention to the reply given in this House recently showing the number of labourers cottages erected in the various counties. On examination of that return the Minister will notice that a number of boards of health have not taken advantage of the Housing Acts in the manner one would expect from them. Many of the boards of health have adopted the go-slow policy in respect of house building and, in particular, in respect of the building of labourers' cottages.  Fifty-nine cottages have been erected by the Carlow Board of Health. That figure compares very unfavourably with other counties throughout the country.  If Deputy Minch were here I would advise him to ask the majority party in the Carlow Board of Health, who are of the same political complexion as himself, to put into operation some of the advice he gave last night.</P>

At the same time I invite Deputy Minch to ask the majority members of the Carlow Board of Health who are of the same political complexion as he is to put into operation the policy advocated last night here by the Deputy.  The Deputy is an advocate of a whole-hog housing policy, but his political friends decline to put into operation the housing policy which he is advocating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister's Department is to be congratulated on its house-building activity.  It is an enormous improvement on anything we had known before, and a substantial improvement on the housing policy of the previous Administration.  If we continue house-building at the present rate the number of houses erected will show an enormous increase on the small <Col N="2345" /> number erected in the years 1922 to 1932.  In any case, the period from 1932 onwards will be marked in the house-building records in this country as a period when the erection of labourers' cottages was recommenced. The previous Administration had declined to build any labourers' cottages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>While on the question of housing, I want to refer to the charge made by Deputy Minch against me last night&mdash;that I advocated recently in Athy a no-rent policy.  I did not advocate a no-rent policy in respect of people who could pay rent.  What I advocated was that the local authorities should be asked to try and devise a rent policy which would enable people who are unable to pay high rents to be put into houses at specially low rents.  At the present moment unemployed people are anxious to secure houses.  Houses are let at certain rents.  The existing housing conditions are such as to make it imperative from a Christian, social and health point of view that the people should be accommodated with decent houses.  When offered these houses the people are willing to take them because of the very wretched conditions in which they are housed.  When they get into the houses they find it very difficult to pay their rents.  What I advocated was that the local authorities should try to provide houses to be let to such people at specially low rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, that people should be asked to pay rents according to their capacity.  They should not be asked to pay rents which are outside their capacity to pay.  That is the policy that has been adopted in other countries, and there is no reason why it should <Col N="2346" /> not be adopted here.  In the course of a Supplementary Estimate dealing with the Department of Local Government and Public Health I asked the Minister to use all his influence to try and induce as many local authorities as possible to adopt the principle of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act.  These authorities can now borrow money and finance the Act out of the funds so borrowed.  If they do that there is no burden on the rates and there is adequate security for the money advanced. There are many local authorities which have not adopted the provisions of that Act.  Other authorities who have adopted it have fixed a low maximum for the sums to be advanced.  In the case of one local authority the maximum sum that will be advanced is £50, and in order to secure that the borrower must incur legal expenses to the extent of £7.  I would like if the Minister would cause his Department to examine the administration of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act with a view to impressing upon the local authorities the desirability of adopting this Act as part of the house-building campaign.  The advantages to be derived from adopting its provisions and making advances available are of very considerable benefit to large numbers of the people.</P>
    <P>There is no loss to the rates.  There is no question of their borrowing powers being seriously interfered with, and I feel that the adoption of that Act and the generous administration of the Act would bring into the solution of the house-building problem a new current of activity which would help to erect houses, and every new house erected, no matter what its dimensions may be, helps, to some extent, to alleviate the house-building problem.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that the members of the Housing Board might be utilised to interview local authorities and to explain to them the provisions of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act; to explain to them the manner in which the Act is financed, and to show local authorities, who only imperfectly understand the Act and many of whom have no notion as to <Col N="2347" /> the manner in which it is financed, that it can be adopted and administered in such a way as not only to assist in house-building, but at the same time to increase the rating valuation of the areas of jurisdiction of the local authorities, and to help to provide decent houses for the people.  On that aspect of the activities of the Housing Board, I observe from the Estimate that provision is made for the payment of salaries to members of the board in this year's Estimates.  I understand that a member has vacated office, and I should like to know from the Minister whether it is proposed to fill the vacancy on the Housing Board during the coming year.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech yesterday, Deputy Mulcahy referred to the general rating position throughout the country, and Deputy McGovern made reference last night to the fact that the farmers were finding it difficult to pay rates and that the difficulty was being accentuated by the fact that large slices of the Agricultural Grant were being withheld consequent upon the default in the payment of the annuities. He went on to say that as a result of their withholding it was necessary to strike a rate to realise the sum which had been withheld from the Agricultural Grant.  Is it any wonder that farmers&mdash;thrifty farmers&mdash;should be finding it difficult to pay rates in view of the curious kind of advice they are getting these days?  At a recent meeting of the Kildare County Council reference was made to the fact that £35,000 of the £45,000 which was due under the Agricultural Grant had been withheld.  One of the members of the Party opposite deplored the fact that this meant putting on the thrifty farmer, who is able to pay his annuities, a new burden in respect of the people who had not paid their land annuities.  That point of view seems incontestable.  But surely the Party opposite, or some members of the Party opposite, have some responsibility for putting on the farmer who has paid his rates and annuities the responsibility for paying for the defaulting farmer, because the Party <Col N="2348" /> opposite, or members of the Party opposite, have engaged in a campaign of advising all and sundry not to pay their annuities.</P>

      <P>Do I take it, Sir, that it is not possible for me, on this Estimate, to deal with the general rating position throughout the country consequent upon the fact that it is difficult to collect rates due to a certain policy being advocated, and to answer the charge of irresponsibility?</P>

      <P>I accept your ruling, Sir.  In any case, I may have another opportunity of convincing Deputy MacDermot, quite apart from the fact that some of his own supporters are in jail every day for advocating a policy which is causing a serious problem in the general rating position of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, Sir, I want to say that I think the Minister can feel satisfied that his Department have put on foot a house-building campaign such as this country has never previously known. I think that his Department deserve every congratulation in that respect. The house-building programme to-day is incomparably better than anything this country has previously known and bids fair to supply the housing wants of our people in measurable time, whereas the policy of the previous Administration was such that we were not even building houses to replace the houses which had gone into disrepair and into disuse.  My advice to the Minister would be to continue pressing on house-building activity and to speed up the building of houses in every possible way, because there is no greater form of social waste than to allow people to continue to reside in slums and in rain-soaked cabins when we have in this country, not merely the skilled labour necessary for the building of houses, but the material for the building of houses, and a financial <Col N="2351" /> credit which is amongst the highest in Europe.  It would be nothing short of criminal waste, merely an attempt to repeat the futility of the previous Administration, if the Minister did not continue to avail of these factors and to harness them into a single whole in providing for the wants of our people in respect of housing.  I think the Minister himself is personally favourable to a radical house-building policy, a policy which would rid us of slums and mud cabins.  Although the Minister may be confronted with defeatist speeches by people who are more concerned with proving his policy ineffective than they are with housing the people, I advise him to take no notice of dismal Jimmies of that kind, but to continue with a vigorous housing policy, because every person with any Christian feeling thoroughly endorses the present housing policy of the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinMNally" hpid="Mr. Nally Mr. Nally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nally</NameTxt>
      <P>The first matter that I have to refer to is the question of housing.  There are a considerable number of complaints about the payment of the grants in respect of housing. I have received several complaints from people in Mayo that they have been trying to get the first instalment of these grants for the past 12 months but they have not yet succeeded in getting them.  The next matter I want to call attention to is the allocation of road grants.  I think that maritime counties, such as Mayo, Galway and others on the coast, should get a larger proportion of the road grants than is given to inland counties, as, of course, it is the seaboard that attracts most of the tourists.  The population is very sparse in these districts and I think the Minister should look into this matter and see that a larger proportion of the road grants is given to the maritime counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to labourers' cottages, I wish to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that no cottages whatever have been built in the Claremorris and Ballinrobe rural districts.  For the last three years inspectors have been going around there and they are supposed to be building 100 or 150 cottages, but not <Col N="2352" /> one has been started yet.  I might mention that the Ballinrobe and Claremorris rural districts pay about two-thirds of the entire rates in County Mayo.  Deputy Norton told us that the legal costs in connection with loans for houses were about £7.  In County Mayo the costs have not been more than £3 in respect of loans of £50 or £60 to help people to build houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MartinMNally" hpid="Mr. Nally Mr. Nally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nally</NameTxt>
      <P>About three years ago we were given to understand that they were going to build a hospital in Claremorris. I might mention that Claremorris did not enter voluntarily into any hospital amalgamation scheme. The reason that the former hospital in Claremorris was discontinued was that the British military went in there and cleared out all the patients and sent them to Castlebar and Castlerea.  As I say, we were promised three years ago that a new hospital would be built in Claremorris and £9,000 was allocated for that work.  The hospital, however, has not been gone on with.  The local authority purchased the site for the hospital and paid the money for that site.  Having gone that distance, they got a notification from the Local Government Department that the hospital was not going to be built, so that the work was never started.  I should like to know who is behind that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister knows Claremorris very well as he has been down there on several occasions.  He knows that Claremorris is one of the largest junctions in the West.  I think it is most unfair not to proceed with the building of the hospital there.  I hope that the Minister in the very near future will look into the matters to which I have called attention.  A former Deputy&mdash;Mr. O'Hara&mdash;once said that the Minister for Local Government was the only decent Minister on the Fianna Fáil Benches.  I hope, <Col N="2353" /> therefore, that the Minister will do his duty, and that Mr. O'Hara's statement will be justified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite realise the great work that the Minister for Local Government has done and will do in the future in regard to housing.  It is a pity that the leader of the Labour Party should take advantage of this debate to indulge in a piece of cheap banter and not face up to the difficulties and realities of the situation. The leader of the Labour Party has spoken about housing and about rents. As one who has a little knowledge of house-building, and who is just as anxious as Deputy Norton is for the welfare of the working classes, I should like to remind him that many speeches delivered by Labour leaders all over the country have done much to make it difficult for the Minister for Local Government to meet the needs of the people by way of the provision of good houses.  We have heard Deputy Norton to-day speak about low rents. It is about time that there was a little honest speaking on this, and that Deputy Norton and the other members of the Labour Party would speak honestly and straightforwardly when discussing the question of rents.  The Labour Party want high wages and at the same time low rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be growing up in this country a feeling that rents should not be paid at all.  We have the peculiar position that, while high prices are paid for everything else, no increase of rent is supposed to be paid.  I am not an advocate of high rents and never was.  I have devoted many years of my life to the advocacy of good housing and low rents, but I am not an advocate of the dishonest policy of asking people who, perhaps, are in a worse position than the people who have to pay additional rents to pay additional rates.  That is an aspect of the situation that the Labour Party have not recognised, or do not seem to recognise in connection with the provision of cheap housing accommodation for the people.  Deputy Norton and members of the Labour Party can placard these words all over the country. <Col N="2354" /> As far as I am concerned, I am willing to debate the question of housing and rents with Deputy Norton or any member of the Labour Party, not only in the Dáil but on any public platform.  I recognise the fact that this country is not a vast empire, that it does not contain millionaires, and that, for that reason, everyone must be prepared to make sacrifices and to do what they possibly can to help the Minister to overcome the stupendous work&mdash;and it is stupendous work&mdash;of providing decent housing accommodation at economic rents.  The Labour Party must do its share as well as everyone else.</P>
    <P>As the representative of a county in which there is 100 per cent. majority against the present Government, I am glad to say that in no other county has there been such co-operation between the Department and local bodies.  The public bodies there have been ready and willing to co-operate with the present Minister as long as they are convinced that the work he is doing is for the public good.  In support of that claim the Minister pointed out in his opening address that Louth was one of the counties that had carried out large housing schemes, in addition to sewerage and water schemes, in order to improve the health of the people.</P>
    <P>In dealing with this Estimate there are a few points I should like to place before the Minister.  The sites question is at present causing a little difficulty in Dundalk.  In carrying out the programme in regard to slum clearance areas it has occurred to many members of Dundalk Urban Council that the Government might forego many of the conditions, in so far as they affect the outline of house building.  I refer to areas in the heart of the town in which, if we were to comply with the conditions governing house building generally, it would be impossible to build any houses.  As the Minister knows, one of the things incidental to house building is the necessity of providing forecourts.  There are many areas in Dundalk in which houses have been condemned, but the depth of existing houses is such that it would not <Col N="2355" /> allow forecourts to be built to add to the amenities of house-building schemes.  There would not be sufficient depth to provide forecourts, yards and little gardens.  While I appreciate the desire of the Department and its officials to make the houses as attractive as possible yet, in cases such as I allude to, they might forego some of the conditions and thus save a great deal of the delay that occurs in the carrying out of schemes by urban councils.  I will give an example of one particular scheme in order to bring home to the Minister the difficulties under which local bodies suffer.  In the North Main Street there is an existing row of houses along the footpath.  These houses were provided by private enterprise. At the end of a certain number of houses is a piece of ground on which we are building eight houses.  The Minister will understand that if forecourts were put to the houses they would destroy the symmetrical appearance of the whole street.  There was no necessity to provide them in such a case; yet there was a delay of almost two months before sanction was received to proceed with the scheme.  In the same place there are slum areas.  If the council was compelled to procure sites on virgin soil, in the course of a few years there would be large areas in the centre of the town derelict.  That is a thing to be guarded against, and I impress upon the Minister and upon the officials the desirability of viewing the sites when, I am sure, they will agree that in many cases it would be better to allow councils to proceed in their own way.</P>
    <P>As regards house-building in general, I think I am safe in saying that, as far as County Louth is concerned, the way the work has been done compares very favourably with houses constructed in any other county. I was rather perturbed recently to read in the newspapers that in a certain county the defects in houses that had been built were so numerous and were of so grave a character that they were almost beyond being made perfect.  As one who <Col N="2356" /> knows a little about house-building, I think that these defects must have been very great or such a report would not have appeared in the newspapers. The most significant part about it was that it happened in a county which has a very large majority of Fianna Fáil supporters.  It goes to prove that, after all, they are not the great moralists that they pretend to be, if reports are true in regard to the construction of certain building schemes in that county.  I should like the Minister to take serious notice of that, and for this reason, that it is hardly fair to honest builders who put in an economic tender and are prepared to carry out the work in accordance with the plans and specifications submitted by the engineers, as the case may be, to the boards of health, county councils or urban councils.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of labourers' cottages, of course, Deputy Norton again referred to the fact that none were built by the former Government. In answer to Deputy Norton, I say that some members of the Labour Party at that particular period were engaged in a campaign of telling the labourers down the country not to pay their rents I would also remind members of the Labour Party that, at that particular time, in justice to the past Administration, money was not as cheap as it is to-day and the costs of building were much higher than they are to-day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the question of labourers' cottages, there, again, the Government has done much, backed up by the co-operation of all right-minded people in the country. I appreciate the work done and I congratulate the Minister upon it. There is one suggestion I should like to make to the Minister in connection with labourers' cottages.  Around the suburbs of large towns, such as Dundalk, there are numbers of workers whose places of abode are in the rural parts, but who work in the town.  They are in the unenviable position that when they go to the board of health for a new house or cottage, they are told that they do not come within the definition of agricultural labourer, as determined by the Labourers Acts 1881 to 1919. On the other hand, if they go to the urban council, they are told that they cannot get a house in the urban area because they are living in the rural area.  What I would suggest to the <Col N="2358" /> Minister is that if it were possible to extend those Acts in some way as to make that class of applicant eligible for a cottage, it would do much to relieve congestion, so far as housing accommodation is concerned, in the rural parts of Louth and especially around Dundalk.  There are large numbers of labourers, good, honest types of workers, who are prepared to pay an economic rent for houses, if they were built, but, unfortunately, the board of health has not the power to build houses for these people.  I should like the Minister to examine the situation and, by legislation or by some other means, enable the board of health to build cottages for that class of people.  The people I refer to are those who work in the Great Northern Railway Works in Dundalk, the majority of whom live in rural parts around the town.</P>
      <P>Again, there is the question of carrying out the provisions of the Vaccination Acts.  I was rather amused at Deputy O'Dowd stating, in the course of his remarks in regard to housing, that since most of the public bodies have Fianna Fáil majorities, a good deal would be done in the way of house building.  His subsequent statement in regard to the carrying out of the vaccination laws was that they were almost a dead letter and I wonder how he reconciles that statement with his previous statement.  It is the duty of public bodies at present to put these laws into effect and if, as Deputy O'Dowd suggests, there is a majority of Fianna Fáil supporters on the public bodies, it is surely their duty to put the law as it stands into effect in regard to the Vaccination Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should be glad if the Minister could see his way to do something in connection with by-roads throughout the country.  Many labourers' cottages have been built along these roads and, owing to the peculiarities of the law, these roads cannot be maintained at present by the county councils.  I think the Minister might give a little attention to that matter and see if something could be done whereby these roads would be put into a proper <Col N="2359" /> state of repair and thus enable the people using them, people who pay rates, to have at least a dry foot when going to and from their houses.  That is all I have to say in connection with this Estimate except to mention that so far as I know, the Minister can rest assured that he will have the co-operation and support of the public bodies in County Louth in his work in respect of housing, sewerage schemes, waterworks schemes and any other scheme that makes for the comfort and good health of the people of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. T.J. Murphy Mr. T.J. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that all of us who have listened to the speech of the Deputy who has just sat down are entitled to some sympathy.  It is a speech on practically the same lines as the Deputy has delivered each year on this Estimate since I came into this House.  The only difference is that on this occasion the speech reveals a more complete ignorance of all the Acts with which local government is concerned and is considerably more reckless in the statements the Deputy has made in his wanderings, and I use the word advisedly, in search of some information regarding local government generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statement that members of the Labour Party are advocating high wages and low rents is, of course, a repetition of the statement which Deputy Coburn considers it his duty to make on any occasion on which he has an opportunity of speaking in this House.  The position of the Labour Party in that matter is quite clear. Our view always has been that rents, generally, are too high, considering the standard of wages payable, and our claim always has been that rents generally should bear some relation to the general standard of wages in the country.  I ask Deputy Coburn whether he contends that that is an unreasonable claim?  If he does contend that is an unreasonable claim, what view has he on this whole question?  Generalities of the kind we have heard and tirades of the kind that are an annual feature of his <Col N="2360" /> contributions in this House are becoming tiresome.  They are wearying and the champion of facing up to realities, as Deputy Coburn has long ago constituted himself, is becoming very tiresome.  The hackneyed platitudes he strings out here, and asks us to believe are a serious contribution to local government, would be a joke in any other Assembly than this Assembly which tolerates, for reasons it is hard to understand, this annual infliction by Deputy Coburn on it.  The Labour Party, I say again, have never advocated non-payment of rents.  That is a distinction which can be claimed by another Party and we leave them the honour of their advocacy of non-payment. We have no desire to enter into that domain.</P>
    <P>In this House, last night, Deputy Dillon made a minor complaint of delay by the Local Government Department in dealing with correspondence. As a member of the Labour Party, I would like to say that that complaint is not mine and I am very glad to be able to say that my own relations, and I think the relations of every member of this Party and of members of the House generally, with the Department of Local Government, have been very happy.  We have found plenty of consideration in every branch of the Local Government Department which we have approached for help or information and I may say that I do feel that entirely the most pleasant portion of my own work as a member of the House over a number of years, has been in the course of my relations with the Local Government Department. I think it is right that that should be said and I say it in the desire to be fair rather than to pay fulsome tributes to the Department's officials.</P>
    <P>Might I ask the Minister for Local Government to consider the whole question of the county homes all over the country?  I am quite sure that I know the Minister's viewpoint in regard to what ought to be the standard of the county homes, but I wonder if the Minister knows how unpleasant the whole position regarding county homes is becoming in certain <Col N="2361" /> parts of the country.  The buildings are cheerless in the extreme.  A great many of them are altogether unsuited to housing large numbers of people and the position is that at present one could hardly imagine surroundings more dismal or more entirely abandoned in some cases, than the surroundings of a great many of the county homes.  Would the Minister consider the possibility of putting into effect some, at least, of the recommendations of the Poor Law Commission which have not been given effect?  Apart altogether from the fact that the buildings referred to are unsuited to the present needs and that they are altogether overcrowded, they contain so many different classes of people that some attempt ought to be made to put them into places more suitable for them. The able-bodied person who is destitute, the unmarried mother, the harmless imbecile, little children whose parents have died and the children of unmarried mothers are all herded together in the county homes at present without any real attempt to examine the special problems that practically all the classes referred to represent.  I hope the Minister will at least, endeavour, so far as he possibly can and I think it is unnecessary to press him very much on this matter because I feel his sympathies are altogether in favour of the development I referred to, to extend the policy of boarding-out poor people in the county homes or encouraging the boards of health to board them out with certain religious orders that have undertaken that work.  We have a special problem in West Cork at present where our county home is altogether overcrowded.  We did make a genuine attempt to provide an alternative but, unfortunately, we have not been successful up to the present, and I do hope that we may rely on the Minister's co-operation towards doing something definite for West Cork in that direction in a comparatively short time.  What is true of West Cork is, I am sure, true also of a number of other places in the country.</P>
    <P>I should like to direct the Minister's attention to a few other matters which <Col N="2362" /> arise on this Vote.  I noticed a newspaper report of a recent meeting of the County Waterford Board of Assistance where the Commissioner for County Waterford moved a reduction of £5,000 in the Estimate for home assistance on the ground that it was necessary to make provision in respect of unpaid annuities.  I suggest that the Minister ought to take steps to see that that position does not arise again and that he ought to ask the Department responsible for the collection of annuities to proceed with that work and to make sure that the burden is not put on the backs of the unfortunate people who have to depend on home assistance for an existence.  I think it would be a calamity if that state of affairs continues, and I think it was very unfortunate that the direct representative of the Ministry in County Waterford should identify himself with a policy of that kind and go further still and say that he was not able to give a guarantee that it would not be necessary to reduce home assistance allowances during the coming 12 months.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of housing loans, I agree that a difficult position has arisen in a number of counties.  We have, in County Cork, been unable so far to issue housing loans to the numerous people who have been buoyed up with the hope that loans would ultimately be made available in addition to the Supplementary Grants given for the erection of houses.  We have been unable to proceed with that work because of the heavy costs likely to be involved. Legal opinion has fortified us in believing that heavy costs would be involved in the absence of amending legislation.  I do not know if this is a practical solution or not, but I suggest that if possible we ought to revert to the position we were in some years ago where, as a result of a certain section in a Housing Act we were able to give loans independently of the Small Dwellings Act.  I think we would have no difficulty in raising money for that purpose.  We were able in the past to raise loans on a simple deed involving no more expense than a 2/6 stamp.  I put it to the <Col N="2363" /> Minister that he might enquire into the possibility of some simple amendment of the Housing Act that would permit us to revert to that comparatively happy position I referred to.</P>
    <P>I want to express the hope that the Minister has not definitely made up his mind that local government needs to be reformed in the way that a great many would-be reformers in this country would suggest.  There are a certain number of people in this country who believe that in local government, at least, super-men are necessary and that super-men exist. I do not believe there are any super-men in this country or in any other country, and I do not believe that they can be found or are necessary for the purpose of maintaining local government. During recent years, the cry that resulted in the appointment of super-men in connection with local government arose from a certain quarter.</P>
    <P>Certain advocates of big business and representatives of commerce cried out for the appointment of certain persons to replace local representatives who were alleged to be worthless and in some cases not only inefficient but corrupt.  A rather illuminating sidelight on the capacity of certain big business people to manage business was recently provided in the manner in which the affairs of the Industrial Trust Corporation were conducted.  I would ask the Minister to bear in mind that the call for commissioners in the past emanated from much the same people who have made such a good job of the affairs of the Industrial Trust Corporation.  I would ask him to be very careful before trusting any advice he gets from them in the near future in regard to the manner in which local government should be managed.  I think the Minister will be on very sound ground if he puts his faith in the people, and makes sure that with some minor adjustment here and there the right of the people to manage their own affairs in their own way is maintained.  I suggest that he ought to consider that matter very carefully in view of rumours which are <Col N="2364" /> abroad to the effect that the whole field of local government in this country is being explored at the present time.  I have nothing further to say by way of complaint or criticism.  I have put those points to the Minister for his consideration.  I want to express on my own behalf and on behalf of some of my colleagues, whose views on the matter I know, and who are not here to express them, our pleasure at the results which have been achieved during the year in the matter of housing generally, and our appreciation of the manner in which we have always been treated and in which our representations have been received in the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just one or two questions which I should like to put to the Minister.  I raised yesterday the matter of the delay in the sanction for the Longford county hospital.  I want to assure the Minister that there is a great need for this hospital; that there is a considerable amount of unemployment in the district, and that if he decided upon some course it would assist the people very much&mdash;both the workers and the community living in the county.  It is a well-known fact that for years we have had no suitable hospital accommodation in the county, and that a good deal of suffering is being caused by the delay, through lack of proper equipment and everything else.  I will not labour that point any further, but I should like to ask the Minister to try to speed up the payment of reconstruction grants, in the County Longford in particular.  There are a good many small farmers and labourers who have started reconstruction work on their homes, but there is considerable delay in the inspection prior to and during the work of repairs which they are carrying out.  Those people are poor and find it extremely difficult to complete the work if the payments are not made.  I would ask the Minister to expedite the payments and the inspections as much as possible.  Those were the two points about which I was anxious.  I am not going to delay the debate by discussing the general question of local government.  I might <Col N="2365" /> have said something about Deputy Norton's speech on the question of labourers' cottages, but as he is not here I shall leave it over until some other time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two points on the housing aspect of this Estimate to which I wish to direct the attention of the Minister.  I notice that in his opening statement he expressed the hope that the housing programme which the Government set themselves out to achieve in connection with slum clearance would be completed within the time they had laid down for them selves.  We all hope that his opinion will be justified.  I want to express here on this Estimate a doubt&mdash;or rather a conviction&mdash;that the machinery which is being employed for the purpose through the local authorities will not result in solving the problem of slum clearance within anything like the time in which an optimistic Government hopes to solve it.  I want to speak about one portion of my constituency, Ringsend.  I speak about it feelingly, because of the number of people who call upon me, and are unable to understand that it is no part of my function &mdash;however much I might like to do it&mdash; to get houses for them.  I have to do the best I can for them, but with the machinery available at the moment it is a rather heart-breaking experience for a public representative to have to tell the people who come up with genuine stories of housing conditions, which are appalling to listen to, that he is unable to do anything for them, as it is the officials of the Dublin Corporation whose function it is to find houses for the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid that the programme of the Dublin Corporation in relation to housing and slum clearance, carried out as it has been in a very generous and whole-hearted fashion, will have to be slowed down as a result of the comparative failure of the last loan. What I am anxious to know is whether the Government is completely satisfied with the machinery under which housing is being carried out at the moment through local authorities, and whether a Ministry&mdash;even a Ministry of <Col N="2366" /> Housing&mdash;ought not to be set up to deal with the problem.  There is a very large element of artificiality about the whole thing.  The Department of Finance, and the Government, think they have done a wonderful thing if they succeed in getting a certain portion of the expenditure in connection with, say, housing put upon the rates rather than upon the Central Government. but rates and taxes are, in essence, one and the same thing. They come largely out of the same pocket, and although the local authorities say that the Government have been generous in giving them two-thirds of the grant, and that sort of thing, in reality it is one and the same pocket that pays it.</P>
    <P>Taking the case of the Dublin Corporation, which has done, I suppose, more than any other local authority in the country to grapple with and solve the housing problem in this country, I feel that places like Ringsend and Ballsbridge, which are my own immediate concern, are being neglected, and will be more and more neglected in the future by reason of the necessity to deal perhaps with more urgent areas in the city.  The district of Ringsend, in which I am particularly interested, is a peculiar district.  The people are&mdash;I was going to say provincial&mdash;almost in a town of their own.  They regard their area as a town and do not want to leave that area.  There is a very big problem to be solved there.  The building of houses under schemes such as have been carried out in Crumlin, Kimmage and all that area, does little, if anything, to solve the problem which exists in the Ballsbridge and Ringsend area.  In that area there exists another problem to which I should like to draw the attention of the Minister.  It is a problem which exists not only in that area but in a number of other places where new houses have been erected under schemes of housing carried out by the Dublin Corporation and their predecessors in the last ten or 12 years.  That problem is the inequalities of the rents which are being charged to the tenants.  There is a very large sense of grievance in certain parts of the Ringsend area at the rents which are being charged by the Dublin Corporation <Col N="2367" /> for the houses that have been erected under the various schemes carried out by that body and their predecessors. Whether by reason of the fact that loans had in previous years to be raised at a higher rate of interest than in subsequent years, or whether by reason of the cost of construction having risen or fallen from year to year, the fact is that the rents of houses in various parts of those housing areas show an extraordinary difference in amount.  In fact, on one side of the street a tenant may be charged 15/- a week, and for precisely the same house on the opposite side of the street only 10/- a week may be charged.  I am not taking these figures as actual figures but as illustrations of what has been brought to my own notice in connection with this problem.  It is a problem which must be adequately solved.  I know it is the primary duty of the Dublin Corporation to do it, but it is the firm conviction of the Corporation that they cannot do it so that something must be done if the inequalities in the rents payable are to end.  The areas to which I refer are Cabra, Ringsend, and Fairview.  In these areas the problem exists in an acute form. The only other point to which I wish to draw attention is the question of the allotment of houses.  In the course of the answer which the Minister gave me last year, I gathered that it was the invariable practice of his Department to require the names of the applicants of the houses to be submitted to his Department for approval.  I want to know if that practice is being still carried on, and if persons who are allotted new houses are allotted them strictly in accordance with their necessities, the number in family and the insanitary condition in which they are living, and whether they are allotted in strict compliance with the reports of the medical officers in the various areas.  I know that numerous complaints are being made that people with one or two children are getting houses while persons with seven or eight children and who are badly housed are being passed over.  It is desirable in the interests of all sections of the community <Col N="2368" /> that houses should be allotted in accordance with merit and that in no instance should political considerations, from whatever angle, be allowed to enter into the question of their allotment. I want to know from the Minister if he is taking steps to see that that principle is being strictly adhered to?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NocholasWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two matters on this Estimate to which I would like to refer.  The first is the matter of roadmaking. I find it is the invariable practice to cover with tar the entire surface of the road from fence to fence.  I agree that that makes an ideal road for motoring, but it makes a very dangerous road for horse traffic.  I suggest that the Minister should see that a reasonable margin is left untarred on each side of the road and that that margin should be sufficiently wide to accommodate horse traffic.  I think that by doing that he will not be encroaching unduly on the rights of motorists; and I feel it would have the effect of making the roads comparatively safe for horse traffic. That is a matter that should be considered immediately unless it is intended to put horse traffic off the roads completely.  A number of serious accidents have occurred all over the country by reason of this tarring of the entire surface of the road.  Something should be done to remedy that state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point to which I wish to refer is in connection with the Agricultural Grant.  My references apply altogether to the County Waterford.  I understand that when this grant was first introduced, it was allocated on the basis of the estimate for a particular year.  In the year selected, I understand that the Waterford County Council struck an abnormally low rate&mdash;a rate which was eventually found to be inadequate to meet their liabilities and it had to be exceeded, I believe, by something like £20,000.  The grant was based on the estimate instead of on the expenditure for that particular year.  The result was that a lower grant was made for that particular year and a lower grant has been made for every year since.  If the facts are as I have stated, and I believe they <Col N="2369" /> are, I think it is the duty of the Minister to inquire into the matter and to try to make some effort to restore to the Waterford County Council and to the agricultural ratepayers in Waterford the losses they have sustained since the introduction of the grant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two matters to which I wish to refer. Deputy Nally has already referred to one of them, and that is, the making of special provisions to improve the roads in the tourist counties in the Free State.  The manner in which I feel that that can be done is by a system which, before any money is taken out of the Road Fund Grant, a certain proportion of it should be set aside each year and that that should be allocated in rotation to the tourist counties for the special improvement of their roads, say one or two counties each year.  I am not particular as to which of these counties gets the grant the first year or the second year.  But each county could be done in turn and in that way the tourist roads would be benefited and improved.  I will probably be met with the reply that the eastern counties bear higher taxes than the western counties.  That may be.  But the eastern counties have a lower attraction for tourists and visitors than the western counties.  I think it is but fair that something should be done to help the tourist counties and a special portion of this fund should be set aside and distributed in the manner I have indicated to one or two counties each year; that would improve the roads in these tourist counties.  The second matter to which I want to refer is one which I have already brought before the Minister. I am afraid if you want to get a hearing you have to keep hammering at the Minister.  The matter is not strictly appropriate to this Vote, but in another way it is strictly concerned with it.  It is in connection with house building.  I want the Minister to make representations to the Land Commission to speed up the sub-division of land.  The sub-division department of the Land Commission is a very small thing and always has been.  It has been the traditional policy of the Land <Col N="2370" /> Commission to refuse to sub-divide holdings, that is to say, they refused to sub-divide holdings lest the holdings would become uneconomic.  As a result of that the house building campaign has been held up.  In the main these new houses have been built on new sites.  That involves a sub-division of the land.  It is one of the things which causes me in my constituency a great amount of worry and work.  I know that it is not very much good for me to call into the Land Commission to speed up the sub-division of lands.  I know that I am received in a friendly way and all that.  I have correspondence which deals very extensively with this question.  In the last week I got a letter, in which the average delay in sub-dividing is stated to be 12 months.  I am not prepared to go to that length; I would agree to eight months.  Now I ask the Minister to make representations to the Minister for Lands and to ask that the staff in the sub-division branch should be increased.  I think that staff is inadequate to deal with the demands made on it now.  This would be only for a temporary purpose.  I submit that the Minister should make these representations to the Land Commission to expedite the work in which the Minister for Local Government and Public Health is immediately involved. By doing that he will be doing a useful work.  I know that the solicitors who are dealing with these matters find that their schemes are held up by the delay in the sub-division by the Land Commission.  Their clients are calling on them from day to day in order to expedite the sub-division. They are disappointed and the building of the houses held up.  In many of these cases there is as much as 12 months' delay in getting the land sub-divided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a very extreme case that I saw reported in the papers, where the Urban Council of Athlone got a site on which to build houses.  They were an exception, of course, because they had compulsory powers themselves and could take the land whether it was sub-divided or not.  The sites were acquired, the houses built, and the tenants living in them, while the land <Col N="2371" /> was yet undivided, and the man from whom the land was taken had not received his money as a result of that. That is an extreme case, I admit, and I only quote it in order to emphasise this matter which, I must say, causes me considerable trouble.  I do not mind the trouble myself, but I must say that when one calls day after day and week after week to the Land Commission only to be sent back again and again, it is very irritating and it is a matter that the Minister should attend to.  It is holding up the work in which he is directly involved.  It means that the grant is also held up, and ultimately the people get tired and disgusted and, perhaps, drop the whole thing.  I would again appeal to the Minister to ask the Minister for Lands to speed up this matter and to increase the staff in the sub-division branch.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words in connection with the costs involved in obtaining grants for housing.  I submit that a great deal of the costs could be avoided if legislation could be passed whereby the consent of the applicant were obtained to create a first charge in respect of the loan under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act in priority to any other charge that may be registered against the holding.  There are cases where the costs are as high as £6 or £7 in obtaining a grant of £40.  These costs are made up in this way.  There is one guinea for the certificate in regard to the market value.  There are two guineas for surveyor's costs and £2 10s. 0d. costs of title.  I submit that, if some adjustment of that system were made by way of an amending regulation, a great deal of that cost could be eliminated and that the people concerned would benefit greatly by such adjustment.  I know that the surveyors and the engineers concerned have done everything to meet the wishes of the people in regard to housing and that everything has been done by the Minister and his Department in order to facilitate and speed up the housing scheme, but there are items such as this which require immediate attention and I <Col N="2372" /> merely mentioned them in regard to this Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh) Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a good deal of discussion and comment on this Estimate.  That is quite natural.  The Department of Local Government and Public Health is a big Department with very wide ramifications, and that the members of the Dáil should display a considerable amount of interest in its work, and criticise it here and it is, well shall I say, flattering to the Department to see that so much attention is paid to it and that people have so much to say about it.  Probably, the section of greatest interest, at the moment at any rate, to the House and perhaps to the public in general, is the Housing Section of the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  A good deal of the discussion that has taken place on this Estimate has been devoted to housing in its various aspects.  I am satisfied that the Housing Section has done very creditable work in the last year and that, generally speaking, the local authorities have done their share and, with a few exceptions, have done it creditably and well during the last year.  Some Deputies criticised the Ministry for the slackness of certain local authorities in the building of houses and particularly in the provision of labourers' cottages in some counties.  All I can say is that every encouragement that I, as Minister, and the Department as a whole, through its officials of various kinds&mdash;those employed at headquarters and those whose duty it is to go into the country&mdash;could give has been given to the local authorities. Every encouragement that these officials can give and every help that is in their power to afford to the local authorities and to their officials to push ahead with the provision of such houses as are necessary, and with the speeding up of housing schemes, is given, and given gladly.  Wherever we can encourage them to greater efforts, we are ready to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked as to the activities of the Housing Board.  The Housing Board has not been much in the limelight. Their reports have been to me, as Minister, and I know that the board <Col N="2373" /> has been active in encouraging areas that were slack and local authorities that were not as enthusiastic as they might be.  Members of the board have visited them and encouraged them, provided sites for them, and shown them where they could speed up matters and help themselves.  Not alone to local authorities, but to individuals&mdash;private persons and public utility societies&mdash;the Housing Board and the individual members of it have given every help in encouraging them in the use of Irish manufacture and in encouraging manufacturers to speed up their supplies so that they might be able to meet the demands that have been made upon them.  One of the first things that was tackled by the Housing Board was the deficiency in roofing materials, particularly in regard to slates.  I think we are now in the position that any demands that are made on the owners of slate quarries for the provision of slates can be met and that is a big change. There are several quarries that have been opened as a result of the insistence of the Department of Local Government and Public Health that only Irish manufactured materials for roofing be used.  There are several quarries in different parts of the country&mdash;in Donegal, Cork, Mayo, Wicklow.  Some quarries that were idle for many years have been reopened.  One of them, at any rate&mdash; in Donegal&mdash;is now employing close on 500 men where not a single individual was employed before the 1932 Act came into operation and before the work of the members of the Housing Board started.  The same applies to other supplies.  Roofing materials, in general, including tiles, have been encouraged and are available everywhere now; also iron goods, grates, rainwater downpipes&mdash;every other kind of housing material, so far as it can be made in this country, has been encouraged and the quantities used and the quantities ordered have increased enormously.  Generally speaking, with regard to the contractors all over the country, not alone in Dublin but everywhere, I think I can say now that whatever demands are made on them for building materials, <Col N="2374" /> that can be produced in this country, are being met by the contractors, largely as a result of the quiet, unobtrusive, but nevertheless efficient work of the Department and of the Housing Board in investigating the demands that were likely to be made and the possibilities of having these demands met by the various suppliers of building materials for housing work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister quite satisfied that the demand for slates, whether by public authorities or private builders, can now be fully met without delay?  If that is so, it would be worth while that the public should know it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can assure the Deputy and the House that any demand for slates likely to be made can be met out of the quarries now working.  There was some delay and some difficulty with regard to the very largest size of slates and, undoubtedly, some considerable delay was occasioned to a number of contractors in getting supplies of this particular size of slate, but, so far as my information goes now, all demands for any size of slate can be met from one quarry if not from another inside the Free State area.  The Deputy thought that there could be more men employed in the Killaloe quarry.  That may be so; but the entire output of the Killaloe quarry, I believe, goes outside the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have frequently been asked by individual contractors to interest myself in trying to get suplies from Killaloe, but I have never yet succeeded.  I have always been told that their output has already been contracted for years ahead for export.  There are subsidiary quarries connected with Killaloe.  Some of these have been developed by means of resources partly provided out of Government funds, or authorities associated with the Government, and others I understand are being developed.  It is possible that what Deputy Morrissey says with regard to further development in Killaloe might be arranged for and any request for financial assistance for further <Col N="2375" /> development which those in control of the Killaloe quarries may care to put up will, I am satisfied, get the fullest and most sympathetic hearing.  I think some schemes have already been put up.  I do not know the details of them; but I think a considerable amount of money has been provided for development and exploration work in connection with the quarries in the Killaloe area.</P>
      <P>On the question of housing in general, I repeat I am satisfied that great progress has been made.  I am not, and I do not think anybody is, absolutely satisfied that all that can be done has been done by some local authorities.  As Deputy Norton said to-day, and as some other Deputies stated yesterday, there are some local authorities that might have done more. Some of them have been slow to avail themselves of the immense advantages offered to local authorities by way of grants under the Housing Act, 1932. There are others who have done remarkably well and have built, in urban and rural areas, a very considerable number of houses.  It is certainly gratifying to the Department to hear from all sides of the House, irrespective of Party, so many encomiums offered to the Department because of its housing activities.  I would only say that we are anxious, as I know every Party in the House is anxious, to push forward housing and to do everything possible in the matter.  The House has generously provided money for grants, and will, I am sure, be pleased to see that the grants are taken up and used to the fullest extent for the provision of houses that everybody agrees are most urgently needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there was any doubt expressed as to the advisability of going forward as rapidly as we have been doing, even though it has not reached to my rate of rapidity, it was expressed, I think, by Deputy Mulcahy, if I understood him aright.  He seemed to express doubt as to whether we were wise in going forward at the present rate.  I think whatever doubt was in his mind as to the wisdom of going ahead at this rate arose out of the cost of the present rate of housing to the country.  My attitude <Col N="2376" /> of mind, and I expressed it here when introducing the 1932 Act and when introducing this Estimate, and I have expressed it on several other occasions in this House, is that whatever is necessary in the way of financial provision to abolish the abominable housing conditions that still exist despite our efforts must be provided by this House. From expressions of opinion from all sides of the House, and from what the House has been prepared to do, and has done in the last few years, and what it has given its approval to in connection with the activities under the 1932 Act, I take it that the Dáil, indeed the Oireachtas as a whole, is prepared to meet whatever financial responsibilities are necessary to solve satisfactorily the housing problem as we know it.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy gets the quarterly statistics he asks for. There is no hesitation on my part, or in the Department, to supply the Deputy or anyone else outside with any figures they want, or with statistics of any kind.  So far as the officials of the Department can get them, we hope to supply them.  If there is any discrepancy anywhere I am sure it can be cleared up.  We failed to clear it up as a result of the statement made by <Col N="2378" /> the Deputy yesterday, in which he alleged that there was a discrepancy. The Deputy compared costs.  He gave figures comparing the cost of houses in the ten years' period 1922 to 1932.  I do not think there can be a fair comparison of the cost of housing under the Act of 1932.  Any comparison of the figures would be very unfair to the Deputy, because the Housing Acts were very different and very much heavier grants were given under some of the Acts brought in in the ten years' period 1922-1932.  I do not wish to be unfair, and therefore I think that comparison is not a right or a proper one to make. I asked the Department for figures of grants over these two periods and here are what I got.  The amount expended on State grants and subsidies during the ten years prior to 31st March, 1932, was £2,529,419 for the erection of 25,540 houses.  The amount expended from 1st April, 1932 to 28th February, 1935, was £752,000 for the provision of 21,283 houses.</P>

      <P>The Minister was talking about being unfair to the Deputy.  What I really want is to be fair to the subject of the provision of houses, and the cost that has to be borne by the people of one kind or another.  It is only for the purpose of being fair to the subject that I want to make any comparison between any period.</P>

      <P>When I said unfair to the Deputy I meant unfair to the subject under discussion.  My personality or the Deputy's personality does not matter.  It is the subject we are discussing that matters.  I am satisfied, on the basis that the Deputy gave his comparison yesterday, and on the basis of the present cost of housing, whether the cost to the State, to local authorities or to any individual, that any comparison we make will show very much in favour of house building under the 1932 Housing Act. If anyone wants any statistics setting out the cost of the individual house, or of a house built by a local authority, or the cost of schemes of housing, or the cost directly on the State, I shall be very happy to provide statistics for any period, whether it be quarterly, half-yearly or yearly, either for the calendar year or the financial year. That may be taken as an invitation to Deputies on all sides to ask for such statistics, which we shall be glad to supply at any time later on if a suitable opportunity for debate occurs, or whenever the question may arise.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that there will have to be, and that we will have to face in this House and in the country, a very considerable charge on the National Exchequer for housing purposes, before the housing problem is satisfactorily ended.  I have said that in the House over and over again, and I repeat it.  I am not a bit displeased if Deputy Mulcahy or anybody else calls attention to that fact.  It is a heavy responsibility.  It is going to be a much heavier responsibility and it is no harm to have it brought home, to have the country told, and to let local authorities know the amount of money the National Exchequer will have to provide to clear the slums in town and country, so as to give proper housing accommodation to those who are in abominable houses to-day if we still continue to believe that that is a duty and a responsibility that rests upon the Government of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some people occupying labourers' cottages, and some who occupy other types of dwellings built by local authorities, who do not seem to realise what is being done for them, <Col N="2380" /> and who, arising out of that want of realisation of what is being done by the nation, whether directly by the Government or by local authorities, do not meet their responsibilities. There are some occupants of labourers' cottages able to pay who do not meet their responsibilities, and, as Deputies who are members of boards of health know, there are some areas in which the arrears of rent are certainly unjustifiable. That is undoubtedly true and I think it arises to some extent out of the campaign of the last few years for the provision of legislation for the purchase of labourers' cottages. It is just as well to mention the matter to clear people's minds.  There are people who have been stating that if, and when, this scheme for the purchase of labourers' cottages comes into operation the rents of labourers' cottages will be reduced, some said, by 50 per cent. and others, by 75 per cent. Some occupants of labourers' cottages have gone further and said, &ldquo;If that is going to happen, we might as well stop paying our rents now&rdquo; and they have done so in some cases&mdash;not in a very great number.  There are particular areas, however, where I think that kind of propaganda has gone on&mdash; perhaps entered into by irresponsible people and I am not attacking any Party.  Individuals have been responsible for that kind of propaganda and I should like all concerned to know that whenever the scheme for the purchase of labourers' cottages comes into operation, it will not operate until the arrears of rent in each individual case have been collected.</P>
    <P>There are other cases of occupants, not of labourers' cottages, but of houses built by urban authorities. Every Deputy in the House, I am sure, gets almost as many letters as I do&mdash;perhaps I get more as Minister for Local Government and perhaps I do not&mdash;but anyhow, I am sure we all get letters from people clamouring for the provision of housing accommodation. We sometimes get heart-rending appeals as to the condition of the dwellings of some people in rural areas as well as in towns and cities.  We know that the local authorities are doing a great deal.  We know that in <Col N="2381" /> Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Galway, and Limerick, too, they are doing a great deal, but there are occupants who have had houses provided for them and who have not been long in them until they have started a campaign for large reductions in rent.  That has a very discouraging effect on local authorities. They clamour for houses and they are getting houses to-day from the local authorities at uneconomic rents.  In a great many cases, they are not asked to pay economic rents and in some cases, at any rate, they are not long in the houses until they are organising associations, not for the non-payment of rent, but for the obtaining of large reductions.  That has not a good moral effect on a local authority; it does not encourage them to go ahead and it may have the effect of preventing local authorities from going ahead with housing with the enthusiasm we should all like to see.  It may stop building here and there, but I hope it will not. It may have that effect and, if it does, those who are not provided with the houses we should like to see them getting may put some of the blame on those who act in this irresponsible manner.</P>
    <P>I have shoals of figures here provided for me by the officers of my Department.  I have reams of statistics of all kinds which are interesting, valuable and helpful, but I do not think it would be helpful to the House if I were to read them out.  Deputy Mulcahy, I know, revels in statistics&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I will not, however, follow what I think is a bad example by reading out figures here which tie the Deputy himself into <Col N="2382" /> a black knot and send most of the rest of the members of the House to sleep. If the Deputy or anybody else wants statistics, anything he asks for he will get with pleasure once a quarter or at more frequent intervals if he likes to have them.  If he asks to have them published in the Official Report or in the newspapers, I shall be very happy to do it.  The Department will be proud to do it, because we have plenty of good results to show so far as housing is concerned.</P>

      <P>There were a number of questions on housing raised by different Deputies.  They were not points of such great importance as those which Deputy Mulcahy raised. Deputy Morrissey spoke about the size of doors.  I have no doubt that the doors of some of the labourers' cottages are not as wide as the doors of, shall we say, Leinster House, and you could not very well expect them to be so.  If all the occupants were of the ample proportions of Deputy Morrissey, they would have difficulty sometimes in getting in and out.</P>

      <P>At any rate, I hope that it will be a long time before there will be any difficulty in regard to whatever sized mansion Deputy Morrissey lives in in getting his coffin out of the door or out of the window. There are difficulties associated with the types of houses, the sizes of houses and the disposition of rooms, doors and window, and perhaps there might be improvements in regard to the architecture, but most of these houses to-day are built on some of the plans provided by the Local Government Department and, generally speaking, until Deputy Morrissey raised that point, it had not been brought to my attention.  On the question of the architecture of the houses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I was misunderstood, or perhaps I did not make myself sufficiently clear.  I was not referring exactly to the architecture, <Col N="2383" /> and if I used the word I did not mean it.  I should like the Minister to deal seriously with the matter of the width of the doors.  It is a very important matter and a matter in respect of which a great many complaints have been made to me in relation to labourers' cottages particularly.  The doors in some cases are ridiculously small and it seems to me that the matter of a few inches should not interfere unduly with the building of a house.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Morrissey says it is so, I do not doubt it. There must be cases in which that is so, but I have not come across them and they have not been brought to my notice.  It was never brought to my notice or mentioned to me and it did not strike me in any of the numerous housing schemes I visited.  Perhaps it would be more obvious to the Deputy than to me going in and out of these houses.  However, I will ask the Department to look into it. Deputy Mulcahy expressed doubt as to the provision of houses in areas that were recorded in the last census as being the worst-housed counties in the Free State.  I stated in my opening remarks that in these counties that were, according to the Census, worst housed, considerable progress had been made in, at any rate, a number of them.  I have a long statistical statement on that which I shall be happy to send to the Deputy.  I propose to give one or two examples:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Counties in order of bad housing conditions, according to 1926 census: Mayo, 43 per cent.</P>
      <P>Counties in order of number of houses provided up to 1932: Mayo, 1,622.</P>
      <P>Counties in order of number of houses provided and houses reconstructed under the Housing Act of 1932, up to March 31, 1934: Mayo, 1,957.</P>
      <P>That is just one example of the type of the list, and I will send it to the Deputy, or to any Deputy who cares to have it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2384" /> Deputy Belton raised the question of interference by the Department with the selection of tenants for labourers' cottages by local authorities, and I think some other Deputy spoke also on the matter.  The Department of Local Government does not select tenants for labourers' cottages, but it has the right to supervise, and what we do is, where there are complaints, we ask the local authorities to give us the names and qualifications of those whom they select as tenants for labourers' cottages, and we endeavour to see that the most deserving cases everywhere get first preference, regardless of what colour of shirt the tenant may wear, or whether he wears any shirt at all. We take into consideration the size of the family, the existence of tuberculosis, which is often a serious factor, and the housing conditions of the person whom it is proposed to re-house. These factors are all considered after consultation with the local authority and with the county medical officer of health, where such exists, or with the local medical officer where there is no county medical officer of health, and all of them having been taken into consideration we approve.  Finally, when we are satisfied that the persons best entitled are offered the houses we approve of the lists submitted. Deputy Dillon asked yesterday whether preference is given to married people as against unmarried people in the allotment of these houses.  So far as we have to interfere in supervising these allotments, married people with dependants decidedly get preference over unmarried persons.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan, in his opening remarks criticised what he called the alarming increase in the cost of local government.  I failed to hear him justify that statement, and I failed to see anything in the Estimate as offered that would justify such a description. There is no alarming increase in the cost of local government.  There is a considerable increase in the total of our Estimate, but as I stated in my opening remarks, and as Deputy Brennan himself admitted, it is due to the housing activities of the Department. We have enormously speeded up <Col N="2385" /> housing, and that could not be done without an increase of staff.  We have now, I think, 17 additional temporary inspectors, working on housing alone, inspecting individual houses and housing schemes all over the country. We have additional clerks in the office to deal with the applications, and a few higher executive and other higher officers to supervise that staff.  Outside of that, there is no increase, and I think everybody will agree that with the enormous increase in activity in housing, an increase in supervisory staff, both in the country and at headquarters, is naturally justifiable. Deputy Brennan mentioned the differences in salaries of some inspectors. There is a variety of inspectors in our Department.  There are medical inspectors and engineering and housing inspectors.  Some of them are a long time in the service, like the chief medical inspector and the chief engineering inspector.  Naturally their salaries are higher than those who came in in the last year or two.  Some of the inspectors have responsibilities greater than others.  Therefore, I think it is obvious that there should be some difference shown.  He referred to some inspectors getting £700, £800 or £1,000 per year, and others getting only £300, £400 or £500.  The reason for that, to my mind, ought to be obvious.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan also mentioned the cost of the Combined Purchasing Act. The cost of that is put down and charged to the Department of Local Government in the Estimates but, as Deputy Brennan and every member of a local authority ought to know, the county councils have to pay.  It does not come back to us, but goes into the Exchequer.  Therefore, that cost does not come on our shoulders, although it appears in our Estimate.  We get it back from the local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">

      <P>There is another point upon which Deputy Brennan may not be clear.  He mentioned auditors' salaries in the same connection.  Such salaries are charged in our Estimate, and no recoupment is asked for from local authorities.  He talked about the heavy cost of local administration and said it took £5,000 to administer every county in the Free State.  It does not cost anything like that to run the Department of Local Government as a very considerable amount of the money of the Department is really spent on the local authorities.  Take the audit to which Deputy Brennan and other Deputies referred.  The local authorities would have to get their accounts audited and they would have to be audited by experienced men. That is done by a staff of auditors from the Department of Local Government, and I think everyone will agree, is well done, and local authorities are satisfied, even when discrepancies may be discovered, that the staff of auditors is competent and reliable and will be sure to discover any looseness, not to use a stronger word, that may creep into their administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I think what I said is accurate.  Some of those audits are very intricate and take a long time. The amount charged to the local authorities is nothing in proportion to the amount of work that is done for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey talked about welfare schemes for the blind.  In, I think, the last annual report of the <Col N="2387" /> Local Government Department there were set out model welfare schemes which had been suggested for adoption by the local authorities.  If the Deputy cares to look up that report he will find set out there the type of scheme that we refer to.  Many Deputies mentioned cases of difficulty or complaint of one kind or another that arose in connection with their own constituency. If I were to go into every one of those in replying I would occupy more time than, perhaps, the House would be satisfied to give me.  I have taken a note of any complaint that was mentioned here or any difficulty which has arisen.  I shall have them inquired into and, where necessary, will communicate with the Deputy who raised the point.  Deputy Davis spoke about the Castlebar Hospital.  There is particular difficulty with regard to that hospital, and no part of the responsibility rests on the Department of Local Government.  It is common knowledge&mdash;it appeared in the local Press; I read it in some of the Western papers sent here&mdash;that the building contractor failed to complete the work.  I think he went bankrupt. That is the sole reason for the long delay which has occurred in the completion of the Castlebar Hospital building.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDavis" hpid="Mr. Davis Mr. Davis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davis</NameTxt>
      <P>I tried to find out what was really the cause of the delay, and I confess, without a desire to be unfair to anybody, that there seems to be a lot of obscurity about it.  For the life of me I cannot understand why, because it is a matter that concerns everybody, and I think everybody should be made aware of the real circumstances.  It is a very big contract; I think it is bordering on £100,000.  It has been held up for many months.  If the contractor failed, should there not be some provision in the contract which would enable somebody else&mdash;his sureties for instance&mdash; to carry on the contract at his expense, in order to avoid holding up a public service, because that is what it amounts to.  While that contract is held up a number of cases which would have been treated in the <Col N="2388" /> hospital if it had been completed have had to go to an extern institution at the expense of the ratepaying public.  I should like to have the matter cleared up if at all possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy said is quite right.  There should be some arrangement whereby the sureties or somebody else could carry on. There was such a provision in the contract. There were sureties but the board of health acting under legal advice did not adopt the method of getting the sureties to complete the contract.  The contract was re-advertised after considerable delay.  There was a lot of investigation of the legal aspect of the matter.  They went into the whole question with very great care, because efforts were being made to oblige the board of health to allow the contractor to carry on.  That matter is being gone into for months, and inquiries are being made by the architect&mdash;a very responsible man, and who has had great experience&mdash;and by the board of health, but unfortunately long delay has occurred, with all the disadvantages of which Deputy Davis speaks. I am satisfied from my own knowledge of the whole question that the delay which has occurred was unavoidable owing to the failure of the contractor. There might perhaps have been greater expedition with regard to getting rebuilding started by the sureties, but there were a lot of legal difficulties in the way.  This brings to my mind the wisdom of not tying oneself down to always accept the lowest tender without examination of other aspects of the matter.  It is wise in public contracts to accept the lowest tender where you are satisfied that the person tendering is capable of carrying out what he contracts to carry out.  That evidently was not so in this case.  It is not wise to depart from the rule of accepting the lowest tender, but in this case it evidently did not turn out to be the wisest course.  Any further information on the matter which the Deputy wishes to have I shall be happy to supply at any time if he puts down a question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Belton raised a whole series of points, some of which have been dealt with by me in reply to others. <Col N="2389" /> He mentioned the question of tenders for the supply of milk.  He was desirous of restricting the tenders to persons within the area of administration of the Dublin Board of Health. As I think most of the supply of milk for the City and County of Dublin comes from outside the administrative area such a restriction would hardly be advisable.  He also raised, as did several others, the question of the financing of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  I am very keenly interested in seeing as many proper houses as possible built in every part of the country for the housing of people who are at present badly housed.  For that reason, I would be anxious to see the Small Dwellings Act in operation everywhere.  A great many local authorities have adopted the Act, put it in operation and financed it.  I would be glad to see every other local authority doing the same.  Difficulties have arisen in Dublin City with regard to the financing of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  The City Manager, realising the tremendous financial as well as other responsibilities that are on him for the provision of houses for the very poor, is hesitant about putting additional financial responsibilities on the City for the provision of houses for people who are not so poor. There was an enormous use made, and is still being made, in Dublin of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act in helping the building of houses for that class of the people who are not so poor.  The success of that development has been embarrassing to the City Manager, to a certain extent, in the provision of the finances.  The whole matter of financing the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act in the City is under examination and I am not in a position to say at the moment that any solution has been found satisfactory to those who want to use the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act to the builders interested and to the Corporation. As I say, a solution has not yet been found, but I hope it will before the present resources available have been fully used up.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies spoke of the alarming condition of the rate collection. <Col N="2390" /> So far, unfortunately, I have not got a complete return of the rate collection up to the 31st March.  The return I have got is almost complete and it shows there has been an improvement in the rate collection in the year ending 31st March this year as compared with the collection for the year ending 31st March last year.  In two-thirds of the counties there has been a considerable improvement.  The doleful picture that Deputy Brennan drew for us some months ago as to the prospects of local government for the coming year are hardly borne out. Last year we were told of the calamitous condition in which we would find ourselves on the 31st March of this year.  I remember that as late as last December and January that we had drawn for us a sad and doleful picture of what was before us at the end of March of this year.  I am glad to say that in almost two-thirds of the counties in the Free State there has been a considerable improvement in the collection this year as compared with last.  I am sure that will be very good news for Deputy Brennan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was Deputy Brennan who spoke at some length on the credit note system.  With a good deal of what the Deputy said I am in agreement.  There is a hardship in the case of some people who find themselves in a position which leaves them unable to pay before the date fixed for the expiration of the credit note.  They suffer a loss thereby.  It is unfortunate that they find themselves in such a position.  If there were a very great number of such persons in any particular county, I think it would be well worth while for the administrators of that county to consider whether they would put the credit note system into operation.  It is useful to have a try-out.  In some counties the councillors and the officials are enthusiastic about it.  Others say that it has not been a success.  I had an opportunity of meeting all the secretaries of the county councils in the month of February.  I put the matter <Col N="2391" /> before them, discussed it with them and let them discuss it amongst themselves. There was no unanimous opinion to be got from them about it. My decision was to leave it to the county councils themselves.  That is to let the power be there, and if the county councils decide to use the credit note system, then I would approve of it.  Where they used it and did not approve of it afterwards, then in general, if they decided not to continue it, I would approve of that decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to hear Deputy Rowlette express satisfaction with the progress that had been made during the last 12 months particularly in regard to the appointment of county medical officers of health.  That, as the Deputies know, is a matter that occupied a good deal of my time since I became Minister for Local Government and Public Health. It occupied a good deal of the time and attention of my predecessor.  There was a long delay in getting some councils to see their duty as we would see it in this regard.  There is one county that has not seen it yet.  I am afraid we will have to invoke the law in that case.  As a matter of fact we have already invoked the law in the endeavour to get that county to see reason.  However, before many months are over, we will have, I believe, county medical officers of health in operation in every county.  In due time we will have associated with that, with the support and assistance of these counties, a school medical system in operation.  That will lead to considerable improvement in public health in general in these counties.  It has been proved that where county medical officers of health have been operating for some time, where they have been making monthly reports, to the local authorities, setting out what is required within the ambit of their jurisdiction for the improvement of the public health of the area there has been a greater amount of knowledge and therefore a greater amount of enthusiasm for the improvement of public health and public health services in general.  There has been a speeding <Col N="2392" /> up of the provisions of the proper water supplies and sewerage schemes, as well as other improvements in matters relating to public health in all these counties.  That will probably insure that these counties will have county medical officers of health in the next few months.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rowlette asked for particulars of the infant mortality rates in urban areas for the last year or two. I have the figures here and perhaps the Deputy would like to have them. In the Cork County Borough, per 1,000 of the population the infant mortality in 1933 was 89 and in 1934 it was 79.  In the Dublin County Borough in 1933, it was 83 per 1,000 and in 1934 it was 79.  In Limerick County Borough the figure for 1933 was 132 and for 1934 it was 77.  In the Waterford County Borough, in 1933 it was 102 and in 1934 it fell to 88.  For all the urban districts including the county borough the figures for 1933 were 87 and 78 for 1934.  For all the rural districts the figures in 1933 were 52 per 1,000 and 53 in 1934.  Generally speaking there has been a satisfactory decline in infant mortality.  That decline is not as great as we would like to have it. But on the whole it is satisfactory. Might I say in connection with this subject of public health that when Deputy Rowlette stood up during the course of this debate I was reminded of the loss that the House had sustained through the disappearance of Deputy Sir James Craig.  I remember that, since I came into this House, during every year when I was sitting on the opposite side of the House or on this side, when we came to the discussion of local government, one of the first to rise always would be Sir James Craig, and always on the subject of improvement in public health services. I miss him.  We all miss him.  He did good work.  He did his best, as one individual, to spread a knowledge of public health work and to encourage us to go ahead in improvements on that line, but I must say that he has an able successor in Deputy Rowlette. I do not know if I need go into any other points.  If there is any question <Col N="2393" /> that any Deputy has not had answered, I shall try to answer it either now or later on.</P>

      <P>Deputy Kelly raised a question about pensions for nurses. I understand that that matter is being examined, not by the Department of Local Government and Public Health, but by others outside, and I hope that some of these organisations will provide us, at any rate, with a scheme. I hope that they will submit a scheme to us, and I can say that anything that is done in that way we shall be happy to have examined.  I quite agree with Deputy Kelly that the nurses are a body that do a tremendous amount of hard work.  There are no harder worked people than the nurses, especially in local services.  They have hard work to do and they are not overpaid, generally speaking.  If we can do anything, with the resources that we have and considering the demands on these resources, we shall be happy to consider any practical scheme that may be submitted.</P>

      <P>There is one other question that I should like to ask the Minister.  I only intend to intervene for a moment.  It is a matter which is so important that it would deserve a very emphatic reply from the Minister, I think.  He has alluded to it generally. The matter to which I refer is the question of the present position of the Dublin Corporation regarding loans. In 1932 a loan of £750,000 was floated and we received applications for £3,780,000.  At the end of 1933 a further loan was floated for £1,000,000, and we only received applications for £790,000. At the time of the last loan, application was made for £1,350,000 and, so far as my information goes, public subscriptions to that loan were only somewhere between £600,000 and £700,000.  The position, of course, is that so far as the Corporation is concerned the loan was satisfactory.  If I ask for a loan of £5 and get it, the loan is a success as far as I am concerned.  The Corporation, however, asked for £1,350,000, and the banks decided to <Col N="2394" /> give it, but they put in the proviso that unless the public subscribed most of the loan the Corporation need not look any more to the banks for finance.</P>
      <P>That is a serious position.  Unfortunately, it has got into the papers through people being too talkative, and it will now require an emphatic statement from the Minister, which I know he will give, that the programme of slum clearances and the provision of proper homes for the people, will be continued, no matter where the money will come from&mdash;that the Government will guarantee that.  We cannot let it go abroad amongst all these poor people, so many thousands of them living under terrible conditions, that the scheme would not be continued. This year the programme will cost £1,200,000 to go on with.  I am sure that the Minister will say here that, no matter what it costs, the clearance of the slums and the provision of proper housing accommodation will be continued until the job is finished.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>My recollection is that there were two hospitals that were not proceeded with on the recommendation of the County Mayo Board of Health.  Two of them were dropped, so far as I understand, because they wanted an additional sum beyond what was originally provided for the county hospitals.  County Mayo has done extremely well in regard to the amount received out of the Sweepstakes Fund towards hospitals in that county, and additional sums were demanded by the board of health in connection with the county hospital.  My recollection is that it was agreed that two hospitals in the county, that had been discussed and proposed at an earlier date, were to be dropped in order to provide funds to complete, to the satisfaction of the board of health, the county hospital in Castlebar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I made a pretty complete statement with regard to housing and the finance of housing.  The Minister for Local Government and Public <Col N="2395" /> Health has not been responsible so far for financing, except in so far as grants are concerned.  As to the housing in Dublin City, that has been accepted as a responsibility by the Dublin Corporation.  I am not yet aware that the Dublin Corporation wishes to rid itself of that responsibility.  I understand that, in connection with the financing of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, and other matters of a cognate nature, the Corporation are sending a deputation to me to discuss the whole matter at an early date, and then I shall have an opportunity to discuss the whole matter with them.</P>

      <P>I should like to take this opportunity to draw the attention of the Minister to a small matter in regard to the system of registration. As Deputies know, the greater part of the work of registration throughout the country is done by dispensary doctors, who act as assistant registrars. The Minister will agree with what has been admitted by most people who take an interest in the vital statistics of the country, that we have here an admirable and an accurate record.  There is probably no country in which there is a better system of registration than that carried on by dispensary doctors in rural Ireland.  The importance of having such accurate statistical records is admitted by everyone interested in statistics or who has to do with government.  One would think that the remuneration paid for such services would have some relation to their importance.  The remuneration for this work is what I can only describe as contemptuous.  The fees for registration were settled some 80 or 90 years ago and have never varied during the whole of that period.  A dispensary doctor is paid a fee of 1/- for registering a birth, 1/- for registering a death, and 6d. for registering a marriage.  The duty does not consist merely in filling in details in the register to constitute the official record.  The doctor has also to complete a copy of these entries and send them to the superintendent registrar periodically.  The amount of work connected with each registration is appreciable, apart from the responsibility, and I think the Minister has admitted that the fees have no real relation to the responsibility or the work done.  The remuneration that an assistant registrar receives amounts to something like £4 or £5 yearly in rural areas.  Of course in large centres like the City of Dublin, where there are very large numbers of births, particular officers may receive larger amounts, especially in districts in which there is a maternity hospital or such an institution as the Dublin Union.  In such cases the amount of remuneration would be appreciable, but I think the Minister will admit that generally the system of payment is really contemptuous and requires drastic alteration, so as to make it in some way commensurate with the work done.</P>

I also agree that the remuneration is not on any very generous scale.  It is a long time since the remuneration was fixed and it has been the subject of discussion with organisations representing medical officers from time to time.  It is at present engaging our serious attention and something will be done, I hope, soon.  As far as I am concerned I believe something will be done.  I hope, to be able to announce, I cannot say at an early date but, at no remote date, that I have succeeded in convincing others, who have to be convinced in the matter, that the remuneration for excellent work done ought to be increased.</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £211,241 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1936, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health in connection with the Administration of the National Health Insurance Acts, 1911 to 1934, and for sundry Contributions and Grants, including certain Grants-in-Aid in respect of the Cost of Benefits and Expenses of Administration under the said Acts.</P>
    <P>During the last year the major part of the actual process of unification has been completed and the members of all the old approved societies and branches have now been merged in the unified society.  The progress made in the matter has been more rapid than was anticipated.  The society at first occupied temporary premises but in the early part of last year central premises of a suitable character were acquired in Upper O'Connell Street, which now form the head office of the society.  Branch offices have been opened in Cork, Limerick and Waterford. The first transfer of societies was effected on 1st January, 1934, when 16 societies comprising 163,000 members were taken over.  One society was taken over on the 30th April, and another on the 2nd June. This was followed by eight societies comprising 131,000 members at the end of June, and the remainder were taken over at various dates between that and the 15th December last when the transfers were completed.  The total number of members transferred was approximately 483,000.  The transfers <Col N="2401" /> were carried through with the least possible inconvenience to insured persons and continuity was preserved in the payment of benefits to those who were incapacitated at the time of transfer.</P>
    <P>In selecting the staff of the society the Committee gave preference so far as efficiency permitted to the staffs of the old societies which had been displaced and apart from agents 188 members of such staffs have been given employment in the unified society including the secretary, treasurer, chief clerk and all the staff officers and deputy staff officers.  Compensation has been paid by the society to 149 persons under Section 22, amounting to £93,970, and to 1,726 persons under Section 23 amounting to £12,730.  The latter were mainly part-time agents.  About 680 cases remain to be completed, making the estimated total compensation £128,750.</P>
    <P>It is already apparent that the annual cost of administration by the unified society will be considerably less than that under the old scheme and the society estimate from the particulars now available that there will be a saving of 5d. per head on the capitation rate of 4/5 available for administration. This will amount to £10,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>A certain amount of publicity has been given to alleged cases of delay or irregularity in the payment of benefits by the unified society.  Any complaints of this kind which have reached the Department have been investigated, and in the great majority of them it is found that there is no genuine grievance and that they have arisen through erroneous ideas on the part of the insured persons themselves as to the benefits to which they were entitled.  It is an essential feature of the scheme, as it is of every insurance scheme, that certain qualifying conditions must be fulfilled before the right to benefit accrues.  Again, unless the number of contributions paid in a contribution year reaches the required number, benefits are reduced during the ensuing benefit year if arrears are not paid.  This has been a very common form of complaint during the early <Col N="2402" /> months of the year.  Although every individual insured person who was in arrears was notified before the 10th November last, and full instruction given as to the method of payment and the effect of non-payment, many of them ignored the instructions and then complained when their benefits were stopped or reduced.  Some in claiming benefit have omitted to give particulars by which they could readily be identified, others have taken no trouble to have their cards stamped or to send them into the society at the proper time.  All omissions or irregularities of this sort entail delay, but the delay is in no way attributable to the society.</P>
    <P>There is one other point to which I would like to refer.  Quite a number of insured persons have sent in one medical certificate and complained they have got no benefit.  Benefit can only be paid when there is proved incapacity extending over a period.  The first certificate merely proves that the person is ill on a particular day; there must be a second certificate proving a period of incapacity before benefit is payable.</P>
    <P>It is not claimed that the society is infallible.  It would be too much to expect that an occasional error would not arise in dealing with such a large volume of work&mdash;some 28,000 payments a week&mdash;but I am satisfied that the work is being well done, and that every possible effort is being made to consider the interests of the insured persons, and to give them the full advantage of the scheme even in cases where they themselves are slow to co-operate.</P>
    <P>The total Estimate of £316,841 compares with a figure of £311,376 for the preceding year, but the items in the latter figure have been altered from those in the original Estimate owing to the changes effected when the Supplementary Estimate was introduced. In dealing with salaries for instance, the amount now appearing for last year is £62,341, but the amount in the original Estimate was £64,641. The difference of £2,300, which represented savings on the salaries sub-head as originally estimated was used in the <Col N="2403" /> Supplementary Estimate to meet deficiencies on other sub-heads of the Vote.  The actual increase in the Estimate for salaries as compared with the Estimate made at the corresponding period last year is £420 and not £2,720, and this increase is more than accounted for by the ordinary incremental (and bonus) increases.</P>
    <P>The increase in State grant is due to increased expenditure on benefits and to the increased number of contributions which, it is estimated, will be paid in 1935.  There has been a steady increase in the annual contribution income of the Health Insurance Fund which, in 1934, is estimated to have reached £628,000.  The expenditure on benefits has, however, also increased and, in 1934, is estimated to have been £782,000.  The number of medical certificates issued under the medical certification scheme to insured persons increased from 1,339,000 in 1933 to 1,410,000 in 1934.  The average number of persons in receipt of benefits weekly through the year was 27,330.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of the National Health Insurance Act, 1929, during the 12 months ended 31st December, 1934, sums totalling £484 16s. 11d. were recovered for insured persons by the Department from employers in respect of benefits lost through neglect to pay contributions.  The accumulated funds forming the assets of National Health Insurance amounted to £3,646,320 at the end of 1934, indicating an increase of £94,540 during the year.  As the annual income derived from dividends and interest, etc., however, is £183,670, it is evident that the income from other sources, i.e., contribution and State grant, is about £89,130 short of the expenditure.</P>

      <P>It was rather difficult to follow the figures as read out by the Minister.  The Minister, apparently, is satisfied that there are not many complaints and that so far as there are complaints, in nearly all cases any delays that take place are due to the members themselves rather than to the administration of the unified society.  I want to say that so far as I am personally concerned, and <Col N="2404" /> speaking only for myself in this matter, there are far fewer complaints reaching me than I anticipated, and I can say that a very fair number of the complaints which did reach me, I found on investigation, were due to delay in contributing and in some cases, non-payment on the part of the members themselves. That is not to say that everything is perfect.  It would be too much to expect that, but, on the whole, speaking as one who had some experience of the working of one of the societies, and as one who was opposed to the unification scheme, both inside and outside this House, the transfer from the societies throughout the country to the unified society has been carried out much more expeditiously than I ever anticipated.</P>
      <P>Of course, it was only to be expected that there would be certain delays.  I believe that those delays would be absolutely unavoidable, because, I take it, the unified society was largely occupied during the last 12 months in, so to speak, creating the machine for the running of the unified society.  There are, of course, complaints and there are delays and there are bound to be delays, in respect of a centre in Dublin, that would not occur in a local society. When dealing, as naturally you must deal, in many cases with men down the country, agricultural labourers and others, who are not accustomed to writing and filling in forms, delays must occur in having these forms properly completed which did not occur when members merely walked into the office of the local society and had the matter fixed there and then. If there is any necessity for it, I would ask the Minister to urge on those who are in charge of the unified society to do all that is possible to avoid delay in dealing with these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister, I am sure, is aware, in the case of benefit for sickness, and, perhaps even more so where the claims are maternity claims, it is all important that the money should be forthcoming as soon as possible.  Very often, it makes a great difference to the mother and to the baby if the money is available to provide nourishment at the proper time.  There is another matter to which I want to <Col N="2405" /> refer and I should like the Minister when he is replying to deal with it a little more fully than he dealt with it in his opening statement.  That is the question of the income and expenditure. The position is serious and has been serious for a number of years. The whole financial basis of national health insurance in this country is being eaten away.  There is a wide difference year after year between income and expenditure and I want the Minister to inform the House, if he is in a position to do so when he is replying, whether he proposes to take any steps to bring income and expenditure closer together, because it seems to me that you cannot continue indefinitely having a difference of £250,000 or £300,000 a year&mdash;I think it is roughly £300,000, taking a round figure&mdash;on the wrong side.  The reserves are being slowly eaten into.  It must be remembered, of course, that the reserves which are there to the credit of the unified society consist of money which is held in trust for those who have been contributing over a number of years and who, fortunately for themselves, have not had to call on that money so far.</P>
    <P>I should also like the Minister to tell us whether any additional steps have been taken to deal with malingering and, perhaps, what is more important, with compliance and whether he is satisfied that he has reached a fairly high percentage of compliance with the Act.  I am very doubtful in regard to that.  What is the position in regard to malingering?  We know that when you have economic stress, when wages are being reduced and being forced down and when men are being thrown out of employment, an added strain comes on the funds of the National Health Insurance Society.  Men who are ill and have no work to return to are naturally inclined to remain longer on the books of the society&mdash;and I suppose it is hard to blame them&mdash;than they otherwise would.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to compensation for the officials of other societies. I should be glad if he could tell us whether any of the former card collectors have been compensated, and, if so, how many, and how long it will take <Col N="2406" /> until the matter is completed.  I mentioned those particular classes of men because, in many cases, they are men who are very badly off and the compensation, whatever it may be, to which they would be entitled would be very welcome, and I would suggest to the Minister that that might be speeded up and that the compensation to which they are entitled might be determined at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <P>Now I come to a matter that I have been trying to get at year after year in this House on this Vote&mdash;the costs of central administration.  Strange as it may seem, instead of reducing, the cost of central administration is going up.  I used to have to draw attention to the fact before the Unified Society came into being that they had one commissioner in England and, I think, one in Scotland, while we could not do with less than three in the Free State.  I cannot for the life of me see why central administration should cost over £65,000.  It seems to me that it is a sum out of all proportion to the cost, and I am satisfied that a substantial reduction could be made in that figure.  I ask the Minister and his principal officials to give their attention to the matter because it seems to me, as I say, that while there is a reduction of one in the staff, there is an increase of over £5,000 in the cost.  I think it will be very hard to justify that increase.  We were told that when we got unification we were going to have a big reduction, to have a less costly service all round, and so on.  I cannot understand why we cannot have an immediate reduction following the transfer of title, but the Minister did not hold out even a prospect, and are we going to take it that this is to be looked upon as the normal cost of administration under the Unified Society?</P>
    <P>Those are really the only points I have got to make, but I would like to say that as one who is opposed and has yet to be convinced that the Unified Society is a better system than the old system, I was more than pleasantly surprised at the efficient and expeditious way in which the transfer was completed, <Col N="2407" /> and having regard to all the difficulties, completed without undue hardship to the vast number of applicants for benefit.  I would suggest, however, that the officials of the Unified Society ought to strive to bring the matter as near to perfection as possible, because in times of illness it is vitally necessary that whatever money an applicant is entitled to should be made available as early as possible.</P>

      <P>I think it proper to offer some observations in an entirely different strain from that of Deputy Morrissey's speech.  Before I come to the principal subject I have to speak of, I want to refer to a growing source of complaint in the portion of the country I come from.  That is the clash between local medical opinion and the opinion of the medical referee. This has happened very frequently in what seemed to me to be rather striking cases.  The referee pronounces somebody fit to work and local medical opinion is flatly contradictory, and on appeal the opinion of the local medical attendant has been invariably confirmed. I do not propose to offer an opinion in this matter except to suggest that the Minister might find an opportunity of inquiring as to how this system of medical referees is working and whether there is any substance in the feeling of dissatisfaction and discontent with the results of the examination of sick persons by the medical referee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking here this evening on the Local Government Estimate, I was in the position of being able to say some pleasant things about the officers of the Local Government Department&mdash; things, I think, which were entirely deserved.  I wish I could take the same line in connection with the society responsible in this State at present for the management of the affairs of insured persons.  I am afraid that the story, as far as my experience and knowledge goes, is an entirely different one.  I have not had the happy experience which Deputy Morrissey seems to have had and I must say a very big portion of the work I had to do for several months <Col N="2408" /> past was endeavouring to remedy complaints that have arisen in connection with benefit, the payment of benefit and the rights of insured persons generally.  There is no question about it, there has been considerable delay in a very large number of cases and there is, further, what seems to me to be very strange, and I am quite fair in saying so, a feeling in the headquarters of the unified society that complaints should not be made. I had a letter from the secretary in which he stated that it seemed to be my business to collect complaints.  It is not my business, but it does not need any collection of grievances to get complaints, because they are coming in frequently.  As one very directly in touch with a large number of workers, I can tell the Minister that the complaints are very general and, from my knowledge, all the blame is not on the insured persons.  It is easy to talk about semi-illiterate labourers and to say that they do not know how to fill forms.  Of course, they do not conform to the standards that those new managers of insurance would like, but they have rights and, in my opinion, their rights have not been given the consideration they were entitled to on a number of occasions.  Perhaps that arises out of different sets of circumstances. It is a fact that a number of persons who had experience of the working of national health insurance were ignored and passed over when appointments had to be made in connection with the unified society.  I am referring principally to agents and I do not want to dwell on that matter unduly for in many ways it was an extremely unpleasant business, and I prefer to say no more than that it was inevitable, when people with no knowledge of insurance were absorbed, that they could not give anything like the service of the experienced officials if their services had been utilised.  There has been delay in issuing cards to members, and workers coming into employment or resuming employment after long delays have found it difficult to obtain cards in a reasonable time.  There has been some improvement lately.  Some time ago, the position was very bad and, of course, there <Col N="2409" /> was a stock answer for all complaints of this kind, namely, that the fault lies mainly with the insured persons. Occasionally, but very rarely, the infallible authorities of the unified society do admit they made some small mistake, but those admissions are very rare indeed and I think it is about time that we had a stocktaking as to the results that this much-vaunted unification system has brought to the insured persons in the country.  That is the real test.</P>
    <P>No amount of glorification over the wireless, no amount of elaborate newspaper articles containing very high-sounding phrases, no amount of well got out and highly-illustrated magazines will, in my opinion, justify the existence of this unified society to the average worker in the country except the members of the committee of management of that society are prepared to satisfy the test which the ordinary worker in the country will apply, and that is that the new service has to serve him as well as the one it replaced.  In this country, for some years past, there are certain principles&mdash; if one could call them that&mdash;which have become stock principles, as it were. We have certain phrases to which, without at all inquiring into what they mean, we are inclined, and in some cases expected to pay allegiance and respect.  Unification, centralisation and things like that sound extremely well. The poor law system afforded in some respects a striking example of how defective schemes of that kind can be in certain directions&mdash;I do not say altogether, but in certain respects.  I say to the Minister in this connection that it would be well to realise that the simple people down the country have, in their own way, as I think he will find on examination, given service which was as least as good and I think in some cases better than the services which the insured persons have received since the change.  At the risk of talking treason, I want to say I have yet to be convinced that unification in this or in any other service is the boon and the blessing that it is alleged to be to the parties concerned.  I think it is time, as somebody else said earlier this evening, that we face up to <Col N="2410" /> realities in this connection, and see exactly how far there was foundation for the view that by just trotting out certain phrases we can impress everybody and convince ourselves that wonderful things are happening.</P>
    <P>I had a letter from a constituent of mine a few days ago, who stated that she had been paying national health insurance contributions for a number of years; that she was a member of a certain society which was one of the first to be taken over; that she had furnished to the unified society her number in the society from which she was taken over, and that she was still awaiting payment of a claim for benefit made in December last.  I asked the society to investigate that matter, and to investigate another case arising in the same district, where delay is said to have arisen because a card, the property of the insured person, was lost in the office of the society.  I have had brought before me, over the last few months, at least a couple of cases a week arising out of the same kind of delay.  I find further that much difficulty has arisen in connection with the demand of the unified society for the production of a certificate of age to ascertain that the person is eligible for benefit.  I cannot complain of the society's asking for documentary proof of age, but I do complain that where that proof is furnished, and appears, from the point of the insured person, to be satisfactory, there still remains considerable delay in some cases.</P>
    <P>Reference was made in this House some time ago, I understand, to alleged efforts on behalf of persons connected with the Unified Society to form within that society what would be known in the industrial world as a company union.  There has grown up in certain parts of this country recently an ugly development, which finds expression in the formation inside certain industries of units controlled by the employers, where the members are supposed to exercise no other function and to be just yes-men for their employers.  The Minister, as far as I know, was not aware that any such thing was happening in the unified society, but the rumour is very persistent, and I would ask the <Col N="2411" /> Minister to make further inquiries into that matter.  I would also ask him to make further inquiries as to whether real difficulty exists in the matter of insured persons getting approach to the officers of the unified society in order that their claims should be investigated.  I have here before me a copy of the instructions issued to the staff of the unified society, which seems to indicate that there must be, for the ordinary person, considerable difficulty in approaching the principal officers of that society. Paragraph 6 of the instructions goes to show that entry to the private rooms, save with permission, is prohibited. Green signal lights will give permission to enter the rooms.  Entry is not permitted while a red signal light is showing.  Some of us here have had experience in the last ten years of calling at the various departments of this State, from the offices of the President and the Ministers, down to those of the chief executive officers of the various departments.  I must say that the formalities indicated in connection with the operations of the unified society show an entirely new and, I should say, undemocratic departure from what is the recognised practice in connection with Government offices.  I am wondering whether the people who have been responsible for issuing ridiculous instructions of that kind, and for making what seem to me to be ridiculous arrangements, have been reading about the operations of certain people who control Italy and Germany at the present time, and whether they feel that, in a minor degree at least, the policy in certain countries of that kind ought to be adopted here.  Why can there not be in the unified society&mdash;which after all is a collection of the societies which have been taken over to pay benefit honestly and deal fairly with insured persons all over the State&mdash;the same sort of democratic management that there is in the offices of the State?</P>
    <P>I am told further that the members of the staff in a good many cases are not very well paid.  I think it would be much better if provision were made <Col N="2412" /> for reasonable remuneration for the junior members of the staff instead of having expensive devices of this kind, and ornamentation which, in the circumstances, does not seem at all warranted.  It is a fact that numerous agents of the society are poorly paid. It is a fact, further, that the very small compensation to which a number of the agents are entitled has not yet been paid.  Though at least some of the persons concerned have had no other occupation, they have told me that they found it difficult to get settlement of their claims made by the unified society.  I notice further that members of the staff are prohibited from smoking during office hours.  That is perhaps not a grievance but again I point out that in Government offices members of the staff are allowed to smoke during office hours and although perhaps the example is not a very good one members of this House know of numerous local bodies where, during the conduct of business, smoking is permissible.  I do not know that I would definitely defend that.  But I think that what obtains in the offices of this State generally ought to be good enough for a unified society.  I should say that the instructions issued are so numerous, so varied and so full of commands that certain things are not to be done, that I am not surprised that the one complaint in Deputy Morrissey's speech in regard to the unlikelihood of costs being reduced in certain directions was made. I see one instruction issued that I think is extremely objectionable.  This instruction has been issued to the female members of the staff and it contains a principle that is highly objectionable:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is the wish of the committee of management that all women members of their staff should wear navy blue office coats.  In order to facilitate the staff in the purchase of these coats, the committee is prepared to defray their initial cost and allow the staff to refund so much a week.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I do not know what power the Minister has to come into a <Col N="2413" /> matter of this kind.  I think the Minister is a very sensible man.  I pay him the compliment of realising, as some of us do on reading the instructions that I have read, that the gentlemen who were being put in charge in O'Connell Street have forgotten themselves and that it would appear they feel that their office is something approaching omni-potence. I think he ought to go and tell them to deal with the people around the country who are dissatisfied with them and that in meeting their obligations to the insured persons about the country they will be doing a good deal more to justify themselves than in piling up those regulations, piling up the creation of precedents and having all this routine business that is so very trifling and is doing so very little to justify the objects for which certain gentlemen were installed in the office in O'Connell Street.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied that the Unified Society has done as well as it ought to do.  I do not share the view to which Deputy Morrissey gave expression&mdash;that he was surprised that things were going so well.  I think the authors of the scheme ought to have been satisfied before they disturbed the existing scheme of insurance that before doing so they were going to put something in its place that would be superior.  A considerable time after that change has been made there still remains numerous causes of complaint.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that I misquoted the Deputy.  I do not want to condemn the society as being incapable of any good.  I think there will be an improvement, but I believe there are just reasons and causes why the Minister should not feel that everything is quite all right.  I assure the Minister that if he travelled over the country he would find very frequently numbers <Col N="2414" /> of people who have cause for complaint in this connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a meeting of the workers in Cork City recently complaints by members of trade union bodies were voiced in connection with the working of the society in that city.  I have found these complaints in various parts of the country with which I am in touch.  I drew the attention of the Minister to the complaints, and at the risk of being told again as I was told some time ago on another matter&mdash;that I have a habit of collecting grievances against this society, I will continue to bring to the notice of this House when I get the opportunity and to the notice of the society when I do not get an opportunity in this House, cases of complaints that are, in my opinion, worthy of being inquired into.  That is one of the functions of a member of this House.  I am not going to divest myself of that right for anybody.  The whole system of unification, in my opinion, is one that confers very questionable benefits on insured persons through the country.  At the risk of being considered old-fashioned and out of date I do say that in my experience some of the societies that the new organisation replaced gave very much more satisfaction and much more prompt results and did more to maintain the confidence of their members to a much greater degree than this new institution has done.  I think it is right when one feels that that is the case that that view should be expressed. The secretary of the society indicated recently over the wireless his hope that there should be a possibility of development along the lines of social insurances, which are very necessary and some of which are overdue.  But one does not see much sign of an advance in that direction when one sees the Unified Society availing of a technicality to cut down to 3/- a week some claims for disablement benefit which runs at something like 7/- a week. Apart from the regulations in connection with national health services, there ought to be humanity and commonsense in any service.  In no service are humanity and commonsense more needed than in this.  If honest criticism of it uttered here and elsewhere <Col N="2415" /> helps to bring an increasing amount of humanity into the administration, I think we will have done well. I can assure the Minister that it is not a pleasant thing for anybody in this House to utter frequent criticisms on this or on any other matter.  The only proof those citizens who are still unconvinced have that this Unified Society is going to improve along the lines that were marked out for it, when it was framed, is that these criticisms will continue.</P>
    <P>I realise that the Minister has no definite control over the internal working of the society except perhaps in the sense that he has accepted Parliamentary responsibility.  But I do suggest to him that he ought to examine into the need for fixing the appointed day for the election of direct representatives of the insured persons on the committee of management at the earliest possible moment.  That at least will put the onus on insured persons all over the country of approaching their own direct representatives in connection with grievances that may arise regarding their interests.  I feel it would be a step that would remove a good many of the complaints and obviate a good deal of the discontent that exists at the present time in connection with the working of the society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to enter into a discussion of the merits or demerits of the Unified Society in this Vote, but I should like to point out to Deputy Murphy and others, who have complained that there is delay in the payment of benefits by the society on receipt of the necessary medical certificate, that what really does happen in many of these cases is that the insured person puts on the medical certificate his or her old number; that is to say, the number that they had in their old society before unification took place.  That has been brought to my notice several times recently.  Each insured person has got a new number but in many cases they omit to put it on the certificate, and delay, in my opinion, is due in many cases to that error on the part of the <Col N="2416" /> insured person.  I should like to pay a tribute to the courtesy of the medical referees in connection with national health insurance cases.  The medical referees, as Deputy Murphy knows, perhaps, at all times inform the insured person's medical attendant of their intention to have that insured person called for examination, and they give the particulars to the insured person's own doctor as to the time and place of examination and invite him to be present if he so desires or to supply any information that may be of help to the insured person.  Speaking personally, I must say that in 100 per cent. of the cases, I agree with the decision given by the medical referees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently a circular was sent out to certain medical men and to certain medical certifiers by the Unified Society asking them for their opinion on the extension of social insurance. To my mind social insurance in the State will never reach anything like the degree of perfection which we all hope it will some day attain unless there is included, in addition to the ordinary national health insurance certification, etc., some scheme of medical benefits. We, in the Twenty-Six Counties, are far behind our brethren in the North in that respect.  In the north-eastern portion of Ireland, and in England, you have, coupled with a scheme of national health insurance, a scheme of medical benefits, and until we have an extension of social insurance to include a scheme of medical benefits, then national health insurance and social insurance will never reach the state of perfection which we all hope it will some day attain.  In connection with that matter, I should like to say that if at any time in the near future it is contemplated to have an extension of the scheme so as to include medical benefits for the insured persons, so far as I know the medical profession, who would have the administration of the scheme largely in their hands, are whole-heartedly unanimous in the suggestion that they made on several occasions, I think, to the Department and to the Unified Society, that that scheme should be in the hands of the Minister and the State Department and should not be left under the control and <Col N="2417" /> in the hands of any Department that is not directly responsible to the Minister. We believe that it would be more efficient to have the scheme under the direct control of the Minister and of his Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrRobertJRowlette" hpid="Dr. Rowlette Dr. Rowlette">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in his interesting statement, made a remark which puzzled and somewhat disturbed me.  In speaking of the complaints which were occasionally made as to delay in drawing benefit, he said that members were sometimes under the impression that they should get benefit on one certificate only, but that it was necessary to present a second certificate before benefit would be paid.  If I heard the Minister's remark correctly, it seems to me that there is some possibility of considerable injustice to the insured person in that matter.  Benefit is payable after, I think, three days of incapacity, on the society receiving evidence that the member is incapacitated from work and is incapable of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no provision in the statutes, so far as I am aware, as to the kind of evidence that is to be procured, but in practice the evidence is the medical certificate.  There is no provision that two medical certificates are required before the member is entitled to benefit.  If the sick member were sure to see a doctor on the second or third day of his illness no injustice would be done if he were not to receive benefit until he presented the second certificate a week later.  In many cases, however, the sick person does not go to see a doctor immediately on the second or third or even the fourth day of illness, and it may be well on to the end of a week before he sees a doctor.  If he has to wait another week in order to get a second certificate before he gets benefit, he is not getting his rights under the Insurance Acts.  I do not know whether the Minister, or the society, has made any regulations which require a second certificate to be presented before a member can obtain his benefit, but if so, in the sort of case I have suggested, an injustice is done and a right of the member is taken from him.  I do not think that it should go <Col N="2418" /> out that a second certificate is necessary before benefit is obtainable.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister whether he can give the House any information as to when he may hope to have a fairly accurate and complete register of the insured persons in the country.  I think it is common knowledge that the register has become somewhat stale and that it would require some little time, with the help of the Unified Society, to bring the register up-to-date and make it fairly accurate.  No doubt, in that respect, unification should be a help in having an accurate register.  The accuracy of the register is of very great importance to the medical men who work as certifiers by agreement with the Minister, because the distribution of the funds available between the several certifiers depends upon the accuracy of the register and the correct addresses of the insured members.  A large number of complaints arise from medical men who feel that they are not justly treated because of inequalities of distribution which they do not understand, which are possibly due to an inaccurate register.  It is quite possible that some of them will get a severe shock when the register becomes accurate, because if some have been underpaid some others must have been overpaid. Whether the register is accurate or inaccurate, I am afraid the Minister's officers are likely to hear complaints from time to time.  Nevertheless, it is of importance that, as soon as possible, the register should be complete and accurate as regards the names and address of members.</P>
    <P>I associate myself completely with what Deputy Dr. O'Dowd has said about the desirability of establishing medical treatment in connection with national health insurance.  It is an absurdity on the face of it that a system calling itself national health insurance should really consist of nothing but a series of cash payments to people who are sick, because that is what it comes to in this country, and that no activity of the scheme is devoted to the treatment or prevention of disease.  I notice in the Estimate that there is a considerable sum&mdash;<Col N="2419" /> £35,500&mdash;put down as medical benefits, which may mislead the unwary into thinking that there are medical benefits in existence in this country, while there are, of course, none.  I do not understand how that item has got that name. It is only a name and has no reference to fact.  There are no medical benefits administered under the national health insurance scheme.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Deputy O'Dowd said as to the propriety of putting ourselves in a level with other civilised countries by adding medical treatment to our insurance scheme.  A scheme has been introduced in Northern Ireland in recent years, which might not perhaps be suitable for this area.  I do not wish to express the opinion that it would be suitable to this area; but medical benefits have been introduced in Northern Ireland and have, I think, worked pretty well.  The Irish Free State is in the unhappy position of not being able to stand on the same level as other members of the League of Nations, because its insurance scheme differs from that of other nations in the absence of medical benefits.</P>
    <P>I was interested to learn from the Minister that there has been some economy already assured through the process of unification, and it will be interesting, as time passes, to learn of further economy and to make some estimation in the course of a few years as to how many generations will have passed before we arrive at the degree of economy promised or hoped for before this unification was decided upon.  I may say that I am not disappointed with the degree of economy reached, because I never shared in the optimistic hopes and promises made before and at the time that unification was decided upon.</P>
    <P>The scheme of unification has come in for some criticism, particularly from Deputy Murphy.  I do not think that there is any doubt, despite Deputy Murphy's opinion, that a unified society is able to give a better, a more efficient, and a more economical service than 50 or 60 scattered societies, some large and some small.</P>
    <P>I was, however, rather disappointed <Col N="2420" /> that Deputy Murphy did not proceed a little further.  I thought he was coming to the point on several occasions. I had hoped that he would urge on the Minister that he should take the step which was urged on the previous Government several years ago by the Labour Party of the time, that instead of stopping short at unification the Government should decide on having National Health Insurance as a State Service under the direct control of the Minister; that instead of farming out National Health Insurance to a society and giving such society a monopoly, the insurance scheme should be part of the Departmental work of the Minister himself.  It appears to me that there still must be considerable duplication of work as between the Unified Society and the Minister's Department and that much greater economy could be made by abolishing that duplication; that more efficient service would be obtained and that less time would be lost.  I hope the Minister will consider seriously, when opportunity occurs, taking the further step of passing from the single society to embracing National Health Insurance in the work of a Government Department.</P>
    <P>It is by means of a Government Department that National Health Insurance is worked in several countries.  The society scheme we have here is an outgrowth from the system imposed on this country 20 years ago&mdash;not because it was suitable to this country.  Nobody ever suggested that it was suitable.  It was undoubtedly suitable to the industrial population of a great part of Great Britain where the Friendly Society system was popular and fairly efficient. In this country the Friendly Society system was limited to a few of the large towns and was not in a position to undertake the whole work of National Health Insurance.  Our present system is almost an accidental outgrowth of the Friendly Society system of the industrial towns in Great Britain and not anything that is particularly congenial to this country or suitable to the needs of this country.</P>
    <P>I myself was of opinion, when it was decided to unify the various societies <Col N="2421" /> into one, that it was a step in the right direction, but it was only one step where two should have been taken.  I would urge on the Minister to proceed to the second step as soon as he gets an opportunity.  I would remind him too that his own policy as regards National Health Insurance, stated very clearly in this House a few years ago, was that two steps were necessary: (1) unification of societies, and (2) medical treatment.  He has taken one of these steps, and I hope he will take the second in this direction also.</P>

      <P>I should like to know from the Minister when the rules in connection with the society will be printed and circulated?  I have written to the society for the rules for the guidance of insured members and I understand that up to the present they have not drafted any rules in connection with the society.  I also wish to know when the insured members will have an opportunity of selecting their own committee of management, particularly after having heard the rules read out by Deputy Murphy.  I do not think there is any other Government Department having a set of rules laid down by the committee of management which must be obeyed.  I suggest to the Minister that the time has come when the three civil servants in charge of this society should be sent back to their own departments and that the insured members should be allowed to select their own committee of management, which will have some consideration both for the staff and for the insured persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised a question in the House some time ago in connection with the formation of a union.  I am fully aware of the Minister's sympathy with workers.  A room was placed at the disposal of the members, as it was not the wish that the members should become trade unionists.  It was suggested that there should be a company union.  The Minister stated that that was not so.  We are not in a position to produce members of the staff, but we know what happened.  I can assure the House that members were anxious to become trade unionists, but were told that there could be a company union. <Col N="2422" /> The late President Wilson and also President Roosevelt had to bring in legislation to abolish company unions in America because they were making profits out of the workers.  I suggest to the Minister that he will have to do as President Roosevelt did, to bring in a Bill to prevent the management of the Unified Society exploiting the underpaid workers.  The Minister may be surprised to know that one of the rules provides that members are not to be allowed to join trade unions; that no member of the staff has a right to subscribe 6d. a week without the authority and the sanction of the secretary; that before any collection or subscription is invited from members of the staff the permission of the secretary must be obtained.  In large State Departments like the Department of Finance or the Department of Local Government there is no rule preventing members of the staff contributing to their own unions. I should like to know from the Minister how many of the staff have been recruited from persons outside Ireland: how many of the staff were brought from Belfast to work here, where we had a large number of our own people unemployed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

      <P>At the present time, it is not under our jurisdiction and very few Free State nationals get employment in Belfast.  Yet we have members of the Government claiming that people from Belfast, who rendered service in the north are to be brought back here and given good positions. Was it necessary to bring a person who had no previous experience back from England to carry on insurance work here while we had a large number of people who had worked in insurance offices unemployed?  I suggest to the Minister that much of the discontent would be removed if he saw that the rules of this society were circulated and that the insured members got an opportunity of electing their own committee of management.  I am certain that if the insured persons got the right to select the committee of management the staff need have no terror about subscribing 6d. a week to <Col N="2423" /> a trade union.  The insured members would then have the right to decide who should be the governors of the society.  I guarantee to the Minister that if the insured members had the opportunity of directly complaining there would be very little discontent amongst the staff, and that that would prevent Mussolini tactics on the part of the committee of management.  I am expressing that opinion on behalf of the underpaid workers.</P>

      <P>I note that there did not seem to be unanimity amongst those who spoke on the tribute that Deputy Morrissey paid to the expeditious manner in which unification was carried through, and the satisfactory nature of the work done.  Of course, it is to be expected that this very big organisation recently established to deal with National Health Insurance could not run altogether smoothly in the first few months of its existence.  I discount very largely the complaints made by Deputy Murphy and one or two other Deputies.  I have a list of 23 complaints from Deputy Murphy, and of the 23 there were 17 for which the society was in no way responsible, and of the other complaints they were not wholly responsible.  They were responsible to some extent, but not wholly.  Taking that list of complaints from Deputy Murphy alone, I think what I have said shows a fairly good record of work for a society which has been in existence only a few months, and that covers nearly half a million insured persons.  Some of the rules and regulations of the society do not seem to have met with the cordial approval of Deputy Everett and Deputy Murphy.</P>

      <P>I can say this, that I doubt if any other three men could have brought about unification so expeditiously and so satisfactorily as these three men did in their period of office, and they deserve every credit for what they did.  Deputy O'Dowd and Deputy Rowlette raised the important question of medical benefit again. That is a question that was often discussed before and will probably be discussed again.  What I said about medical benefit I adhere to.  I hope to see the day when national health insurance, as it is called, will be really national health insurance and not what it is in practice at the present time.  The rules of the society are available.  I think Deputy Everett asked that he should be provided with a copy.  One or two other points were raised by Deputy Murphy and by Deputy Everett as to expenditure. There is not a loss, as Deputy Murphy suggested, on the present working of the organisation.  There is a credit rather than a deficit for the end of the year.  For the last few years there has been a very considerable increase in revenue, due to the very efficient working of the national health insurance organisation.</P>

      <P>It is hereby resolved, under Article 38A of the Constitution, that the Constitution (Amendment No. 19) Bill, 1933, be again sent to Seanad Eireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies are aware that the Constitution (Amendment No. 19) Bill, 1933, is that which shortens the stated period during which a Bill may be held up by the Seanad from 18 months to three months.  When this Bill becomes law the Dáil can after three months send back to the Seanad any Bill rejected by that House.  If the Seanad still refuses to pass a Bill sent back in that <Col N="2425" /> way, the Bill will nevertheless be deemed to have passed both Houses if, after a further 60 days, the Dáil passes a resolution to that effect.  I do not think it is necessary to give any further explanation of the matter. The 18-months period had elapsed by December&mdash;I think, on 28th December last&mdash;so that we could at any time within the year introduce a resolution of this sort.  We are introducing it now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The President will have an opportunity, as he usually has, of making the speech at the end of his performance that he should have made at the beginning.  For the head of the Government to introduce a Bill dealing with the Seanad and to limit himself to what I might call the mere arithmetic of the matter is rather naive.  I might suggest to the President&mdash;he may have forgotten&mdash;that there is another Bill dealing with the Seanad in, so to speak, a state of suspension. I thought this might be the opportunity which the President might have availed of to tell us exactly what his intentions with regard to a Second Chamber are and whether he has yet excogitated that ideal Second Chamber which he hankers after.  He has not even indicated what advantage the passing of this Bill will be to him in respect of any legislation which he thinks there is any likelihood the Seanad might hold up.  It is practically 12 months now since this House passed that other Bill dealing with the Seanad.  We must take it for granted that, as the President never learns anything, his mind is still the same and that because he introduced a Bill of this particular kind almost a couple of years ago now, he must, therefore, introduce it again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As he indicated at the end of his statement, he might have brought in this resolution at any time since last December.  He brings it in now, so far as I can see, merely because he brought it in before and for no other reason.  He has another Bill, much more drastic, awaiting consideration <Col N="2426" /> and yet he deliberately goes on with this.  For what purpose?  What time can he gain with respect to any Bill the Seanad might hold up?  At the very best, a matter of a couple of months.  If he waited from December until now, why not wait that couple of months longer that would make this Bill completely unnecessary, unless he has, strange as it may seem, changed his mind?  Surely, he cannot have done so?  He has not explained precisely, if this resolution is passed now, and supposing the Seanad, when the Bill goes to them, hold it up for two months, as they still can do, in what better position he will be and whether it is worth doing this, assuming, as I said, he intends to put the other Bill on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>I suggest that some of the arguments that appealed to him when he was first introducing this Bill need not appeal to him any longer.  I think he said then that the Seanad were &ldquo;friends of ours.&rdquo;  I think that was the phrase he used.  If I were to take that argument or pay any attention to that particular type of argument, I candidly confess that I would see no reason for opposing this Bill, assuming that the Government was likely to remain in power for a few months longer.  They may easily get a majority in that particular body, but it is not from that particular Party point of view that I am really interested in the Bill.  If I were looking at this from the purely Party point of view, I might take up the line the President took when first introducing the Bill, when he more or less hinted that it was one of the motives that were actuating him, so far as this Bill was concerned.  Looking at it from the rather broader point of view than any mere Party point of view, I think it is advantageous to have a body like the present Seanad which really has not unduly exercised the powers vested in it by the Constitution and which, on the whole, has acted with great moderation.  I do not think anybody, looking at the matter without Party bias, can say that they have acted in anything but a moderate fashion, and, that being so, I think that, in the general interests of what I might call a more reasonable Constitution, <Col N="2427" /> apart altogether from Party issues, he should not be anxious to curtail the powers that the Seanad now possesses.</P>
    <P>The period of 18 months for which they can hold up Bills, extended, of course, to 20 months by the extra two months, has not been abused and in the course of time, if there are vacancies in the Seanad, with their majority in this House and practical equality in the other House, it is possible that the Government may get a majority there.  Yet, I think the Seanad ought to have this power.  The Government, as we know and as the country knows, has on more than one occasion since it came into office, been guilty of extremely hasty action, so far as the rushing of legislation through this House is concerned&mdash;action of which, I am sure, if they had not committed themselves, they would now be quite ready to take a different view.  If we had a normal Government in existence, I think the Seanad would have rendered services to the nation in giving the Government an opportunity of calmer consideration.  Where a Bill is held up for such a long time, it can be looked upon in a different atmosphere and examined, even by the Government itself, in a different atmosphere from the atmosphere of jumpiness and hastiness in which they first introduced the measure.</P>
    <P>Even in regard to one of the principal criticisms which, I think, the President had against this power of the Seanad, namely, the Oath Bill, I think the Seanad, by holding up that Bill, conferred what the Government, if they looked at the thing calmly, would acknowledge as a benefit on the country. They at least prevented this &mdash;delay is useful in all international relations, I do not care whether between this country and England or between big continental countries&mdash;they prevented a <i>fait accompli</i> between two Governments before either had an opportunity of considering the full consequences, with the result that although subsequent actions may be far from satisfactory, they at least never got to the <Col N="2428" /> breaking point they might have reached had the Oath Bill been passed by the Seanad immediately it was sent up by this House.  I think that it will be agreed that a period of delay is desirable in national as well as international affairs, where highly contentious matters involving two countries or highly contentious matters involving great issues in one country are concerned. Measures may be hastily conceived and still more hastily introduced.  I think that when these questions are taken into consideration it will be seen that the power which the Seanad has to hold up Bills can be extremely useful.  So far as criticisms are concerned, I have held the view during the past couple of years that the Seanad would be more useful if its powers had been extended.  It might be said to be more useful as far as the majority of this Party or of any other Party was concerned, but if I were looking at it from a Party point of view I should have no interest in opposing this measure at this particular moment, but looking at the thing from the general interests of the country, if there was to be any change in the powers of the Seanad I should prefer to see them extended rather than diminished.  I know it is useless, but still I would ask the President not inevitably to take up the attitude that what he has written he has written and it cannot be changed, and that if he does not preserve that literal constancy in mere words he is showing weakness of some kind.</P>
    <P>This is not, and need not any longer, be a Party matter&mdash;I mean in the sense of either Party looking to advantage from the extension or diminution of the suspensory powers of the Seanad. It is a question, especially with the other Bill there, with the House and with the country being still in the dark as to whether the President is inevitably wedded to one Chamber Government or not, whether he still has any hope of finding that ideal Second Chamber.  The Seanad has been criticised for being a mere replica of the Dáil.  It is nothing of the kind.  There are periods in the life of the Seanad when the <Col N="2429" /> majority in the Seanad has coincided with the Dáil but other periods will come when it is not the case.  The very method of election now prevailing ensures that, in many cases, the Seanad would not be a mere replica of the Dáil and the only thing that might be considered is whether in practice the Seanad has unduly abused its powers.  Not merely do I think that it has not but I think it has acted with great moderation whenever it has acted.</P>

      <P>I want to add a very few words to what Deputy Professor O'Sullivan has said.  I think that the President has treated this House with extraordinary levity in introducing his motion without giving us any indication of what the Government intentions are with regard to the Seanad.  If we are to assume that the Seanad is still to be abolished, it is extraordinary that we should waste time in discussing proposals merely to cut down its powers of delay to three months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that in his reply, at any rate, he will give us a little illumination of this question.  My own views on the subject of the Seanad have not changed.  I throughly agree with Professor O'Sullivan that the powers of the Second Chamber ought to be real and not illusory and that it would be very much better to increase the powers of the Seanad than to diminish them.  I would especially wish to increase them by extending the range of their powers so that they could interfere in financial matters to the same degree as in other matters, but I am not, I confess, at all satisfied with the present constitution of the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that body is not a satisfactory body at the present moment, and, moreover, that it must continue to get less and less satisfactory as the years go on, because, while it is true, as Professor O'Sullivan has said, that the method of election is likely to result in a certain time-lag so that the Seanad will not always be just of the same political complexion as the Dáil of the day, <Col N="2430" /> that method of election has this great disadvantage, that it practically rules out of consideration all aspirants for the Seanad except persons who have been actively engaged in politics and that it makes it next door to impossible in any closely contested election to get rid of any Senators who, for one reason or another, may be unsatisfactory. Their votes are needed by the particular Party to which they belong to get the candidates of that Party selected and, therefore, the Party cannot afford to offend even the worst and most incompetent Senator by kicking him cut.  Consequently, the method of election which at present prevails seems to me to be faulty in almost every possible respect.  While I say that, I am still a supporter of the principle of having a Second Chamber, although I lay myself open to somewhat the same sort of derision as the President in having a hankering for experiment in the selection of the form of Second Chamber which we will have.  I do not think the experience of other countries has on the whole produced satisfactory Second Chambers, and I think we might justifiably experiment and make some discoveries for ourselves.</P>
    <P>But while the question of the mere existence of the Seanad is in the balance, it seems really extraordinary to reintroduce this old provision cutting down the power of delay without giving us a word of information as to what the Government's intentions are with regard to the whole question of the Seanad's existence, and of its composition, if it is to be allowed to exist.</P>
    <P>If I remember rightly, when the Bill cutting down the Seanad's power of delay was before this House on a previous occasion, the President's chief argument was that at some committee &mdash;unfortunately I did not realise this matter was coming up or I should have refreshed my memory about it&mdash; which was appointed to consider what the Seanad's powers should be, a recommendation had actually been made that the power of delay should only be three months.  Nobody apparently discovered during the debate in this House a fact of great importance which was subsequently brought out by Senator Douglas when <Col N="2431" /> the Bill was brought on to the Seanad. That was that the recommendation that the period of delay should be only three months was coupled with another proposal which was part of the same plan&mdash;that at the end of those three months there should be a referendum in the event of the two Houses, the Dáil and the Seanad, being unable to agree; so that the proposal for a three months period of delay, so far from diminishing the powers of the Seanad, would have enormously increased its powers.  Thus it would appear that the President's memory was either unusually defective or that he was guilty of a very serious <i>suppressio veri</i> when this matter was debated by us before.  I hope that at any rate in his concluding remarks he will throw a little more light on what we have to expect in regard to the whole question of the Seanad's future, and the Seanad's position if it has a future.</P>

      <P>It is not anything new now, because it happened so often, but it is rather strange that I should be criticised by a Deputy for not saying more than I have said, particularly by Deputy MacDermot, who is so anxious to spare the time of the House.  Why should we go over all that ground again?  We had very long debates on this whole matter before. The points of view of both sides of the House were expressed at great length, and why should we have it all over again on a matter of this sort?  This was the first Bill to run its course&mdash;18 months.  The period, as I already said, expired a couple of months ago, and if we were serious about the Bill at the start I see no reason why it should not be assumed that we are still serious about it.  As long as the Seanad remains, even if it is only for a very short time, we desire that its power of delay should not extend to a period of effectively 20 months, as it does at present, but that that period should be shortened effectively to a period of five months.  There is legislation going through.  We do not want to face the holding up of that legislation by <Col N="2432" /> the Seanad for that period, even during the short time it is in existence. It is not to be assumed that since our bringing this Bill in any change has taken place.  If a change had taken place in our views then I certainly should have thought it desirable and necessary that I should inform the House of that change.  But no change has taken place.</P>
      <P>When we were discussing this particular Bill originally I think Deputy MacDermot was of opinion that once the Seanad had no greater power of delay than is proposed in this Bill it might as well go out of existence altogether. We are taking those things as they come.  I simply say to the House that there is no change of attitude on the part of the Government in regard to the Seanad.  The object in bringing in this Resolution is to make effective the first idea we had in bringing in the Bill, and that is to shorten the period during which the Seanad could delay legislation even though the period during which it will be in existence is drawing to a close.  A number of Bills are being sent up; a number are likely to be sent up, and we do not want to have a long period of delay.  I cannot say anything further which would be useful at this stage.  When we come, as we will in a short time, to a similar motion in regard to the Bill completely abolishing the Seanad I think we might be in order in again discussing the question as to whether or not there should be a Second Chamber at all.  That does not arise on this motion.  This particular Bill is for curtailing its powers.  What might be germane to this if we had not threshed it out before is whether the Seanad would be of any use if its delaying powers were as short as is proposed in this Bill.  Accordingly I do not think I should waste the time of the House by speaking further.</P>

      <P>I would not suggest that these should be taken together, because it is possible that we might want to vote against No. 11 and not want to vote against No. 69.  I think, Sir, that we have got on very well in previous years without taking these together.  As regards No. 10, that probably can go through without discussion, but there is no reason why there should not be discussion on Nos. 11 and 69.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If we take No. 10 as agreed, we can then proceed to No. 11.  The only point I am putting is that it is not a question of the Vote. Nos. 10 and 11, customarily, have been taken together.  The Deputy may take it that that is a fact.  The difficulty, however, is that in latter years, the Board of Works have been responsible for the administration of the Relief Vote, and therefore, on the Board of Works Vote, a discussion on the whole of the Relief Vote takes place, and we are going to be put in the awkward position that, after we have dealt with the whole of the discussion on No. 11, then we have to move the material for that discussion.  Technically, we could not give you the figures for the distribution of last year or for next year, while, if you take the discussion on the three Votes together, you can <Col N="2437" /> divide separately.  My suggestion is that if you take No. 10 as an agreed Vote now, that would save the trouble to begin with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that it is a very bad precedent, and certainly a nice commentary on the state of affairs in the country, if the Office of Public Works has to be permanently linked in discussion to the Relief Vote. I suggest that, while Nos. 10 and 11 might be taken together in the way the Parliamentary Secretary suggests, by passing No. 10, the relief schemes are certainly a matter that ought to be open to separate discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only trying to meet the convenience of the House.  If it could be agreed that we would not discuss the Relief Vote on No. 11, that would suit me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>My suggestion is that we take No. 10 now as an agreed Vote, and No. 11 as one on which we discuss, first the particular motion which Deputy Mulcahy has, and then the Vote itself.  We can then take 69 as a separate matter in which we can deal with both the administration and the distribution of relief.</P>

The simplest course to pursue would be that suggested by the Parliamentary Secretary; that is, to take No. 10 as agreed and not to discuss relief works on No. 11.  No. 11 would proceed as far as sub-head B, and then a general discussion on the remaining items of that Vote.</P>

      <P>This represents an increase of £133,653. Under sub-head A&mdash;Purchase of Sites and Buildings&mdash;there is an increase of £31,000, made up principally by the purchase of the reversionary interest of the Dublin Corporation in the site of the Custom House, amounting to £14,000 odd, and the cost of sites for Volunteer Drill Halls, Gárda Síochána Barracks, and similar items.  Under sub-head B&mdash;New Works, Alterations and Additions&mdash;there is an increase of £224,113, made up principally of grants for the building, enlarging and so forth of National Schools, £80,000; Galway and Ballyvourney special schools, £18,000; the reconstruction of the old Viceregal Lodge as a Folklore Museum, £10,000, and about £100,000 on drill halls.

      <P>I move that the Estimate be reduced by £100 in respect of sub-head B.  Sub-head B provides for a certain amount of money for reconstruction of the General Post Office, and a Supplementary Estimate on the same sub-head, in August last, provided £1,000 for the provision of an Easter Week memorial in the General Post Office.  On the last day of the Summer Session, in August last, and about half an hour before the adjournment was moved, the Minister for Finance introduced an Estimate for <Col N="2439" /> £1,000 and explained that it was proposed to set up a bronze memorial in the General Post Office, as a memorial to the men who fell in the Post Office during Easter Week.  The matter was introduced in a most haphazard way. Deputy Cosgrave pointed out at the time that it was an unreasonable action on the part of the Government, and that it was a very inadequate action on their part.  He pointed out that neither was the form of the memorial nor the time suitable, and that there should have been some understanding with the particular people who were concerned with the Rising in Easter Week.  He pointed out that they should have been consulted in the matter, and that there should have been some understanding that they agreed that the action that was proposed to be taken was in some way suitable and that there would be general harmony between all parties concerned with the Government's action.  There was no time to discuss the matter adequately.  It was introduced without any previous notice to the House generally and was presented practically as a <i>fait accompli.</i></P>

      <P>I am showing the Parliamentary Secretary that there is money provided in Item 82 to pay for certain work at the General Post Office, and the work that is being carried out to-day at the General Post Office must be paid for out of that £300,000, or out of some Supplementary Estimate to be provided later.

      <P>No. The position, as the Chair sees it, is that Deputy Mulcahy wishes to raise a particular matter.  He referred to that matter on rising to speak.  It had reference to the Easter Week Memorial in the General Post Office. In the Book of Estimates there is no money provided for that.  The Parliamentary Secretary, who is head of the Department, and who knows what money is being expended on that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The following appeared in the <i>Irish Times</i> of April 11th:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;With a uniformed policeman and three detectives in plain clothes standing nearby, workmen were busy in the General Post Office, Dublin, yesterday, on what is presumably the base for the statue of Cuchulann, the official memorial to the men who were killed in 1916.  It will be recalled that the statue, which had been in the public hall of the General Post Office for a long time, was removed last week by men employed by the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;President de Valera will formally unveil it during the remembrance celebrations on Easter Sunday morning.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I object to the expenditure of money on that object in the particular circumstances in which it is now being spent. I indicated that in August last when, without previous notice to the House and half an hour before the Adjournment Motion was taken closing the session for the summer, the Minister for Finance, in a most casual way, asked the House to grant £1,000 to be spent in putting up a memorial to the Easter Week men at the General Post Office.  Certain criticism was made against that.  There was no vote against it because it came on in an unexpected way at the end of the session.  It was, however, indicated that this was going to be a national thing, a State thing, <Col N="2447" /> that the occasion was one to honour the men of 1916, one that was to be an honour to this State, and one to help to unify the various Parties in the State.  No exception was taken since to the matter until an advertisement appeared in the <i>Irish Press</i> early in March indicating that a Fianna Fáil flag day was to be run on Palm Sunday, Holy Week and Easter Sunday.  There was disseminated to the Press the information that the President was going to unveil the memorial on Easter Sunday, that there was to be a big procession of men who were out in 1916, that the Army was to parade, that Volunteers were to be brought from all parts of the country, and that there was to be a big military display.  No invitations have yet been issued by the President or by the Government or anything done to indicate that this is being carried out out of State finances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely this has nothing to do with the reconstruction of the General Post Office.  I allowed the Deputy to discuss the expenditure of £300,000 in connection with the reconstruction of the General Post Office but he is now proceeding to tell us something about a ceremony that is to take place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

      <P>There is provision <Col N="2451" /> made in this Estimate for the expenditure of £521,000 on new works, alterations and additions in sub-head B.  In connection with that, Deputy Mulcahy was drawing attention to certain expenditure on certain new works, alterations and additions going on at the General Post Office and, in doing so, he was describing the surrounding circumstances which, in his opinion, made that expenditure improper.  He was ruled against by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I think it is only right that it should be stated, while, of course, nobody challenges the good faith of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that it is the unanimous opinion of us on this bench that this ruling was unfair and oppressive.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mulcahy, in the first instance, indicated that he desired to raise the question of expenditure in connection with a specific item in the book of Estimates. The Parliamentary Secretary pointed out that there was no expenditure provided this year in connection with that particular item, and that it had been voted on last year.  Some further discussion took place, but I ultimately indicated to Deputy Mulcahy that I was prepared to hear him on the £300,000 money which is provided there for expenditure in connection with reconstruction, etc., in the General Post Office.  Deputy Mulcahy proceeded to discuss that for a little while. He proceeded then to tell us about a ceremony that was to take place in connection with the unveiling of the Easter Week memorial in the General Post Office, and proceeded to speak about the celebrations, military parades, invitations and who were to send the invitations, and who were to be invited.  I indicated very definitely to Deputy Mulcahy more than once that I could not connect the ceremonial, the invitations to the ceremonial, or who were to be invited and who were <Col N="2452" /> to invite, with the expenditure of £300,000 for reconstruction work in the General Post Office.  I definitely indicated to Deputy Mulcahy that I could not allow him to proceed on those lines.  He deliberately disobeyed that ruling and continued to speak.  I sent for you, Sir.</P>

      <P>The question was raised by Deputy Mulcahy that he wanted to raise the question of specific expenditure.  I want to raise the question of £300,000, as I do not know whether it is being spent on a lavatory or upon the reconstruction of something else, but we do know that Deputy Mulcahy read from the <i>Irish Press</i> that a monument had to be altered reconstructed and replaced. Whether or not the money expended on that by the Board of Works during the last year has nothing whatever to do with the motion before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion before the House is to reduce that Vote by £100, not the £1,000 but the £300,000, and it has nothing whatsoever to do with what was voted last year, the sum of £1,000 <Col N="2456" /> which is put there as an unvoted sum. It is, I submit, a matter of interest to the taxpayers of this country to know how that sum of £300,000 is going to be expended in alterations or otherwise to the General Post Office, and it is also, Sir, I submit, a matter of interest to know that there are at the present moment, to-day, yesterday and, possibly, to-morrow, persons employed in the Office of Public Works who must be paid out of that Vote because it is for reconstruction in the General Post Office, Dublin.  It is a matter of interest to them to know what we are reconstructing and why we are doing it.  It is possible, indeed very probable, that the Parliamentary Secretary is not desirous of having any reference whatsoever made either to 1916 or to the particular function that he is preparing to participate in.  I would say that his only association with 1916 would be the nineteen part of it&mdash;the nineteenth anniversary.</P>

At that period I know there was no job for me or for my companions in the said Board of Works.  My references to the various items here will be fairly commonplace &mdash;a sort of anti-climax to what has occurred.  In connection with the Phoenix Park I should like to remind the Secretary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I expect that in the near future we will get rid of one eyesore&mdash;the statue of Queen Victoria &mdash;at the entrance to the House&mdash;and if we get rid of one eyesore let us not follow that up by introducing a number of new eyesores.  I think we are entitled to hear a little more from the Parliamentary Secretary on these matters. I suggest that if it is proposed to put in new busts of national leaders in any part of the precincts of Leinster House these leaders should not be confined to people of 1916 and since 1916, but that they should be selected from the whole line of leaders of Irish national opinion in the past.  They <Col N="2462" /> should not be concentrated on one particular epoch to the glorification of that epoch at the expense of the rest.</P>

It has been decided to have plaster busts made of General Collins, Cathal Brugha and Austin Stack, and also castings in bronze of the busts of Padraic Pearse, President Griffith, General Collins, Cathal Brugha and Austin Stack.  The provision of £1,500 is intended to cover the cost of the execution of a bronze bust of Padraic Pearse, the purchase from Mr. Albert Power of a plaster bust of President Griffith, the preparation of plaster busts of Cathal Brugha, Austin Stack and of General Collins; the purchase of four death-masks (President Griffith, General Collins, Cathal Brugha and Austin Stack) and the execution of casts in bronze of the four busts.  Mr. Sheppard, who has already executed a bronze bust of the late Kevin O'Higgins, intimately knew Padraic Pearse and is fully qualified to prepare the proposed busts.</P>

I understood you stated it has been ruled that when there is an amendment to refer back a matter the debate on that amendment covers the whole subject.  I do not understand whether you meant that it was a universal ruling that when there is such an amendment the discussion of that amendment shall cover the whole discussion on the sub-head, or whether you merely referred <Col N="2468" /> to the fact that such a thing had happened. In that case I submit respectfully that there is a complete difference when it has been agreed and announced beforehand that the whole discussion will take place on that sub-head.  I submit that if on the previous occasions there was an understanding beforehand, clearly made known to the House, that all discussion on that sub-head was going to take place on the amendment, there is no analogy between that and the present circumstances, when nobody knew that we were going to be precluded from discussing the sub-head after the Vote was taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised last year the question of closing the Phoenix Park to motor traffic and suggested confining it to hackney cars, particularly for sight-seeing and races.  I did this in the interest of trade, so as to try and bring about a revival of an industry that has waned considerably. I raise the question now more by way of vindication because, unfortunately, throughout my life my vindication has always taken place 12 months or, perhaps, five years after the time it should have taken place.  Had the Parliamentary Secretary agreed to my suggestion last year there might have been a revival in the hackney car trade here with the consequence that the citizens of Dublin would not be in the position in which they are to-day.  What position are we, the ordinary man and woman in the street, in the city to-day?  We are absolutely back again to the beginning of man. We have no means of locomotion except our legs and that was the way in the very beginning and in the stone age, the bronze age, and the other ages that we are told existed before our age.  If that is so, it only shows the great foresight I possess.  I know that motorists were very angry with me at the time.  Some of them spoke to me very seriously and asked me was I going back to mediæval times or times long before that; did I want to get back to the wheel-barrow age.  If we had a few wheel-barrows to-day they would be very useful.  I remember on one occasion when the late Arthur Griffith, the present Minister for Local Government and myself were sketched being wheeled home from the Leitrim election in a corporation wheel-barrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not suppose that there is much <Col N="2470" /> use in my renewing my request to-night.  It is, however, a very serious condition of affairs that a trade which has been associated with Dublin for some 100 years should be completely wiped out.  If there were a number of cars and cabs plying on the streets of Dublin to-day the inconvenience and the other things we are suffering from would not be so great.  I see, later on, in these Estimates that an increased grant is to be given to the Zoological Gardens.  That is what we want in this country&mdash;more Zoological Gardens. I shall allude to that later on when that Estimate comes up; but if money could be spent upon them they would be useful in a way which I hope to set out when we are considering that particular Estimate.</P>
    <P>I wish to direct the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to the Chapel Royal, a very beautiful building internally and externally.  The Chapel Royal has been closed to the public for some years.  I am not aware if it is open to visitors.  Some years ago it was made a receptacle for official documents.  I was told that the documents were piled high on the seats and that it was practically impossible to see anything worth looking at in the building.  I do not know what the position is now because I have not been there for some time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chapel Royal is open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest if the building is not put to any use that it should be offered for re-erection in some portion of the city, because it is a pity to have such a splendid building hidden away, where it is seen only by civil servants, who have been looking at it so long that they do not take any notice of it now.  I should also like to direct the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to the Arcade in Henry Street which was erected about 10 years ago.  The Arcade has never been occupied.  I often go down there on Saturday evenings and I notice that the place is closed up and that the shops are to be let.  The hoardings have become dilapidated and the paint work must have been done years ago.  Notices on the shutters state <Col N="2471" /> that applications for the shops should be made to the Board of Works.  I submit that that is not a right state of affairs.  When the experiment of putting up an Arcade in Henry Street was made it was known that Arcades, generally speaking, and especially in Dublin, are failures.  Rather than have the place lying idle the Parliamentary Secretary might consider the advisability of establishing a fruit and flower market there.</P>
      <P>Owing to the operation of the Street Trading Act, which was passed by this House some years ago, a number of honest women have been prevented from making a living by selling fruit and flowers.  They are not now allowed to trade in many streets that were previously, open to them.  If they attempt to do so they are prosecuted and fined sums that are beyond their capacity to pay.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary consider the experiment of allowing some of these women into the Arcade by establishing a fruit and flower market there?  If he did that a good deal of employment would be given to these women.  Something should be done about the shops in the Arcade or there should be some explanation why they are idle in one of the best business streets in Dublin. The Parliamentary Secretary will remember that I raised a question here some time ago concerning the proposal to expend £100,000 on new offices for the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <P>I am merely recalling the matter, because I stated then that the Board of Works might have a survey made of the national property they control in Dublin, to see if any sites could be obtained for a citizens' hall that is so badly needed.

      <P>There is another item dealing with sundry premises, let or unoccupied, and it is proposed to spend a good deal of money on them. Will the Parliamentary Secretary be good enough to indicate if he will have a survey of unoccupied premises made to see if he could present the citizens of Dublin with a suitable site for the erection of a hall?  The questions I raised on this Estimate are commonplace questions, and there is no high-falutin about them.  I submit them for generous consideration by the Parliamentary Secretary in the hope that some attention will be paid to them, and also that some effort will be made to revive the hackney car trade in the city.</P>

      <P>On sub-heads (c), (d) and (f) I see items for maintenance, repairs and other charges relating to the sites of buildings and offices. Deputy Kelly has taken the opportunity to discuss a matter of policy, driving traders from Wexford Street and other places.  That was done without any protest or indication that it was out of order.  The first items, sub-heads (c), (d) and (f) refer to the Oireachtas Vote, and arising out of that I should like to have this early opportunity, just as a matter of policy, of having a definite ruling on the principle that you, Sir, and your colleague, can intervene in debate or preclude debate.  To-night a point was raised as to whether, in fact, when an amendment is put down to a particular sub-head, and is voted upon by the House, that that entirely precludes discussion of the <Col N="2473" /> main Estimate.  On that we had a ruling, in your absence, that discussion of the amendment would preclude discussion of the question to which the amendment was directed, and on that the House was precluded discussing the main body of this Vote.  If that is to stand as a ruling in this House, the sooner we abolish all hope of providing money for housing such a collection of futile folk as we appear to be the better.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if his attention has been called to reports in the Press of a judgment delivered by the Supreme Court in a case in County Donegal relating to the ownership of mineral rights in the course of which it was stated that the Land Commission procedure was contrary to natural justice; that people's rights were decided in their absence, and that proper notice was not given to the parties concerned; and, if so, if he will state what action he proposes to take in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands (Mr. O'Grady)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen a report of the case referred to; it concerns an appeal brought by the Minister for Industry and Commerce from an order made by the Judicial Commissioner under Section 4 of the Mines and Minerals Act, 1931, relating to the ownership of granite rock on the estate of the Earl of Mount-charles, Co. Donegal.  The Land Commission were not parties to the case and were not therefore represented at the hearing before the Supreme Court. I have had inquiries made in the matter and I find that rule 6 of the rules regulating procedure and appeals under Section 4 of the Mines and <Col N="2334" /> Minerals Act, 1931, provides that the Land Commission may, if they consider that notice may be dispensed with, determine forthwith a question referred to them by the Minister for Industry and Commerce under the Act and publish the determination in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  The rules also provide that when the Land Commission determine a question without a hearing they shall, in addition to publishing the determination in <i>Iris Oifigiúil,</i> serve a notice of the determination personally or by registered post on all persons appearing to them to be interested.  It is also provided in the rules that an appeal may be lodged by any interested person with the Appeal Tribunal, whether or not there has been a hearing by the Land Commission in the first instance.  The rules provide, therefore, (1) that every determination by the Land Commission shall be brought to the notice of all interested parties, and (2) for an appeal in every case.</P>
      <P>These rules were complied with in the Donegal case to which the Deputy's question refers.  The parties concerned were notified of the determination or decision of the Land Commission, one of them appealed against the determination to the Appeal Tribunal, and it was the decision of the Tribunal delivered by the Judicial Commissioner on a point of law which was the subject of appeal to the Supreme Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the judgment of the Supreme Court appears to be that there must now be a public hearing in the first instance, by the Land Commission, in every case, however trifling, in which the Department of Industry and Commerce, in dealing with a mining proposition, require to know whether an exclusive mining right has been reserved to the State in any particular land and whether any particular substance can be mined under such exclusive right.  The Land Commission, as indicated in their rules, did not consider that it was necessary to put the parties concerned and the State to the expense and delay of a public hearing in every case.  I understand that in the vast majority of these inquiries the information as to the existence of a State mining right is at once available by examination of the records of <Col N="2335" /> the land purchase proceedings affecting the lands.  No action on my part seems to be called for.</P>
