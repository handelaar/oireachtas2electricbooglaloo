      <P>I move that the Bill be read a Second Time.  The Bill is entitled &ldquo;an Act to make further and better provision in relation to assurance business and persons carrying on that business or any branch thereof, to make provision for the formation and registration of a company having for its principal object the reinsurance of insurance business and to make provision for other matters connected with the matters aforesaid.&rdquo;  The purposes of the Bill are two-fold&mdash;firstly, to provide for the better regulation of insurance business, and to secure more protection for the insuring public; secondly, to assist Saorstát companies &mdash;companies owned, controlled and operated by nationals of the Saorstát &mdash;to attain a position in which they can command the utmost confidence of the insuring public and to secure that, in due course, the greater part, if not all, of the assurance business arising in the Saorstát will be placed with <Col N="1710" /> such companies.  The conduct of insurance business in the Saorstát is regulated at present by the Assurance Companies Act, 1909, which applies to all companies carrying on any of the following classes of business&mdash;life, industrial, fire, accident, employers' liability, mechanically propelled vehicle insurance and bond investment.  The keynote of that Act may be said to be &ldquo;freedom with publicity.&rdquo;  It does not provide for close supervision of the activities of the companies.  Every company is allowed to follow its own course, provided it lodges the prescribed deposits with the accountant of the courts of justice and submits to the Department of Industry and Commerce certain statements and annual accounts in statutory form. Throughout the world, the trend is towards more effective regulation of this important and steadily expanding business and, in other countries generally, State supervision and control have developed to a greater extent than in this country.  The measure of control provided by the Assurance Companies Act of 1909 is in several respects inadequate to safeguard the interests of policy holders and improved regulation is more particularly needed by reason of the introduction of compulsory third party risk insurance.  During the past 20 years, insurance business has developed to a greater extent than in any previous period, but insurance facilities are not available here to anything like the extent which they are used in other countries, and competent authorities are agreed that the business is capable of very much greater expansion.  Life assurance is, perhaps, the most important of all forms of thrift, providing, as it does, for the accumulation of savings, combined with security; and, in view of the improving standard of living in the wage-earning classes and the increasing population, it is at the present time more essential than ever that thoroughly sound and economical systems for life assurance and industrial assurance should be available. The responsibilities devolving upon offices undertaking the business of life assurances are very onerous, and the State cannot afford to be indifferent as <Col N="1711" /> to the manner in which they are fulfilled. The offices, in the management of which the policy holder has no voice, collect premiums from their policy holders at fixed intervals upon a contract to discharge an agreed financial obligation which may not, and usually does not, arise for a very long interval after the date of the contract.  An office must accumulate large funds relatively to its annual premium income, and the policy holder suffers grievously if these funds are mismanaged or misapplied.</P>
      <P>The obligation placed by the Road Traffic Act of 1933 on all owners and drivers of motor cars to insure against the risk of claims which might arise against them as a result of accidents caused by their cars, and the necessity under the Workmen's Compensation Acts to provide adequately for compensation to workers and their dependents in cases where accidents sustained in the course of employment cause injury or death, likewise make it now of greater importance than ever that the companies undertaking insurance against these risks should be conducted on lines that leave no doubt as to their resources being sufficient to meet every liability.  It is proposed in the Bill that the classes of insurance business to which the Act of 1909 applies shall in future be carried on only by companies licensed for the purpose; and companies authorised to do life assurance or industrial assurance, or both these classes of business, shall not be permitted to undertake bond investment, fire, accident, employers' liability, or mechanically-propelled vehicle insurance.  Other classes of insurance business to which the Act of 1909 does not apply, such as marine, plate glass, burglary, live stock, boiler and gas engine insurances, are not affected by the Bill.  Licences will be granted to existing assurance companies on application; but except temporarily, pending arrangements for the transfer of business, a company will not be licensed to carry on both life and non-life business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be well at this stage to state the reasons for that division of business.  The contracts involved in <Col N="1712" /> life assurance and industrial assurance, being of a long period character as contrasted with general insurance contracts intended to cover a short period of risk only, make it desirable in the opinion of the Government to separate the life and industrial branches from the other branches of insurance business.  It is proper that policy holders in the life and industrial insurance branches should be afforded the full security of the separate funds formed by the assets which their premiums have created, and should be protected from the possibility of such funds being applied, directly or indirectly, to make good the losses and cover the expenses incurred in other classes of insurance.  It is a desirable reform which should not be delayed merely because of the temporary inconvenience which may be caused to companies now doing both classes of business.  It has been suggested that the same purpose could be served by the effective separation of interests by a company doing both classes of business.  Such a method is, I believe, impracticable, or, if practicable, would involve a very elaborate and intricate set of provisions.  The British Departmental Committee, which reported in 1927, known as the Clauson Committee, in putting forward such a set of provisions in the draft Bill prepared by it, do not claim that they would provide a complete solution of the difficulty. They said&mdash;I am quoting from their report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Committee cannot hope that in such an intricate and difficult subject matter their work would prove to be flawless.'</P>
    <P>In the case of new companies, licences under the Bill will be granted only to companies incorporated in the Saorstát.  Such companies will be required to comply with certain conditions as to ownership and control, and to have an issued capital of not less than £200,000 and a minimum paid-up capital of £100,000.</P>
    <P>There are certain fundamental points in regard to which amendment and extension of the laws dealing with insurance are desirable.  To secure the interests of policy-holders in the several separate classes of insurance, <Col N="1713" /> by giving them a special interest in the funds created for the purpose of that class of insurance with which they, as policy holders, are concerned, the Act of 1909 requires separate assurance funds to be kept for certain classes of insurances, but it does not, however, require the separation of investments.  To make the seperation of funds really effective, it is proposed in the Bill to require also that the assets representing the separate funds shall be kept separate from the other assets.  Moreover, it is intended to prohibit the practice of borrowing on the security of the assets representing life assurance funds.</P>
    <P>In lieu of the deposits, required by the Act of 1909 to be made with the accountant of the Courts of Justice, it is proposed that separate deposits shall be made as follows: £20,000 for life assurance, £20,000 for industrial insurance, and £20,000 for general insurance business other than mechanically-propelled vehicle insurance.  The amount of deposit for mechanically remain, as at present, £15,000.  The obligation with regard to these deposits will apply equally to existing companies and new companies, credit being allowed, of course, for any deposits already made.  Exemption from the obligations to make deposits is to continue for certain mutual associations doing fire and employers' liability insurances, but such associations will in other respects be required to comply with the provisions of the Act of 1909 and of the Bill.  There appears no reason why such companies transacting employers' liability business should continue to be exempted from the responsibilities imposed on other insurance bodies with regard to the furnishing of accounts and statements relating to their financial position.</P>
    <P>Assurance companies will be required to furnish to the Minister more detailed information concerning their transactions and affairs than is contained in the accounts and returns they make at present.  It is believed that the preparation of the additional particulars will not impose any undue strain upon the offices.  By having the returns <Col N="1714" /> rendered in greater detail, the financial position of the companies can be more clearly disclosed and supervised.  Thus better protection can be afforded to the insuring public.  The publication of statements and certified balance sheets, while presenting to any person skilled in the examination of accounts a fairly accurate indication of the company's affairs, does not afford to the general public a sufficient means of estimating the value of the security offered by an assurance company.  The information contained in such published accounts may convey very little to the holder of an industrial assurance policy.</P>
    <P>Though fortunately not occurring in this country, there have been in neighbouring countries, within the last few years, some serious failures of companies transacting third party insurance, resulting in grave hardship to their policy holders.  From the examples afforded by such failures, it becomes clear that more effective measures should now be taken to protect the insuring public, and, accordingly, it is proposed that the Minister should be given a right to require any company to give him such information and explanation as will enable him to judge whether there are reasonable grounds for believing that the company is insolvent, and be empowered to intervene, if necessary, and take steps with a view to having insolvent companies wound up.  The powers intended to be conferred on the Minister in this matter are chiefly such as will enable him to set in motion machinery which may lead to a hearing by the court, and it will rest with the court to make an Order for the winding-up of the company, if it sees fit to do so.</P>
    <P>The premium rates upon which the strongest and best-managed companies operate usually determine the ruling insurance rates.  There are, besides, certain agreements and undertakings as to rates to which most of the offices are parties.  These rates are generally sufficiently high to enable the stronger companies to make substantial profits. In case it should become necessary to intervene in the fixing of rates, with the object of preventing the exploitation of the insuring public, it is proposed <Col N="1715" /> that the Minister should be empowered, if, after consultation with the companies concerned, he should think proper to do so, to fix the rates of premium to be charged for any class of insurances to which the Bill applies other than life assurance and industrial assurance.</P>
    <P>Industrial assurance is governed by the Collecting Societies and Industrial Assurance Companies Act, 1896, and Section 36 of the Assurance Companies Act, 1909.  There are at present no collecting societies registered in the Saorstát, and here the business is carried on only by officers complying with the requirements of the Act of 1909.  Industrial assurance was, in the beginning, little more than insurance to provide for funeral expenses.  Its successful growth has been largely due to the adoption of a system of collecting premiums at the home of working-class people, whose circumstances render it difficult to save money from week to week out of their wages to pay premiums at quarterly or longer intervals.  As a rapidly-expanding enterprise, catering for the needs of the wage-earning classes, the business is essentially one that requires to be regulated and restricted by legislation. While the provisions of the Bill affecting this particular class of assurance are comprehensive and far-reaching, they do not involve any very drastic changes in the practice of the companies transacting such business.  In general, the system and method of industrial assurance business, as conducted in this country, are already largely in conformity with what are now proposed to be made matters of a statutory obligation.</P>
    <P>An important feature, however, is the establishment of the principle of State supervision.  The laws at present in force give the Minister no authority to intervene in disputes between industrial assurance companies and their policy holders.  Such disputes can at present be determined only in the courts and the cost of proceedings makes it difficult for the policy holders to contest disputed claims.  It is now proposed that the Minister should be empowered to determine disputes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1716" /> The Bill extends the permitted degrees of relationship between persons effecting industrial assurance policies and persons whose lives may be assured under such policies.  It proposes to validate certain classes of policies and to provide for the conversion of lapsing policies, under certain specified conditions, into free paid-up policies for reduced amounts.</P>
    <P>The public controversy which has grown up around the Bill has been concerned exclusively with the effect of the measure on the future of Irish insurance companies and their staffs, so much so, that the primary purpose of the measure&mdash;the protection of the public doing business with insurance companies&mdash;whether Irish or foreign&mdash; has been somewhat obscured.  It is for that reason that I have devoted my remarks in the first instance to that aspect of the Bill.  The Government, however, is vitally concerned to ensure that the growth of strong, stable and properly-conducted Irish offices will be fostered.  It has given the matter very careful and prolonged consideration and has arrived at the conclusion that the present Bill is the best means to that end, taking all factors into account.  Another type of measure is, of course, possible and was, in fact, at one stage contemplated by me&mdash;a measure to confine insurance business, or classes of insurance business, to qualified Irish offices only&mdash; and I propose to tell the Dáil in detail why such a measure was not considered advisable under present circumstances.</P>
    <P>It is necessary, however, in the first instance, to answer the criticisms which come only from certain limited quarters, the criticisms of those who contend, in the words of the <i>Irish Times</i>, that we should leave well enough alone; that insurance business, by its nature, must be carried on internationally, if it is to be carried on to the best advantage; that there are no countries in the world, outside Russia, in which British offices do not operate; and that we should confine our legislation to the protecting of the public, leaving Irish companies to get what business they can on their merits, without the State attempting to <Col N="1717" /> influence the volume of that business in any way, although the British Government itself, in its industrial assurance legislation, confines that business in the interests of its own citizens to British offices.  The accumulation of large reserves by assurance offices has a significance to which the State cannot remain indifferent.  A considerable proportion of the liquid wealth of this country is now subscribed to assurance offices in the form of annual premiums, and remains at the disposal of such offices for investment by them in whatever manner the managements of the offices in their discretion may think fit.</P>
    <P>Assurance offices can become the wealthiest of corporations.  They have the advantage that they can calculate with great precision the rate at which their liabilities fall due.  Unlike the banks, they do not undertake to pay out their liabilities upon call or short notice, and hence they are in a position to invest their funds in long-date securities.  Through their investment policy, they have power to exert a very potent influence upon the financial stability and credit of the country.  It is, therefore, desirable that the State should assist in securing that there should be established and maintained native offices, equipped with the necessary resources to undertake a large share of this important business, and that the whole business of insurance should be regulated by legislation to ensure conditions favouring orderly development along sound lines.</P>
    <P>In considering the manner in which State assistance to that end can best be afforded, it is perhaps desirable to deal separately with each branch of insurance business with which the Bill deals, regarding life assurance, ordinary and industrial, in one branch, and fire and accident business in the other.  In reviewing the position in respect of life assurance business, I think I can state first, as an important factor in the situation, that the great majority of the Irish people would prefer to place their life assurance business with Irish offices, subject to the condition <Col N="1718" /> that they can do so on the same terms and with the same degree of security as they can get from most of the external offices operating here.  I may say that the efficacy of the proposals in the Bill rests on the soundness of that assumption.  If the Irish public are at present placing their life assurance business for the most part with external offices, it is due primarily, if not solely, to the non-fulfilment of the condition I have referred to.  If my assumption is correct, then the task of reversing the existing condition and establishing new conditions in which the bulk of the Irish life assurance business will come to Irish offices is a matter of building up an Irish life assurance company or companies so strong and well managed and so secured against the possibility of failure, that no member of the public will have any hesitation in investing in its policies.</P>
    <P>Let it be clear that these remarks of mine are not made in any spirit of criticism of the persons responsible for the direction and management of the existing native institutions.  I have personally a great admiration for many of those Irishmen who have directed their energies to the business of insurance, and for their persistence in advancing the idea of national as against external enterprise in that field.  They have built up for the Irish offices a combined premium income for life and industrial business in the neighbourhood of £600,000 and, considering the handicaps under which they have laboured, that is a very noteworthy achievement.  The unequal terms on which they have to compete with external offices derive from several sources, the most obvious one being the matter of money and the great disparity between their limited funds and the vast resources available to their competitors.  Another factor is that, owing to their comparative recent formation, the Saorstát offices are still contending with many of the special difficulties which attend all insurance organisations in the early stages of their development.  Then <Col N="1719" /> there is the high ratio of administrative costs consequent upon the relatively small volume of business transacted by each separate company. Furthermore, there is the fact that the Irish companies commenced operations in the period of high post-war costs.  The older companies were built up at a time when costs of all kinds were very much lower than when the Irish companies were started.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps desirable to raise and answer forthwith the question, whether we should, under present conditions, legislate to transfer compulsorily all life assurance business to the Saorstát companies either by prohibiting external companies from doing such business here or by instituting a system of taxation which would have the same effect.  I say at once that no Government could undertake the risks associated with such a course.  It might easily result in heavy losses to many of our people and produce a very serious financial crisis.  If this Bill produces the effects that it is hoped and intended it shall produce, then it may well be practicable for some future Government to act in that wise.  But, it is the Government's considered opinion that, in existing conditions, other and less drastic means must be found to foster the growth of Saorstát life assurance companies.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to facilitate the merger of existing Irish life companies into amalgamated units with a view to effecting economies in their administration and in providing improved security for their policy holders.  As such amalgamation may be found to require financial support in the form of additional capital, it is proposed that, if amalgamation is effected in accordance with provisions set out in the Bill, the Minister for Finance may take shares in an amalgamated company.</P>
    <P>In view of statements which have appeared in the Press, it is necessary to emphasise that there are no powers being conferred to require compulsory amalgamation.  There are, however, compulsory powers under Part IV of <Col N="1720" /> the Bill, the existence of which may force companies, otherwise unwilling, to come into an amalgamation scheme. But these powers, it is to be noted, relate to the winding-up of insolvent companies.  The remarks of those who have expressed their views in the newspapers on the amalgamation provisions of the measure should be read in the light of these two facts.  It will not, I am sure, be seriously contended in this House that the Government should tranquilly allow an insolvent company to write new life assurance business. If there are insolvent Irish life offices or, for that matter, insolvent foreign offices operating here, some action in relation to them must be taken.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I wish to state another primary consideration which operated with the Government in the drafting of this Bill, and that is the obvious desirability, if it can be done, of ensuring the policy holders of the Saorstát life offices against loss.  The great majority, if not all, of these policy holders placed their business with Saorstát offices for patriotic reasons, at any rate, during the early stages of their operations.  It was the widespread public enthusiasm for the idea of national self-sufficiency which enabled these companies to be launched.  They traded on that enthusiasm, and I mean no disparagement by that remark.  Having regard to those circumstances, and in the light of present conditions, the Government considers that it is justified in taking special measures to protect those policy holders and to ensure for them that their policies will be sound investments, if necessary by the transfer of the liability on them from the company which issued them to a new and stronger company emerging from an amalgamation scheme.  If there are now, or should at any time exist, insolvent Irish life assurance companies, the situation which they create must be dealt with, and it seems to me that there are only three practicable alternative courses: (1) to wind them up, distributing the available assets proportionately amongst their creditors; (2) to introduce a special measure compulsorily to write down <Col N="1721" /> their liabilities on their policies in accordance with their assets; and (3) the course adopted in the Bill. Of these alternative courses, that adopted by the Government is far preferable to any of the others.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that amalgamation may result in the wholesale dismissal of staffs of the amalgamating companies, but this suggestion is entirely without foundation.  I do not think that the provisions of this Bill will result in any number of persons losing employment and it is my intention that persons who are dependent for their livelihoods on insurance employment and who are affected by the measure will be fairly dealt with. If, however, it should at any time come to a choice between the continued employment of the staff of any company and the protection of the policy holders of that company against loss, there will be only one choice possible.</P>
    <P>The Government hopes that as a result of the operation of Parts III and IV of the Bill, there will emerge a strong Irish life assurance company or companies backed by the State to whatever extent may be necessary, and able to command on merit the bulk of the business originating in the Saorstát. It recommends these provisions to the Dáil, confident that these hopes will be justified.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps desirable to emphasise, even at the expense of repetition, that, in case discussion on this Bill here may create doubts in the minds of policy holders of existing Saorstát companies as to the security of their investments, that Part III of the Bill is designed to secure for them that they will receive from a company established as a result of the operation of its provisions, policies for the same amounts as those which they now hold, if the company which issued them is involved in an amalgamation scheme, whether that company is or is not actuarially solvent at the present time.</P>
    <P>In respect of general insurance business, different considerations apply. At first sight it would seem a comparatively less difficult matter to give Saorstát companies a monopoly of general insurance business arising in the Saorstát, <Col N="1722" /> than in the case of life business, and, from a purely legislative point of view, such is undoubtedly the case. Again, however, it is a question whether the gains to be secured are proportionate to the risks involved and whether the desired aim cannot be achieved in a manner which avoids the risks.  The aim is to secure that to the maximum extent practicable Irish insurance business will be done by national companies, but there are strong objections on grounds of public interest to attempting to secure this aim immediately by the exclusion of external companies from this field.  It is the duty of the Government to ensure, when promoting insurance legislation, that, no matter what changes are produced by such legislation, there will be adequate insurance facilities for those desiring them.  If the strong external companies now doing this business in the Saorstát are excluded from that field, it cannot be said that the resources of the existing Saorstát offices are sufficient to guarantee that such adequate facilities will be available. Whether new companies would be formed and what their results would be, only the future could tell, while the problem would be an immediate one.  The results of the adoption of such a course might well prove very damaging not merely to national interests in general and to Irish insurers but also to the Saorstát insurance companies themselves.</P>
    <P>Take the example of fire insurance. The total fire premium income contributed by the Saorstát to companies doing that business here is, roughly, about £1,000,000.  If we assume that the premiums amount on the average to 5/- per cent. of the sums assured, the total risk covered must be about £400,000,000.  If that business is confined to companies whose business is limited to the Saorstát, a bad experience in any year would certainly cause them serve financial distress, and if they had not had ample time in which to build up large reserves, might possibly make them insolvent.  A catastrophe, the risk of which is always associated with fire business&mdash;the burning down of a large part of the commercial or industrial quarters of one <Col N="1723" /> of our cities&mdash;even if the companies had quite substantial reserves and reinsurance, would almost certainly cause a crash.  Apart from the catastrophe risk, the same considerations apply to other classes of general insurance business.</P>
    <P>Again, it can be said that these conditions may change considerably, if the present Bill operates in the manner hoped for and intended, and a future Government might well be able to legislate for the exclusion of external companies from these classes of insurance business.  In fact, the purpose behind the present proposals is to assist the Saorstát companies to build up their reserves, and to put them in a position in which they could, with greater justification than they can now show, ask the Saorstát Government to legislate to confine these classes of business to them.</P>
    <P>The proposals of the Government for fostering the growth and development of Saorstát offices in respect of the classes of insurance business, other than life, with which this Bill deals centre around Part VI of the measure which contains provisions for the establishment, with State assistance, of a reinsurance company to be called the Reinsurance Company of Ireland, Ltd.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that every licensed company, Saorstát or foreign, shall enter into reinsurance treaties with the Reinsurance Company ceding a proportion of its Irish reinsurance business. The terms of the Treaty and the proportion of the business to be ceded will be agreed by the board of the company.  The company will at its own option cede risks reinsured with it giving preference to the Saorstát companies wherever practicable.  As all treaties at present granted are reciprocal, it will be seen that the external companies will be giving up a portion of their business by ceding to the Reinsurance Company unless the Company enters into reciprocal treaties.  In this way a certain amount of the Irish business and the profit attaching thereto will pass into Irish hands.  This method will provide <Col N="1724" /> proper insurance facilities in general and for compulsory insurance in particular, and the business ceded to the Saorstát companies will help them to establish themselves.  When this stage is reached the advantage of a Saorstát company over an external company in securing Saorstát business will, it is believed, enable them to obtain a proper share of that business, and expedite the arrival of the day on which the limitation of the business to Saorstát companies will be practicable.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary at this stage of the discussion on the Bill to go into greater detail in explaining its provisions.  I have stated the main purposes of the Bill and the manner in which it proposes those purposes shall be accomplished.  The Bill is the product of prolonged consideration by the Government, and I am satisfied that it is sound in principle and as reasonably sound in detail as it was possible to make it.  Nobody can accuse the Government of being unduly hesitant about affording protection and assistance to Saorstát commercial and industrial enterprises and it approached the consideration of the question of insurance with a keen desire to promote the development of strong Irish assurance companies capable of attracting and retaining the bulk of the assurance business of the Saorstát.  This Bill is the result.</P>
    <P>The amendment in the name of Deputy McGilligan which is to be moved to the Second Reading is one which the Government cannot accept. It is possible that the tabling of the amendment was a matter of parliamentary tactics rather than the submission of a reasonable alternative to the proposed legislation dealing with insurance business at the present time. The examination of the problems relating to insurance in Ireland has proceeded for a long time.  Since the report of the Inter-Departmental Committee of 1923 to the Government the law which operated in Great Britain and here with regard to insurance has been frequently amended in Great Britain, but no legislative changes have been effected here. These legislative changes are long <Col N="1725" /> overdue.  Committees of one kind or another have examined aspects of this problem both under the previous Government and the present Government, and it is considered that no useful result could come from the setting up of a select committee such as is proposed; whereas the activities of that committee and the inquiries which it would undertake might have very serious consequences indeed. The Bill which is before the House represents the conclusions of the Government as to how best the problems associated with insurance in the Saorstát can be dealt with and it is considered unlikely that any more satisfactory set of proposals would emerge as a result of the deliberations of such a select committee as is proposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Deputy McGilligan, I move:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after the word &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;the Dáil declines to give a Second Reading to the Insurance Bill, 1935, until a select committee with power to send for persons, papers, and records be appointed to inquire into the whole question of insurance and to report what changes, if any, in the law are necessary and desirable.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may say that we are of opinion that the time is not inappropriate to take whatever legislative steps may be necessary in order to consolidate the position of Irish insurance; but we believe, in order that that may effectively be done, so complex a problem as the general question of insurance in this country requires close examination and the persons called upon to deal with it from a legislative point of view should be afforded the opportunity of hearing the evidence of experts and interested parties in order that the pitfalls of so complex a problem should be manifest, that the interests which are likely to be affected should be fully understood, that the position of policy holders versus insurance companies should be thoroughly grasped by those whose duty it will be to legislate and, lastly, that while showing every <Col N="1726" /> solicitude for the legitimate interests of policy holders, the legitimate interests of those who have spent their lives in building up the insurance business of this country should not be ruthlessly sacrificed.</P>
    <P>The Bill seems to us to contain amalgamation proposals which are going to bear most unfairly on the employees of the insurance companies and it is right for Deputies to remember that while the managers and directors of insurance play a very great part in building up an industry of this kind, it is the men out in the fields who build up the books and command the confidence of the public with whom they are in touch, who do the spade work, and have done the spade work in building up the existing insurance machine that we have in this country.  As we see it, the amalgamation proposals contained in this Bill must inevitably result in a considerable number of those employees being dispensed with, and while the Minister declares to-day in his introductory remarks that he is resolved that these employees will be fairly dealt with, he does not elaborate that.  What does he mean?  Does he mean to give an undertaking that he will see that any employee who loses employment is adequately compensated at the expense of the Central Exchequer?</P>
    <P>Deputies must realise this, that we are dealing here with an entirely different problem from that which was involved when we were considering national health insurance.  There is no fund available to the Irish insurance offices out of which displaced employees could be fairly compensated. It was possible to arrange for compensation terms for the redundant employees of the approved societies under the National Health Insurance Act and to charge that on the funds of the Unified Society.  No such funds are available to the Irish insurance companies on which to charge compensation arising from the displacement of employees.  I think the Minister might have dealt more frankly with the House and told us what he meant when he said he was determined they would be fairly dealt <Col N="1727" /> with.  Not only have you to consider the problem of the employees who will be deprived of employment, but you have to consider the position of the insurance agent who bought a book for a valuable consideration.  Let us suppose that under an agreement such as is envisaged in this Bill he is no longer permitted to carry out the work of collecting premiums.  Who is going to compensate him for the actual money which he paid for the book which is now the source of this income?  We believe the proposals in the Bill are calculated to operate inequitably in that direction and we cannot see that an arrangement can be arrived at to avoid that without full and careful inquiry.</P>
    <P>These amalgamation proposals seem to us, on the facts laid before us, to be premature.  People are prone to compare the solvency, the strength and the wealth of British, German, and French companies with that of the Irish companies, unfavourably to the Irish companies.  I will ask Deputies to remember that some of the wealthiest insurance companies in the world to-day consisted of one man sitting in a room paying the claims out of the premiums as they came in just 50 years ago, and insurance companies of so humble a commencement as that 50 or 60 years ago are to-day some of the greatest financial institutions in the world.  Our insurance companies have only had ten or fifteen years wherein to consolidate their position. I venture to say the vast majority of Irish insurance companies compare very favourably in their financial standing with the greatest financial institutions in the world if they were examined at the same period of their development.</P>
    <P>It is necessary for Deputies to remember that no insurance company, from the very nature of its business, can start off with a flourish.  It has to build itself up slowly; it is of the very essence of the business that that should happen.  It is necessary and good that the position of an insurance company should be slowly and solidly consolidated.  That is what is happening in the case of the Irish insurance <Col N="1728" /> companies, and without close investigation we feel that amalgamation proposals of the drastic character envisaged in the Bill are premature and are of a panicky nature for which there is no necessity.  We believe that patience and possibly a little paternalism by the Government, a readiness on the part of the Government to stand over Irish insurance companies during the initial period of their development, would be quite adequate and would render unnecessary drastic amalgamation proposals such as are suggested in this measure.</P>
    <P>The last thing I have to say with regard to amalgamation is that we consider the method whereby the Minister proposes to provide additional finance to amalgamated companies is thoroughly unsound.  The Minister, when introducing this Bill, said that where there is an amalgamation and an apparent temporary deficit the Government are prepared to advance certain moneys in exchange for ordinary shares.  That means that if the Government are going to get ordinary shares in exchange for the money they advance, they are going to become in some cases a controlling partner in the enterprise.</P>
    <P>I have the greatest respect for the integrity and ability of the Civil Service in this country; but I have a healthy distrust and horror of the bureaucratic passion for interference. Irish insurance men have built up the Irish insurance in this country.  If the Government deems it their duty to intervene, by way of legislative supervision, this House should not allow the Government, not only to supervise the insurance business, but, effectively, to control it as well.  From the facts as laid before us it appears clear that the way in which the money should be advanced would be by debentures, so that the Government would be assured of whatever advance they made in a reasonable time.  At the same time an attempt should be made to build up the business of the future in the hands, and effective control, of the business men who understood and promoted it, and who, unless I am much mistaken, have no desire to hand it over to <Col N="1729" /> civil servants no matter how competent or conscientious.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the whole essence of the proposals, that is the effort to separate the life business on the one hand, and the fire and accident on the other.  I am not clear as to the exact meaning of the Minister's intention as to marine and boiler insurance, but I do not think that much of that business is done by Irish companies.  It was not clear as to whether he would allow fire and boiler insurance to be carried on by life insurance companies. If he proposes to put life insurance in one company, and to put the other branches of insurance in other companies I submit that that is a most inequitable proposal and for this reason: You are going to prevent any Irish company from doing two classes of business, whereas you are leaving the external companies free to do them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The same applies to the external companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the Minister knows that for a long time most of the English companies could do life business through parent companies and employ subsidiaries to do fire, accident and marine business.  They are at present doing that, and there is nothing to prevent them going on doing it under this Bill.  So that the effect of this legislation is that you are going to prevent any Irish company doing a dual class of business but, in effect, you allow external companies, in England, in Germany and in France, engaged in this business, to do fire and accident and life business as well.  It appears to us that that is a most unsatisfactory arrangement, and one that should not commend itself to Oireachtas Eireann. It is to avoid such incidents as that that we feel this Bill should be submitted to committee with power to send for persons and papers so that difficulties of that kind might be overcome, and a more reasonable method evolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, it appears to me that where you have, at the present time, one company doing fire and accident and life, to divide that into two involves very greatly increased expenditure. <Col N="1730" /> Where you have one office for life and fire, at the present time, if you compel that office to divide up into two head offices certain steps will be necessary.  It may be, that after investigation of that aspect of the problem, a case might be made to show that the increased expenditure would not be so great, and it is to ascertain facts of that kind that we think a committee would be necessary.</P>
    <P>Another fact that emerges upon which it would be extremely difficult to get information except in the way we suggest, is that Irish companies, under this Bill, seem to be called upon to make far more elaborate returns to the Department of Industry and Commerce than any external company. External companies are required to make no further returns than are required by the insurance or governing authority of their own company. Whatever satisfies Great Britain for British companies, or whatever satisfies Germany for German companies, will satisfy the Department of Industry and Commerce for those companies here.  But Irish companies must furnish a very exhaustive and expensive series of returns which are going to involve them in considerable expense, and to put them under heavy obligations which their competitors, in the same business, do not seem to have.  It appears to us that is an unreasonable proposal and, while we are satisfied that the Irish companies are prepared to make any return the Government feels necessary, we feel that external companies should be prepared to make identical returns in respect of their Saorstát business.  Unless that is so it means that there is a differentiation between the external companies and the Irish companies which is unfair and inequitable to Irish companies.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the reinsurance proposals.  On the face of them these proposals are impracticable and must, inevitably, break down.  In our opinion they would jeopardise the existence of any fire and accident company established in this country. As I understand it, when a fire and accident company accepts a risk of any kind, the situation is this: they have already negotiated a treaty, <Col N="1731" /> either with another group of companies or with Lloyds.  The terms of the treaty are that the fire and accident company will retain, for their own account, say 20 per cent. of any risk they underwrite, and the remaining 80 per cent. of the risk will be divided up amongst the other companies under the treaty.  If I go to an insurance company to-morrow morning, and ask them to cover a risk for £100,000, and they give me a cover note, at the moment the cover note is given to me, and my risk is covered, the treaty between them and the other companies comes into operation, and the risk becomes the liability of the companies associated by treaty with them.  If my premises were destroyed the following morning, although the other companies had never heard of the risk incurred, they would be liable for £80,000 of that risk, and the parent company with whom I transacted the insurance business would only be liable for £20,000 because their overriding treaty operated all the time to relieve them of the agreed percentage of every risk.  Now the reinsurance proposal here is that every such proposal must be offered to the Irish company, and on the face of the Bill it appears that if the reinsurance corporation of Ireland, which it is proposed to set up, pauses say for a week to examine the merits of a reinsurance proposal, the company which effects the insurance has to carry the entire risk while the reinsurance corporation is examining it.  A company that could safely carry £20,000's worth of the risk, and would ordinarily relay to its associates 80 per cent. of a £100,000 risk, may find itself in the position now that it accepts a £100,000 risk on Monday; it asks the reinsurance corporation of Ireland to take 80 per cent of that risk off its hands; the reinsurance corporation says: &ldquo;We must examine this proposal;&rdquo; the building insured burns down on Tuesday, and the company that made the first insurance is obliged to find £100,000 to discharge the risk.</P>
    <P>That is one point, and it seems to me to be one of the utmost possible <Col N="1732" /> gravity, but there is another problem involved in this position.  Suppose the reinsurance corporation says to an Irish company: &ldquo;You have offered us this morning five risks.  We will take four of them but the fifth we do not care for.&rdquo;  That insurance company has to go out and try to reinsure that risk on the insurance market of the world, and it cannot do it.  It cannot start that search for reinsurance until the reinsurance corporation of Ireland has rejected the risk.  It goes to Lloyds and asks: &ldquo;Who is ready to reinsure my risk in respect of this fifth contract of insurance?&rdquo; Lloyds say to themselves: &ldquo;Well, if the reinsurance corporation of Ireland have refused it there must be something groggy,&rdquo; and the company has got to take what terms it can get to relieve itself of the risk in respect of that fifth contract of insurance, if the reinsurance corporation of Ireland declines to carry it.  Surely, proposals of that kind cannot commend themselves to the House.  Surely so delicate a problem as that of reinsurance deserves close investigation, with experts, by those of us who are concerned to legislate in a matter of such complexity as this.  Nobody will pretend that in a democratic country you could expect every member of the Oireachtas to familiarise himself with every detail of a highly technical measure such as the Insurance Bill is, but our suggestion is that when confronted with a Bill of this character the proper thing to do is to invite Deputies of all sides of the House to choose from their members certain individuals who are prepared to study a problem of this character, and to let there be a joint recommendation from them all, advised by experts, and strengthened by having heard all the interests concerned, so that the House will feel that whatever recommendations come forward in respect of matters such as this reinsurance proposal are the best that could have been got even if the experts and interested parties had been allowed to come to the bar of the House and make their case to each individual Deputy.</P>
    <P>Now I want to refer to a new principle which is introduced into insurance <Col N="1733" /> in this country by this Bill, and that is the principle that the Minister is to be substituted for the courts of law in disputes arising between insured parties and insurance companies. I warn this House that if you permit the development of a tendency which is manifesting itself in this country to sweep the courts of law to one side and to constitute the Minister&mdash;who is by the very nature of his office a politician, in the midst of political tumult&mdash;the judge and jury and final Court of Appeal in litigation between one citizen and another of this State, the greatest possible evils will accrue.  The Minister says that he proposes to adopt this new procedure in order to save expense.  If the Minister considers that the expenses of the law courts are excessive, or are operating to keep poor people out of them, then he ought to insist on his colleagues introducing such legislation as may be necessary to bring down the costs of the law courts.  It is a monstrous thing to say that the rich man in this country shall have the right to go into the law courts, and have the benefit of the judges and Bar in settling his claims upon his neighbour, whereas the poor man must do with the rough and ready justice that is dispensed in Government buildings.  There must be equality before the law for all classes of the community if there is to be good law.  If a poor man has an industrial policy he is just as much entitled to justice in respect of that policy as the gentleman who has insured his life for £100,000.  He is just as much entitled to go into the highest courts of this country, and to have his case heard with as much attention and as much care as that of the man who insures his life for £100,000.  It may seem to Deputies at first that the Minister in his benevolence is going to spare the poor litigant expenses, but no greater evil could be set up in this country.  If the law is too expensive for the poor, then reduce the cost of the law; but it is bad, it is unsound, and it is unjust that the man who has plenty of money should have the courts of law available to him, whereas the man who is scraping and saving in order <Col N="1734" /> to carry on a small industrial policy on his life or the life of his relatives should be denied the justice of the courts, and told that he will have to do with the decision of the Minister, which shall be final and from which there is no appeal.  That is not justice and ought not to be allowed to go on.</P>
    <P>On those several grounds which I have outlined, I submit that an ample case has been made for a more exhaustive examination of the whole problem than appears to have been made.  The Minister said that he did not think this was the appropriate stage to go into greater detail.  If this is not the appropriate stage to go into the greatest detail, I do not know when he proposes to do it, unless he has developed the same disease that his leader has got, and that is that he will never say anything when anyone can answer him. We are all familiar with the fact that the President, when introducing a Bill in respect of his Department, gets up, mumbles for five minutes, and then sits down.  Then the chief whip of the Government Party is rushing around to know if we will provide an hour and a half for the President to wind up the debate, because, like a woman, he wants the last word.  I hope that is not contagious, and that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is not developing this feminine quality of thirsting for the last word.  He skipped lightly over the power he proposes to take to fix premiums.  How he justifies that we have not heard. Apparently, he did not think it suitable to elaborate on that question.  The proposals in the Bill are certainly of a character that do not recommend themselves to us.  They are also a problem which would do with investigation. Frankly, I do not feel competent to give this Bill the consideration it deserves unless and until I have heard the views of those people who are actively engaged in the industry; unless I had an opportunity of hearing the views of those whose interests are going to be involved; unless I had an opportunity of hearing the insurance actuaries, who are familiar with all the technicalities of the quinquennial valuations, the basis upon which those valuations can be made, and their <Col N="1735" /> relative importance as an indication of a company's solvency.  I do not believe there are a dozen Deputies in this House who, without the procedure which we ask for, are capable of giving a Bill of this character the consideration and discussion which it deserves. We are going to do something in respect to the business of this country that may involve its very existence. We are going to do something that may imperil, for hundreds of men and women in this country, their means of livelihood.  We are going to do something that may decide for all time, certainly for our time, whether Irish insurance is going to be a prosperous business or not.  We should not embark on that task if we are not fully competent to do so.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to say one last word which the Minister I am sure will endorse.  When legislation of this character comes before the House it may give rise to questions in the minds of a lot of people up and down the country as to what is behind all this.  Has some crisis arisen in insurance business in Ireland that requires drastic and dramatic treatment? I think the Minister will endorse me when I say that while it is necessary that the Government should modernise insurance conditions in this country and bring them more or less into line with those obtaining in every other country, there is no real ground for any anxiety on the part of anyone as to the immediate solvency and soundness of the insurance industry as a whole in this country and that once the Government has put its hand to regularising the position, there will emerge, we hope, from our deliberations such arrangements as will result in an insurance industry in this country which will be as solid and as solvent as the insurance industry of any country in the world.  I would press most strongly on the Minister that he should reconsider what he said about the amendment we have put down. We have put it down with a desire to help, with a desire to turn out a good body of legislation in connection with insurance.  We honestly do not <Col N="1736" /> believe that this House is competent to do that, unless and until it has the information and the assistance with which the committee that we adumbrate is in a position to provide it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose as regards the general principles that underlie this Bill we should all be in agreement. I take it that nobody would object to the statement of the Minister that insurance companies operating in Ireland should be perfectly solvent and above suspicion. I think we would all agree with the Minister that if he requires additional powers to supervise insurance companies operating in this country those should be given.  But when one comes to the details of how that object is to be arrived at I am afraid there will be a considerable divergence of opinion.  The Minister seems to think that if we pass legislation everything will be all right.  I should like to urge upon the Minister that supervision is more necessary than breaking up insurance companies into compartments. The Minister is quite right when he says that the funds of a life insurance company should not be allowed to be used in other directions, but there is no doubt that many insurance companies, and other businesses too, find that operating with Irish costs at English standards of business is a very difficult matter. I am afraid that this idea of dividing life and industrial insurance from other forms of insurance is only going to increase the cost of running an insurance company.  There can be no doubt that there is economy in having one board of directors, one manager and various other reforms, but I think that if an insurance company is going to the bad, it will go to the bad in spite of being a separate company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has mentioned that there were three courses open to the Government in dealing with an insurance company that is insolvent and that he adopted the one that appeared most feasible, namely, to amalgamate it with another insurance company, and if the amalgamated company be short of capital, the Government or <Col N="1737" /> the Minister for Finance will advance shares.  That is not a course that would commend itself either to the business or the investing public at large.  Take the case of two traders, side by side, and say that one of them had obviously become bankrupt, while his next-door neighbour was in a prosperous condition.  What is the remedy proposed?  That some fairy-godmother should come along and say, &ldquo;Now, you two people ought to amalgamate and I shall provide you with additional capital to run the business.&rdquo;  There are two objectionable features in that.  There must, obviously, be some fundamental error or errors in the manner in which the trader who had become bankrupt had carried on his business.  Yet he is going to be put on equal terms with his next-door neighbour and additional capital is going to be provided. That looks rather like watering the existing assets which in the case of one party were not what they were represented to be.  That is the position suggested by amalgamating a solvent and an insolvent insurance company, providing additional watered capital and regarding the amalgamated company as a solvent company.  I have very grave doubts as to whether the insolvent element brought into the new company will not make the whole body insolvent.  That is an aspect of trading that I should like the Minister to consider very carefully before that part of the Bill becomes law.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned to Wednesday, December 4th, 1935.</P>

    <Title>Private Deputies' Business. - Demonstration Farms&mdash;Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that the Department of Agriculture should run several farms in each county under the direction and supervision of its agricultural instructors, independent of all other activities, on which decent wages would be paid, accounts kept and audited, balance sheets published <Col N="1738" /> with appropriate explanations of costings, profits, etc., for the purpose of demonstrating to farmers in a practical way how to make their industry pay.&mdash;(Deputies Patrick McGovern, Timothy J. O'Donovan.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last day this motion was before the House I put forward various reasons in favour of its adoption. One reason was that some of the methods by which the Department of Agriculture tries to educate the farming community were defective.  For that reason I wish a change over to the system which I recommend.  There are various defects in the Department's method.  I could give many examples of that, but I merely took one to illustrate my point. I was dealing with the exhibition that was held at the Spring Show in 1934. Two lots of cattle were shown there. I gave the figures dealing with the ration that was recommended for them. The result appeared to be that there was a loss of 4d. per head on each animal without taking into account the cost of the hay, the crushed oats, and the silage fed to them over a period of 112 days.  That worked out at 7 cwt. hay, 28 cwt. of silage and 2 cwt. crushed oats.  When you add the loss of 4d. sustained on the best lot of cattle and the 5/4 loss on the other lot to the cost of all this food that was consumed &mdash;I leave it to any Deputy or to the Minister to put any value he likes upon 7 cwt. hay, 28 cwt. silage and 2 cwt. of crushed oats&mdash;you get some idea of the total loss on each animal.  If you multiply that by 48 you get the loss for 112 days on a farm carrying 48 cattle. Again, if you multiply that by three, you get the annual loss approximately upon the running of the farm, according to the experiment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I propose to leave that subject. It may be said that the Department, perhaps, did not recommend that course, but there was nothing shown at that exhibition to say whether or not farmers should follow it.  They were not told not to follow that course, so that any farmer who came along was entitled to assume that the course was recommended when the exhibition <Col N="1739" /> was held and the results given.  I suggest that any farmer who would be foolish enough to put that course into practice would soon find himself in the bankruptcy court.  No thinking farmer would be so foolish as to adopt that course without giving it a little thought.  I think that any man who carefully considered it would come to the conclusion that there was no use any longer in following the instructions given by the Department.  Even though the Department gave ten useful demonstrations, I think the good they might do could be nullified by one such as that.</P>
    <P>If a farm such as I recommend were being run by the Department, I do not think that any one of its officers would be so incompetent or foolish as to adopt that method on it. Therefore, I recommend the adoption of practical education rather than education of that sort.  It is hard to understand why money should be spent in giving that sort of education to farmers.  It may be said that, if the course I recommend be adopted, the loss on the feeding of cattle, because you must have a mixed system of farming, will be counterbalanced by producing other commodities.  It may be said, for instance, why not grow wheat?  I agree that they would be entitled to grow wheat on these farms, but that they would not be entitled to grow more than what would be their proper quota.  We know that in this country we have 12,000,000 acres of arable land, and that 600,000 acres of wheat will supply all our needs; that we have no market for any more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We surely cannot discuss the Government's wheat policy on a motion to start experimental farms of this kind.  The agricultural policy of the Government cannot be traversed on this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to discuss the Government's wheat policy. What I mean is that the Department's experts will be entitled to grow wheat upon these farms for the purpose of giving demonstrations.  Suppose that they grow all wheat, all beet or some other crop on one of these farms, the ordinary farmers of the country could <Col N="1740" /> not follow suit.  They could not take that as their model, because then the farm would not be a model farm.  If every farmer grew nothing but wheat on his land, there would be no market for the wheat.  That is what I want to point out, and I think I am entitled to do that.  What I have in view in proposing this motion is that these model farms must be confined, to a certain extent, to the production of certain classes of agricultural commodities. Now, they are not entitled to put more than 5 per cent. of the land under wheat, because 5 per cent. of the arable land of the country will produce all the wheat that the country can consume. Therefore, for the purposes of demonstration, these farms would be entitled to put only 5 per cent. of the land under wheat.  That is the point that I want to make clear.  They must grow what there is a market for. Every other farmer must do likewise. The object of the demonstration farms is to give every farmer a chance to do exactly the same thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is entitled to charge in the accounts the monopoly prices realised for special quality seeds, special breeds of cattle, and fowl.  In that way, they would have an advantage over ordinary farmers for some years owing to the scarcity of these special seeds and breeds, and they might command a higher price than they would be justified in entering in the accounts.  That might be called a monopoly price, or a scarcity price, but it should be followed by the commercial price that would be commanded by these commodities by every farmer who raised produce of the same standard set up by the model farms.  I am mentioning that to show what is intended.  Otherwise some people might be making extraordinary profits that would not be obtainable by other farmers who adopted the same methods.  I wish to bring before the Minister some points that I think should not be lost sight of.  At the end of the year the accounts would be more impressive than all the speeches from political platforms or lectures delivered by the most competent agricultural instructors.  Such accounts would bring conviction to the farmers, and they would pay attention <Col N="1741" /> to them.  The accounts for the farms that are being run by the Department are not very impressive in that respect. I have the accounts that are furnished to this House for runninug these farms. Year after year we are asked to vote money to meet the expenses incurred by the Department in that respect.  I agree that there are many other activities on these farms and that they cannot be taken as a test.  Nevertheless, a bad impression is created when we see, for instance, that £6,011 is voted to Athenry farm to run it and to pay expenses for the year 1935-36. On the other side of the account there is a sum of £3,375, an Appropriation-in-Aid received from students' fees, sale of live stock, farm produce and rents.  Leaving out the item of students' fees, it is plain that the amount realised from the sale of farm stock and other produce was considerably less than £3,375.  When £3,375 is deducted from £6,011 there is a difference of £2,636 on the working of that one farm.  In other words, that £2,636 is a gift from the State for the running of that farm on up-to-date lines.  For Ballyhaise farm in County Cavan £5,855 was voted.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, surely we would be entitled to argue on this motion that the type of farms proposed to be set up would be more efficient than the type at present operated by the Department. It is because we are dissatisfied with the present system of demonstration <Col N="1742" /> farms that we are advocating the institution of the new system adumbrated in the motion.</P>

      <P>The Deputy spoke of demonstrations at the Royal Dublin Society's Show-grounds at Ballsbridge.  Surely that was not a demonstration farm.  I indicated then that he and other Deputies were likely to travel over other matters.  Now he is going in another direction by dragging in the entire administration of the Department of Agriculture.  I cannot allow that.  The proper place to do that is on the Estimate for the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  I think what I meant is understood, and I need not bother further in that respect.  It is fairly well known that on all the farms run by the Department there is a loss.  What I want is to have a profit shown on these farms at the end of the year.  Otherwise they are a complete failure.  There is no use in voting £1,000,000 to the Department for this work if they are not able to show by practical instruction and practical work that they are able to farm at a profit.  That is my view.  Unless they are able to make a profit, they are unable to teach agriculture because, after all, farming cannot go on unless there is a profit.  No business can be conducted without a profit.  Therefore, I am convinced that, unless there is a change in the method of teaching by the Department, they might as well scrap the whole machinery.  I am confident that the Department's officers are well able to teach.  They are quite competent to do this if they get a chance.  This motion would give them a chance to put into practice the theories they have been teaching.  If they got the chance and were able to set up a headline whereby every farmer could increase the value of the output of his farm by 10 per cent.&mdash; that, I think, would not be too much&mdash; by following the very best methods, Deputies can realise what that would mean to the country.  I am sure that there is no farmer who would not be very glad to increase the value of the produce of his farm by 10 per cent., <Col N="1744" /> 20 per cent. or 30 per cent.  Let us take it at the lowest figure.  If it is true that the value of the produce of a farm can be increased by 10 per cent., what would that mean to the farmer and to the country?  Taking the last three normal years, 1929, 1930 and 1931, we find that the average value of our agricultural exports was £31,816,421.  That was the average value for the last three normal years. We have to add to that the value of the produce consumed at home.  The figure for that would be about the same, so that the value of our agricultural produce over the last three normal years would be about £63,000,000.</P>

That money would circulate throughout the country and every section of the people would benefit, while the nation as a whole would also benefit.  It would increase the taxable capacity of the country and put money into circulation, because the people who would get this additional money would part with it again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The argument made by Deputy McGovern is designed to show that the nation would benefit by these demonstration farms.  He argues that, if the farmers can be shown better methods of husbandry, they will get a better return.  He estimates that additional return at £6,000,000, and he argues that that will be to the advantage of the State as a whole.

      <P>I am not accustomed to rope-walking or wire-walking, and I am being confined within very narrow limits.  I do not want to enlarge on the matter, but I have shown that if this motion were passed, it would benefit every section in the country and would increase the national wealth by over £6,000,000.  That is on the basis of a 10 per cent. increase in production. It might result in a greater increase.  This is a proposal well worth consideration in difficult times such as we are now passing through.  If so much value attaches to a couple of hundred little factories set up in this State&mdash;I do not despise them; they are a benefit to the State&mdash;just imagine the benefit that would ensure to the country if the prosperity of 400,000 factories were increased.  Every farm in the country is really a factory.  Four hundred thousand thriving factories would put a couple of hundred little factories in the background.  The Minister for Agriculture would have done the best day's work he has ever done for this country if, by adopting this scheme, he increased the production of these <Col N="1746" /> 400,000 factories by even 10 per cent. That would be the greatest achievement than any Minister for Agriculture could boast of.  It would give an opportunity to the people, as a whole, to see whether agriculture was a paying proposition under present conditions or under any conditions.  It would remove from this House one of the greatest causes of obstruction, because half the time since I came to this House has been wasted in discussing the conditions of agriculture, whether farmers are prosperous or not, and whether this policy or that policy is the better policy for farmers.  If this motion were given effect, it would prove things in an unmistakable manner and would bring to an end all these discussions on undecided issues not only in this House but in every farmhouse and at every cross roads, dance and ceilidhe in the country.  This proposal would decide the matter once and for all, and I hope the Minister and every member of the House will decide to give it a fair trial.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great pleasure in supporting this motion, which is a perfectly reasonable one.  The Government have embarked during the last three or four years on a new policy for the farmers.  I think that it is only reasonable that we should ask the Government by this motion, which is a very simple one, to show the people that agriculture can be made a paying proposition as a result of the change of policy.  It is laid down in the motion that decent wages should be paid to the workers, that accounts should be kept and audited, and that balance sheets should be published, with appropriate explanations of costings, profits and so forth.  I should like to ask that, in carrying out those experiments, the Government would take notice of the different kinds of farms in this country.  The Government seem to be very much in favour of farmers who can grow wheat, beet and tobacco. I put down a question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce a few days ago, and in his reply he said that in 1934 there were 55,597 people who grew wheat in this country, and that <Col N="1747" /> in 1935 there were 75,321 people who grew wheat.  Everybody knows, however, that there are 450,000 farmers in this country, and I say that a very big section of them are not in a position to grow wheat.  In a great many cases they are hardly able to grow potatoes enough to maintain themselves, and I say that, in carrying out this, if the Government are prepared to accept it, they should take all those cases into consideration.</P>
      <P>I was speaking to a man a couple of days ago from County Kildare and I said to him: &ldquo;Did you grow wheat this year?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;I did; I grew&rdquo;&mdash;I forget how many acres he told me he grew, but he should have got about £115 out of it.  He said that he would grow some more this year.  I said: &ldquo;What are you going to do with the land next year?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;Oh, to hell with the land.  It is no good anyway.&rdquo; I wanted to know how he was going to manure the land, because it is very necessary to manure the land so as to keep it in good condition, and I must say that it is to the credit of the farmers of this country that they always went in for a policy that would tend to improve the land rather than to reduce its value.  The Government claim that their policy is a more profitable policy for the people than the policy that was in existence before they came into office.  Deputy Corry told us a week or so ago that there was a great change in the views of the farmers in East Cork in the last six months.  In carrying out these experiments, I say that, in order to make fair comparisons, instructors, in calculating the value of cattle, should put down what would be the value of the cattle in the British market without deducting the tariff.  In order to have a fair experiment, I think it would be only right that that should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is just the same with regard to pork.  I was speaking to a shopkeeper here within the last month, who had a shop in the North of Ireland and one outside the Border.  He told me that the price of pork in Northern Ireland was 57/2 and that there was a higher grade for which the price was 60/2. On this side of the Border, I understand, the price is 8/- less.  That would <Col N="1748" /> mean that, in every cwt. and a half, the people in the North have an advantage of 12/-.  Take the case of indian meal mixture also.  Across the Border it is £4 10s. and on our side of the Border the price is £7.  That means that in every cwt. of feeding stuffs there is half-a-crown a cwt. of a difference. Dr. Ryan said in this House on one occasion that it took 6 cwts. of feeding stuffs to fatten a pig.  That would be a difference of 15/- in the feeding stuffs, and taking with that the difference of 12/- in the price of the pig, it would mean that the farmer here is at a disadvantage of 27/- on every pig as compared with the farmer in the North of Ireland or Britain.</P>
    <P>I am not trying to take any political advantage with regard to this question. I think it is only fair to the people of this country, when agriculture is the main industry in this country, that the Government, as I have often put it to them before, should set up a commission and find out the real position with regard to this question.  Dr. Ryan seems to care for nobody except a man who is able to grow wheat or barley, but I myself think that, in justice to the people who have not land to grow these crops, they should not be fleeced. As the former Minister for Agriculture said in this House on several occasions, he did not stand for growing grain as a cash crop but for the purpose of feeding stock on the land and walking it off into the market.  I think that is a perfectly reasonable and feasible proposition on our part.  Last Saturday, I was in a fair in Ballyvourney and the people got a bit soft towards the evening, and one chap&mdash;a supporter of the Government&mdash;said: &ldquo;Will you come along and discuss this situation now?&rdquo; The other chap said: &ldquo;Tell me, are you better-off now than you were two years ago?&rdquo; He answered: &ldquo;I admit I am not.&rdquo;  I think it would be only reasonable for the Minister for Agriculture to consult that man and some more of his own supporters, who could not be accused of being prejudiced, and in that way he might be enabled to get some sense of justice.</P>

      <P>I read the motion all right, but I do not think it is fair to take the position as it stands without taking the whole condition of the farming industry up and down the country into consideration.  I think that the system before the Minister came into office should be considered also as compared with the present system in the country, and I think myself that, if the Minister does establish those farms, it is only reasonable that that should be taken into consideration, because there is no doubt that he is forcing his policy on the farmers of this country, and if he can show that farming under this policy can be made a paying proposition, there is nobody who will be more anxious to welcome it than your humble servant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Holohan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support this motion standing on the Order Paper in the names of Deputies McGovern and O'Donovan.  I do believe that demonstration farms of this sort would be of the greatest advantage to the farming community. First of all, I should like to see the work taken over by the agricultural instructors, or by somebody selected by the Minister for Agriculture, who, he thinks, would be in a position to <Col N="1750" /> give us information that would lead us to the position of being able to make our farms pay under present conditions.  That is why I am in favour of these demonstration farms. In the past, I may say that we got a good deal of useful information and instruction from the agricultural instructors in the country, and farmers who gave special attention to the information and instruction given by those instructors got quite decent returns from their information. However, with regard to the manner in which demonstration plots have been run in the past, I do think a big improvement could be made in that direction by asking these instructors now to take over farms of their own and work them in such a way as would be an education to us from the point of view of improvement and in such a way as that at the end of the year they would be able to meet their liabilities and obligations.  That is what we cannot do at present and that is our trouble.  Even the best farmers in this country are complaining to me that they cannot pay their way or meet their obligations because of the present agricultural policy of the Government.  We want a change, and the change is necessary.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to agree to this motion and to set up a number of farms in the different counties.  I do not ask him to go into it in a large way; he could have one or two farms in each county worked and managed by agricultural instructors or some other person who he thinks might be able to enlighten us as to the best means of working our farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When he had taken over one of these farms, we would like to see how he would lay out that farm; how many acres he would till; how many he would meadow; and how many he would graze; what number of stock he could keep on the farm, with their breeding, feeding and keep, so that, at the end of the year, he could prove to us that his up-to-date methods would give such a return as would enable him to pay his way.  We could do many things on our farms which would make them look more up to <Col N="1751" /> date, so that others looking at them would say: &ldquo;This farm is well managed and well kept&rdquo;; but on account of weather conditions and want of capital we cannot work our farms to the best advantage for ourselves and for our children and to the best advantage for this country.</P>
    <P>I should like to see mixed farming carried out on these demonstration farms if the Minister decided to take them over, so that farmers who are more or less on tillage land, as well as those on the better class land, grazing and dairying land, would have an opportunity of seeing how to breed, and to feed and to get the best results from cattle, sheep and pigs and from tillage of the land.  The rotation of crops is very important and, to begin with, I should like to see the agricultural instructor going into a field and marking it out and ploughing it so as to get the best results from the crop to be sown there.  I should like to see the number of yards between the different furrows, the breadth of the furrows and the breadth of the centres, and how that would be done by some of the agricultural instructors and by some of the people who are fond of instructing us day after day on how to manage our farms.</P>
    <P>The Minister himself might give us a demonstration on some of those farms whenever he got the opportunity. He comes from a farming community himself and I have no doubt that in his younger days, before he left his old home&mdash;I believe he still has a farm&mdash;he had a good deal of experience in the working of a farm, and I should like to see him giving a demonstration with the plough.  We who were reared on the land and who have given all the attention we think necessary to farming to the best advantage to ourselves, would like to get further information which would enable us to carry out that work to the best advantage to ourselves and, at the same time, enable us to pay for the extra work done.  In the ploughing and tilling of land and its preparation for the crop a good deal of skill is required, and I should like to see a demonstration of this by some of these agricultural instructors who could <Col N="1752" /> point out to us where in the past we have made mistakes.</P>
    <P>I should also like to follow the rotation of crops.  I should like to see the first crop put into the land&mdash;oats, barley, wheat or perhaps a root crop&mdash;and to follow that rotation so that decent results would be obtained year after year for a period of four or five years. It is the aim of every good farmer in this country to have his land, when that rotation is finished, in a better condition than it was in on the first day he put the plough in it, so that if he wants a second rotation he will get as good results as he got from the first. An experiment for one year or two years, to my mind, is useless.  If a farmer gets into a fairly decently managed farm, a farm which has been well cared for over the past forty or fifty years, there is no doubt whatever that he can get good results for one, two and perhaps three years, while the land is able to stand up to the different crops one year after another without proper manuring, but, after the third year, I should like to see how the farm would be managed for another period of three or four years.</P>
    <P>I know that, as things are at the moment, to wait for another five or six years would be rather long.  I honestly tell the Minister that we cannot stand the strain for another five or six years, and the Minister will realise that if he makes any attempt to inquire from the farmers in his own constituency, County Wexford, which is a tillage county, where you have as good farmers as there are in any other part of the Free State.  In Kilkenny, we are farmers who work our farms more or less on the mixed farming system, and I do think it is the best method of farming.  We can get fairly decent results from it if we are given a chance to get these results, but the wages we can pay to our workers, in present conditions, and what we have for ourselves are not sufficient to keep ourselves and our families in any sort of decent standard of comfort.</P>
    <P>I am strongly in favour of these demonstration farms.  A good deal of useful information can be given by the instructors or by whomever the Minister might appoint to work those farms. Five or six years at least should be the <Col N="1753" /> shortest term, and, during that time, the different crops put into the land would form useful information for us and we could be shown that the up-to-date methods used by the instructors would provide a decent result financially for the extra labour entailed in turning out these crops in an up-to-date manner.  We can grow a few more barrels of oats or barley or wheat by more attention and more manuring, but whether a couple of barrels to the acre would pay the extra cost for the extra attention and manuring is another matter for consideration.  To carry out farming as I would like to see it carried out by the mixed farming system, I have no doubt this would be very instructive for the farmers, provided the instructor was able to prove at the end of the term that he was able to make the farm pay and give a fair return.  Otherwise the demonstration, no matter what might be the good results of the crops turned out per acre, would be of very little use.  It must be able to show a certain amount of profit over the cost of production.</P>
    <P>Then there is the dairying side and the rearing of young stock, to which I know the Minister is somewhat opposed.  I tell the Minister, as I told him before, that you cannot farm successfully without a considerable number of young stock and dairying cows on your farm, as well as manuring the land and caring your farm properly.  Mixed farming, to my mind, is the best and most suitable method.  To do that you must have a considerable number of young stock on the farm.  While that particular branch of the industry is handicapped so much, I think it will be a problem even for the most skilled person to manage a farm and make it pay.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give his consideration to these matters.  We would be glad if he would show us, through his instructors, how we can make our farms pay under present conditions.  An effort in that direction would be very helpful to us.  I do say to the Minister that under his agricultural policy we find it impossible to meet our obligations. <Col N="1754" /> He may be trying to help one particular branch of farming, such as the growing of wheat, but the growing of wheat on any farm is limited, if the condition of the farm is to be kept up to the standard required. If you had 100 acres of land, you could grow 40 or 50 acres of wheat for a few years, but then the question arises: what is to be done with that land; how are you to bring it back to any sort of decent condition, such as it was in before you started to plough?  We farmers intend to live on our farms.  It has always been our intention to improve our farms and hand them over in such condition to our children that they will be able to make a living out of them.  We do not want to hand them over impoverished farms, but farms that are in fairly decent condition, so that they may be able to make a living out of them.  We do not want to have our children handicapped when starting in life.</P>
    <P>The tillage policy of the Government, to my mind, will lead many farmers, owing to want of capital, to run out their farms to a very great extent.  The passage of time, of course, will put an end to that sort of management.  I am not opposed to the growing of wheat or beet.  I have been growing wheat since I was a boy and I know what it means.  I know the extra labour that will have to be put into the growing of wheat, as compared with the growing of barley or oats or any other crop.  I know what it will mean to prepare the ground for the following crops, especially after winter wheat, as compared with preparing the ground after either oats or barley.  We have to be very careful as to the number of acres we will plough on our farms every year.  I should like to see, by means of the farms taken over by the agricultural instructors, how we can till more and produce more and at the same time maintain our farms and keep them up to the same standard they were in before.  Growing wheat and beet means growing the best of a bad lot.  Growing a certain amount of wheat and beet, which a <Col N="1755" /> man can manure and grow with success is a good thing, but where a man is forced, because of the economic conditions, to grow more wheat than he is in a position to manure the land after, and bring it back into the same condition as it was in before he ploughed it, is a bad practice, because after some years that farm will be in such a condition that it will hardly pay anyone to try and make a living out of it.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to give us an opportunity, through his instructors, of seeing what he could do in managing a farm at present so as to make it pay, and thus put the farmers in a position to meet their liabilities, which they are not able to do at the moment, largely due to the agricultural policy of the Minister.  He may be able to help the growing of wheat and beet, but I can tell him that he has killed the one branch of farming worth catering for in this country and on which we depended most&mdash;the live-stock branch of our industry.</P>

      <P>I am supporting this motion.  The farmer Deputies in this House, in my view, have not asked for anything unreasonable in this motion. In effect, it means that the Government are asked to prove to the satisfaction of the farmers that all that Government spokesmen have said is true in substance and in fact.  We have had the opinion expressed in public and in private, both by Ministers and the rank and file of the Government Party, that, while there may be slight depression in this country, it is brought about by world conditions.  In any case, according to one of the Government's spokesmen, the farmers are delighted to be fighting the economic war.  In other words, farmers are doing so well that they are delighted with the condition of affairs in certain parts of the country.  We have had it also from another Government Deputy that the farmers in East Cork are doing well.  These opinions are all contrary to the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The farmers with whom I come in contact have told me quite a different <Col N="1756" /> story.  The case as presented here to-day by a farmer Deputy is one that the Minister, I think, must admit has been well presented.  No hyperbole and no exaggeration have been indulged in. The position of the farmer has not been exaggerated in so far as it relates to the working farmers of this country. I am in almost daily contact with numbers of them.  They are constantly complaining of the bad results of the Minister's policy on their lives and on their fortunes.  If all that the Government spokesmen say is true, and if all that the Minister himself says is true, I cannot see any tangible or reasonable objection against putting into effect the terms of this motion.  The one thing that may influence the Minister in not granting this reasonable request of the farmer Deputy is the fact that he asks the Minister to set up, not one experiment to have this thing tested, but that the Minister should run several farms for this purpose in each county.  I feel that the Minister, knowing full well that he could not run one farm and make it pay, will be very slow to run several farms at a loss to the community in general.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>He must, or else accept the motion.  We have had very rosy pictures painted by the Minister as to the flourishing condition of agriculture. He has painted that rosy picture in this House and outside the House.  Now, here is an opportunity for the Minister to demonstrate the truth of that to the working farmers of the country.  He can do that under the most ideal conditions&mdash;under the direction of the agricultural instructors and under conditions laid down in the motion.  It must be conceded that these agricultural instructors know their business. They would not be in the position they occupy if they were not capable agricultural instructors.  This motion asks that they should be relieved from their other duties and put on to these experimental farms on which decent wages would be paid, accounts kept and audited and balance sheets published. In my view that is a very reasonable <Col N="1757" /> request.  If the Minister and his Government stand for any reliance on their tillage policy, can any valid or reasonable objection be raised to the setting up of even one of these farms? I cannot see how there can.</P>
      <P>If the Minister refuses this very reasonable request it is an admission on his part that the men with expert knowledge who were at his disposal and with the traditions of farming handed down to him could not, under the present economic circumstances, make farming pay.  It is all very well for the Minister to adopt the rôle of the schoolmaster and the lecturer and say to the farmers: &ldquo;Grow wheat, grow beet,&rdquo; and other things that we hear the Minister saying in this House in the course of speeches or in reply to criticisms of his policy.  From time to time we have the Minister getting up and saying a whole lot about agriculture and, having said all this, he then just in the form of a schoolmaster says: &ldquo;Q.E.D.&rdquo;  Having said <i>quod erat demonstrandum</i>, he sits down.  The Minister's attitude in this respect reminds me of the story about the conjurer whom many of us have gone to see.  We have heard of the conjurer carrying out his sleight-of-hand tricks before an audience who did not know how it was done.  The conjurer then told them that he would now show them how it was done.  They were delighted with the prospect of learning that.  But the conjurer having performed his tricks again, the audience were amazed when he merely said at the end: &ldquo;That is how it is done.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will adopt the same tactics to-morrow or the next day. When asked a question on his agricultural policy in this House he produces a whole lot of figures of prices from the world markets.  He gives us world prices and cross-Channel prices, and he tells us how the sale of agricultural produce is governed by certain prices. But we have had it on the authority, of Deputy McGovern and other farmers who live on the Border of the Twenty-Six Counties that better prices are obtained at the various fairs and markets across the Border. Bigger prices are obtained there than <Col N="1758" /> can be obtained here in the Irish Free State.</P>
    <P>Now the Minister has this motion before him and here is his opportunity to prove not alone to the farming community but to the remainder of the community that agriculture is a paying proposition, and that it is an avocation in which the persons engaged are able to maintain themselves and their families in decency and comfort. I am aware that it is a very big struggle at the present moment for many farmers in my area to maintain their families even in frugal comfort, and when I say frugal comfort I mean the barest minimum means of living. The men to whom I refer and their families are industrious people; thrifty people when they had something to put by.  The day for thrift may not be over but the day when thrift would be of any use to those people is past and gone.  Here now is an opportunity presented to the Minister to be able to say to all those people, after a demonstration on these farms worked by agricultural instructors, that they have not been as active as they ought to be, that they do not grow enough wheat, and so on.  He has said that to the farmers already without regard to the experience of such farmers as Deputy Holohan.  The Minister surely must have regard to the opinions expressed by such men and to the experience of those Deputies in this House who have time after time on the Agricultural Vote in this House explained to him the position of the agricultural industry in this country.  I do not profess to be a practical farmer but I am a man of some common sense, and I learned something about farming when I was a boy.  Everybody learned that the rotation of crops is a good thing. The Minister and the farmers of the country could learn something from this experiment.</P>
    <P>It cannot be objected that there is not enough land in the country on which to establish these State farms. The Minister is himself aware that the Land Commission has several large farms and tracts of land upon which these experiments could be carried out. There is nothing to prevent his carrying them out.  Surely if the Minister <Col N="1759" /> is so enamoured of his policy and if he feels that it is giving such good returns in the country, if he feels that hard-working, perfectly honest farmers cannot make a living for themselves and their families from working their little farms, it is for him in this manner to show them how they should work them properly.  That is one of the functions of the Department&mdash;to come to the rescue of the farmers, who, because of obsolete methods or because of want of capital or want of machinery and other things that come into the economy of farming in this country, may not be able to make farming pay. It is for this Department to demonstrate to them how they could improve their farms and get a better living out of them by following the instructions of the Department.  It would be also for the Department to demonstrate to them in a practical way &mdash;not in the theoretical way that we hear trotted out so often here&mdash;how farming should be made a paying proposition in this country.  Everybody knows that farming is not a paying proposition in this country.  Everybody is perfectly well aware that when the farming community in this country are suffering a loss, and when that cannot be changed, the remainder of the community suffers in proportion.  That cannot be denied.  The ordinary city or townsman, if he has not got sufficient interest in that great industry, should have, because it is essential that that industry should prosper if the man in the town or city is to prosper also.  Therefore, this motion makes a larger and bigger appeal than many Deputies think.  Otherwise there would have been a far bigger attendance on the Government Benches, and even on the Opposition Benches.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a great opportunity of showing farmers that agriculture can be made pay.  He has at his disposal all the requisite plant and machinery. He has experienced, enlightened, educated, technical instructors.  Let him put his experts on a farm and prove that it is a paying proposition, and I can assure him we will have very little agitation in this House in future debates on agriculture.  I think it is a fair challenge to the Minister.  It is <Col N="1760" /> useless telling farmers that their industry can be made pay if the Minister and his Department cannot prove to the satisfaction of these farmers that it can be made pay.  It is up to him to do the right thing.  This is not asking anything unreasonable, and surely the Minister, who is a practical farmer himself, must see eye to eye with me.  If he is not prepared to set up several demonstration farms he ought, at least, to set up one or two in the country.</P>

      <P>The results sought by this motion might be useful if we had not them already.  As a practical proposition I can hardly agree with it. Deputy McGovern wisely said that if such demonstration farms were run by the Government, to be of any use there should be at least one in every county. Perhaps better still would it be to have regional farms.  There are many parts of different counties with similar kind of land, similar sized farms and a similar farming economy.  If the size of the farms and the standard of economy were classified, and if demonstration farms were run to suit local needs, they might fill the bill; but to be of any practical utility you would require one farm in each county. Deputy McGovern suggested that the size of the farm and the type of land should bear a close relation to the average farm in a particular county. He suggested an area of 20 or 30 acres for County Cavan and he wants an instructor.  It is news to me that they are Departmental instructors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The most relevant? That was my opinion, too.  It certainly was the most interesting and it hit the nail on the head every time.  What you get out of a farm is not so much the £ s. d. at the end of one year.  Deputy Holohan said you would want to demonstrate a farm for four or five years.  Under present circumstances, you would want to demonstrate a farm for a generation because if you grow wheat four or five years in succession it will take a generation to bring that farm into good heart again.  It is not the 26/- you get for a barrel of wheat that you must reckon.  How much fertility have you stolen out of the land, and to what extent is it represented by the money income of 26/-?  We all remember that in normal times when a farm would be put up for sale there was one thing prospective purchasers looked for and sellers never omitted to insert in boosting the farm&mdash;that it had been well-farmed and was in good heart.  That phrase of being in good heart is understood by every man in this House who knows anything about land, and the farming that Deputy Holohan visualised was farming that would keep the land in good heart; in other words, that when you had finished a rotation of four, five or six years the land was better than you found it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is any need for demonstration farms.  I submit, while this discussion is useful, that if the Minister was willing to demonstrate as asked for in this motion it would give no practical results.  It would be better if the Minister would concede this.  I do not know if the county committees have the power to run demonstration farms.  They may have, but I never heard it discussed, or tried out.  I suppose the way the Minister would demonstrate, if that principle was adopted by him and his Department, would be to administer those demonstration farms through county committees. <Col N="1763" /> How many county committees in the Free State would be prepared to take on that responsibility?  If the Minister would leave it open to the county committees to take on these demonstrations, he would meet the claim made, and throw the responsibility on the people themselves.  Otherwise I do not think it is practical.  The farmer has a lot of latent knowledge&mdash; knowledge which he does not know he has himself&mdash;it has grown up with him. He knows the land, and he knows what each field can produce.  Nobody knows the land better than the man working it and his neighbour who has grown up there.  Take a stranger who comes in, qualified in a scientific way as an instructor in agriculture.  You cannot expect him to walk into a farm and work it as well as the hard-headed farmer who has grown up on it, and fought for years to make a living on that land.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGovern was, I think, a bit hard upon Government institutions such as Glasnevin and Ballyhaise and the like.  I do not think it was ever the intention that these should be paying concerns.  I do not know how the Glasnevin Model Farm is working recently, but I know that three or four years ago they were losing anything from £4,000 in a year.  But that farm is being run not to make money but to gain knowledge.  I know the farm in Glasnevin put produce on the Dublin market, and we, farmers in County Dublin, objected, and rightly so, because it was a subsidised farm.  We held that it was a self-contained institution and should not sell produce on the Dublin market in competition with us, who had to pay our way and got no subsidy from anyone.  I would be sorry to see a farm like that in Glasnevin run on any lines except educational lines. I appeal to those Deputies who have spoken upon this motion to consider it very carefully before they press it too far.  If we are looking to get information through a model farm it cannot be made to pay in a way that an ordinary farm should.  Do we not know that if we got £20,000 as a present to take up a farm of this size, and show a profit at the end of a year, even with that bribe, we could not do it?  How then <Col N="1764" /> could the Minister do it?  Such a farm does not produce for our greatest market; it has no live stock.  It is immaterial whether you sell that produce here in the home market, or whether you sell it in an external market. The price you get for agricultural produce is regularised and standardised by the price you get for live stock.  No farm economy can give economic results unless the selling price of live stock reaches such a level as to leave a margin of profit on the whole farm economy.  Now, while live stock has to carry such a tax as it has had to carry for some years, it means a tax on the market for agriculture.  That tax is something that has to be taken out of the general pool of money received for agricultural produce.  It has to be taken out, and, as far as this country is concerned, not only does it have to bear the direct loss of that money being taken out of the agricultural purse, but it has to bear the economic loss sustained by the whole Irish community in losing that money which is taken out of circulation, and the business that money, if in circulation, would do.  In all these circumstances I cannot see how demonstration farms would be of any use.  They would be still-born.  No man could take up such a farm and say: &ldquo;I will make it pay.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If Deputy Holohan had 100 acres he would advocate, and rightly so, mixed farming, for no other farming will maintain and fertilise the land. Let us take an arable farm where you grow wheat.  I know farmers with a considerable amount of wheat down for the coming year.  On some of these farms this is the fourth year of wheat in succession.  If an analysis of that soil was taken four years ago, and again when that crop will be harvested next year, I think every farmer here will agree that there would be no comparison between the commercial value of that land four years ago and what it will be next October.  I agree it will take generations to get that land back again to its former condition.  The Minister will know from local gossip, if he goes around the country, that that is so.  I know tracts of land in parts of Roscommon and Galway, and I was informed by local people that it was <Col N="1765" /> good fattening land 40 years ago.  It has not been robbed to the extent that wheat would rob it, but it has been robbed in this way, that it has raised young stock and fattened none, with the result that that land has ceased to be fattening land to-day.  Everybody in the scientific agricultural world&mdash;to which I do not belong but which I touch now and again&mdash;will tell you that one of the secrets of the fertility of County Meath is that it has for ages been a finishing county, and that it has not been robbed of the bone ash and other things that are used up by growing cattle.  It has retained its fertility, but the raising of store cattle will take the fertility out of the land.  The same applies to growing crops on land without the proper scientific rotation.  Everybody who knows anything about land knows that all crops take something out of land, but they also give something back, and by a scientific rotation and a dovetailing of one crop into another what is taken out by one is given back by another.  There will, of course, be a wastage in the aggregate, and there is the place where scientific manuring comes in.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of farming which has particular reference to the conditions now being produced in farming economy and, quite apart from present conditions, it is something which our Department of Agriculture should have developed ten years ago at least. I am not blaming the Minister for it, but I would direct his attention to its importance, and also to the fact that it is being done in other countries.  It has particular application to the condition in which agriculture, and the land particularly, finds itself to-day. In other countries, when a farmer is about to break up a field all he has to do is telephone to the Department of Agriculture or drop a postcard to one of their instructors, and the instructor will call on him.  He can go over that field and tell the farmer what manure would be best to apply to that land for the particular crop which he contemplates growing on it.</P>
    <P>That is done in other countries.  I do not think it has ever been thought of by the Department of Agriculture here.  I remember mentioning it once <Col N="1766" /> to an official of the Department, a friend of mine whom I met one Sunday. We went out for a walk, and I pointed out to him a field of about 30 acres which I was breaking, and I told him that I thought the Department of Agriculture should do what I have just described.  He said: &ldquo;It would be very desirable, but I am afraid you are very far away from it.&rdquo;  It was only about a week or a fortnight afterwards that representatives of a Franco-Belgian fertilising company called on me to look for an order.  I showed them a field where I had a certain crop &mdash;it was a market garden crop&mdash;and asked them could they tell me what would be the best manure for it.  I asked them to help me to a knowledge of the manures that were used by the market gardeners around Paris.  They took away some of the soil and analysed it.  They sent me a copy of the analysis, and also a copy of the analysis of the manure which they proposed to sell me for that particular crop.  I used the manure, and it had good results.  I did not check up on them as to whether their analysis of the soil was correct, or whether the analysis of the manure was correct, or whether it was the best possible manure to use.</P>
    <P>I give that instance in order to illustrate the idea.  The idea is a perfect one if everything is carried out properly, and if there is a checking up on it.  The Department should take up that line of investigation and scientific research.  If it did, I do not think any Minister for Agriculture would dare to get up in this House or outside it and advocate or be responsible for an agricultural economy which would rob the fertility of the land year by year, even though a farmer who takes a short-sighted view of the matter would say: &ldquo;Well, I made only £100 on that piece of land last year; by growing wheat or something else for three or four years in succession I can make a couple of hundred pounds.&rdquo; The farmer would say that was better farming, but was it, when you analyse the condition of the land as well as the condition of the farmer's profit? That farmer might go on in that way for a few years, and then he would find that he was able to grow nothing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1767" /> If that happened even in the case of a hundred, two hundred or a thousand farmers, it would cause a serious problem and be quite a serious matter for the Government. It would be something similar to the fluke epidemic we had a few years ago.  But if the whole nation adopts that method, and the fertility of the land is destroyed, what will be the position of agriculture?  Everybody admits that agriculture is the pillar of our nation.  If the fertility of the land is destroyed, where does agriculture come in?  Are you not up against privation and want, perhaps famine?  With people who spend their time working on a farm a money return is a big consideration, but the Minister for Agriculture and his Department should attach at least as much, if not more importance, to maintaining and increasing the fertility of the soil in this country.  It is their job, and they alone can look after it.  Those of us who are on the land are not there through natural love and affection for the land.  We are there to make the most we can out of our time, and it would be pardonable in us to rob the soil in order to make money, but it is not pardonable in the case of the Minister for Agriculture, who is the trustee of the land of this country for the nation. It should be his major concern to see that the fertility of the land is not only maintained but improved.  That was the strongest reason in favour of the growing of beet in this country. In Germany, the value of land went up in the areas where beet had been cultivated for years, not because of the money return that could be got out of the land there, but because of the improved condition of the land itself.</P>
    <P>We all know that in no country in the world has the production of sugar from beet been made an economic proposition, nor will it be made an economic proposition in any country until we get a sugar content of about 25 per cent.  I am not speaking for or against the production of sugar beet.  I am speaking on the necessity of maintaining the fertility of the soil.  If the <Col N="1768" /> Department is going in the direction of scientific manuring by an analysis of the soil, filling into the soil the fertilising ingredients that are absent from it&mdash;if they have been doing any research in that direction, it must have been limited.  If they started on it at all it must have been in very recent times, but it would be the greatest check on the robbery of the soil that is now going on and that is actually boosted here in this House.  Everybody here connected with farming will admit that money has been made out of certain things on a farm.  A couple of years ago money was made out of tobacco, money for nothing.  But at whose expense?  The expense of the Exchequer.  The Exchequer could not afford it.  The fertilisation of the soil and the robbery of the soil are operations that cannot be seen, but nevertheless they go on.  Comparatively speaking, there is money in wheat at the present time, but at what price? The robbery of the fertility of the soil. I think nobody over there will get up and say that the farmer who produces 20 barrels of wheat to the Irish acre, bushelling 60 lbs., and who gets 26/- or 27/- per barrel, is not paid, but what does that take out of the soil?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are entitled to ask the poor man to pay for bread made from wheat grown in this country.  On that question I differ with my friends over here, but the Minister should not forget that there is also a question of taking the fertility out of the soil.  I should like to know how much farmyard manure would be required to restore the fertility of an acre of average land on which wheat had been grown.  We cannot, unfortunately, keep cattle for the sake of their manure. That would be very dear manure.  We can only keep cattle if they show a margin of profit.  I wonder is it a paying proposition to keep bullocks for three years and sell them then at £10 per head, no matter how valuable their manure is?  Just think of what we are up against.  The proposer of the motion, and I am sure the seconder, would be the two first Deputies in the House to sit back and say: &ldquo;Well, the <Col N="1769" /> Minister can go on with the demonstration farms, but we know the result before he starts.&rdquo;  They are farmers themselves, but of course this is only a way of putting it up to the Minister. I do not think it is necessary to waste a year or two on these demonstration farms.  Will the Minister produce in this House an analysis of the soil before and after the growing of wheat, signed by a reputable soil analyst, showing the condition of the soil before and after the growing of that wheat for one, two and three years?  If that analyst proves that there has been no wastage or robbery of the soil, then our case falls; but I submit that no analyst can produce such a certificate.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I must say that I do not see that the setting up of these demonstration farms in the present circumstances will do any good.  If times were normal and we wanted to use instructors to the best advantage it might be a good idea to have competitions and to make selections from those competitions the following year, to take one or two of the best in a county or district&mdash;you might have three or four in a county&mdash;and offer premiums for running farms on the lines suggested in the motion.  I do not think that any Minister, or even a county committee of agriculture, could run a demonstration farm that would be of any use.  Speaking for myself, if I were a Minister or if I were a county instructor, and I were given this job, I would not put the work into it that I would put into my own farm, nor would any man in Ireland.  It would not be giving the farm a fair chance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I first saw this motion on the Order Paper&mdash;I think it must be six or seven months ago&mdash;I thought it was a joke.  I did not think that there were any Deputies seriously behind it, but it does appear that Deputy McGovern is seriously behind it as he made a speech lasting an hour and a half on it.  He did not, I will admit, supply any strong reasons as to why the motion should be adopted, but he at least spoke as if he were in earnest about the motion.  All I can say is that I under-estimated the folly of some Deputies when I thought they were putting down this motion as a joke. No Deputy could be in favour of the motion if he had any regard for the work that the agricultural instructor is doing.  If there are men who are prejudiced against the work of instructors and against the work the county committees are carrying out, men who, perhaps, are more inclined to take an interest in politics than in agriculture in their own counties, I know Deputies of that kind will vote for the motion. No Deputy who has a real interest in agriculture in his county, and who knows the value of the advice that these county instructors give from time to time, would consider a motion like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite all right, of course, to take the opportunity of making the usual economic war speech.  Motions are put down from time to time to give Deputies that opportunity, but they ought not to play politics so far as to forget whatever advantages there are from having county instructors in their own counties.  There are young farmers, progressive farmers, still left in the country who are not too interested in politics but who are interested in agriculture, and are <Col N="1771" /> prepared to take advantage of the instruction that these instructors give. Deputies ought not to play politics to the extent of trying to deprive these young men of that instruction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that anyone who reads the speeches that have been made on this motion will come to the conclusion that I reached.  The Deputies' speeches were not made on the motion at all, but on the economic war.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister leave it to the farmers of the country to decide?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We left it to them on three occasions to decide, and they gave the decision that we wanted.  I want to impress this on Deputies, that while they may be out of touch with the honest farmers of the country, still we have honest farmers who want to pay their way and are doing so.  We have farmers who want to benefit by the instruction that these agricultural instructors are giving them.  I put it to the Deputies sitting up there: &ldquo;Let these honest farmers continue to have the instruction that they have been getting, let them continue their farming and do not interfere with them any more.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHolohan" hpid="Mr. Holohan Mr. Holohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Holohan</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion these instructors are at the present moment giving very useful information to farmers, and, therefore, I do not think the Minister should have made the statement that he has just made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I now propose to deal with <Col N="1772" /> the motion.  None of the previous speakers did that.  In the first place, I want to point out that these agricultural instructors are not under the Department at all.  One would imagine that the Deputies who put the motion would, at least, be interested to know that the agricultural instructors are under the control of the county committees and not of the Department. But, of course, the Deputies who have spoken do not take enough interest in the matter to understand that.  They are only interested in the usual talk about the economic war.  They simply put down a motion like this to get the opportunity of talking about the economic war.  Deputy McGovern has suggested that several farms should be taken over in each county and run by the agricultural instructors.  In most counties there is only the one agricultural instructor.  The Deputy, perhaps, does not know that.  He does not take sufficient interest in this matter to know that much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies who do know something about farming will admit that the management of one farm is nearly a full time job for any man.  You might, possibly, put an instructor to manage two farms, but that is about the most he could do.  The idea of an instructor in each county taking over several farms and running them is ridiculous, and, again, shows that the Deputy who put down the motion gave no thought whatever to what is practicable.  All that he is interested in is propaganda.  If the Deputy was genuine in putting down this motion he might, possibly, have asked that two farms in each county should be taken over under this system.  If we did that, what would be the result?  It would be this: that the instructor would have to confine all his attention practically to the running of these farms.  The County Cavan is a fairly big county. Suppose two farms were taken over, they would have to be located in different districts.  You cannot move farms about.  Therefore, it is only the people living in the immediate neighbourhood of these farms who would derive any advantage from the county instructor's work.  That reminds <Col N="1773" /> me that there is an agricultural college in the County Cavan, and I am just wondering whether Deputy McGovern was ever there.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Teachers have to be employed there and, of course, they could not make it pay.  I wonder does Deputy McGovern go to Ballyhaise farm once every quarter to see what is going on there.  I know very well that he does not. Therefore, he is not serious about this motion, which he has simply put down for propaganda purposes.  He knows very well that the farmers all over the County Cavan would not go to see the model farms that he asks us to have set up.  The Deputy pretends to be interested in agriculture, but he does not go to Ballyhaise farm to see how it is being run.  That is a farm that is being run on experimental lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHolohan" hpid="Mr. Holohan Mr. Holohan">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are doing experiments there, and it would be useful to any farmer to see them and study them.  If Deputy McGovern was more interested in farming than he is in politics he would visit Ballyhaise farm occasionally and try to learn something.  Deputy Holohan has been paid the compliment of being a good, experienced farmer.  I am sure he is, but Deputy Holohan will admit that there is no farmer in this country so experienced that he could not learn a little more.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We could all learn a little more, even Deputy McGovern, and I would advise him to go to Ballyhaise <Col N="1774" /> farm occasionally and try to get a little knowledge on farming&mdash;not, mind you, on propaganda, but on farming.</P>

      <P>I will come to that later but I may not reach it to-day.  I say again that it would be very unfair to the honest, hard-working farmers in the County Cavan, who are not interested in Deputy McGovern's propaganda, to take the county instructor away from them and put him into one farm in order to carry on some work that Deputy McGovern wants done.</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation. The Minister has associated us with politics on this question.  I would ask him to consult some of his own followers about this.  It is not long since I asked a follower of his if he was better off now than he was two years ago and he said that he was not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, they do not intend to go back to the first horse again.  They made that fairly clear at the elections.  Suppose we did what the motion asks, I am quite sure that no matter how good the results were&mdash; even if you were able to show that the farms were paying&mdash;you could not convince either Deputy McGovern or Deputy O'Leary of that.  If the results showed that the farms were paying they would tell you that there was some trickery in it.  The fact is that I do not think they want to be convinced. I do not think it would be worth while departing from our present system of agricultural instruction in order to embark on an experiment such <Col N="1775" /> as has been suggested.  Supposing that we did agree to what is being asked, it might be necessary to change the law.  I am not going to deal with that, because we could change the law if we thought there was anything in this. What I want to put before the House is this, that if we were to do what is proposed here it would mean depriving every county in the Free State of the <Col N="1776" /> benefit of the agricultural classes held during the winter months and of the instruction given by means of experiments on individual farms and plots. I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
