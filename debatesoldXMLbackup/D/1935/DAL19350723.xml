As the number for mid-February was 153, the figure on which the bonus will be calculated in the current half year is 155 in either case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilroy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he will state if applicants for compensation under the Damage to Property (Compensation) (Amendment) Act, 1933, who had through lack of knowledge on their part, or for other good reasons, failed to have their applications lodged in time, may now be granted permission to bring their cases forward; and, if so, if he will see that such permission gets ample publication so as to avoid further disappointment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the statement I made in the House in reply to a question addressed to me on the 18th ultimo.  I then indicated that the grant of extensions of time for lodging claims under the Damage to Property (Compensation) (Amendment) Act, 1933, was a matter entirely within the discretion of the Circuit Judge, but that the State Solicitors would be instructed to offer strenuous opposition to any extension of time where the claim is not lodged on or before the 30th September, 1935.  That statement received widespread publicity over the radio and was also reported in the Dublin and provincial press.  I am, moreover, taking such steps as are open to me to ensure that the matter receives further publicity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether, in view of the dissatisfaction expressed by civil servants with the proposals issued under cover of his letter of the 8th June last to <Col N="1080" /> the Staff Associations, he will now set up negotiation and arbitration arrangements in relation to the conditions of employment in the Civil Service on the lines of the system which for a number of years past has been operated successfully in the Civil Service in Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>After due consideration the Government decided that before a decision could be reached as to the methods by which arbitration can best be applied to our Civil Service the matter should be inquired into by a commission which would receive evidence from all parties interested.  That inquiry was duly held and the Scheme of Arbitration issued to the Civil Service on the 8th June last is based on the majority report of the commission.  All the Civil Service Staff Associations have been invited to state their views on the scheme in writing, but replies from a number are still outstanding. I have no information that the Arbitration Scheme in the British Civil Service, referred to in the question, has operated successfully, but in any case I am not prepared to accept the suggestion that such a scheme should be adopted here in preference to one based on the report of a commission of our own who have examined the problem with great care in the light of the circumstances of our own Civil Service and of the financial requirements of our own State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister state whether the actual scheme of arbitration that has been put up to the Civil Servants is in fact based on the majority report of the commission that inquired into this matter?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say if, in so far as it is not entirely based upon it, it departs from it in very fundamental particulars?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state then if I am correct in saying that the staff associations have made it perfectly clear that the Minister's scheme is entirely unacceptable to them, and, if so, whether a condition of dead-lock has been reached between the Minister, the Staff Associations and Civil Servants in general?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I received indications that some Staff Associations are not prepared favourably to consider the scheme.  On the other hand, I have not yet received from all the Staff Associations their views on the scheme in writing, and, therefore, I do not think it is correct to suggest that a dead-lock exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say which of the Staff Associations have not yet sent in their replies, and, if he cannot state the names, would he state the number of associations that have not yet replied, together with the number that have?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Meantime, will the Minister deny that the scheme has been rejected by all the staff organisations, except one puny, insignificant organisation, because of the fact that it does not contain the principles of arbitration which the staff organisations were led to believe would be enshrined in the scheme of arbitration promised to them by the President in the speech delivered by him in the Town Hall, Rathmines, in 1932?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to <Col N="1082" /> pass judgment on the quality of any of the staff organisations, but at least I feel that those which have accepted the scheme are as representative of the service as a whole as those which have rejected it.</P>

    <P>That Dáil Eireann hereby approves of Reserved Commodity (Sewing Cotton) Order, 1935, made on the 2nd day of July, 1935, by the Executive Council under the Control of Manufactures Act, 1934 (No. 36 of 1934)&mdash;(Minister for Industry and Commerce).</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved to report progress on this matter on Friday last, I was drawing the attention of the House to the fact that the Minister for Industry and Commerce was asking us to approve this Reserved Commodity Order and was proposing, if we did so approve, to issue a licence to a firm in Westport for the manufacture of cotton thread.  I pointed out that the Minister had not given any particulars as to the conditions he proposed to impose on the firm in question.  We had no indication as to when the firm would be able to supply commodities to satisfy the demand from the home market.  We had no information as to the rates of wages proposed in the factory or as to the type of person to be employed.  We had no information from the Minister as to what the conditions of employment would be like.  I sought to call attention to the fact that the legislature was being asked to give the Minister power to give this firm a monopoly.  In such circumstances, the House was obviously entitled to know something about the conditions of labour and what rates of wages would be paid.  I am sure it must be obvious that when the Minister issues a licence, on the confirmation of this Order, the House will, with its eyes wide open, be giving an absolute monopoly to a Westport firm and it will have no assurance as to the rates of wages and the conditions of employment which will be observed in the factory.  If the Westport firm is allowed to go ahead, by virtue of the reservation made in respect of it, under the licence that will be issued by the Minister, then we may assume that no other firm will be allowed to manufacture thread in the country, and if any other firm should attempt to do so the Minister would be confronted with all kinds of pressure in order to ensure that the interests of the Westport firm will not in any way be impaired by the establishment of a second factory.  The only way in which the Minister can then safeguard the Westport firm will be by making it impossible for any other firm to be established with his benediction and good-will.</P>

      <Col N="1089" /> If, as the Minister wishes, we are going to give him facilities to put the Westport factory in a position to manufacture the whole of our home requirements, then I submit that we are obviously entitled to know the conditions of employment which will operate in that firm and also to know that that firm will be able to supply the whole of the home market, and that the consumers in the home market will be able to obtain thread on conditions at least as favourable as they obtain to-day; or if there is to be any variation we are entitled to know what the variation is likely to be.  During one portion of the Minister's speech he indicated that the price of cotton thread at Westport would be substantially the same as the prices at which similar thread could be obtained from the British combine.  Apparently the Minister thought well to obtain that information from the firm.  Surely the Minister could also obtain from this firm particulars as to the rates of wages and particulars as to the conditions of employment it proposes to observe and, generally, information as to the kind of persons who would be employed in the firm.  Calling attention in this House to the dangers of giving State benefits to private firms without obtaining any guarantees from the firms in question, I quoted on Friday last a notorious example of State assistance being given to a particular firm in the County Kildare without having obtained any guarantee as to the rates of wages paid by that particular firm. And I said then and I now repeat it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only in these first few words that I repeat myself.  It is suggested then that it was nothing short of a scandal that that particular firm should be allowed to get assistance from the State without giving any sort of return; and because I took steps to expose that notorious instance of the exploitation of Irish workers in the interests of a certain enterprise, the Minister indulged in one of his ill-tempered and, if I might say so, ill-mannered remarks in connection with Irish industry.  The Minister said that my exposure was an attack upon Irish industry.  I want now to tell the Minister very definitely and in language that he can clearly under stand that my attack in that instance was altogether on a particular employer who was exploiting Irish workers while this particular one was being assisted by the State and was having the benefit of a high tariff wall erected for him.  The Minister attempted by his attitude and remarks to say that any attack on such employers in this country was an attack on Irish industry.  That statement is a contemptible misrepresentation of the real issue, and I tell the Minister very definitely that the good Irish employers in this country resent the establishment of that kind of industry because it is a social evil, because it is an economic injustice on other competitors and because it seeks to establish here an industrial fabric that is not capable of being sustained except at the price of exploiting Irish workers at starvation rates of wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say to the Minister very definitely that it is his task and it ought to be the task of any Minister for Industry and Commerce to make it clear that if we are going to have industries in this country, national or other industries, they will pay fair rates of wages to the workers and it should be the task of the Minister to stand up here and denounce the type of employers&mdash; fortunately a minority&mdash;who are only too anxious to try to exploit Irish workers at the lowest possible rate of <Col N="1091" /> wages at which they can induce them to work.  Instead of taking that obvious line, instead of standing up and denouncing that type of employer, the Minister by his attitude on Friday last showed himself, in that instance at all events, in a rôle which was certainly a surprising one to me.  He said on that occasion that that attack on an employer was an attack on Irish industry.  I tell the Minister that that statement by him is a deliberate misrepresentation of the real position&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let the Minister read his own Party organ.  I suppose I will not be accused of bias in quoting that. The Minister was highly annoyed and highly indignant because I sought to warn him against the dangers which flow from giving private enterprise facilities at the expense of the State without getting any guarantees from the private firms concerned.  In this instance I want to make sure that if the State is going to give private enterprise certain facilities we are entitled in all reason to know the conditions that are being imposed upon these firms.  Yet the Minister came to the House on Friday last and made a very brief statement which contained no information of the kind we were entitled to expect on an occasion such as that.  Having made that brief statement he asked Dáil Eireann to approve of the Reserved Commodity (Sewing Cotton) Order without the House being given the necessary information. I think that attitude on the part of the Minister is inexplicable. I think it is without precedent that the Minister should come to this House and ask for the wide powers which he is seeking in this Motion without giving the House the detailed information which it seeks in connection with this particular matter.  Even apart from this particular instance I think <Col N="1092" /> the whole policy of the Government in granting facilities to private enterprise is wrong&mdash;without making sure that certain conditions in respect of the rates of wages and certain conditions of labour will be observed in these undertakings which seek facilities from the State.  The whole policy of the Government seems to me to be that we want industries here at any price, the main consideration being to get the industry and that it does not matter what kind of exploitation is carried on in order to establish and to maintain that industry.  It is obviously a task for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to take every possible step to ensure that so far as he can the conditions of employment and the rates of wages paid approximate to the most ideal that it is within the power of the Minister or the power of this House to make.  My complaint against the Minister is that in giving facilities to private firms he has not taken steps to ensure that these firms will be required to pay fair rates of wages and to observe fair conditions of labour.  The whole policy of the Government in this particular respect seems to be to get industry at any price.  As against that kind of rash policy, as against that kind of panic for industry I suggest to the Minister that his policy should be tempered with the desire to see that such industries as are being established and in particular in respect of such industries as are seeking assistance from the State, he should take steps to ensure as a condition of the grant of any assistance by the State that fair rates of wages and fair conditions of labour will be observed by the firm in question. So far as this House knows, no such steps have been taken in this particular instance.  So far as this House knows, no steps whatever have been taken to ascertain from the firm in question what rates of wages it proposes to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister came to the House and asked to have this Motion approved, but there was not a single indication from the Minister that he proposed to impose upon this firm any conditions in respect of wages or any other feature of employment in the industry. <Col N="1093" /> We are being asked, therefore, so far as this particular industry is concerned, to make it a closed borough for this firm.  If we are going to do that, we ought to do it with our eyes wide open.  We ought to do it when we have knowledge of the conditions of employment in the industry.  We ought to do it when we have knowledge of the rates of wages to be paid.  I think it is grossly unfair for the Minister to come to this House, and ask for the authority which he seeks in this Motion, without giving the House the detailed information which it requires in respect of the rates of wages, the conditions of employment, the sexes of the persons to be employed there, and the proportion of one to the other.  I am not asking the Minister for anything unreasonable in asking for that information.  We certainly ought not to be asked to approve an Order enabling the Minister to issue a licence to a particular firm, and to make this industry a closed borough for that firm, without having first obtained all the relevant information in respect of the conditions of employment in the undertaking.</P>
    <P>It is quite possible, and indeed it is highly probably, that if this firm has a licence issued to it, and any subsequent proposal is submitted to the Minister for the establishment of a second undertaking in that particular industrial direction, the Minister will be prohibited from allowing that second industrial undertaking to be established, at least so far as the powers in his Department are concerned. This House will have placed itself in this position: It may give the Minister power to issue a licence to one particular firm, without information as to the wages or conditions of labour in the factory.  Afterwards those conditions may come to light. They may be found to be unsatisfactory, but the House will then have put itself into the position of making a closed borough for one firm paying low rates of wages, and being prohibited in fact from permitting a second firm to be established, even though the proposed rates of wages are substantially higher than those paid in the first <Col N="1094" /> instance.  I want to protect my vote against that possibility.  I want to protect the State against the possibility that it will be used to subsidise an industry by the issue of a licence of this kind.  I want to put the State in the position that it will not give its imprimatur to the establishment of a closed borough for the private owners of an enterprise, unless there is some definite information as to the rates of wages and conditions of employment. I hope that, since Friday last, the Minister has been able to get information on the matter.  I hope we are now going to hear about the rates of wages and conditions of labour.  I hope we are going to hear how many men and how many women will be employed in the undertaking, and that on to-day, Tuesday, we can have the information which we ought to have got from the Minister when he was moving this Motion on Friday last.</P>
    <P>Aside from the whole question of whether this firm should or should not be licensed, and aside from the whole question as to whether it is desirable to permit the manufacture of this commodity in this country, I should like to ascertain from the Minister whether in fact the Government can see no way of inducing the manufacture of such commodities in this country except by setting up private monopolies, which are to be permitted to exploit the market for their own benefit, the creation of new national wealth and the provision of employment for Irish workers being secondary to the main consideration, which is to line their own pockets, and afterwards, and only incidentally, to create new sources of employment.  The Minister used to be in favour of nationalisation of certain kinds.  Has he given any consideration to the question of dealing with a problem such as this, and of introducing new lines of manufacture here, by setting up publicly-owned and publicly-controlled undertakings to produce such commodities here?  It is not a very far step from having a publicly-owned and publicly-controlled sugar beet company, and Shannon scheme, to having a similarly owned and controlled industry in respect of cotton <Col N="1095" /> thread or other commodities.  I should like to know whether the Minister, who used to be so fond of nationalisation in other days, has now completely abandoned any possibility of using the resources and the powers of the State in order to assist in the establishment here of industries which, so far, private enterprise has not established, and which private enterprise will only establish on being guaranteed an unrestricted monopoly in the home market?  There may, of course, be people who will say that the State cannot run those schemes as efficiently as private enterprise.</P>

      <P>I should like to remind the Deputy that this is a specific resolution dealing with a specific matter.  The opportunity for reviewing the administration and policy of the Department of Industry and Commerce was on the Vote for that Department.  The Deputy is not in order in canvassing the whole policy of the Department of Industry and Commerce, and the Minister's views on nationalisation and other questions, nor would the Minister be in order in stating his general policy, on this resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling, Sir.  I do not desire to travel outside the ambit of this Order, except perhaps to the bare fringe of it, where I might be permitted to ask the Minister whether this is the only way in which he can have sewing cotton manufactured in this country, and to point out to him that there are other ways of inducing the manufacture of that commodity here rather than by the setting up of a private monopoly, such as the Minister has indicated to the House that he proposes to set up if this Order is approved.  My complaint will be shared by many complaint will be shared by many other Deputies, is that the House, which is asked to give these facilities to the Minister, is not given information to enable it to judge the merits of the case.  It is not given any precise information as to the rates of wages <Col N="1096" /> and conditions of employment to be observed in the industry which the Minister seeks to assist if this Order is passed.  I think the Minister has treated the House most unfairly.  If he had put as much energy into the compilation of these necessary statistics as he did into his display of disorderly interruptions on Friday last I think we might have had much more helpful information in considering a matter of this kind.  I now suggest to the Minister that, in respect of this Order and the licence to be issued under it, it would be very much better for Irish workers and very much better for the reputation of the Minister and the Government if, instead of putting so much energy into defending a minority of Irish employers who exploit Irish workers, he put at least half the energy into defending the rights of Irish workers to be given reasonable standards of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with this Order, we are entitled to ask the Minister what he has done to safeguard the conditions of Irish workers, what he has done to safeguard consumers, and what he has done generally to ensure that the national wellbeing is being fully safeguarded by the issue of a licence to this particular firm.  I have no particular complaint to make against the firm in question.  It happens to be in Westport, but it is immaterial for the purposes of my argument where it is situate.  My one desire is to ensure that if we are going to give facilities to a private firm, we ought: (1) to get a guarantee about the rates of wages that are to be paid and the conditions of labour that will be observed; (2) to make sure that the consumer is protected; and (3) to make sure that the national wellbeing is protected, and that we are not setting up here a kind of private uncontrolled monopoly with which this country at some future date may be compelled to deal. I would like, therefore, to know if, in those three simple respects, which should be the special care of and in the special province of the Minister, he has taken steps along the lines I have indicated?  If he has done that, we can consider this Order much <Col N="1097" /> more intelligently on receipt of that information from the Minister than we could on the meagre and very inadequate information which he gave to the House on Friday last.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There can be no doubt, after listening to Deputy Norton's speech, that he is interested in rates of wages.  He repeated 22 times that he wanted the Minister for Industry and Commerce to tell him the rates of wages that are going to be paid in Westport.  I can assure the Deputy that, if he were to repeat his question another 22 times, he will get very little information from the Minister.  But out of evil cometh good, because the leader of the Labour Party is now beginning to learn that when any Deputy of this House has the temerity to ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce for information which the Minister ought to vouchsafe himself without being asked for it at all, it is the Minister's practice to reply that those questions are asked with a view to sabotaging Irish industry.  I have had that reply made to me several times, and my recollection is that when the Minister made that reply to me Deputy Norton sympathetically nodded his head.  Now he discovers that that kind of misrepresentation, that dishonest weapon, is being used against himself.  It will always be used by the Minister when he wants to cover up his own tracks.  Whenever the Minister wants to conceal the activities in which he is engaged, he denounces anyone who dares to draw aside the veil as doing something that is calculated to sabotage and overthrow the industrial life of this country.  It is useful that Deputies on the other side of the House are beginning to learn, by bitter experience, what that means.  It simply means that the Minister for Industry and Commerce does not want to expose awkward facts.  It is his most odoriferous red herring to draw out whenever it is necessary to raise a good smell, and to throw people off the track, that the person who crossquestions him is sabotaging Irish industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton laid very heavy <Col N="1098" /> emphasis on the dangers of exploiting persons working in factories protected by a monopoly.  I agree with him.  On the Conditions of Employment Bill, I suggested to him that he should put down an amendment giving the Minister for Industry and Commerce power to prescribe the type of employees and the rates of wages and the conditions under which they would work in every monopolistic industry of this country. I suggested that a standard should be set in those monopolistic industries far higher than it would be practical to expect in the ordinary competitive industries of the country.  I shall be interested to see whether, on the Report Stage, Deputy Norton will concern himself with drafting such an amendment.  If he does, I will support him.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton raised this question of exploitation; that there is the danger of the exploitation not only of the men and women working in those factories but of consumers, and the consumers are the working men and women of the country.

There is exploitation going on at the present moment in this country which Deputy Norton is responsible for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me explain.  If the Deputy votes for a tariff of 75 per cent. on a certain commodity it may not exploit the individuals working in the production of that commodity, but it does exploit everybody in the country who has to buy that commodity, and is at the present moment exploiting them.  I have drawn the attention of this House on diverse occasions to specific articles.  I have deliberately chosen articles which are principally purchased and used by labouring men <Col N="1099" /> and women, by people with a very small margin of income over and above what is required to purchase the necessities of life.  I have pointed out to the Minister, and to the Labour Party, that the effect of these prohibitive tariffs of 75 and 100 per cent. was to raise the price of those commodities on the home market and to impose a burden on the consuming public, and in these special cases the consuming public is composed largely of the labouring men and women of the country&mdash;agricultural labourers and industrial labourers.  That is the kind of exploitation I consider to be much graver and much more dangerous than the exploitation which is in embryo in this Resolution.  I have again and again asked the House to join with me in insisting that exploitation of either kind should be prevented by confining ourselves (1) to free competition within the country and (2) to protective tariffs as against prohibitive tariffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>And the effect of prohibitive tariffs is not, on the Deputy's own admission, relevant to this Resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg your pardon; that is so.  But I object to this monopoly business altogether, and I object to this specific monopoly to be granted in respect of thread for more than one reason.  Let me remind the House that we do not even allow a public authority in this country to appoint a dispensary doctor on its own volition without entering into an examination of the claims and qualifications of the various applicants for that position. We do not allow the Civil Service to appoint anyone&mdash;no Minister is allowed to appoint a civil servant&mdash;in the Civil Service without first referring the matter to the Civil Service Commissioners. It has been the policy of the Oireachtas to take out of the hands of persons actively engaged in politics in every department the right to make any public appointment which carries with it emoluments from public funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yet, that is our settled policy in that <Col N="1100" /> regard.  We allow one individual, the Minister for Industry and Commerce to hand out monopolies to individuals from abroad, or to nationals of this country which may be worth anything from £10,000, £20,000, £30,000 £40,000. Is that a desirable situation?  Is it good that a Minister, who is an active politician should have placed upon him the duty of giving to applicants concessions worth anything from £10,000 to £100,000 per annum?  I do not think it is.  I think it is bound sooner or later, as certain as we are sitting here, to bring corruption into the public life of the country, bound to result in grave public distrust and bound to give rise to evils which that kind of patronage always brings in its train, no matter in whom you may vest the patronage. I object to this particular monopoly in Westport because the Minister has never told us what these gentlemen are actually going to do in Westport. We are told they are going to produce thread.  What does that mean?  Are they going to bring in thread as yarn, simply polish it in County Mayo, and put it on reels, or, are they going to dye it in County Mayo?  If so, in what range of colours is the thread to be dyed?  Are they going to bring in raw cotton and genuinely to manufacture by spinning thread?  I am going to suggest that they are not going to spin a single yard.  No thread is going to be manufactured.</P>
    <P>These gentlemen are going to have a complete monopoly of a pretty valuable market, and they are not going to manufacture thread at all. They are simply bringing in the yarn, finishing it and dyeing it in a very restricted range of colours.  If anyone wants a colour other than what these gentlemen have in a very restricted range, he will have to pay an exorbitant price and to take an exorbitant quantity of it in order to justify the dyeing operation.  We have got into the habit of planking on tariffs, restrictions and quotas, and no one ever seems to think of what the repercussions of these tariffs will be.  If you give a monopoly of thread manufacture to Westport, and if you restrict customers of Saorstát <Col N="1101" /> Eireann to a small range of threads, it means that you are going to put every ready-made clothing manufacturer at a very serious disadvantage, if he cannot get the colours of thread required for the trade, unless he is prepared to buy a very large quantity of each particular shade which he may require and unless he is going to pay an exorbitant price for it.  I understand that a great many of the ready-made clothing manufacturers have protested very emphatically against that, and pointed out to the Minister that it would hinder them very considerably. I have not heard the Minister giving any information on that aspect of the situation.</P>
    <P>He told us what he expected the effect of the order would be on the consuming public.  Let the House remember that a great many of the consumers of thread in this country are manufacturers.  I do not believe in offering criticism of a scheme of this kind without making a proposal. I want to say to the Minister that I believe we can establish a thread factory and that we do not want any monopoly at all.  If the Minister has made up his mind about the manufacture of cotton thread, I do not think this scheme should be followed up.  If it is to be followed up I think it could be done much better than in the scheme adumbrated in this resolution.  I venture to say that if the Minister will give me two months I will make a proposal by which we will spin thread, dye it black, white, and two or three standard shades, reel it, pay decent wages, take no more than a fair profit, and maintain the industry without any monopoly at all.  I will undertake to have it done by a firm that stands high in the trade, and I will undertake in the presence of the House to take an interest in the enterprise, or not to take an interest in it, whichever the House thinks best calculated to serve the success of the scheme, and there need not be any monopoly at all.  I am satisfied it could be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe the manufacture of thread in this country is really a genuine proposition at all. Supposing the scheme I adumbrated was attempted it would have to be qualified by this, that the Minister would undertake to give a licence to import free of duty all shades of cotton thread which were not produced in this country, because the Deputy is probably aware that there are about 360 shades in current use. In addition to that, you must be ready to meet perhaps 20 or 25 special shades that it would be quite unthinkable to undertake the dyeing of unless you had an adequate demand.  Therefore, a licence to import free of duty from the principal factory would be wanted for shades to meet special requirements.  In addition to that, the Minister talked about cotton thread but, in fact, they are not going to attempt to manufacture thread in all forms at all because, as far as I am aware, there is no suggestion that Westport is going to try to produce embroidery thread.  It could not produce it in any variety, because there is no market, and therefore the Minister will have to issue licences for imports of embroidery peculiar to the embroidery trade.  Sewing cotton is the only thing they would manufacture there. I do not think it is an economic proposition. I believe consumers must pay more for thread if they are to get an article of the same quality, and as good as they got before.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is resolved to go ahead with his proposal, I urge him to withdraw the whole scheme of restrictions and to leave the market in the Saorstát open.  If he will do that, or postpone this proposal until after the recess, I will undertake to put a scheme before him between this and October 1st, which would call for no monopoly.  I will undertake to manufacture thread and give any reasonable standard of shades, and to offer reasonable guarantees against exploitation of the public, and reasonable guarantees as to the price that the public will have to pay for thread.  It will have to pay more. There is no doubt about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1103" /> Manufacture here means that consumers must pay more unless the public is given an inferior article, but they will not be unreasonably exploited, and the people manufacturing will be reasonably paid and will have reasonable conditions.  Before the Minister gives prohibitive tariffs &mdash; never mind monopoly &mdash; he is entitled to demand the most exhaustive guarantees as to conditions of labour, as to the price at which the commodity will be sold and as to the quality of what is going to be produced. He has not satisfied the House that he has made any such requisition on Westport, and he has not satisfied the House that the persons to whom he is going to give this monopoly are persons who ought to get this monopoly at all.  I mentioned at an earlier stage that so far as my information went one of the gentlemen in question never manufactured thread.  He has a strictly honourable, commercial record in Belfast and in the North of Ireland, but a record which no more qualified him to set up as a manufacturer of thread&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not want to be involved in exploiting the people.  I do not want to be involved in the manufacture of anything that is going to cost the consumers in Saorstát Eireann more than if it were purchased elsewhere.  I have no smack for that kind of enterprise at all.  I do not want anything out of public funds.  I have never got anything from the public funds, and I should be much happier to die without getting anything out of public funds.  Very few people have a scrap of objection nowadays to putting their hand in the public pocket or the public purse and taking out what they can get their claw upon. I do not like that.  I do not want to grow wheat and collect the subsidy. I do not want to grow beet and collect the subsidy.  I do not want to make thread and compel the people to pay for my profits when I am not prepared to give them as good and as cheap an article as they would get elsewhere.  But if this country is determined to do that, and to do it in a way which appears to me to be calculated to inflict a greater hardship on the consuming community than some other method that presents itself to me, I am prepared to recommend that other method to the Government and I should be prepared&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister will get an opportunity of answering me.  If I may say so, he is conducting himself somewhat like a mountebank during this debate.  It would be much better if he would wait and answer me, the leader of the Labour Party and anybody else who intervenes, when the proper times comes.  I would much rather that the Minister or some of his own supporters would engage in the manufacture of this thread and indulge in this profit-making out of protected industries.  But if they will not, I am prepared to exert myself to the best of my ability to get the job <Col N="1105" /> done as cheaply and as efficiently as it can be done under the circumstances in which we find ourselves.  That is the extent of my offer.  When Deputy Walsh leans forward and says: &ldquo;You, yourself, have an interest in starting a thread factory,&rdquo; let the Deputy suggest to his own colleagues, whether in Westport or in Wicklow, that they should take example by me and, before they embark on any such enterprise, get up and inform their colleagues what they propose to do and invite their colleagues to investigate the conditions under which they propose to do it.  If the Deputy does that, and his colleagues take example by what I am doing now, public life will be all the better&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no desire to engage in the manufacture of thread. I have no information as to the terms upon which the people in Westport propose to manufacture thread.  I <Col N="1106" /> have questioned the Minister several times in this House with a view to getting the necessary information and he has consistently refused to give it. There is no question of a brief having been prepared.  There is no question of my having an interest in the manufacture of thread.  I do not want to manufacture thread.  I am quite prepared to allow anybody else to embark on the manufacture of thread and I suggest that it could be done reasonably economically and much better than under this monopolistic system. The essence of the proposal I have to make is that there should be no monopoly, that any citizen who wishes to embark on the production of thread should be free to do so.  That would remove all the objections that we have to offer.  If the Minister says: &ldquo;There is your tariff; there is your market; go ahead, but remember that if any other Saorstát national desires to embark on this business, he can do so,&rdquo; that would remove our objection to the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If these people in Westport have the capacity to produce thread economically and efficiently, they need not be afraid of competition.  If they are doing this work economically and fairly, <i>vis-a-vis</i> their own employees, who is going to jump into a restricted market such as we have here in Saorstát Eireann to share it with them? No sane man will do that.  The only reason people of this kind want a monopoly is either they intend to charge more for the thread than can be reasonably asked for it, or they intend nominally to charge what has been charged in the past but so to reduce the quality that the consumer will get less value for his money than he has been getting.  In the third place, they may propose to staff the whole establishment with women and pay them the lowest possible wage they can get away with.  Therefore, I ask the Minister (1) if he will remove the monopolistic character of this undertaking and open the market to other Saorstát nationals who desire to embark on the industry; (2) if he will inform the House&mdash;if he is determined to go forward on this monopolistic <Col N="1107" /> principle&mdash;what it is exactly that the factory in Westport is going to do; (3) if he has any information from the people in Westport of the standard of quality they are going to maintain and the price at which they are going to make it available to the consuming public.</P>

In the fourth place, I want the Minister to inform us if this undertaking will produce embroidery cotton thread and colours in sewing cotton thread.  Until the Minister gives us the information I have asked, I do not think he ought to have these powers.  What I am particularly interested in is whether the Minister will consider reviewing the position he has taken up in this matter and opening this market to Saorstát Nationals, wherever they come from, who want to embark on the manufacture of thread.  If he does that, I am satisfied he will get a better proposition from some other source&mdash;a proposition from individuals who detest the principle of monopolies and would much prefer to operate competitively in an open market.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate until I heard the speech of Deputy Dillon.  It is very strange that the staff in this factory in Westport seems to be troubling so many Deputies.  I wonder if the worrying of Deputy Norton about the Westport factory is due to the fact that he did not succeed in wiping the eyes of the Westport people as Newbridge did in the case of the people of Tralee. Deputy Dillon, in that style of which he is a past master, indulged in what <Col N="1108" /> I call safe libel by taking advantage of the privileges of this House to make every dirty aspersion on the people connected with that factory, every sly insinuation and every mean implication that it was possible for him to make.  He admitted that he knows absolutely nothing about the factory. Then he gets up and talks about people whose hands are stained with exploiting the Irish people owing to the Government policy of protection. I wonder did any exploitation of the Irish people take place under free trade?  Would it be honest or reasonable for me, coming from the shop-keeping class the same as Deputy Dillon, to say that the shopkeepers of Ireland exploited the Irish people under free trade?</P>

      <P>And that thereby they were a crowd of rogues or thieves.  As the son of a shopkeeper I would certainly resent that, but it would be at least as honest and have as much evidence to support it as Deputy Dillon's statement and vile insinuations about the people who are taking advantage of the protection policy of the Governeent. I wish Deputy Dillon would have the courage to go to Westport and make the speech that he made here to the people of Westport.  I can assure him that he would not be very pleased with the answer&mdash;and, mind you, it would not matter what Party they supported, whether they were supporters of his own Party or supporters of our Party.  But, of course, as I said, Deputy Dillon takes advantage always of the privileges of this House to make any outlandish statement that enters his head.  Deputy Dillon then confessed, though of course he vigorously denied it afterwards, that at the back of his mind was the fact that some people, who are apparently interested in the thread manufacturing business are in touch with him and have put forward something in the nature of a proposition to him; or else Deputy Dillon has discussed this proposition with these people, and now they find that they have been anticipated. <Col N="1109" /> Of course, Deputy Dillon and his friends have been very indignant because they have been anticipated. Although Deputy Dillon has met with disappointment, he should not allow himself to indulge, to say the least of it, in these ill-natured remarks, and he ought to give this enterprise a chance.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton stated that I had given the House no information as to the conditions that were going to be imposed on the company that will manufacture thread at Westport in respect to the rates of wages they are to pay, the types of persons who are to be employed there, and the conditions under which they will be employed.  The exact words used by Deputy Norton were these:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;So far as this House knows there is not going to be any condition imposed on this company in respect of the rates of wages they are to pay.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon, of course, started off his remarks by drawing attention to the fact that Deputy Norton had asked for information concerning rates of wages and told the House that I would not give that information.  When I was speaking on the matter, I assumed that Deputy Norton, as the leader of a Party in this House, and Deputy Dillon, as a Front-Bench member of a group that calls itself a Party, would at least have taken the trouble to have read the terms of this Act under which this Order is being made.  Does Deputy Dillon know what this Act provides in respect of the rates of wages to be paid by firms that get a licence under a reserved commodity order?  Does Deputy Norton know?</P>

      <P>He stated that so far as this House knows there is going to be no condition imposed on this firm <Col N="1110" /> in respect of rates of wages.  The Act provides in Section 25:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The wages paid by the holder of a reserved commodity manufacture licence to persons employed by him for the purpose of the business authorised by such licence shall not be less than would be payable if such business were carried on under a contract between the Minister and such holder containing a fair wage clause similar to that for the time being contained in contracts made by Ministers and Government Departments.</P>
      <P>If any person who is the holder of a reserved commodity manufacture licence acts in contravention of this section, such person shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding £50.</P>

If he had merely taken the trouble of reading the Act he would not have committed himself in that way.  He would have avoided the blunder he made.  He would have avoided another blunder.  He would have seen that there is no power under this Act to impose upon this concern any condition whatever in respect to the type of persons to be employed in the concern or the condition of employment.  There is no provision in the Control of Manufactures Act, under which this licence is being given, under which the Minister is empowered to impose any conditions in respect to these matters.</P>

      <P>There is a Bill before the House, as the Deputy knows, called the Conditions of Employment <Col N="1111" /> Bill, in which the Government is proposing to take, for the first time, power to impose conditions in respect to both these matters; power that will be exercised in order to ensure that the conditions of employment in Irish industries as are we wish them to be.  In that regard, I think I am entitled to make a protest against every occasion upon which a matter relating to Irish industry is raised here being availed of for the purpose of creating the impression, without proof, without evidence, without positive assertion of any kind, that Irish industries are sweat-shops and places where the exploitation of workers takes place.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Norton came in here on Friday and made a speech about the conditions prevailing in a factory in Kildare which manufactures bolts and nuts, he was not speaking about that for the first time, or the second time, or the tenth time, because, for the past two years, on every occasion upon which matters in relation to industry were under discussion we heard all about this one concern in Kildare; and on overy occasion I warned Deputy Norton, as I warn him again, at least to find out something about the conditions of employment in that concern before he commits himself to a definite statement about them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to deal with the matter from two points of view.  First, on the general question. The concern to which Deputy Norton <Col N="1112" /> referred was assisted under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act, and under that Act there is no power to impose any condition whatever in respect to the rates of wages to be paid to the employees of the assisted concern. Nor do I think it is desirable that the State should undertake generally the obligation of fixing the rates of wages to be paid in every industrial occupation.  The policy of the Government in that matter has repeatedly been made clear.  We think it is preferable that the rates of wages in industry should be fixed by agreement between the employers, on one hand, and the trade unions representing the workers on the other.  If there is an admission by Deputy Norton on behalf of the trade union movement, that they are unable to organise the workers, or to organise them in an effective way so as to protect their interests and to prevent exploitation, then the Government are prepared to consider taking to themselves whatever powers are necessary in order to regulate and control rates of wages, but if the Government undertakes that task then it must be allowed to do it alone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Norton has tried to run away from the particular point he raised.  He knew quite well when he raised that matter on Friday that the Government had no control whatever over the rates of wages paid in that concern, that the concern had received no licence of any kind from the Government to which a condition could be attached, that it had no relation whatever to the particular concern, the establishment of which at Westport was relevant to the debate, and yet he brought it in here in order to create the impression that Irish industry as a whole was in a condition in which many of the factories could be called sweat-shops and in others workers were being exploited.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The Deputy had to bring it in once more although he has referred to it here time and time again.  He has referred to it here at least a dozen times.  He has raised it on every occasion on which industrial matters were being discussed here. This one concern in Kildare is a small concern.  In no way can it be regarded as typical of Irish industry as a whole yet the alleged conditions in that one concern are mentioned time and again by the Deputy in order to create the impression that Irish industry is conducted upon the exploitation of workers and upon the payment of low wages.  Deputy Norton, whether he wishes it or not, by adopting that line is playing into the hands of those who are anxious to find some excuse to prevent the development of industry here&mdash;interests that were concerned in the importation of goods from abroad and whose profits are being reduced by the development of production here.  But even if that one concern were as badly run as Deputy Norton alleged, it should not be advanced as typical because it is not typical.</P>

      <P>I am saying that Deputy Norton has advanced as an example of Irish industries that are badly run, where workers are badly paid, that one concern in Kildare.  He has advanced that one example time and time again.  Whether it was his intention or not, he succeeded in conveying the impression that the conditions in that concern were typical of the conditions in Irish industrial concerns generally.  The conditions in that concern are not as Deputy Norton alleged, that 12 are employed at 5/- a week.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, the official debates are not yet available. I am not responsible for testing the accuracy of the Deputy's remarks.  I have no control of the conditions of employment in that concern and I am not responsible for fixing the rates of wages.  The Government has no way open to it of criticising these rates of wages even if the conditions there were as bad as they are alleged to be by the Deputy.  If they are the trade union movement is open to criticism, because the unions insist on keeping the matter of the regulation of wages to themselves.  If they cannot succeed in eliminating conditions like these, subject to their admitting the fact and agreeing to leave the matter to the Government, we are prepared to undertake the exercise of powers to protect the workers in these concerns. In fact, I have been informed by the management of the concern that the conditions of employment are not as the Deputy alleged.</P>

      <P>Thanks to the efforts the Government have adopted to ensure that the evil conditions which have brought about low rates of wages in Great Britain are not reproduced here.  When we embarked upon our industrial programme, we appreciated the fact that because of the industrial deficiency here, we were in a position at all events to be able to avail of the experience of other countries and to avoid the evils associated with industrialisation in other countries.  We have deliberately prevented the development of unnecessary competition. We have before this House at the present time a Conditions of Employment Bill which is designed to give us statutory powers to enforce uniform conditions of employment in different industries, and to ensure that the evils associated with industrialisation in other countries will not be reproduced here.  That Bill has not been paralleled in any democratically controlled country in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton said that instead of denouncing the bad employer, I defended him.  I invite Deputy Norton to quote a single instance on which I defended a bad employer or said anything that might be misinterpreted as a defence of a bad employer.  The Deputy knows quite well, because it has been frequently stated here, the attitude of the Government in relation to industrial conditions and industrial rates of wages generally.  We have brought forward proposals, which are now under consideration, to ensure a general levelling up of rates of wages and conditions of employment in industry, despite the fact that difficulties are being created from many directions to the enactment of that measure and that obstacles of various kinds are being put in the way of it.  Deputy Norton said our whole policy was to get industries established at any price, no matter what exploitation of workers might be involved.  He cannot produce a single shred of evidence of any kind whatever to support that statement.  In fact, the whole history of the industrial revival which has taken place during the past two or three years is a contradiction <Col N="1117" /> of it.  Now, let us deal with this concern at Westport.  It is not a private, uncontrolled monopoly.  It is neither a monopoly nor is it uncontrolled, but Deputy Dillon knows, perhaps better than I do, that there is something approaching a monopoly in relation to sewing cotton at the present time; that there is a combine in Great Britain which is now enjoying, and has enjoyed for a number of years, a practical monopoly of this market.  I never heard Deputy Dillon in this House enquiring what protection the consumers were receiving against the activities of that monopoly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no monopoly in Great Britain, and the Minister knows it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a monopoly, and there has been a monopoly here which, at the present time, is adopting a well thought out and carefully prepared plan to smash this industry at Westport.  I am going to deal with that more fully later on, but I want to point out now that the adoption of this Resolution does not create a monopoly. In the speech, however, in which I proposed the adoption of this Resolution, I informed this House that we proposed to make this sewing cotton a reserved commodity, not because we regarded the making of it a reserved commodity as an essential for the establishment of the industry, but in order to ensure that it would be established in the West of Ireland.  Deputy Dillon said that the industry could be established without a reserved commodity Order.  So did I.  If Deputy Dillon had been here on Friday, he would have known that I said that also, and that I said that the only reason why it was decided to make it a reserved commodity was to give power to the Government to make sure of the establishment of the industry in the West, as we considered it an industry particularly suitable for establishment there.  We could have got it established, without this Order, by the concern that is now engaged in it if we so chose, but the industry would not have been established in Westport or in any other town on the Western <Col N="1118" /> seaboard, and it is necessary to provide industrial development and the opportunities of industrial employment in that area to a much greater extent than, or at any rate to the same extent as, in any other part of the Saorstát. However, no industrial concern engaged in an industry of this kind is going to establish its factory in Westport if it knows that a competitor can start in the centre of the market, in Dublin or in Cork; and we did this in order to ensure that the industry would be located in the West, and for no other reason.</P>
      <P>Neither will the firm be uncontrolled. If Deputies had taken the trouble to read the Act under which the Order is being made, they would have found in it almost two pages of conditions which may be attached to any licence issued under that part of the Act.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton said here that I gave him one scrap of information: that is, the information that the prices to be charged at Westport <Col N="1119" /> were not to exceed the prices charged in Great Britain by the British thread combine.  Of course, Deputy Dillon said that the prices here were going to be higher than the prices charged by the British combine: that this was going to be a concern to exploit the Irish consumer, and that it was the business of the Government to allow that exploitation of the Irish consumer to take place, and that any concern established in Westport or anywhere else was bound to be inefficient and to charge higher prices and exploit the Irish consumer.  Imposed as a condition, in consequence of an undertaking given, the prices, quality for quality, of the thread produced at Westport will not be higher than the prices charged in Great Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, Sir, the Minister purports to quote me as saying that thread produced here must cost more, whereas, in fact, I said that thread spun, manufactured and dyed here would cost more.  Will the thread be spun in Westport?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, that is the question. Will it be spun at Westport?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon said that to describe this factory at Westport as a thread factory is a fraud.  That was the precise term he used.  He did not ask any question.  He made the positive assertion.  He knew all about the concern at Westport and expressed his conviction that it was going to be a fraudulent concern: that it was not, in fact, going to manufacture thread.  The factory is going to undertake such manufacture as is normally done in a thread factory, and, whatever degree of manufacturing it will undertake, it is going to give employment to 200 people in <Col N="1120" /> Westport&mdash;a not inconsiderable number.  It is going to engage in the different processes of manufacture.  It has been capitalised to the extent of £20,000, in the initial stages, but additional capital will be required before all the stages of manufacture can be completed&mdash;all the stages of manufacture from the yarn up.  They are not going to spin cotton yarn, nor do we desire it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It took a long time to knock that out of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already informed the Dáil of what precise processes of manufacture are going to be undertaken by this factory.  If they came forward with the proposal to spin cotton yarn, we would prevent them doing so because we want to get the cotton yarn industry established, and, in order to make that possible, it is necessary to concentrate the production of yarn in one plant.  Therefore, in this concern, yarn is not being spun nor do we want it to be spun, but all the processes of manufacture from the yarn up&mdash;which is the phrase I used on Friday last&mdash;will be undertaken there, and 200 people will be employed in the doing of it.  Deputy Dillon then came forward with an offer to produce another factory himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may consider that offer as withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Act was before the House in 1934 and when this particular part of it was under discussion here, I said there never would be a case in which we would come with an Order to make some commodity a reserved commodity but that we would have Deputies, briefed by interested parties, coming in to say that a better proposition than the one presented by the Government would be forthcoming.  I told the House that, during the statutory period provided in the Act, after publication of the intention to make this Order, another British concern came forward with a proposal.  I have no doubt <Col N="1121" /> that it is the same concern that Deputy Dillon has in mind, and I have no doubt also that that concern &mdash;a very powerful one, with very large resources&mdash;in conspiracy with certain wholesaling houses in this country, have prepared a plan to smash this factory.  The plan was so carefully prepared, and in such a way, that it is going to tax the ingenuity of the Government to defeat it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will learn later.  If he examines the import figures for cotton thread into this State for the last 12 months, and the previous 12 months, he will see a rather considerable change has taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows, because it was explained three weeks ago that the original duty on the cotton thread imposed when that Westport factory was commenced, had been successfully evaded by a particular device.  That will come before the Dáil again in another form.  I merely want to say that Deputies should be careful concerning the interests that approach them in this matter.  The evidence of a concerted attack on Westport is overwhelming.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order. The Minister says that attempt was made to approach certain Deputies.  I am not sure what ground he has for saying that Deputies were approached.

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>Arising out of what Deputy Norton said, it may be necessary for me to say that I have been approached by nobody, though I <Col N="1122" /> sought information from authorities in Great Britain and elsewhere, on thread manufacture.  But I was approached by nobody.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will find that in this, as in many other things, he is wrong as usual.  Deputy Dillon also referred in a disparaging way to the people associated with the factory. He said that one of them was from Belfast, and never made thread in his life.  Does the Deputy ever make the slightest effort to check their accuracy before he comes down here and makes these slanderous statements? So far as I know, no person connected with this concern has any interest in Belfast.  Fifty per cent. of the capital is owned by business men in Westport. The other 50 per cent. is owned by British Thread Mills, Limited, Leicester, a firm with half a million of capital and a first-class reputation. Where did Deputy Dillon get his information that any member of the firm came from Belfast and had no previous experience in the manufacture of thread?</P>

      <P>We are engaged in the establishment of this industry because it is in the nation's interest that it be established.  It is an industry that is quite suitable for establishment in this country and particularly in the West of Ireland.  It is because we regard it as suitable to the West of Ireland, and that it is so suitable that we have made it a reserved commodity.  The industry is being established by a first-class firm, associated with all the technical advantages appertaining to a firm of very high reputation.  It is a firm that has successfully competed against the combine in Great Britain, and has produced thread of first-class quality, and sold it below the combine's price.  Employment growing as production increases will be given to Irish workers to the number of between 150 and 200, when the factory is in full production.  That number of course will not be employed until the factory is in production on a proper scale.  A number of workers have been trained for the work in Leicester. They have now come home and they are training other workers.  It will be some time before a sufficient number are available to enable the factory to get into full production.  Before full production can be undertaken a considerable addition to the factory works will have to be built.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That it is expedient to authorise the payment out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas of any expenses incurred in carrying into effect any Act of the present Session to amend and extend the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933.</P>
      <P>It is not easy to say what the expenditure under the Act will be.  There are two main provisions which will involve expenditure.  One arises from the extension of the definition of the term &ldquo;continuously employed.&rdquo;  That extension of the definition, it is estimated, might cost £25,000, if it had no other effect than to increase the number of claims, but we anticipate that it will have the effect of encouraging people to take shorter terms of work when they offer and, consequently, the additional cost may not be so high as the figure I have mentioned, The second provision involving increase of expenditure arises from the necessity of appointing appeals officers.  In the first year the expenses under that section will be higher than in subsequent years when the arrears of appeals will have been cleared off.  It is expected that in the first year the expenses under that head will be £5,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give us more information with regard to the appeals or could he say when he hopes under the new machinery that the great number of appeals pending will be dealt with?  Apart from the appeals which will necessarily arise as a result of this amending Act, there are 32,000 to 35,000 appeals at present pending.  Could the Minister say in what period he hopes to have these appeals cleared, particularly in view of the fact that many of these cases have been awaiting decision for a period of 12 months or more?  The whole position with regard to appeals is very unsatisfactory at the moment.  Deputies <Col N="1128" /> are continually getting letters from unemployed persons who have appealed asking for that information.  I have received hundreds myself and I am sure other Deputies are in the same position.  The Minister has for a very good reason refused to answer questions in the House as to individual cases.  We are placed in this position at present that the person who has appealed can get no information and we, on his behalf, can get no information. The Minister has not now told us when he hopes that appeals under the principal Act will be cleared off. It should be also noted that, so far as I know, those people who have appealed will not be entitled to retrospective payments when the appeals have been decided in their favour.</P>
      <P>It would appear to me to be to the advantage of the Minister for Finance that the decisions in the case of the appeals should be delayed.  I am not suggesting that that is the reason for the delay, but it would be a very good reason from the point of view of the Minister for Finance. We ought to be told whether the Minister is satisfied with the new machinery he has set up and whether that machinery will be adequate to have these appeals cleared within a reasonable time.  It seems to me that it would be very difficult to clear 30,000 to 35,000 appeals within a reasonable time.  Surely we ought to have from the Minister some information as to what his proposal is&mdash;whether it is proposed first to take the long-standing appeals and give them priority.  It seems to me that men whose cases have been appealed for six, nine or twelve months should have their cases taken first.  Some of the appeals have been pending for more than 12 months and the decision in such cases should be given priority.  Then there are cases of married men with families and great hardships are suffered in those cases. I appreciate the Minister's difficulties in dealing with the matter.  I suggest he ought to take the steps necessary to give clearance to these appeals in the shortest possible time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister indicated the cost of two sections of <Col N="1129" /> this Bill, and he stated that the cost of the amendment in connection with the continuous periods of unemployment would be £25,000.  He said the cost of the appeals section would be approximately £5,000.  What I am mainly concerned with is the saving to the Exchequer that would be effected by one section.  I would like to know from the Minister whether, he is in a position to inform us what the extent of the saving is?  Can the Minister say whether he has made any inquiries and whether we can have some information of that kind so as to be able to appraise the merits of this Bill&mdash;if there are on balance any merits in it?</P>
      <P>When we were discussing the Bill on the last occasion I said it was worthless from the point of view of the unemployed, and I say again that my suspicions in that respect are confirmed. The Minister said on that occasion that there were five good sections in this Bill, and he proceeded to enumerate them.  Some of them are only good when viewed from the standpoint that there is a jam caused by the Minister's own sluggish administration. There has been a complete deluge of appeals in the Department, and that is caused by the Minister's slowness in getting rid of the appeals.  I suggest to the Minister that under this Bill the Exchequer is gaining an amount of money.  The Minister spoke of five sections which are beneficial to the claimants in the Bill, but the amount of benefit in these sections will be nothing as against what will be saved to the Exchequer under Section 11.  If the Minister disputes that, we are entitled to know what sum of money will be saved to the Exchequer under Section 11 so that we can compare that and weigh it.  against the five other sections in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join with Deputy Morrissey in protesting against the grievances in the matter of appeals under the principal Act.  The Minister in replying to a question in this House has already indicated that there are over 30,000 appeals yet to be dealt with, and that 23,000 of these appeals have <Col N="1130" /> been in since January last.  That was the last reliable information we had from the Minister.  That is a hopeless and chaotic state of affairs, and besides being a chaotic state of affairs it is unjust as well, because many of the applicants are persons who appealed against the reduction in the amount of their assistance benefit many months ago.  When their appeals are considered, if it is decided that they are entitled to an increase, they will not be paid retrospectively. In other words, the man who submitted an appeal last August&mdash;if he gets a decision in July this year, having been so lucky as to have waited only 11 months&mdash;even after getting the decision he will not get the benefit retrospectively of the increase.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If I put down a question to-morrow, could I have that information from the Minister?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to get the information and to discuss it.  I am not standing for the person who is not entitled to unemployment assistance benefit.  I am standing for the person who is clearly entitled to unemployment assistance benefit; who has his benefit reduced in the first instance; who makes an appeal against the reduction of his benefit; who has his appeal held up for 12 months, and then gets the decision applied only from the current date.  To put it frankly and plainly, that person is being swindled out of his arrears of benefit for the previous 12 months.  There is no other term to apply to it.  A man makes a claim for benefit; he does not get the benefit to which he thinks he has a right; he appeals; the Appeals Tribunal says: &ldquo;Yes, you are entitled <Col N="1131" /> to the full benefit, but because of the way in which the Act is drawn we are not going to give it to you from the time at which you were entitled to it. We are going to give it to you only from a date 12 months later than that on which you should have got it.&rdquo; That seems to me to be downright legalised swindling.  Even in this amending Bill, which I do not want to discuss on this motion, the Minister is not taking any power whatever to remedy that obvious injustice to unemployed persons.  It is proposed to continue this scheme, by which appeals will be held up, and under which, when the applicants get a favourable decision, it will apply only from the current date instead of from the date on which the appeal was lodged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister might, if he had no amending Bill before the Dáil, plead that the removal of the injustice would require amending legislation.  He might have pleaded also that the legislative programme was such that he could not have that amending legislation at the moment.  But here we have an amending Bill.  Is not this an opportune moment for inserting an amendment in that Bill which will give such persons the right to their full benefit as from the date on which they made an appeal for that benefit, in cases where that appeal is held up by the Tribunal to which they apply?  I think the Minister must admit that the present position is grossly unfair to those people.  There has not been a single attempt to defend the refusal to apply a favourable decision retrospectively when appeals are held up for a period of six or 12 months through no fault of the applicants themselves. If a man were to make an appeal in the month of July, and got a decision in the month of August, one might perhaps understand the position, although one could not logically explain why the decision on his appeal only took effect from the current date. But where a man submits an appeal and, for reasons outside his control but within the control of the Minister, his claim for benefit is not decided until 12 months afterwards, surely <Col N="1132" /> that man has a strong claim to be paid the higher amount of benefit retrospectively. If the Minister is convinced of the justice of that claim, I think he should avail of this amending Bill in order to make it possible for such persons to obtain that benefit.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this whole Unemployment Assistance Act to which I should like to call attention.  I think many Deputies will have had experience, during the past couple of months especially, of a large number of cases where payment of unemployment assistance benefit has been disallowed, no evidence being produced to the claimants as to the reasons for such action.  Many cases have come to my notice where persons who have been drawing benefit for a long period have been notified by the local employment exchange that their benefit has been stopped pending investigation.</P>

      <P>Very well, Sir.  I accept your ruling on that.  Perhaps the same point really arises in connection with the appeals legislation which it is proposed to set up under the amending Act.  At present, many of the applicants for unemployment assistance benefit are having that benefit stopped. No explanation is given to them as to why it is stopped.  They present themselves at the employment exchange and inquire why their benefit has been stopped.  They are informed that certain investigation has to be made into the circumstances of their case. Perhaps some of them are fortunate enough to be able to ascertain that the complaint is in the form of an anonymous letter.</P>

      <P>I accept that ruling.  I would like to know if I can have from the Minister some idea as to the speed at which the 31,000 appeals now on hands&mdash;probably the number has increased since the Minister gave us information relating to them&mdash;will be dealt with?  The Minister told us recently that he thought it would be nearly two years before all the appeals were dealt with if the old machinery were the only machinery at his disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now it is proposed to improve the machinery of the principal Act in the manner suggested in the amending Bill. I would like to know from the Minister when we may expect to see a substantial diminution in the 31,000 appeals now pending.  Would the Minister say what period he anticipates will elapse before all these appeals are disposed of?  In view of the fact that the hearing of these appeals has been delayed so long, by reason of the defects in the principal Act introduced by the Minister, will he not consider at this stage the introduction of an amendment to this Bill to ensure that, <Col N="1136" /> in cases where an abnormal delay has occurred in dealing with appeals, a retrospective decision may be arrived at so that the persons who have appealed and whose benefit has been increased will not lose as a result of the delay which has arisen through circumstances outside of their control?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Rice Mr. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the Minister, when replying, will deal with some of the points raised by Deputy Norton. The Deputy has pointed out that there are over 30,000 appeals pending.  I think it is correct to say that 23,000 appeals have been pending since January last, and some of the others for a much longer period.  It is an absolute denial of justice to those people to have their appeals held up for such a long period.  A worse feature of this is that the people who have been successful in their appeals are to be deprived of benefit during the whole of the period that the appeal was pending.  That, I know, is due to a defect in the principal Act.  I think the Minister should avail of this measure to remedy that defect.  I hope the Minister does not propose to adhere to the old vicious principle that, where there is a dispute between the State and the subject, the subject is not to get ordinary justice.  In recent years we remedied, to some extent, that state of affairs by providing in a case where, say, the Minister's car ran over a citizen, that the citizen is entitled to seek a remedy. It seems to me, however, that the procedure that has been followed in connection with this unemployment assistance is really putting into effect the old vicious principle to which I have referred.  When Deputy Norton urged that people whose claims to benefit were allowed by the Appeals Tribunal should be paid benefit retrospectively, the Minister asked what about the other side of it, where they are not entitled to benefit?  Does the Minister mean to argue that if I have a claim against him and that it is held to be bad, and that, say, Deputy Norton has a good claim against him, that one is to be taken as balancing the other?  Surely, the Minister is not going to take up that attitude, <Col N="1137" /> because I submit that each case should be taken on its merits and justice done to each individual as between him and the State.  Why should people whose claims have been allowed be deprived of benefit, if it is found that they are entitled to it, during the period that their appeal was pending?  Will the Minister tell us when he thinks these appeals are going to be dealt with, because the long delay that has taken place is really a denial of justice to those people?  They are being kept out of their rights, and that is a very serious matter for the poor people concerned. In some cases there has been a delay of more than 12 months in dealing with appeals.  I suggest that is a denial of justice to these people, and, now that the Minister has the opportunity, I suggest to him that he should take power to remedy that matter forthwith.</P>

      <P>I made no reference to the eligibility of claimants.  I am referring to appeals lodged against the amounts granted.  The point that I want to emphasise is that when an appeal is allowed and when it has been supported by evidence, there is an apparent injustice to a claimant in view of the fact that under present legislation it is not possible to make the award of the Appeals Tribunal retrospective.  The Minister, by way of interruption, made a remark that may or may not be reasonable.  That depends entirely on the extent to which it is supported by figures.  The Minister put this question to Deputy Norton: what about those cases in which the amount is reduced?</P>

      <P>That argument, like any other kind of argument, is one that is open to be supported by facts and figures.  Would the Minister support his argument by giving us the number of cases in which, in fact, the amount has been reduced?  Therefore, what he demonstrates is that his officers have been slack, lazy or inefficient, in making the original award. The case made originally in this Chamber appears to have been that the action of his officers was entirely in the other direction.  There are 30,000 appeals against the amount assessed as being inadequate.  How many notices of appeal has the Minister against assessment on the grounds that people got too much? The Minister's interruption could be supported if he showed that there were 30,000 appeals against the amount granted, on the grounds that it was excessive.  Otherwise, it merely means the big-tongued interruption in order to side-track discussion of a point really important to the persons concerned.  There will be general agreement, I think, that men out of work who rely on State assistance in order to support themselves and their families are, at least, entitled to fair play.  If we were dealing with a pensioner, <Col N="1139" /> a military pensioner, an old age pensioner, or an employee of a firm the precedent has already been established in this House that when an award is made it applies from the date of the claim.</P>
      <P>It should be conceded that the State should be the model employer.  Employers or firms are within their rights if they follow the example of the State. Let us apply the principle being established by the Minister to private employers or big firms.  If that principle is followed outside the House, conditions of employment, instead of being bettered by this Bill, will be very considerably worsened.  What does it mean in practice?  That the coin the State tosses has two heads; that it does not matter what side turns up, the State wins and the unemployed man loses.  We were told in the Budget that we are living in times when there is the direst necessity for economy, but we mean economy to be effected at the expense of the unemployed. Could the Minister say if any estimate has been made of the saving to the State by each week's delay in the hearing of these appeals?  Is it not apparent to everyone that the longer the machine delays the hearing of the appeals the greater economy there is for the State, and the greater the loss to the unemployed?  It is unreasonable to expect this House to approve of the principle that where there is an appeal against the amount granted, if the appeal is confirmed, the extra money will only be granted from the date the appeal is heard.  Meanwhile, on the person against whom the appeal is lodged, money can be saved every week, every month and every year that there is delay in hearing the appeal. That is unreasonable, and the Minister should reconsider the position.</P>

      <P>There are 30,000 appeals awaiting decision for several months.  Can the Minister tell the House what he has done to satisfy himself that he has the proper people in charge of the machinery of the Act? Has the Minister made any effort to see that he has got officials, from the <Col N="1140" /> highest to the lowest, best fitted to operate the Act?  If the House could get some information from the Minister in that respect it would know where it was.  Section 15 (1) (b) is quoted to every unfortunate applicant for assistance. I came across a case recently where a man, after attending the employment exchange and signing for unemployment assistance, secured employment on the way home.  That was on a Saturday morning.  He returned to the labour exchange to report the fact, but the office was closed.  The following week he could not get away from his work and he sent as his deputy an unemployed person, with the necessary form, to draw the few shillings that were coming to him.  I understand that he got 1/8 in respect of the Saturday, and because of that error&mdash; although he got the employment on his own initiative&mdash;payment of benefit due to him has been held up.  We hear a lot of talk about unemployed people being told that the unemployment officer is not satisfied that they are genuinely unemployed and seeking employment.  This is a case where a man, without any effort of the Department, got employment and as a result is severely penalised.  He is at present in dire distress.  The Minister should take particular note of cases that come before the Department to see if the right people are in the right places, as far as the administration of the Unemployment Assistance Act is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to another matter which affects my constituency.  The married quarters attached to Kilkenny military barracks happen to be a few feet outside the borough boundary.  The building was idle for a long time, and the Corporation got permission from the Department of Defence to accommodate people from slum areas in it temporarily.  Because these people reside in the married quarters, which are outside the boundary, they are described as rural workers, and under the Order recently issued by the Minister are debarred from receiving unemployment assistance.  I ask the Minister to look into this matter, <Col N="1141" /> because I hold that these people are really citizens, and should not be deprived of unemployment assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In the cases referred to by Deputy Pattison, the applicants can lodge an appeal to the Court of Referees, and if the Court of Referees decides in their favour, they are entitled to claim retrospective of the date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesPPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking of people who were held not to be genuinely seeking work.  If people of that description appeal to the Court of Referees, a favourable decision upon the claims involves payment retrospective to the date of the claim.  These were not the type of appeals that Deputies on the opposite benches referred to.  In the case of persons resident outside a borough boundary that difficulty is bound to arise, where you have differential rates of payment for different areas.  Somewhere the boundary must be, and somewhere there will be persons just inside and just outside the boundary.  We have to work upon the boundaries that were there, namely, county boroughs and urban districts, and certain anomalies are bound to arise in that regard.  In fact, the Bill before the Dáil is designed to enable us to avoid certain obvious anomalies due to the alteration of county boroughs or urban districts.  I think Deputy O'Higgins quite clearly mixed up in his mind appeals to the Appeals Committee against the refusal of qualification certificates or against the means stated in the certificate, with appeals to the Court of Referees and the Umpire against the refusal of assistance.  These are different matters.  It was clear Deputy Rice also did not appreciate the difference between them.  A person whose appeal is awaiting the decision of the Appeals Committee may, in fact, have been in employment from the date of the appeal.  He may have been employed when he made the appeal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It works both ways. A person on appeal may have the rate of means stated on the certificate decreased and consequently the rate of unemployment assistance which he may be eligible to receive may be increased or the reverse may happen. We are not proposing to recover retrospectively the amount he may have been overpaid.  We cannot pay retrospectively the amount he was underpaid, because the mere possession of a qualification certificate does not entitle him to unemployment assistance.  It is one of the things that qualify him to receive unemployment assistance but, after he has got his qualification certificate, he must prove his eligibility&mdash; that he conforms to the condition about which Deputy Pattison has been speaking, that he is unemployed, that he is genuinely seeking work, that he is unable to obtain work and that he has complied generally with the conditions set out in Section 15 of the Act.  It is only when he satisfies the unemployment assistance officer on these matters that he is entitled to receive unemployment assistance and, so far as the Department of Industry and Commerce is concerned in the administration of the Act, we must regard as the means of that person the means stated in the qualification certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another consideration in that regard.  Any system of determining these appeals must be entirely detached from the ordinary working of the Department.  At present, the person possessing a qualification certificate who is denied unemployment assistance on any of the grounds on which he may be denied unemployment assistance may appeal to the Court of Referees, which is a body consisting of a neutral and impartial chairman and an equal number of representatives of workers and employers in the area <Col N="1143" /> concerned.  It is that body determines and decides the appeal.  In certain cases, with the permission of the unemployment assistance officer and the court, there may be an appeal from that body to the umpire but the whole machinery of the appeals is outside the administration of the Department and it is desirable to keep it so.  Nor do I believe that, in relation to appeals of that kind, there is any considerable delay anywhere.</P>

      <P>These are appeals to the Appeals Committee established at the headquarters of the Department in Dublin against the refusal of qualification certificates or the assessment of the means of applicants in relation to qualification certificates.  Undoubtedly, these appeals have accumulated. I agree that the machinery established by the Act for the determining of these appeals was inadequate to deal with them in the initial stages&mdash;and the initial stages only.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Once the arrears are cleared off the position will be quite <Col N="1144" /> normal and the machinery provided by the original Act will probably be effective to keep the appeals up to date. Deputy Norton inquired what was the saving anticipated in consequence of the reduction of uncalculated means. It is impossible to give a net figure. It is true that, if that section of the Bill stood alone and no other changes were likely to follow&mdash;if there were no change in the number of persons unemployed and no change in the proportion of unemployed persons who have means&mdash;a saving would result which might amount to £150,000 in this year but, against that, there are all the other provisions&mdash;the change in the definition of &ldquo;continuous unemployment,&rdquo; the expeditious disposal of the appeals and so forth.</P>

      <P>I did not say that.  The change in the definition of &ldquo;continuous unemployment&rdquo; may cost £25,000.  The salaries of the officers constituting the new appeals organisation may cost, in the present year, £5,000.  It will be less in other years.</P>

      <P>That is so.  What the net result to the Exchequer will be in the present year it is hard to say.  It may be that the saving under Section 11 will be completely wiped out by the increased cost resulting from the expeditious disposal of appeals and the operation of the &ldquo;continuous unemployment&rdquo; definition.  In that way, the cost of the Unemployment Assistance Act might even be increased.  One cannot be certain.  The number of persons claiming fluctuates from day to day.  What the position may be at any time it is impossible to say.  We have not got sufficient experience of the Act to enable us to make reliable estimates.  It has been in full operation for the first time this year, and to enable us to formulate proper estimates the machinery would require to be in operation a number of years. Section 11 effects a saving, which saving I am quite prepared to justify, <Col N="1145" /> but the other provisions of the Bill I have mentioned will necessitate increased expenditure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly.  The new procedure for determining appeals will, I think, commend itself to everybody.  It is of the elastic nature which I described, so that it can be expanded to whatever extent is necessary to enable the appeals to be disposed of.  The delay in disposing of these appeals is due to the inadequate nature of the machinery, which was set up to deal with normal conditions and which proved incapable of dealing with the abnormal conditions which operated in the period immediately following the bringing into operation of the scheme. The new procedure in respect of appeals will enable these abnormal appeals to be cleared off, and there will be no undue delay in doing that once the new machinery is availed of. There were no Exchequer considerations behind the delay in dealing with these appeals.  The officers appointed on the Committee have been working almost night and day at their ordinary duties in the Department as well as at their duties on the Appeals Committee. It became obvious at an early stage that, no matter how hard they worked, they could not keep pace with the number of appeals.  Everybody who was refused a qualification certificate, or whose means were fixed at any figure whatever, exercised his right of appeal.  It cost him nothing and it might have brought him in an increased amount weekly in unemployment assistance.  In the case of every one of these appeals the decision of the unemployment assistance officer was against the applicant.  The unemployment assistance officer, on the information supplied as to the means of the applicant, fixed his means, and the decision of that officer was arrived at with a knowledge of the decisions which had been given in previous cases.  In an increasing number of cases in future the decision of the <Col N="1146" /> Appeals Committee will be against the applicant, because, following upon the determination of typical cases by the Appeals Committee, the unemployment assistance officers were asked to revise their decisions in certain cases where their decisions seemed to call for revision. In 9,000 cases the applications have been reconsidered by the unemployment assistance officers.  So that a series of decisions has been arrived at which will enable these unemployment assistance officers to make their decisions uniform and to apply the same considerations to the determination of applications in one area as in another.  Therefore, I think that the hardship which may be inflicted on certain persons by the delay in considering appeals has been exaggerated in cases where a decision upon the applications of these persons has been given.  In any event one of the main purposes of this Bill is to provide new appeals machinery for the future.</P>

      <P>I cannot understand why the Minister wants to assume that nobody understands the provisions of this Act except himself.  This is a clear case and the Minister's advisers will tell him it is a fairly typical case.  John Murphy makes a claim for unemployment assistance benefit and gets 6/6 per week, instead of 12/6 per week which he would be entitled to, having a wife and five children and being resident in a rural area.  John Murphy says &ldquo;The amount of benefit allowed to me is inadequate, or is not what I am entitled to under the Act&rdquo;, and proceeds to the Labour Exchange, gets a pink appeals form, and submits an appeal against the reduction in the amount of his benefit.  John Murphy continues to draw his 6/6 per week while his appeal is before the unemployment appeals committee.  The appeal is before that committee for nine months, during which time John Murphy is still getting 6/- per week less than he believes he is entitled to. If after having had the appeal before them for that time, the committee say be should have got 12/6 in the first <Col N="1148" /> instance, they revoke the qualification certificate which he had showing means of 8/- per week and they proceed to give him the 6/- arrears as from the date upon which they decided the case.  But John Murphy's circumstances have been unchanged during the previous nine months; yet he is denied the arrears benefit which he is clearly entitled to, since his circumstances were unchanged, and the committee decide the case on the same set of circumstances as operated when John Murphy got the 6/6 in the first instance.  There is a simple typical case.</P>

The Minister says as a reason why that person should not get the sum to which he is entitled: &ldquo;What are you going to do with him during the period he is employed?&rdquo; You do not give him the 6/6 when he is employed and you need not give him the arrears of 6/- in respect of the weeks during which he is employed. There is no difficulty in calculating the period he was unemployed, and in respect of that period he ought to get the arrears of benefit.  That is a simple proposition which it is not possible for anybody to confuse.  I suggest to the <Col N="1150" /> Minister that it is a very typical case. I do not say that it represents all the cases that are with the appeals committee, but it is typical of a category of cases and the Minister ought to have no difficulty in deciding on the obvious merits of a case of that kind and meeting it in this Bill.</P>

      <P>Is it not on all-fours with the old age pensions?  If any person applies for a pension he is adjudged to be entitled to a pension or not to be entitled to a pension. Secondly, a decision is arrived at as to what means he has.  If the pensions officer decides that he is entitled to 8/- he gets 8/- for a considerable time. He then applies for 10/- and there is an appeal against that.  The appeal hangs fire for eight or nine months and, eventually, the Minister for Local Government decides that he is and was entitled to 10/- from the date of his application.  He then gets 2/- per week in respect of each week which has elapsed since the date of his application. Take an unemployed man seeking unemployment assistance, having got his qualification certificate showing his means to be 8/-, as in John Murphy's case, who appeals on the ground that they are not, and that lies out for 15 months.  He has been drawing 6/6 for, say, 60 weeks out of these 15 months because he has not been unemployed all the time.  He has only got 60 weeks' unemployment assistance. He alleges in his appeal that in respect of each week's unemployment assistance received he was docked 6/-, to which he was entitled, owing to the error of the unemployment assistance officer.  The Appeals Committee say at the end of 15 months that John Murphy was right and the unemployment assistance officer was wrong.  John Murphy was in fact entitled to 6/- more than the unemployment assistance officer showed in his certificate. John Murphy's certificate showed his means to be 8/- a week when they have not been more than 2/-.  What on earth difficulty is there in sending a message down to the labour exchange where John Murphy drew his benefit and saying: &ldquo;Since January 1st, 1935, <Col N="1151" /> how many weeks' benefit did John Murphy draw?&rdquo;  The answer comes back: &ldquo;He drew 30 weeks' benefit and then he was employed for a period. Then he drew ten weeks' benefit and he was employed for a period.  Then he drew 20 weeks' benefit and he was employed for a period and he is actually employed now.&rdquo;  Will it tax the ingenuity of the Department of Industry and Commerce to multiply, say, 60 by 6 and then divide the net result by 20 and pay the man the sum due to him in £ s. d.?  What is the trouble about it?</P>

      <P>I have the utmost confidence in the mathematical ability of any Government at the head of which President de Valera presides, and I have not the slightest doubt that this will tax their capacity.  It is judicrous to suggest that that creates any difficulty, because it does not.  The Minister says that they do not propose to recover any over-payment or to recoup for any underpayment.  I disagree with that principle because the mistake, if there be a mistake, is that of an officer of the Government.  I think we should recoup for underpayment, but I do not think that you should compulsorily recover overpayment unless the Department is satisfied that that overpayment has been secured by conscious fraud on the part of the applicant.  If the Department makes a mistake, and pays a very poor person three or four shillings a week too much, it is not reasonable that at the end of a long period it should endeavour to recover that money, unless it was fraudulently obtained by the applicant, who then has been guilty of a criminal offence by defrauding the Government. Then it is perfectly legitimate to penalise him and to require him to return the money, and possibly to punish him in addition.  There is, however, no shadow of equity in the plea that we do not propose to recoup for underpayment, nor do we propose to <Col N="1152" /> recover overpayment.  There is an obligation on the Government to repair their own errors.</P>
      <P>By the Minister's own admission, where the qualification certificate bears on its face too high an assessment of means, that assessment is an error on the part of a servant of the Department, and it is the duty of the Department to repair it.  I should like to ask the Minister if an amendment to that effect is put down for the Report Stage will he favourably consider it?  Will he accept an amendment on Thursday morning to that effect?</P>

      <P>On Section 4, Sir.  I should like to raise the question of the definition of dependency as set out in the Bill and to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that, in certain circumstances, under the Unemployment Insurance Act, a person is entitled to an allowance in respect of a housekeeper who lives in the house and looks after the children where the wife of the claimant is deceased.  I should like the Minister to extend the scope of dependency in this section, so as to ensure that a person who found it necessary to employ someone to look after young children&mdash;because, obviously, it is not a task that a man can perform efficiently&mdash;would be entitled to claim benefit in respect of the person who so assisted in the rearing of the family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that, if we were to extend the class of persons who could be regarded as dependents for the purpose of getting increased payments of assistance, we could go very far indeed and still be dealing with cases which are quite common from time to time.  I am afraid that it is not possible to do that.  As a matter of fact, this section in this Bill effects only three changes which experience has shown to be necessary without unduly extending the scope of the principal Act.  In the first place, we achieve a certain uniformity in the definition of dependency.  In the principal Act, different terms are used in different sections.  For instance, <Col N="1157" /> the term &ldquo;wholly or mainly supported&rdquo; is used in one case; the term &ldquo;undertaking responsibility&rdquo; is used in another case; as also the terms &ldquo;liable for support&rdquo; and &ldquo;normally supported&rdquo; These different phrases all appear in the principal Act and have, in fact, the same meaning. Accordingly, here, the phrase used is &ldquo;wholly or mainly supported&rdquo; as the definition of dependency in all cases. Then, we are extending the definition of dependents in order to include invalid children over 18 years of age, and we are restricting it in order to exclude the wife of an applicant who is herself in possession of means of any kind sufficient to support herself. These are the only changes effected here, and I do not think we could contemplate any elaboration of this section at this stage until we have more experience of the working of the Act and of the charges on public funds that are likely to result therefrom. I want Deputies to appreciate the fact that the existence of the Unemployment Assistance scheme in its present form is going to depend largely on the country's liability to provide the funds necessary to enable it to be maintained, and that it would be a mistake at this stage to do more than is contemplated in the principal Act as amended by this Act until we have had more experience on that subject.  If the annual cost of the scheme should decrease for any reason, then we might contemplate various amendments in order to effect improvements in the scheme which will suggest themselves to many Deputies.  If, on the other hand, the annual charge should increase and continue to increase, then it might be necessary to exclude certain classes already included.  I would not be prepared to accept any amendment which would involve increased cost, other than the amendments embodied in the Bill, until we have more experience.</P>

      <P>On Section 8, sub-section (2), a case has come to my notice&mdash;as a matter of fact, it was brought to my notice by a Deputy of this Party&mdash;where an applicant for unemployment assistance benefit thought that he would have a better chance of obtaining employment if he moved from a rural area into an urban area and proceeded, therefore, to move his family into the urban area.  When he arrived there, he made a claim for unemployment assistance benefit but his claim was turned down because he was not a resident there for twelve months and had not worked there for the period of three months, which would entitle him to it.  In addition to that, by reason of the fact that he no longer resided in the rural area, he was denied benefit there also.  I can see, of course, that there are certain plausible reasons for this, but I do not think that they are all 22 carat reasons such as that it is desirable to stop the movement of populations from rural areas into towns merely for the purpose of getting a higher rate of unemployment assistance benefit.  If, however, for good and sufficient reasons, the man goes into an urban area or into a county borough area to reside, while the Bill imposes penalties on him by not allowing him the urban rate, I think it is extraordinary that he should be denied his claim to unemployment assistance benefit at the rate which was applicable to him while he was residing in the rural area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole purpose is to discourage people employed in rural areas from moving into urban areas in search of work, and we make it a condition that he does not do that.  The tendency for unemployed persons in rural areas is, if unemployed for some time, to drift into the cities and towns. That only aggravates the unemployment problem generally.  The whole purpose of this provision of the original Act is to discourage such movement of the unemployed into the towns.  The provisions are there, but a person does not become entitled to receive unemployment <Col N="1160" /> assistance in the county borough until he has either completed 12 months' residence or three months' work.  We are not preventing a person from coming in for the purpose of getting employment, but we are preventing him getting unemployment assistance at once.

Take the case of a person who resides in Dundrum, County Dublin, and is in receipt of unemployment assistance benefit at the rate of 12/6 because he has a wife and five children to maintain.  He moves into the City for good and sufficient reasons.  Unemployed men do not move as a matter of luxury or as a hobby.  He has good and sufficient reason, or else he would not move his furniture and belongings from Dundrum into some place in the City.  It is an expensive pastime to indulge in, but supposing there are good and sufficient reasons to induce him to move into the City.  That person, if he resides in the City for 12 months, or works for three months, is to be entitled to unemployment assistance benefit when out of work and to get £1 per week having regard to the extent of his dependency.  But the Minister is not satisfied with depriving him of his claim for £1.  He also disallows that person the 12/6 a week that he was receiving in Dundrum.</P>

Does the Deputy think that that is a suggestion that the Dublin worker would welcome?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That trick is too patent altogether.  What the Minister is doing, in that case, is not distributing the benefit that the man would get amongst the other Dublin workers; he is simply putting it into the pocket of the Exchequer.  What defence has the Minister to make of an arrangement by which a man, who, for good and sufficient reasons, moves from a rural area into an urban, should be denied the benefit of the urban rate and also the benefit of the rural rate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to allow that in respect of any machinery that exists.  Clearly the unemployed man should be entitled to benefit no matter where he resides.  The State has no right to impose such penalties because a man merely moves from one place to another.  In the primitive days of the seventeenth century there was a law in existence known as the Law of Parochial Settlements, under which a person could be dealt with if he moved.  But it was not claimed, then, that there was a Fianna Fáil Government in power, or that there was any democratic Government in power.  In the year 1935, I think, it is altogether a tyrannical imposition to deny a person his claim to benefit simply because he moves from Dundrum into Dublin City.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, or from Connemara or from Galway.  He should not be deprived of benefit simply because he moves.  People of that kind are coming into Dublin and into other cities in the country.  That drift has been going on for the last 70 years, and it has not been stopped in the last three years.  When a person does move, as a matter of fact, there must be some very good reason why he <Col N="1162" /> should move.  Unemployed men do not usually move in any promiscuous way, and when they do move, I think they should be entitled to unemployment assistance benefits at the same rates.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister say exactly what is in his mind in regard to paragraph (c), sub-section (1) of Section 9?  The section says that a person shall be disqualified for receiving unemployment benefit &ldquo;(c) while he is an inmate of any institution maintained wholly or partly out of public moneys or by a local authority.&rdquo; It is agreed that if sick in a county home he ceases to be eligible, because he does not fulfil the conditions under Section 15 of the Principal Act.  Suppose a man is able-bodied, and is looking for work, and has nowhere to live, and, in his destitution, finds his way into a county home because there is no other place wherein he can lay his head, why deprive him of unemployment assistance?  Perhaps the Minister has something in his mind which is not present to me, at the moment, and I would be obliged if he would let me know.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a new provision. We have tried to avoid legislation by reference, and so we have re-enacted the original provision in its amended form.  The purpose of this section is to make it possible for an unemployed person to draw either unemployment assistance or insurance benefit at his discretion.  The unemployed person has an option. That particular paragraph appeared in the original Act, and it provides that where a person is maintained in an institution, out of public funds, it is not proposed to provide him with additional support out of public funds. The whole purpose of the Act is that the person who through unemployment is not in a position to maintain himself is to be given assistance until he can find work.  If that person is maintained <Col N="1163" /> in some other way out of public funds the need for this assistance does not arise.</P>

      <P>I think this section of the Bill explains why the Bill has been introduced.  I think if Section 11 were not in the Bill there would not be the same haste to have this amending Bill introduced.  I asked the Minister on the Second Stage of this Bill, and I asked him again on the Money Resolution to-day, to indicate what the Executive Council expected to save for the Exchequer under this section.  The Minister said he could not indicate what would be the saving to the Exchequer under the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>At all events, we have it that under Section 11 alone, assuming the Bill contains no other section but that section, in this financial year the Exchequer expects to save £150,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this section the <Col N="1164" /> Minister stated that in the present financial year if that section stood alone, and there were no beneficial sections in this amending Bill, the result of the saving to the Exchequer would be higher than £150,000 in a normal full year.  I do not know if I am right in making this calculation, but I assume that the persons who are described as persons of means in the return, as persons who are applicants for unemployment assistance benefit, or persons who are in fact in receipt of unemployment assistance benefit are really persons who have means of the type which is clearly taken into calculation in calculating the claim for benefit. According to the information supplied by the Minister there are 75,000 persons with means in receipt of benefit under the Act, and in respect of everyone of these, if that figure is correct&mdash;and it is an official figure&mdash;if the deduction from it is correct, in respect of every one of these the State would save in a normal year £2 12s.  So that if these 75,000 persons have means of 2/- a week or more, then the Exchequer would save 75,000 times £2 12s., or close on £190,000, assuming the same number of persons continue to be entitled to unemployment assistance benefit and have that amount of means.  That, of course, is what the Minister is trying to put over on the House in this particular section.  We have it now clearly, at all events, from the Minister that under Section 11 standing alone the Exchequer will save £150,000.  He may plead that with the other five beneficial sections the Bill may result in the Exchequer being asked to pay more, or it may have the effect of substantially reducing the £150,000 or the £190,000 as I calculated.  But the Minister has not even pleaded that the five beneficial sections which he relied upon last week during the discussion on this Bill will absorb the whole saving under Section 11.  I suggest to the Minister that if he had a shred of such belief even a little judicious exaggeration would have enabled him to claim that the other five would have absorbed the £150,000, and we <Col N="1165" /> would have been told long ago that the saving under Section 11 would be wiped out by the other sections.  The real position is that the Minister knows that he will save under Section 11 a sum very much greater than he will spend under the other sections of the Bill which he may claim to be advantageous to the unemployed persons. But even the other five sections which the Minister relied upon are not all for the benefit of the unemployed. The new appeals machine will cost £5,000, but the unemployed will not pocket one halfpenny of that. It is because I believe that Section 11 will wipe out the benefits which the unemployed are getting under this Bill that I believe, from the point of view of the unemployed, it is a worthless Bill except that in some respects it holds out the hope that the people who had been entitled to benefit under the principal Act, and who are not able to get that benefit because of the chaotic number of appeals pending, that I have any kind of regard for any of its provisions.  At all events, when this Bill is passed, the unemployed are going to get less benefit than they are getting at present.  The Minister wanted to make the point the other day that this Bill was a good Bill from the point of view of the unemployed.  If saving £190,000 at the expense of the unemployed is regarded as giving them benefit, then every burglar in this country is a public benefactor.  If it is regarded as a benefit to take that money out of the pockets of the unemployed, then every miscreant in the country who steals the people's money can claim under the Minister's definition to be in fact public benefactors.  This Bill is raiding the pockets of the unemployed. It is going to take £190,000 from the unemployed in the same year as £300,000 is going to be taken from them under two Unemployment Period Orders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That admission of the Minister is useful.  Approaching the problem of balancing the Budget and indicating what might be saved in a variety of ways, the Minister for Finance said he would save £300,000 by employment period orders, by reason of the fact that certain preference would be given to persons employed on public works&mdash;and they will be more numerous this year&mdash;and by reason of Section 11, which shows that when this whole Bill is examined it is regarded as an economy Bill, because this Bill is expected to make a contribution to the £300,000 which the Minister for Finance indicated in his Budget statement would be saved in the payment of unemployment assistance benefit this year.  The fact remains, therefore, that so far as Section 11 is concerned it is in this Bill, so that notwithstanding the other provisions of this Bill it is intended to make a contribution to balancing the Budget, and the unemployed are again to be singled out for the purpose of bearing burdens of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this is a most outrageous proposal in this section.  When the principal Act was introduced in 1933, and that is not so long ago, the Executive Council and the Minister for Industry and Commerce then subscribed to the belief that the means exemption limit should be 2/- per week and that income which did not exceed 2/- per week should be disregarded for the purpose of applications for benefit, and for the purpose of determining title to the full rate of benefit.  I take it, therefore, that the Executive Council were convinced in 1933 that the figure to put down for a means exemption limit was <Col N="1168" /> 2/- per week.  Now, in 1935, we are told that the 1933 figure was wrong; that it was indefensible, and that we must go back to 1/- per week as the maximum means exemption limit.  If we were abolishing completely the means exemption limit one might understand the desire of the Minister to adopt a tidy outlook on legislation, to allow all persons to draw the same rate of benefit from the State, and have a standard income from the State, disregarding any other kind of income.  But we are maintaining the principle of a means exemption limit, with this difference&mdash;that we are cutting it down from 2/- per week to 1/- per week.  The Minister cannot, therefore, have any objection to the means exemption limit.  He has put it in this Bill, but he has divided the means exemption limit by two as compared with what the position was under the principal Act of 1933.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Old Age Pensions Acts are much more generous in respect of means exemption limit than is this Bill.  The provisions of the new Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Bill are more generous than the provisions under Section 11, or under the principal Act.  Although the principal Act was not as generous to unemployed persons as the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Bill or the Old Age Pensions Acts, nevertheless the Minister proceeds to make it still less favourable by the provisions contained in Section 11.  I suggest to the Minister that this section is indefensible, except it now be a defence that you are entitled to grab at any kind of money which comes within the range of your own hands, and unless you are entitled to say: &ldquo;The Budget must be balanced, and here is a section of the community which we must ask to bear new burdens.&rdquo; One might understand some people taking that viewpoint.  I must say that I, personally, am surprised that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should come to the House with a proposal of that kind which, stripped of all the varnish which the Minister sought to put upon this Bill, is a proposal to take a sum estimated by the Minister at £150,000 out of the <Col N="1169" /> pockets of the unemployed.  We cannot even get from the Minister an assurance that that sum of money will go back in the other beneficial provisions of the Bill, upon which he relied in his attempt to describe this Bill as a good one from the point of view of the unemployed.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister seriously contend that a section which takes, according to his own estimate, £150,000 out of the pockets of the unemployed, is a good Bill for the unemployed?  Does the Minister seriously contend that he is assisting unemployed persons by enacting a section of that kind?  If he does, what grounds has the Minister for making an assertion of that kind? Section 11 is not necessary to this Bill. It is probably one of the briefest sections in the Bill, and probably one of the least necessary sections in it. The only purpose of this portion of the amending Bill is not to improve the main Act but to disimprove it.  Some people contend that amending an Act presupposes improving it.  That contention is rudely shattered by Section 11, because Section 11 of this amending Bill has been designed not to improve the principal Act, not to improve the lot of the unemployed, not to spend a greater sum on unemployment assistance benefit, but for the very definite purpose of enabling the financial experts in the Department of Industry and Commerce and in the Department of Finance to get both their hands down into the pockets of the unemployed and to take £150,000 per year out of them.  If the Minister wants to do that, and has to plead economy reasons for doing it, let him do so, but I think it is nothing short of a cruel irony to tell the unemployed that this is a beneficial Bill when, under Section 11, they are going to be £150,000 worse off than they were formerly.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is entitled to regard himself as a public benefactor by introducing this Bill, there are very few honest people in the country who will ever be able to aspire to that high rôle.  The Minister wants to contend now that public benefaction is equivalent to getting your hands into the pockets of the unemployed and lifting <Col N="1170" /> £150,000 per annum.  Whatever beneficial provisions are in this Bill can be allowed to remain in it, and the Minister can take the credit for amending the principal Act in the variety of ways suggested in this Bill, but it is not necessary to have Section 11 in order to amend the Act.  Section 11 is going to take out of the pockets of the unemployed a sum which they are not capable of subscribing towards balancing the war Budget of the Minister for Finance.</P>

He has got it now and, notwithstanding the fact that he is getting that, he puts his hands into the pockets of the unemployed and rakes out, in a most shameless manner, a sum of between £150,000 and £190,000 per annnum.</P>

      <P>I wish that the unemployed were going to have it taken out in the way that I propose.  When this Bill is passed the Minister will will take it out in a much more tangible way, and the unemployed will really feel the loss of the £150,000 under the Minister's method of abstraction.  They will feel it much more severely than my abstract way of withdrawing that sum from their pockets.  They will find that the withdrawal of that sum, six times in an abstract way, does not make them any poorer, whereas the Minister's one raid will relieve them of £150,000 in the first go.  I think that most of those folk would prefer my method of abstracting the money after they have had experience of the Minister's method.</P>
      <P>This Section of the Bill is indefensible. It cannot be excused on any ground, unless the unemployed are to be asked to make a contribution to balance the war Budget.  The Minister is taxing the unemployed under this Bill to balance the war Budget, while the wealthy classes who are capable of bearing still more burdens are allowed to escape without the imposition of any new burdens.  I propose to vote against this section.  If the Minister believes in his heart that this Bill is a good Bill from the point of view of the unemployed, then he will vote with me against this section in his own Bill.</P>

Deputy Norton, when he is in the country, is a war horse.  He declares that he is prepared to fight to the last ditch, and that the Irish Labour movement is a Republican movement.

I quite recognise that, individually, they are making their contribution, but the sad part of it is that we cannot confine the losses of a war of this kind to one section of the community.  Sooner or later it affects them all.  Deputy Norton, with his usual perspicacity, put his finger on the whole trouble when he said that this was a war Budget.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton was quite correct in saying that these savings were to aid in balancing the war Budget and, according to the Minister's own words, and to Deputy Norton, this is a war Budget.  I quite agree.  I think it is a monstrous thing to be inflicting taxation to the tune of £180,000 per annum on people who, according to the Minister's own finding, are destitute and hungry.  The reason the Minister is doing it is not for any lack of desire on his part to plunder other sections of the community because he would raise the income tax rate if he dared, but he cannot.  The Government, under the Financial Agreement with Great Britain, are enjoying an enormous benefit under the reciprocal income tax arrangement which is part of that agreement.  The Minister knows perfectly well that under that income tax arrangement this country is deriving <Col N="1173" /> gigantic benefits, because we get back oceans of money from Great Britain and they get practically nothing from us.  The Minister cannot upset the balance with regard to income tax between this country and Great Britain, because if he were to do so he would lose the advantage of that agreement.  But he has not got the honesty&mdash;he never had&mdash;to get up and say so.  He does not want to confess that any international agreement made by his predecessors in office was an advantageous agreement for this country.</P>

      <P>The Minister has advanced two reasons in defence of Section 11 of this Bill.  One is that he proposes under other sections to confer certain benefits, and these must be financed.  His case is that he is financing them entirely out of his savings under Section 11.  The balance is to go into the Exchequer, which was specifically referred to.  The Minister for Finance, in the course of his Budget statement, reckoned on whatever saving the Exchequer would get under Section 11 when he informed the House of the reductions that could legitimately be made in unemployment relief.  But the fact is that we were not told at the time the Budget was introduced how that was going to be arrived at.  Because it was desired to divorce it from Budget purposes, we were not to know that the unemployed were to carry any burden, but in fact they are beginning to feel it now.  I want Deputies <Col N="1174" /> to realise that this is only a beginning. I have often told members of the Labour Party that I regarded it as criminal to institute social services and at the same time to destroy the means of maintaining them, because by doing so they were simply fooling the people.  This is the beginning of the destruction of our own social services, for the reason that we have not got the money to finance them.  Why is that?  Because we are fighting a war, not against a national enemy, but against the interests of our own people.</P>

Although I think this is unjustifiable I prefer the methods of the highwayman which the Minister introduced. He came out bluntly and said: &ldquo;I am going to screw it out of the poor if it is necessary to do so.&rdquo;  The Minister for Finance and, I regret to say, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, piously fold their hands and say: &ldquo;By administrative economies which we will take we will get £250,000&rdquo; (or is it £100,000) &ldquo;from the old age pensioners.&rdquo;  Surely that is hypocrisy.  If I may say so, with great respect to the Ministers, this is the method of the sneak thief.  It would be much better to come out boldly and say that they were going to plunder certain persons.  The Ministry are taking from the old age pensioners, and Section 11 takes from the unemployed.</P>

      <P>This proposal was discussed at length on the Second Reading of the Bill, despite the fact that the Deputy was absent.  I do not think it is necessary to go over what was said then.  The proposal, of course, has nothing to do with the economic war or with the Budget position of this year.  No matter what the position in respect of the war or the Budget might have been, this proposal would have appeared in the Bill.  We think it is a good proposal. We think it quite a justifiable amendment of the principal Act, having regard to the experience of its operation. If it should happen that in consequence of this section the saving effected under it exceeds the additional charge arising out of the rest of the Bill, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, apart from the position of the Minister for Finance, I will be very pleased, because it will give us the opportunity of considering again other desirable amendments and additions to the principal Act, which <Col N="1179" /> could not be undertaken at this time, in consequence of financial exigency, and the difficulty of finding increased funds for such purposes.  At the present time, the operation of the Unemployment Assistance Act works out to ensure that a person who has means, calculated in accordance with the provisions of the Act, equal to or less than 2/- per week is better off than a person who has no means at all.  We think that that is undesirable.  In theory, Deputy Norton is quite right in saying that there should be no uncalculated means at all, but, in practice, some margin must be provided to allow for errors in the assessment of means and to avoid too great rigidity in the administration of that part of the Act.  We have found by experience, however, that a narrower margin than that contemplated as necessary in the 1933 Act can be made effective.  If the result of that is to provide a saving in the cost of the scheme, then that saving makes possible the amendment and improvement of the scheme for which other sections of this Bill provide. No person who is unemployed in the sense in which unemployment is ordinarily understood, no person who is dependent entirely on what he earns in wages for his livelihood, will be one halfpenny worse off because of this section.</P>

      <P>That is nonsense.  In fact, the administration of the Act, in so far as the assessment of means is concerned, has been on the generous side.  Wherever it was possible in this regard to give the benefit of the position to the unemployed applicant, the benefit was so given and there is not an unemployed person in the country but will admit that, even though there has been difficulty in dealing with the arrears of appeals, which difficulty this Bill is intended to remove.  The section has nothing whatever to do with the matters of which Deputy Dillon spoke and very little to do with the matters of which Deputy Norton spoke.  This is, in our opinion, a justifiable change in the Act and, in so far as it effects a saving to the Exchequer, that saving is justifiable.  The amount so saved can be utilised much more directly for the benefit of the unemployed and of persons in need of assistance from the State than in the manner originally provided under the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the reason for altering the well-established principle under the Criminal Justice (Evidence) Act, 1924, that, I think, was long-established prior to the passage of that statute, that a wife could not be compelled to give evidence against her husband in a criminal charge?  Is there any special reason why this Bill should be excluded from that general rule, because, I think the Minister will agree with me that as a general rule it is a good one?  Why should a wife be made to go into the witness box for the purpose of convicting her husband of an offence alleged against him under the terms of this Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>British legislation, British inspiration is the basis of the section.  I object to a section of that kind being embodied in a Bill of this description.  Only the very gravest possible considerations should induce the House to enact a provision such <Col N="1183" /> as this, where the wife or husband of an offender is a competent witness in legal proceedings against the other. If it is in existing legislation, that in itself is not a case for the continuance of this kind of legislation. It is generally recognised that it is undesirable that a wife or husband should be a witness against the other, and here in this Unemployment Assistance Bill, for the purpose of recovering small amounts in respect of unemployment assistance, we are taking power to enact a principle of this kind which is rightly eschewed in the general legislation of the country.  In what circumstances does the Minister think he is entitled to include a provision of this kind in a Bill of this kind?  It seems to me to be enthroning a principle so vicious that we are not entitled, purely for the considerations in this case, to enthrone it in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing vicious in this principle and nothing new. In a case where a husband or wife is claimed as a dependent for the purpose of obtaining increased rates of unemployment assistance, it may not be possible to prove fraud unless the wife or husband, as the case may be, is a competent witness in legal proceedings. The purpose of the section is to secure that position.  That has always been the position under the unemployment insurance code, where precisely similar considerations arise, and this section is similar to Section 11 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1922, which has been in force since the State was established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>One consideration applies where the wife may be a witness, but here it is sought to make her a compellable witness against her husband and against the wishes of her husband.  Does the Minister think it is a desirable state of affairs that a wife can be made a compellable witness against her own husband?  One could understand a position where a wife might be summoned as a witness but not made a compellable witness, and where she would be entitled to <Col N="1184" /> plead the fact that the defendant was her husband as a reason why she should not give evidence against him. I think the section is very objectionable.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite sure it has. It is a very common type of fraud under the Unemployment Insurance Acts where a person is claimed as a dependent who is not a dependent for the purpose of getting increased rates of benefit.  I could not say definitely, but I am sure this section in the Unemployment Insurance Act has been availed of for the purpose of proving fraud in cases like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says he is almost certain it has been, but I have never read of a case of the kind in the newspapers.  I am sure the Minister remembers St. Paul's advice to wives, that they must obey their husbands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the fact that this section was there before, the principal argument on the merits that the Minister has used was that the offence could not be proved unless the wife could be compelled to give evidence in many cases of this kind of fraud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not say it could not be proved but it is much more difficult to prove it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not realise that precisely the same argument would make a wife a witness in every case against her husband?  I think that when the general jurisprudence of the State is against that principle, to introduce it as a side issue in a Bill of this kind is not advisable.  If by a mistake it had been allowed to lapse in the case of the unemployment insurance it should be left that way.  The Minister is going against the general sense of the community in this matter. Remember exactly the same argument will apply in the case of every offence. <Col N="1185" /> If it is tolerable in small offences like this, surely a much stronger case could be made for it in connection with graver offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy cannot contend that the same argument could be used in every case.  The power to call a wife as witness against her husband or a husband against a wife is required mainly where the wife or the husband is claimed as a dependent in order to get increased rates <Col N="1186" /> of payment.  In cases of that kind it would be completely impossible to prove the charge without the testimony of either party.  That has been the experience in the Unemployment Insurance Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

    <P>That it is expedient to authorise <Col N="1187" /> the payment out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas of any expenses incurred by the Minister for Agriculture pursuant to the provisions of any Act of the present session to amend the Diseases of Animals (Ireland) Acts, 1894 to 1934, in relation to the Slaughter of Animals affected with disease, and to make provision for other matters connected with the matters aforesaid.</P>
    <P>I was asked, I think, on the Second Reading Stage of this Bill, what the likely expenditure would be under the Bill for the remainder of the year.  It is not expected that this Bill will be operative until some time in the autumn and, therefore, for only about half the year and in three or four counties at most.  The total expenditure for that period is calculated to be somewhere between £7,000 and £8,000 for this year.  At any rate I think a Supplementary Estimate would be necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is right that the Minister should take this occasion to emphasise something that might create apprehension in the public mind.  He might make it plain that while this Bill might have reference to the Roscrea factory in so far as it deals with uneconomic cows and old cattle, not giving a return in milk, or paying for their keep, the provisions that have reference to diseased cattle are quite apart from the Roscrea factory, and that there is no intention whatever of the powers to deal with diseased cattle being used directly or indirectly in the Roscrea factory.  I can conceive that certain parts of diseased cattle, for example, skins, or the conversion of diseased carcases into artificial fertilisers, might be processed in Roscrea.  But I suggest that the Minister might state categorically what his intentions are, so that the public mind might be clear as to the distinction between uneconomic cows to be slaughtered by the Minister under the Bill and diseased cows which are to be slaughtered and disposed of and not processed at Roscrea at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter was mentioned on Second Reading, I think. The Roscrea factory is meant to deal with old and uneconomic cows that are not likely to be fit to be used as beef, but are not diseased.  But we cannot guarantee that diseased cows would not be delivered in any circumstances there.  It is possible they will. But there will be veterinary inspectors there as they are attached to other places.  It is possible that a process will be done on hides, and fats, and for conversion into edible meal.  There is no process for consumption in this factory.  However, the place must be looked after and proper veterinary examination will take place of all animals received.  With regard to tuberculosis, I did mention that local authorities were not taking as drastic action as they might for the elimination of tuberculosis, and that is the reason we are proposing under this Bill to take over the administration in that matter in a number of counties for some time.  It is only meant <Col N="1189" /> to take over that power in a county which had supplied cattle to Roscrea and to clear up that county, and then hand it back to the local authority to go on with the administration under the Principal Act.  I did say we do not contemplate dealing with any other disease except tuberculosis at the moment.  I do not want any misapprehension under that, because we are taking power to deal with any disease.  For instance, it was suggested to us some time ago that we should take over the administration of dealing with the Bacillary White Diarrhoea in poultry.  I do not think it would be necessary, but if there should be any further trouble with diseases of that kind we would have the power under the amending Act without further legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>My idea in putting down the amendment was to provide that compensation should be paid at a rate that will enable the animal to be replaced.  The Minister says that some counties are not using their powers as drastically as they ought to, and one of the reasons why I put down the amendment was because I thought the Minister would use his powers too drastically.  I have no objection to the Minister turning round and dealing with cattle which are in a very advanced state and destroying them, but I fear that the veterinary surgeons in going into the farmer's place might go much further than that.  It is a well-known fact that a great many cows which are healthy-looking cows are, when tested, found to be suffering from tuberculosis.  My idea in putting the amendment was to bring it home to the Minister that after all if that policy were persisted in and pursued drastically it would be a great hardship on farmers unless they were compensated. <Col N="1190" /> If the State wants to do this thing, or a thing of that kind, there is no reason why the State should not pay for it.  I put down this amendment in order to have an opportunity of discussing it on the section.  It is a very serious matter for the people of the country to have the veterinary surgeons given all this power.  I know the veterinary surgeons are out to push this business to very great extremes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to assure Deputy O'Leary that there is no great danger that there will be any wrong done to anybody, because under the Principal Act provision is provided for compensation.  It is laid down that the compensation to be given is the value that an ordinary person at an ordinary market would pay for the beast if he were not aware that the beast was suffering from any disease. That value is agreed upon by the local authorities' veterinary surgeon, and I am told that the value is generous.  If they do not agree there is provision for an arbitrator, but it has not been known that an arbitrator was called in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the price that would be given if the person buying the animal were not aware it was suffering from any disease.  If, on slaughter, it is found that the beast was not suffering from tuberculosis, then the owner gets the value plus £1. That is the Order.  If it is found that the tuberculosis is not in a very advanced state the owner gets three-fourths of the value, and if it is in a very advanced state he gets one-fourth. We mean to raise that one-fourth provision, because we must bring the value of the beast, no matter how advanced a state she is in, to the Roscrea level, that is, to £2 10s. 0d. The effect will be the raising of the figures all round as far as compensation is concerned.  In some cases at present the owner gets only £1 or 25/-, but now he must get at least £2 10s. 0d. I think when we take over the administration we shall give a little more generous compensation than has been given.  I might also say that where the veterinary surgeons go around and <Col N="1191" /> detect this disease in a herd the owner will naturally be better compensated than if the beast had been allowed to remain another six months and became more advanced.  The more vigorous our examination is, the better it will be in the end for the owners of the herds.</P>

      <P>At this stage I take occasion to refer to the Schedule of this Bill.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce to-day in piloting another Bill before this House adopted a different method to that which is adopted in this Bill.  The Minister for Agriculture is aware that his colleague is not a person who goes out of his way to meet the views of the Opposition or the views of his colleagues but at all events he has recognised how unfair it is to legislate extensively by reference.  On more than one occasion he reproduced the whole section of the original Act in its amended form.  But in this Bill we have three sections extensively amending an earlier Act.  It is only right that it should go on record that not a single Deputy in this House knows the effect of any one of those amendments.  No Deputy could know its effects but by sitting down with the original Act and spending three or four hours reading them with the amending Bill in his hand.  I desire to put it on record that the introduction of legislation here in that form is undesirable and that it ought to be avoided particularly in non-controversial Bills of this kind where the Minister has no reason to believe that by setting out the amendment <i>in extenso</i> he would be in any way embarrassed by the Opposition.</P>

      <P>I should like to remind the Deputy that I did circulate a memorandum on this Bill, because I recognised that it would be rather inconvenient for Deputies to have to look up the Principal Act, and go through the various sections to see what these amendments meant.  That was pointed <Col N="1193" /> out on the Second Reading, and I undertook to circulate a memorandum, which was done.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  Last year a Bill was passed through the Oireachtas dealing with a situation that had arisen out of a decision of the Supreme Court in a case which arose principally out of the Erne fisheries.  I need hardly remind any Deputy of that case, because everybody was very conversant with it at the time, and probably remembers the circumstances.  The point was, at any rate, that as a result of the decision of the Supreme Court there was a right to fish in the estuary of the River Erne by anybody who might wish to come along and pay the ordinary licence.  At the time, it was recognised and agreed by the Dáil and Seanad that a very serious position might arise if the place was overfished, and that the valuable fishery which was there might be destroyed in a few years.  The principal Bill then gave us power to issue a special licence to a fisherman to fish in the River Erne estuary on payment of a special fee.  That has worked very satisfactorily since.  At that time we got this power only for a limited period.  It is contemplated, as the House is aware, to bring in a comprehensive Bill to deal with inland fisheries, and the case of the River Erne will, of course, be dealt with the same as all the other rivers when that measure is brought in.  The Inland Fisheries Commission reported <Col N="1194" /> some time ago.  The report is being examined by the Government, and as soon as some decision is come to, the necessary Bill will be prepared.  As it will probably be a very big Bill, I suppose it will take at least 12 months before it can be prepared and got through both Houses.  In the mean-time we want to carry on just as we are with regard to the Tidal Waters (Amendment) Bill.  It refers principally to the River Erne.  It also refers to the Owenea River, in the County Donegal.  Those are the only two rivers to which it refers at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made reference to his intention of introducing comprehensive legislation to deal with the whole question of inland fisheries.  This Bill is more or less a stop-gap until the whole problem can be dealt with.  Would the Minister take this opportunity of indicating to the House what his intention is in respect of the several fisheries referred to in this Bill?  Do they come within the sphere of the Erne fishery judgment? I have neither the desire nor the right to comment upon the Erne fishery judgment, but the Supreme Court has reached a certain decision which has had certain effects.  One of the effects has been to discover the fact that a person who believed himself to be the owner of very valuable property was not in fact the owner of it.  I understood the Minister, or somebody speaking on his behalf earlier, to say that when he came to deal with this problem <i>in toto</i> he intended as part of the possible settlement in all human probability to take over all the fisheries in the country, on the basis of compensation, and to operate them on behalf of the State. When he is doing that, does he intend to provide any <i>ex gratia</i> compensation for those individuals who, as a result of the Erne fishery judgement, suffered what was for them a wholly unexpected loss?</P>

      <P>Certainly not.  We wanted to get sufficient from the special fees to recoup the Conservators for the loss of rate, and so on.  I think it worked out about right, as far as that was concerned.  The matter raised by Deputy Dillon involves a big question. It is a question, of course, which the Government has to consider, and I cannot at all anticipate what the Government might do with regard to taking over the several fisheries.  I cannot say whether they might take them over and declare them to be State property, or make them public fisheries.  Personally&mdash;and I might also speak on behalf of the Government&mdash; I think that if they take over those several fisheries they certainly will recognise the principle of compensation. I cannot say anything more than that at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister anything to say with particular reference to the owners of the Erne fishery, whose property has become forfeit as a result of the constitutional position discovered by the Supreme Court judgment?  Here you had people who believed that they had a legitimate right to this property.  When their title was tried in law it was decided that they did not own the property at all.  We all know that they gave very substantial consideration for their property in years gone by, and my submission to the Minister now is that if he proceeds to take over the several fisheries in the country on the basis of compensation he ought to give something to these people.  If he does that, he has got to realise that it must be in the form of an <i>ex gratia</i> payment. No matter what legislation is produced those people cannot make any claim under it, because the <Col N="1196" /> Supreme Court has decided that they had no title to the several fisheries which they had been enjoying previous to that judgment.  In the event of his deciding to compensate owners whose title has not been called in question he should recommend, at any rate, that an <i>ex gratia</i> payment be made to the individuals who suffered under the Erne fishery judgment.</P>

      <P>If the Bill is not produced before this time 12 months the Minister should keep in mind the fact that in the Erne case there is a river.  That was not in dispute in the case of the judgment&mdash;it was the estuary.  The estuary was the part for which they paid £80,000 when they took over, the foundation of their title being a State conveyance.  I think anybody who gets a State conveyance presumes that it is a good enough title, and the Minister should keep that in mind when he is introducing a measure to compensate those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Dillon and Deputy McMenamin have pointed out, the estuary of the Erne is in a different position from the rest.  The River Erne, for instance, would come in with any other several fishery that might be considered for compensation.  They would all be dealt with, I suppose, on the same sort of general basis&mdash;what the basis might be I do not know&mdash;if they are taken over by the State or declared public fisheries.  I cannot say really what might be decided with regard to the estuary of the River Erne. Of course, the people who had that, and who claimed to own it, tried by every means to get a decision, not only with our own courts but also with the Privy Council.  It would appear, as Deputy Dillon has pointed out, that they have no right, and if any payment were to be made it would be an <i>ex gratia</i> one.  I am not in a position to say what view the Government might take of that particular case.  Of course, all that will come up on the main Bill.</P>

      <P>I move that this Bill be now read a Second Time.  Under the Fisheries Act of 1925 there was a provision enabling boards of conservators to collect a rate from the owners of fisheries, and, in turn, if the loss of such a rate amounted to more than 1d. in the £ on a particular local authority, the excess of the rate of 1d. in the £ was made good to the local authority by means of an Exchequer grant.  That provision only extends up to September, 1935.  The money that was derived in that way was spent by the conservators in protecting the fisheries.  It is necessary, of course, that that protection should be carried on, and that the conservators should have funds to do their business until the comprehensive Bill that I have mentioned is introduced. In this case, I am asking for an extension of the period for two years so as to give time for the preparation of the necessary legislation and to have it made operative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. F. Lynch Mr. F. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I was not present for the Minister's statement on the previous Bill in which, apparently, he referred to the comprehensive measure in contemplation for dealing with the inland fisheries. When I saw this Bill I wondered why only a two years' prolongation of the period during which the rates on valued fisheries are to be paid to boards of conservators instead of local authorities is being asked for.  As Deputies realise, this was a provision which for the first time put boards of conservators in funds.  One can say that it was only from that date that the fisheries were, for the first time, effectively protected, at least in the areas where there were numbers of those valued fisheries, where the valuations were very high, and where for the first time many boards of conservators <Col N="1198" /> were able to employ a better type of bailiff, and more bailiffs.</P>
      <P>It was my fault, of course, that I was not present to hear the Minister's statement on the previous Bill.  Even if the Minister had in mind an earlier introduction of the comprehensive Bill he mentioned, I see no reason why he should not make assurance doubly sure and give himself a longer time within which to play with the present arrangement.  I think the minimum extension of the period should be for five years.  Perhaps the Minister does not think that it will be his job to deal with the matter after two years.  That may be, and if that is the explanation, well one can feel rather pleased about it.  However this Bill does make provision for keeping Section 13 of the Act of 1935 operative.  As a matter of fact, I asked the question several times when it was proposed to bring in a measure such as this so as to ensure that Section 13 of the 1925 Act would not expire.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Lynch that the period under this Bill should be extended to 1940. We all agree that protection must be afforded to the fisheries, and that protection cannot be given unless the money is there.  The only way to get sufficient money to protect the fisheries is by having the power to strike a rate.  The Minister told us that the report of the Fisheries Commission had been received by the Government.  Would the Minister say when it is intended to circulate that report amongst Deputies?</P>

Deputy McMenamin thinks that the period should be extended to 1940.  I do not think that is necessary.  We are allowing 12 months for the consideration, by the Government, of the report of the Inland Fisheries Commission. During that period the Government will have time to consider the heads of new legislation that may be decided <Col N="1199" /> upon, and to get the Bill drafted. There will be a further year to enable the Government to get the Bill through the Oireachtas.  We are allowing two years from next September for doing all that, and I think that is quite sufficient.  I may say that the report of the Commission is with the printers at the present time and that it will be circulated as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>This is an Estimate for a sum not exceeding £75 towards the expenses incurred in connection with the racial survey of Ireland which is being conducted at present as part of the series of researches undertaken in this country under the auspices of Harvard University.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1200" /> The racial survey is being made by Dr. C. W. Du Pertuis, to whom the University authorities have assigned the work of field anthropometrist in charge of the collection of physical data relating to the people of this country.  In this racial survey the Harvard University Expedition plans to gather adequate samples of anthropometric records pertaining to the population of every county.  With the physical information certain sociological facts will also be acquired. The ultimate aim of the racial survey is not only to establish the various ethnic strata in the population of this country, but also to correlate this information with the studies of social anthropology which have been made in County Clare and elsewhere by members of the Harvard Expedition, and with the archæological findings which are being made by the staff of excavators who are working in selected districts under the direction of Dr. O'Neill Hencken and other skilled archæologists attached to the Expedition.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education has been assured by the University authorities that it is their intention to produce not only a number of monographs dealing with the social anthropology, physical anthropology, and archæology of Ireland, but also to attempt some general work which will purport to be in the nature of a scientific interpretation of the pre-history and history of the Irish nation.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the proposed grant of the sum of £75 is to enable Dr. Du Pertuis to hire, in the various places where he is working, local assistants who will be of use in rounding up the population for his anthropometric studies.  In some areas the local assistant will be required to act as interpreter.</P>
    <P>The various investigations and researches which are being conducted in this country at the expense of the University are of very considerable national and scientific importance, and the Government is satisfied that the proposed grant of £75 towards meeting the expenses of the special <Col N="1201" /> work assigned to Dr. Pertuis will ensure that the work of this investigator will be fully extended.</P>

      <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £22,240 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1936, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including the Rates Advisory Committee, and sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate provides £22,240 additional to the amount already provided this year for turf development.  It represents a further advance by the Department to make turf a national fuel.  The sum of £2,740 is provided in the first sub-head and is required for increased administrative expenses, and is chiefly due to the necessity for strengthening the engineering and supervising staff of the Board.  That strengthening of the engineering and supervising staff is consequential on the increase in the number of co-operative turf societies, which now amount to 162.  It is necessary, before co-operative turf societies are formed, to ensure that the bogs are suitable and that a certain return is secured from the money expended upon them.  It is also necessary to make more detailed surveys of some of the bogs.  Furthermore, I felt that the time had come to amalgamate the functions hitherto performed by the I.A.O.S. with the duties performed by the Turf Board.  As that is now being done, I <Col N="1202" /> would like to take this opportunity to express appreciation of the efforts of the I.A.O.S., who placed their wide experience and trained staff at the disposal of the Department of Industry and Commerce, and made it possible to organise the co-operative societies quickly.  There are three items embodied in the sums mentioned in the second sub-head.  A sum of £10,000 is being provided for the purchase of storage grounds and the erection of sheds; a sum of £4,500 is being provided for the purchase of the Turraun works of the Leinster Carbonising Company, Limited; and £3,000 is provided for the Turf Board as working capital for the Turraun works.</P>
    <P>In respect to the first undertaking, during the past year particularly, it was clearly demonstrated that in bad weather turf could not be delivered direct from the bog to the consumer in proper condition, and furthermore it was found that some producers forwarded turf of inferior quality and, in many cases, wet turf to consumers. Notwithstanding the prevalence of this dubious practice, the Turf Development Board usually succeeded in tracing this turf to the source, and the most drastic action was taken against the offending societies. Where inferior or wet turf was discovered to have been forwarded to the markets, and delivered to the consumer, the Board compelled the society to bear the cost of the poor turf, and to pay the rail, carriage and delivery costs to the consumer. If the turf had been delivered to the consumer the cost of removing the bad turf from the consumer's cellar was also borne by the societies.  It was not always, however, the producer's fault that bad turf was delivered, as in many cases the turf left the producer in good condition and was damaged in transport or while awaiting transportation.  For this reason, it has been decided to erect compounds and storage sheds for small quantities of turf in the areas where the societies can conform to the very rigid conditions set down, and where there is a possibility of establishing the turf scheme permanently.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1203" /> It was decided during the course of the year to take steps to acquire the Turraun Peat Works owned by the Leinster Carbonising Company, Limited, and as that is now being considered by the Dáil, it is desirable to recapitulate, to some extent, the history of the Turraun Peat Works. The Irish Peat Inquiry appointed by the Fuel Research Board of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research reported to the Government in July, 1918.  In September, 1919, another Committee known as the Committee of the Commission of Inquiry into the Resources and Industries of Ireland was appointed by Dáil Eireann and this Committee reported in 1921.  Sir John Griffith was Chairman of the Irish Peat Committee, appointed by the Fuel Research Board for investigation of the peat resources in Ireland.  This Committee made certain recommendations in its report which were not, however, acted upon and Sir John Griffith decided to finance experiments himself on the lines of the Committee's report.  To this end, he acquired the Turraun property and set about experiments on a small scale, to ascertain something of the quality and general character of the fuel that might be expected from Irish peat.  A small electric power plant was installed to provide for the manufacture of machine or macerated peat in the summer, and it was intended to generate electricity for distribution to the adjacent towns in the winter.  It was also intended to sell any fuel, surplus to that required for electric plant, for domestic purposes in the neighbourhood of the bogs.  The development of hydro power from the Shannon caused the promoters to alter their plans and to seek a market for their peat fuel in Dublin, and within a 40 mile radius of Turraun. Difficulties arising out of the bad location of the site and inadequate exit roads with consequently high transport costs militated against the sale of the turf, and it was not found possible to market such a quantity as would justify <Col N="1204" /> production on a scale sufficient to cover the capital charges.</P>
    <P>Despite discouragement, Sir John Griffith persevered in his efforts and spent considerable sums on the company. He purchased 1,323 acres of bog and effected the deep drainage of over 400 acres, built a peat moss litter factory and installed power transmission plant, bog railways and macerators for the manufacture of machine-won peat.  This was the principal unit of what he intended should be developed into an extended programme of fuel production.  I think it would be regrettable if the physical assets now available in the Turraun bogs and the great efforts of a famous and public-spirited Irish engineer should be lost to the nation, if the enterprise could be continued with any hope of final success.  Sir John Griffith, who is now of advanced age, did not feel capable of carrying the burden of these experimental works any longer. The price at which it has been agreed that the Turf Board should take over the assets and good-will of the company will make it possible to reduce the overhead charges on capital account to a minimum.  In view of the fact that the Government has in contemplation steps for increasing the market available, no difficulty is anticipated in disposing of the product of the works at a reasonable price.  The plant and premises will serve as a valuable field for experimental purposes and for trying out new machines and production methods.  Improvements in the road system are, it is understood, being effected, including access to the railway. The latter will widen the market for the company's product and at the same time enable transport costs to be reduced.</P>
    <P>I have not, however, regarded the enterprise solely as a commercial proposition. The fact that the livelihood of 16 permanent and 50 casual employees is involved in the enterprise is a matter of importance, and more particularly I have been impressed by the necessity of having at the disposal of the Turf Development Board a prepared bog, where experiments with <Col N="1205" /> different types of machines could be carried out.  In this connection it is noteworthy that, except in unusual circumstances, it takes two years before a bog can be sufficiently well drained to carry machines even for experimental purposes.  The Turf Board will endeavour to make the Turraun plant, in its present form, pay for itself and it is considered that, in view of the extremely low price at which it has been offered, together with the fact that the stock of turf is being offered at a very attractive figure, it will be possible to do this and that the project can be made cover its costs in the transition period whilst a final decision is being taken on the ultimate form of mechanical turf development.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, we recently sent a delegation to the Continent to study methods of turf development in other countries.  I have had a preliminary conversation with the delegation and I learned that it is their intention to recommend the purchase of an up-to-date machine to be set at work experimentally at Turraun.  The delegation are, apparently, hopeful that if this machine does what is expected of it, a long step will be taken towards the solution of the turf fuel problem.  However, the full report of the delegation has not yet been received. I understand that it is likely to be received about the end of the present week.  On it will be based decisions as to the extent and form of experimental work in the mechanical production of turf fuel.</P>
    <P>It will be necessary, before the end of this year, to promote legislation dealing with the turf situation, and that legislation is in course of preparation. I had hoped to have it ready for this session, but that became impossible in view of the pressure of other business.  It will, I trust, be available for consideration by the Dáil when the House reassembles after the summer recess.  We have informed the turf societies in a circular issued to them that the Turf Board would undertake to dispose of all standard turf, the property of the members of registered societies, cut during the <Col N="1206" /> 1935 season, at a minimum price of 11/6 per ton, provided certain rather stringent conditions imposed by the Board were conformed to.  In order to put the Board and the Department in a position to make good in respect of that undertaking, certain legislative proposals must necessarily be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>The third item of £2,000 appearing on the face of the Estimate is the price proposed to be paid for the stock of turf at Turraun.  There are large stocks of machine-won turf there&mdash;turf of excellent quality.  The £2,000 which it is proposed to pay for these stocks represents a very favourable price to the Department.  There will be no difficulty in disposing of the turf available there at prices which will yield a profit to the Department.</P>
    <P>To recapitulate, the main items are: (1)  increased administrative cost, due to the necessity for increasing the engineering staff of the board and also to the fact that the officers of the I.A.O.S., who were previously engaged in the organising of these co-operative societies, are being taken over by the Turf Board; (2) the purchase of the Turraun Works at a price which is very favourable and gives the board a large area of prepared bog, particularly suitable for experimental work.  It would not be possible to get any area of bog into the same condition for experimental work within a period of two years.  We are proposing to carry on these works as a commercial proposition and for that purpose £3,000 working capital is being provided for the board.  In addition, we are purchasing the stocks of turf available at Turraun for £2,000.  That represents the total of the sum now required for this service.</P>

      <P>It is rather interesting to hear the Minister tell us at this stage that he proposes to introduce in the autumn legislation dealing with turf.  I think that it is time something was done to systematise and control what is being done as regards turf-production. I do not know whether or not the Minister's first appearance in the House on the turf question was <Col N="1207" /> on the 11th May, 1933.  On that occasion he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If various inquiries which we are undertaking at the moment into the possibility of marketing peat in another form prove that difficulties have been overcome and that a method of doing so has been invented, we will be able to establish an industry which will be, by far, the most important in the country and which will provide us with a fuel not merely as good as, but better than, coal.  These are some of the things we are planning.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was in May of 1933.  In April, 1934, speaking in Castlerea the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The turf plan had been a remarkable success, all available turf being consumed before the winter was half over and he guaranteed that every sod of good quality, produced under the Government scheme, would find a market next winter.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was in the winter we have just passed.  Now, we come to the third stage.  Speaking in the House in June last, the Minister said that they hoped this year to put the whole turf scheme on a national footing.  The Minister tells us again to-day that, this year, his plan is to put the whole turf scheme on a national footing.  The Minister is looking for an additional £22,000. I do not know exactly what the sum already voted is.  In May last in reply to a question by Deputy Davin, the Minister stated that in the two years, 1933-34 and 1934-35, the amount of money expended in connection with peat-fuel development amounted to £8,005 in 1933-34 and to £24,019 in 1934-35.  Now, he is asking for an additional amount.  The Minister quoted figures here some time ago to indicate that in the last year for which he had available information&mdash;1933&mdash; there was less turf cut and sold than there was in 1931 before all this money was expended in connection with turf. I do not know whether he is yet in a position to give the figures of turf cut last year&mdash;1934.  If he has these figures, the House would be glad to hear them. <Col N="1208" /> It would be interesting to get information from the Minister as to where all this money has gone.  We know that £11,000 went in buying sacks last year.  I suppose an additional sum went the previous year in buying sacks. I do not know how much money went in telling us through the medium of the Press:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where the Irish elk roamed. Countless suns have crossed the sky since the giant elk roamed Ireland. Time has shed a mellow light around these ancient days....  In those far-off days a wondrous wealth was being born, slowly, surely, steadily, the wealth that is the birthright of Irishmen to-day&mdash;turf.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am sure a considerable sum was spent on that sort of thing.</P>
    <P>But the position that we have, as a result of all this, is that for the last year for which information is available there was less turf cut or less turf sold, at any rate, than in 1931.  The Minister has made all kinds of statements as to what is going to happen. For instance, as I stated, in April, 1934, he said that he guaranteed that every sod of good quality turf produced under the Government's scheme would find a market next winter.  The fact is that he had to buy over the Turraun peat works, because they could not carry on and were left, as he says himself, and as they said in March last, with 5,000 tons of fuel in stock The Minister has not told us exactly who is going to run the Turraun peat works.  Is the the Peat Development Board, which I think has been established as a company, going to run the Turraun works and try to make a success of a concern which individual enterprise, with a very considerable amount of scientific skill and of money behind it, could not make a success of?</P>
    <P>The Minister ought to be able to tell us something about what he hopes for in that direction; or is this the putting of money into a purely experimental business?  It does not seem to me, when you see the want of control that there seems to be in this whole turf business, that the Minister has any technical or administrative <Col N="1209" /> guidance that could possibly hope to make a success of an establishment such as the Turraun works, which, even with the skilled technical advice and experience they had, and with the benefit of all the Minister's propaganda in regard to turf, and his arrangements for cheaper railway carriage, actually failed when he was spending so much public money on the advancement of the general scheme with regard to turf and putting a considerable amount of public money into the provision of free turf in order to take some of the turf off the market.</P>
    <P>Various statements have been made from time to time as to some big development in the making of peat briquettes, for instance.  The Government organ in May of last year announced that the Minister for Industry and Commerce had then indicated his willingness to guarantee a trade loan of £90,000 for the establishment of a factory for the making of peat briquettes.  Is there anything developing along that line?  Was that part of the scheme under which it was understood that machinery had arrived for a new factory in Edenderry in connection with which £150,000 was going to be put into the development of a big peat industry there?  Is there anything pending in regard to the development of the industry suggested by the statement in May last year that the Minister had expressed willingness to guarantee a trade loan of £90,000, or in the statement made in the public Press in April this year that machinery had actually arrived in Edenderry for a £150,000 business for the development of turf?</P>
    <P>The present proposal is, to some extent, an extension of the unemployment assistance measure.  A sum of £2,740 is going to be spent on additional administrative expenses; £10,000 is going to be spent on the building of storage accommodation; £4,500 is to buy an industry; and £3,000 to provide working capital. More than 10 per cent. of that money is being devoted to what the Minister calls administrative expenses.  I say that is an extension of the unemployment <Col N="1210" /> assistance scheme.  To some extent, some of the other money to be provided is an extension of the unemployment assistance scheme.  The Minister has not told us how the £10,000 in respect of storage is going to be spent.  We are confused with regard to the Minister's general plan. An experimental peat works is to be carried on at Turraun.  There is the general work of development of the co-operative societies all over the country. But we do not get from the Minister any idea where the incidence of this development is.  Is there any real development in Donegal or Mayo or Kerry?  Where exactly are the real centres of development?  Where are the areas where this is bringing any kind of assistance to the people?</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands, speaking recently in Doonbeg, announced that during the last 12 months the turf scheme had brought £6,000 additional into that area.  It is gratifying to hear that. The Parliamentary Secretary also said that £10,000 was to be spent on the further opening up of bogs.  That is again an extension of the unemployment assistance scheme.  That must be very welcome to the people of West Clare.  But if these sums of money are to be available to the people in West Clare, there are other sums of money which were available to the people of West Clare that are not now going in there.  I think in West Clare area the Parliamentary Secretary could pick out four centres where fairs which were held at particular periods of the year brought annually into these places a lot more than the £6,000 that went into Doonbeg.  The fair at Doonbeg was perhaps worth more in any year than the £6,000 that the Parliamentary Secretary says is going there in respect of turf.</P>
    <P>We would be glad to know from the Minister what other areas in the country, as well as West Clare, are benefiting by the sale of turf, and in what other parts of the country development of the type the Parliamentary Secretary speaks about, such as the expenditure of £10,000 on the opening up of bogs, is going on.  It seems to me that <Col N="1211" /> the whole thing is being approached in a most absurd and mixed-up way.  It would be no harm to have some kind of legislation dealing with the matter, but it would be interesting if the Minister could tell us the ground that would be covered by his legislation and whether this elaborate scheme of a company with a capital of £150,000 is simply a figment of the imagination or is actually going on; and whether it is going on entirely outside the Government's scheme of development.</P>
    <P>Another question that arises is the price of turf.  Last month the Galway County Hospital and Dispensary Committee had been able to enter into a contract for 800 tons of standard turf for the hospital at 19/4 per ton.  On the other hand, we had complaints from the Committee of Management of the Cork Mental Hospital in December last that, whereas they had experience of turf at 22/- per ton which gave a considerable amount of satisfaction, when they went to look for more of it the price had risen to 25/-.  It would be interesting to know why, with the standard price that the railways are charging for carriage, the Cork Mental Hospital has to pay 25/- for what the Galway County Hospital and Dispensary Committee could get at 19/4. Generally, however, I suggest to the Minister that the position with regard to turf development seems to be very unsatisfactory and uncontrolled and the various sums of money spent within the last 12 months seem to have brought no co-ordination into the situation. £11,000 was spent on sacks; goodness knows how much on advertisements; and, as I say, administrative costs are comparatively very high; yet there was less turf cut.  There was less turf won in 1933 than was won before the scheme was started.  We have no information as to the amount of turf won last year despite the administrative expense of looking after the scheme.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mulcahy has referred to the fact that no statement was forthcoming from the Minister as to the progress made in the production of turf.  I agree with Deputy Mulcahy that that is the gist of the thing.  As far as I know the country there has been no outstanding progress made in the production of turf in this country.  People may ask: &ldquo;What is the reason for that?  There is plenty of bog and why is it not being developed?&rdquo;  In my opinion, the reason for that is that all the money that is being spent on this business is being spent on administration and an economic price is not being paid to the people who win the turf.  If you take all the money voted here this evening, practically not a penny of it is being spent in a way that will bring about an increased production of turf.  So far as I know anything about harvesting turf, and I know something about it, I think this scheme is a failure and it is going to remain a failure so long as a decent price is not being paid to the people who produce the turf. I think it is utterly ridiculous and futile to spend money in administration and development so long as you do not pay the people who produce the turf a price that will attract them.  I was of opinion at the time that this 11/6 per ton was fixed that it was a ridiculous price, and I am of that opinion still.  If all the money that is paid to Sir John Griffith for this land and property were passed on to the producers to enable an economic price to be paid, you would then be taking the right steps to make the scheme a success, but, in my opinion, no matter what money is spent in paying engineers and in administrative expenses that will not result in producing any more turf in this country unless an economic price is paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1213" /> I made an attempt in parts of my constituency to get something done in this direction.  A man went down, either from the Irish Agricultural Wholesale Society or the Turf Board, and a meeting was held.  Prior to the meeting I had arranged with the Department of Public Works to build a new road into the bog.  When this man went down he wanted an undertaking from the people to produce a certain amount of turf before the road would be built.  When, however, the people heard that the price was to be 11/- per ton delivered at the railway station, that was the end of my road. I want to be quite frank.  I want this thing to be a success, but, as I said at the beginning, it is ridiculous to ask people to produce turf and deliver it at the railway station, which in some cases may be three or four miles away, at 11/- per ton.  At the same time, we are paying £11,000 for sacks.  I think some other means should be adopted instead of spending all this money in buying sacks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Deputy suggest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>If sheds had been constructed at railway stations where this turf could be kept dry, if waggons were not available to receive it, it would not be necessary to expend this money on bags.  You are also in my opinion spending money unnecessarily on engineers.  If you increase the price paid to producers they can drain the bogs themselves because the people who own these lands know just as much about draining the land as the engineers.  They will drain the bogs adequately if they are guaranteed a price.  An open drain a couple of feet deep would be sufficient to drain most of the bogs.  The very flat bogs in the province of Connacht would probably require scientific draining but the bogs in Donegal would require practically no drainage. I would urge upon the Minister that the road to success in this scheme lies along the line of increasing the price paid to the producer and in not spending so much money in administration. He emphasised a few times <Col N="1214" /> that the Turraun works were being carried on experimentally.  A sum of £3,000 is being given for capital purposes. Much of that money could be usefully spent in increasing the price to the producer but it is little use in expending it, if the producer is only to get 11/- per ton.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to see that the experimental work carried on there will be carried on efficiently, and to see that the men who are in control will carry it out successfully so that it cannot be said afterwards that the payment of their salaries was a waste of public money.  It is all right to appoint engineers down there to send up reports to the Department that they are carrying on experimental work, but I think they should be asked to produce some value for the money paid to them just as much as the people who are only paid 11/- per ton.  These engineers should not get all the money on the pretext that this thing is being pushed on to a success.  I appeal to the Minister to increase the price of 11/- per ton. There are many places where the turf has to be carted three and four miles to a station.  That turf has to be taken out of the bog in half-loads as a horse cannot pull a full load out of the bog.  All that means additional expense to the people who are producing the turf.  These are the people who should derive some benefit from the money that is now being spent on administration.  You can tell the people as long as you like that the Irish elk was to be found there at one time, but you will not get turf at 11/- per ton.</P>

      <P>I am afraid judging by the manner in which the Minister introduced this Estimate, he is not very heartened at his proposal.  Personally, I think that there is no justification at the present time for <Col N="1215" /> the introduction of this Estimate. Firstly, if we have sent a deputation out to some foreign country to inquire whether the production of peat fuel in that country is on an economic basis, we should have some report from them.  The House should be made aware&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any hurry about this?  Is there any hurry to make a white elephant out of this, if it is possible to make a white elephant out of peat?  That is what we are doing on the face of the Estimate.  We are voting £22,240, £2,240 of which is for engineering and administrative expenses. Might I ask the Minister what is the position, really of the Turf Development Board, and its officials?  Are these officials, for whom we are providing £2,740 here, to be permanent or temporary?  Are they holding pensionable offices?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>What are they then? They are officials of the Turf Development Board.  What are to be the duties of those people in connection with the production of peat in this country?  I think the Minister will admit that no defence has been made in any way. Deputy McMenamin spoke of 11/- per ton; the Minister mentioned 11/6.  I do not recognise either figure as an economic price.  I do not recognise the production of peat, at all, as economic if it has to be carried about.  The public Press contained reports of the Turraun Peat Works.  Has the Minister inquired through any engineering source, or from any people who have experience, as to the qualities of airdried turf and pressed or broken up turf?  I do not know whether the Minister knows the difference between the two.  I have seen the two.  My own opinion is that turf out of which the water has been pressed will never make a satisfactory fuel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1216" /> It appears to me that while we are paying £7,500 for Turraun, in fact £9,500 including the stock, we are only coming to a point at which further expenditure will be necessary.  That is how it appears to me.  I am afraid we are only experimenting with something which we already know is going to prove a failure.  I would like to see some steps taken to make it a success, if possible.  But until we have had further reports from the deputation sent abroad, as to the suitability, or otherwise, of pursuing this type of development, we should not have made a proposal to buy out this white elephant in Turraun.  I think we should have waited for the report of the experts if they are experts.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that there is a certain amount of sentiment attached to it.  A certain gentleman undertook to develop this thing, and went to expense, and possibly the nation would not like to see him let down.  Are we justified in pursuing it further and expending more money in the circumstances? I do not think the House is justified in going forward with this plan until we get some further hope. I know the Minister is not very hopeful. As to the erection of sheds and storage to the extent of £10,000, I would like to know, from the Minister, how many societies have been established and are working now in 1935 and how many went out?  I know one society where there is no production. The people are still cutting turf, and selling it, but they are not cutting more than before the Minister's scheme started.  I do not see any improvement or advance, or any more money coming to people, as a result of the peat development.  I would be very glad if it could be developed.  I am afraid, if the Minister endeavours to develop the turf before he gets a report from those people he sent out to inquire, he is moving in the wrong direction.  The House is entitled to some information before passing this Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I know very little about turf, and I do not propose to offer the Minister any advice as to <Col N="1217" /> draining bogs or marketing turf.  But there is one aspect of the case that I would like to point out to the Minister. It seems to me we cannot make up our minds as to whether we want to burn turf or coal.  There is no doubt about that.  I would like to hear the Minister deal with this aspect of the question.  Grates or ranges made to burn turf will not economically burn coal.  And you cannot get turf to burn satisfactorily in ranges that have been built to burn coal.  I do not mean to say that you could not light a fire in a grate that was especially designed for some other fuel; but there is no doubt about it that the average person has not made up his mind to give up coal and to burn turf.</P>
      <P>As there is a Turf Development Board, to be logical, they ought to go round to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health and say to him: &ldquo;Look here!  You are building a whole lot of houses and putting ranges into those houses that are not suitable for burning turf.&rdquo;  That is partly at the bottom of this uncertainty. People cannot make up their minds to take in turf.  Turf is not taking its place as a regular supply on the market where it could be got at a certain price, and would be always available.  I do not mean that there are not plenty of houses in the country where they have fireplaces suitable for turf burning.  These people have always been burning turf and will continue to do so.  But if the Minister is really anxious to get turf developed as a suitable industry there ought to be some very radical changes made in the methods of burning turf.  I would be glad if the Minister, in his reply, would answer the questions I have put to him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McMenamin, who has apparently gone, thinks that we ought to sell more turf, pay higher prices for it, but not advertise it for sale and arrange to have the turf carried loose in railway waggons instead of in sacks and delivered <Col N="1218" /> loose to the consumers.  He thinks bog drainage should be done without engineering assistance.  He seems to have devised some way in which that could be done, but he carefully avoided telling us.  I do not know how it can. We can get plenty of turf produced at 11/6 per ton delivered at the railway and canal stations as the turf is required.  It is necessary to have the turf packed in sacks because otherwise the cost of the transportation by rail or canal would be prohibitive.  The device of packing the turf in sacks which has been inaugurated in the past few years has made possible the cheap transportation of the turf to areas in which turf was not ordinarily used for fuel for a long number of years past. The expenditure on sacks is something in the nature of capital expenditure. These sacks will remain available for a number of years, and it is not necessary to charge against each ton of turf sold anything more than a fraction of the cost of the sacks.</P>
      <P>The advertising of the turf is essential to the campaign.  There would be little possibility in the circumstances which have existed up to this of securing an increased sale of turf without advertising its qualities and advertising the places and premises at which it was available.  I agree that we have now reached the stage when we will not be able to rely entirely upon the voluntary demand for turf in order to secure a sale for the quantities of turf produced, and that a certain element of compulsion will have to be introduced in some form or other.  But until that stage of compulsion is reached we have no means of securing a sale for turf except by advertising in one form or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would, of course, be complete lunacy to spend large sums of money upon the drainage of bogs and the construction of roads into bogs without competent engineering advice, and only Deputy McMenamin would have suggested it.  Last year, certain difficulties arose.  In 1933, as was stated by me in the speech from which Deputy Mulcahy quoted, by far the larger quantity of turf produced for sale <Col N="1219" /> under the Government scheme was sold before the winter was over.  There was a scarcity of turf and the Department of Industry and Commerce, who were dealing with the matter direct, was unable to meet the demand for turf.  But in 1934 the campaign for the sale of turf started very badly.  There was two reasons for this:&mdash;One was that the weather was very bad; the weather turned wet early in the autumn.  But apart from the bad weather a number of turf societies, without consideration of the consequences of their action or without consideration for their own interests, sent forward wet, unsuitable and badly won turf.  It was of an inferior quality. There were numerous complaints about the turf and that injured the sale of the turf; at the beginning of the season much damage was done.  That was damage that could not be repaired during the season.  The result was that at the end of the season the co-operative societies had quantities of this hand-won turf lying unsold on their hands.  That will be sold this season. In the meantime the societies are receiving advances on this turf to the amount of two-thirds of the standard prices.  We hope to be able to eliminate these causes which had an adverse effect on the sales.  In the first place, drastic punishment will be meted out to societies that supplied wet or unsuitable turf last year.  In the second place, by the erection of sheds at the transport points, the danger of the turf getting damaged will be eliminated.  This will enable the turf to be placed dry in the sacks and to be kept dry in the sacks so that it can be transported to the centres of consumption without damage.</P>
    <P>The board are quite confident of their ability to make a success of the scheme for the development of hand-won turf.  The board and the Department of Industry and Commerce recognise that no matter what development there may be in turf-producing machinery or as to what may be decided in regard to the new methods of winning turf by mechanical processes, <Col N="1220" /> that for many years to come hand-won turf for fuel is going to be an important feature of their activities. Consequently all the expenditure that has taken place upon the preparation of the bogs, the making of roads, the provision of sacks, the erection of sheds, and so forth, is likely to be recouped by the development of hand-turf in the future.</P>
    <P>It is well that Deputies would visualise the turf scheme in two parts first as that which is now in operation, the organisation of co-operative societies of turf producers to produce turf for sale at the fixed price of 11/6 a ton&mdash;the turf which is marketed through the coal merchants throughout the country under the regulation and supervision and control of the Turf Development Board.  In the second part there is a scheme of experimental work on turf production&mdash;the mechanical winning of turf, the utilisation of turf for power purposes and for purposes other than for fuel. These are all matters which are in progress at the moment.  The Industrial Research Council has been entrusted with this matter and the Turf Development Board has been making investigations in other countries.  They will have recommendations to make in that regard.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, other developments have taken place here independently of what the Government is doing.  I have mentioned the desirability of acquiring the Turraun bog from the Leinster Carbonising Company.  We considered that Turraun as a turf producing centre can be made very important for the country.  There is no place in the country where the experimental work of winning peat can be done more satisfactorily.  It would take two years to get any other bog in the country into the position that Turraun bog is at the moment. Very extensive sums have been spent in that way in Turraun.  Turraun turf is infinitely superior to hand-won turf. Most people will agree with that.  The only question that has arisen is the difference in price.  Turraun is dearer. One difficulty there, was the difficulty <Col N="1221" /> of transport and consequently the high cost which had to be charged for transport purposes.  In the second place Turraun never got production on the scale which would enable its capital charges to be recovered.  The briquetting plant, which is independent of this scheme, has been erected by a privately owned company.  This private company has a capital of £150,000.  Half of it was secured by a Government guarantee and half of it was independently subscribed by the company which has the right to certain patented processes owned by certain people outside this country.  They are erecting their factory in Lullymore Bog near Ticknevin in County Kildare. The factory is now being constructed, but will not come into production until the winter time in accordance with their plans of campaign. I doubt if it will be in full production this winter.  The work on the bog is proceeding.  They have a new method of winning the turf.  The method is a patented method, and involves the use of a very specialised type of machinery.  They have been laying out the bog for that method of winning, which involved a very considerable amount of work, and the factory is being constructed.  The briquetting factory will probably be ready for work in the winter, but it is doubtful that there will be any considerable store of turf ready for briquetting this winter.  There will be briquettes on sale, but they do not anticipate getting into full production until next year.  That is, however, something independent of what we are doing.  If that company prove that their process is a commercial success, and that they are able to produce and sell those briquettes at the price they anticipate, I think it will be a matter of very great importance to this country, because the fuel which they produce is a first-class fuel, having many qualities which make it superior to coal.  But the whole development is, of course, experimental, and although the persons who are behind the project are very confident of the future, nevertheless they cannot be certain that <Col N="1222" /> unexpected difficulties will not emerge. Hitherto, apart from certain delay in getting their factory erected, they are satisfied that everything is going well. In any event it is quite big enough to enable me to say that nobody can possibly mistake it for a figment of the imagination.</P>
    <P>It is not true that we had to buy Turraun because it could not carry on. Turraun was never carried on for a profit.  It was started, as I explained, with two ideas; one was the production of electricity, and secondly it was proposed to sell the surplus turf in the surrounding area.  The electricity scheme had to be dropped because of the development of the Shannon scheme, and the company undertook the sale of the briquettes in Dublin and other areas, but because of their transport difficulties they never sold sufficient turf to make the undertaking a profitable one.  Those transport difficulties have been overcome.  New roads have been constructed, and a new entrance to the works has been created.  Furthermore, Turraun peat fits into the general scheme in a way which makes it almost certain that the Board will be able to operate it at a profit apart from the fact that they will have much lower capital charges than the old Leinster Carbonising Company.  They have acquired for £4,500 what cost the Leinster Carbonising Company a good deal more.</P>
    <P>One of the matters on which the Industrial Research Council has been asked to report has been the design of grates and ranges, so as to enable turf to be used economically.  It is true that the great majority of the grates and ranges now being used in this country are primarily designed to burn coal, and very largely to burn British coal. When the Industrial Research Council have completed their report on that matter, it may be that certain changes in the instructions of the Department of Local Government will follow. Deputy Brennan was not very optimistic. His speech was very largely a caoin over what he regarded as the death of the whole turf business.  It is not going to die.  I am quite optimistic of the future.</P>

There is no need to be as mournful over the whole thing as Deputy Brennan was.  We are proceeding according to plan.  The work upon which we are engaged is experimental work.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Those people are investigating only one aspect of the problem.  Other aspects have been investigated by the Industrial Research Council, who are availing of the experience of other countries.  We cannot afford to spend the millions of pounds a year on turf research which the Russian Government expends, or the huge sums which the British Government spent not so very many years ago, or the sums which the Canadian Government are now spending.  There was a Canadian Commission in this country only a few weeks ago, trying to get the benefit of our experience and discover what was to be learned through what we are doing.  Many of the best engineers in the world are at the present time engaged on researches into turf production, and many Governments are spending large sums of money on that matter.  The briquetting plant which is being erected, and to which I have referred, if of a similar kind to that erected by the Danish Government, at Government expense, on a bog in Denmark.  It was following upon the partial success of that Danish Government factory that the company here was organised, because benefiting by the experience gained in Denmark certain difficulties and faults in their plant could be eradicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1224" /> The Danish Government, the Canadian Government and other Governments are particularly interested in this development here, and are awaiting a report upon the success of the development here before determining on their own plans in their own country.  There is one other thing which I would suggest to Deputy Brennan, and that is that he should not disparage everything related to the country.  We have a few things to be proud of.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Our experts, if they are experts,&rdquo; was the term he used. It happens that one of them is not merely an expert, but probably the greatest expert in the world at the present time on questions relating to peat, and is recognised as such in all countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>You ought to wait for his advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, and we propose to wait for his advice.  We purchased Turraun because Turraun was available, and otherwise would have been closed down at the beginning of this season, Sir John P. Griffith being too old to carry on the business, and in any case the continued losses on the undertaking were telling.  The plant at Turraun became available for purchase, and we purchased it without delay because of the effects which its closing down would have had upon employment locally, as well as because of the fact that we regarded it as a good stroke of business for the Government to acquire the plant, believing that we can make it a commercial success as part of our hand won turf scheme, but having due regard to the fact that the ownership of that prepared bog was going to be a useful asset in connection with any experimental developments that might follow upon the experts' report after their visit to other countries.  That is all we are spending in anticipation of their report&mdash;expenditure which is obviously desirable in any event.  The rest of the expenditure provided for here is in connection with the hand won turf <Col N="1225" /> development scheme.  It is true that there has been a substantial difference in the prices charged for turf in Galway and Cork.  The matter of the price charged in Cork and the price charged in Limerick and certain other centres in the South will have to receive particular attention in the coming winter.  I do not think there is any good reason why the price of standard turf in Cork should be in excess of the price in Dublin, but I understand it has been so in the past.</P>
      <P>The figures for turf cut in 1933 as against 1931 are of little significance. The quantity of turf that is cut in one year as against another very often depends on the weather and other causes, and no conclusion can be drawn by comparing one year with another.  It is true, generally speaking, that for a number of years past the production of turf has been declining.  We are not concerned with the quantity of turf cut because, of course, by far the greater proportion is cut for the producer's own use. It is not being produced for sale.  Our object in promoting the turf scheme was to try and increase the production of turf for sale and thus secure the circulation of money in districts that are very badly in need of it, because the bog areas, as a rule, are the poorest parts of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The only statistics that we have are the statistics of the turf marketed through the Turf Development Board, but even that would be only a small part of the total amount of turf sold under the Government scheme by the co-operative societies, because even the co-operative societies sell the greater part of their production, when they can, in their own localities where they can get a higher price for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is known what progress is being made and that is checked up through the other end. The number of societies that are producing turf, and the number of persons engaged in turf production under the Government scheme, are known.  The increase in the number of societies is an indication of the progress which is being made, and, incidentally, an indication that the standard price fixed is not generally regarded as unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, if the Minister eliminates the total amount of turf won in the year from any consideration bearing on progress, the test of progress is whether there is an increased amount of turf sold in the country, and the Minister says that he is not able to tell us about that.  He does not know whether he will ever be able to tell us what progress is being made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.  We will be able to tell the Deputy as soon as the scheme is put on a more organised basis, but at the present time the Turf Development Board has no control over the societies except the threat of refusing to sell their turf for them or of giving them the advantage in the expenditure of Government funds for the doing of drainage work or the construction of roads.  Before we can get the turf scheme upon a properly organised basis, it will be necessary to have legislation which will give the Turf Board certain statutory functions and certain control over the co-operative societies when it is working them.  That control is only secured in a secondhand way at the present time.</P>

    <Col N="1227" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be possible to get that figure, but I have not got it available at the moment.  Even that figure would not be a complete indication of the quantity of turf sold because very large quantities go by canal, and, as in the case of the railways, it should be possible to get the figure with regard to the quantities carried by canal.  I do not think there is any other point arising out of the discussion. The increase in the cost of administration expenses is not entirely due to increased staff.  It is, to a large extent, due to the fact that the staff of the I.A.O.S., and paid by the I.A.O.S., is being taken over by the Turf Development Board to continue to do under the control of the board the work they formerly did under the I.A.O.S.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be erected as near as possible to the railway station or the canal station, where that is considered suitable.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1228" /> Generally, the intention is to have the sheds at the point from which the greatest quantity of turf is likely to be transported.  The remainder of the sum provided here arises out of the purchase of Turraun&mdash;£4,500 for the assets.  There is £3,000 working capital for the board.  That is an advance which is repayable.  There is also £2,000 for the purchase of existing stocks at Turraun.  This sum will be repayable when the stocks are sold, as they will be sold, at the end of the present year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to say that in advance of legislation.  I say that it will be necessary to have certain powers in that regard to enable us to honour our undertaking to the societies to dispose of whatever quantity of turf which they produce in conformity to our requirements and which they cannot sell themselves. But, generally speaking, the powers that we will seek will probably be designed to enable the turf to be sold in the areas where it is of greatest economic value.  These would be the areas adjacent to the bogs.</P>
