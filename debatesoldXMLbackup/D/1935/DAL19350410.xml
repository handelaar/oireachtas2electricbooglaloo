      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the President whether his attention was directed to the announcement in the British House of Commons on April 2nd that arrangements are being made for an informal discussion on Empire defence; whether an invitation to take part in these discussions has been received by the Executive Council and whether it is the intention of the Government to participate in any conference convened for this purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy's question has reference to the replies given by the British Prime Minister in the House of Commons on the 2nd April.  I have read these replies and can find in them no statement that arrangements are being made for a discussion on British Empire defence.  No invitation to take part in any such discussion has been received by the Executive Council and the matter has consequently not been considered.</P>

      <P>As I stated in my reply to a question put by Deputy Micheál O Braonáin on the 13th February, the terms of the arrangement made with the British Government were that quotas for cattle in the year 1935 would be increased in all categories by 33? per cent. over the quotas for 1934 in return for increased purchases by the Saorstát of coal to an equivalent value.</P>

      <P>My attention has been called to certain irregularities in connection with the operations of one public utility society under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous <Col N="2131" /> Provisions) Act, 1932, and I have given directions in that instance that no grants be paid to the society until it conforms with the rules governing such societies.</P>

      <P>If the Minister will inquire in his own Department he will find that there was a case in the law courts recently in the course of the hearing of which moderately severe strictures were passed by the judge; and I think the Minister will have no difficulty in finding that numbers of public utility societies are run by building contractors?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say what difficulty is experienced in furnishing the information?  I take it there can be no difficulty in the assistance officer getting the record of the number of vouchers distributed.  If that information were not available the matter would be open to grave abuse. Would it not be possible for the assistance officer or the superintendent home assistance officer to ascertain what the precise number of vouchers issued was?  That seems essential in connection with the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether his attention has been called to the decision in respect of the blind pensioner No. 2993, by which the pension was reduced by 7/- per week; whether he is aware that in this case the present rate of pension is 4/- per week less than the rate in force previous to the enactment of the Act of 1932; whether he is aware that in this decision the pensioner has not been given the benefit of the provisions of Section 7 of the 1932 Act; further, whether he will state the legislative provision under which there are taken into account the allowances of children when calculating the means of the parent for the purpose of blind persons' pensions; and whether he will indicate the regulation under which the income of applicants for blind pensions under Section 2 of the Blind Persons Act, 1920, is taken into account when determining the amount of the pension provided under Section 1 of that Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The case referred to is apparently that of Matthew Dunne, 3 Camden Place, Dublin, who held a pension of 10/- a week under the Blind Persons Act.  On a question raised by the pension officer the pension was reduced to 3/- a week from 21st December, 1934.</P>
      <P>The Act of 1932 made no reduction in the weekly rate of pensions as suggested.  Moreover Dunne, who was born in 1890, was not 50 years of age prior to 1932 and could not have held a blind pension before then.</P>
      <P>Section 7 of the Old Age Pension Act of 1932 cannot apply to this case, as the pension was allowed subsequent to this Act.</P>
      <P>The calculation of the pensioner's means is made under Section 2 (1) (b) of the Old Age Pension Act, 1911, which contains no provision to authorise the deduction of the cost of maintenance of children in ascertaining parents' income.</P>

      <P>asked the <Col N="2134" /> Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that the wages paid by the contractor for the Grange and Johnstown, Fermoy, County Cork, water supply, are at the rate of 28/9 per week; if the recognised rate in the district is 35/- per week, and whether he is prepared to withhold payment of the State grant in respect of this work until the contractor undertakes to pay wages at the recognised rate; further, if he is aware that, in selecting men to work on this scheme, the contractor discriminated against local labour; whether the specification for the work was altered subsequent to the contract being placed, and, if so, whether he can state on what grounds the alteration was made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the rate of wages paid by the contractor for this work.  The particulars furnished by the local authority of the men employed on the work indicated that the conditions governing the grant were observed.  The specification also set out that all skilled and unskilled labour should be employed through the nearest labour exchange office.  A proportion of the grant was paid to the local authority before the end of March.  I am unaware of any change in specification subsequent to the contract being placed on the information before me at present.  I see no adequate reason for withholding the grant, but I will make further inquiries into the position.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, would he make further inquiries in order to ascertain if, in the case of schemes of this kind and numerous other schemes, there is a striking difference in the rates of wages paid?  Would it be possible for the Minister to consider whether, as in the case of grants made to county councils for the maintenance of roads, that it would be a condition of the grant that a fixed rate of wages should be paid approximating to the local rate of wages?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if the holder of a qualification certificate under the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933, who surrenders his certificate when lodging an appeal against a means assessment is regarded, pending the reissue of the certificate, as being ineligible for employment on relief schemes and other public works as an unemployed person and if, having regard to the existing practice and the statement made in the Dáil on November 15th, 1934, by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, he can indicate in general terms the nature of the instructions issued in reference to such applicants for work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The order of preference which has been prescribed for the selection of persons for employment on relief works has been designed with the purpose of securing that where <Col N="2139" /> there is not work available for all applicants first preferences will be given to those most in need of work. To give effect to the principle involved it has been decided that in selecting persons for employment on public work financed from Central Funds first preference must be given to persons who are in receipt of unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>The fact that the holder of a qualification certificate has appealed against the assessment of his means by an assistance officer does not debar him from claiming and receiving assistance and so entitling him to preference for employment on works financed from Central Funds, provided he satisfies the statutory conditions for its receipt and is free from the statutory disqualifications.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he will state what provision is made to investigate the complaints of persons who allege, as was alleged by a number of persons in Cappawhite, that payment of benefit under the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933, where the recipient holds a qualification certificate, is discontinued improperly or as the result of allegations which they have no opportunity for several months of rebutting; whether he is aware that persons whose benefit is discontinued in this manner are suffering great hardship, and if he is prepared to make arrangements for a speedy determination in these cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>As pointed out in a reply addressed to the Deputy on the 20th March, 1935, an unemployment assistance officer in discharge of his obligations under the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933, is bound to investigate any information coming to his notice which affects or which may affect the question of the fulfilment of the statutory conditions for the receipt of unemployment assistance, and where the necessity for such investigation arises, the necessary action is taken as expeditiously as possible.  If as a result of investigation the unemployment assistance officer determines that unemployment <Col N="2140" /> assistance is not payable, the applicant is duly notified without delay of the determination and of his right of appeal to a court of referees which is provided by Section 20 (3) of the Act.  Every applicant for unemployment assistance, therefore, in whose case there is a determination by an unemployment assistance officer which is adverse to the applicant is afforded, without delay, an opportunity of contesting the determination, and in cases of successful appeal, payment of unemployment assistance, including accrued arrears, is made without any avoidable delay.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that, provided applicants avail adequately and promptly of the right of appeal afforded to them, there can be no reasonable complaint against the existing procedure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, would he indicate what he considers reasonable delay, considering that these are people who have proven themselves to be entitled to unemployment assistance, have qualified under the Act, and who, because some unknown person, perhaps evilly disposed, writes in something about them, they are immediately struck off the benefit list and allowed to starve while they are waiting for an investigation?  I consider that the delays are very unreasonable. I think that they should not be struck off from benefit before they get an opportunity of proving themselves to be the victims of false information.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether the order prescribing two employment periods for rural workers during which they will not be entitled to obtain benefit under the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933, applies to single men who are without means; whether it applies to single men in rural areas other than those usually designated as agricultural workers; whether before making the order he obtained evidence that work will be available for the men concerned during the currency of the order; whether if work is not available these men will be entitled to receive home assistance during the period from which the payment of unemployment assistance is suspended; whether in the event of the men concerned receiving home assistance he will be prepared to accept that fact as evidence that they are unable to obtain work, and, if so, whether in that case he will be prepared to cancel the order and restore their title to unemployment assistance.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, can he say specifically whether there was a detailed examination by his Department in order to ascertain that certain persons in the areas referred to in the order will, in fact, be able to get employment during the period specified in the order; and, if they are not able to get employment <Col N="2142" /> and are forced, because of their destitute circumstances, to apply for and subsequently obtain home assistance, will he not accept their receipt of home assistance as clear evidence that the work is not available for them and will he in these circumstances agree to restore the unemployment assistance benefit since it is palpable that there is no employment to be got in these cases?</P>

    <P>I am unable to make that distinction, and would refer the Deputy to my <Col N="2144" /> answer of the 28th March, 1935, to his earlier question on the same subject, in which I stated in effect that all persons seeking employment as clerks are taken into consideration in the process of selection.

Advice can also be obtained from the agricultural instructors in these counties or direct from the Department. According to information available, flax growing during the present season is likely to be undertaken mainly by farmers who are thoroughly conversant with the proper methods of cultivating the crop, and in these circumstances it is not thought necessary to provide special instructors, nor, having regard to the uncertainty as regards prices, is it deemed expedient to encourage the extension of flax growing on the part of farmers who have no previous experience of the crop.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the Committee discussion on this Bill, with the principle of which the Opposition is in agreement, the following fact emerged: At column 2065, volume 55, No. 6 of the Official Debates the Minister is reported as having said: &ldquo;I disagree that there is any necessity for anything mandatory, telling the Minister to do that, for this reason, that this possibly does not represent the final form of the Local Loans Fund.  I should like to say that the Bill is a preliminary one.&rdquo;  Out of that statement this question naturally arises&mdash; why did you introduce a preliminary Bill at this moment, in the middle of considerable pressure of public business if it was not for some ulterior motive?  Why did you not wait until you had all the relevant data to introduce a permanent Bill?  It is not a contentions measure.  Of course, the explanation springs to the eye.  The fact is that when the Minister came to the end of his financial year, and summoned the <i>Irish Times</i> and the <i>Irish Press</i> to explain his financial skill, both of them said: &ldquo;Now we can do a great deal to boost you, but there are limits to what we can expect our <Col N="2157" /> readers to swallow.&rdquo;  The <i>Irish Times</i> was ready to claim a surplus of £500,000; the <i>Irish Press</i> said: &ldquo;We cannot persuade our readers to believe in anything more than £1,000,000&rdquo;; but both agreed that if they had to provide for the £4,000,000 which were appropriated to local loans in the Budget there could be no face put upon the surplus at all.  A scheme was then devised whereby the Minister provided in the Supply Services Estimates of April, 1934, that local loans would not be used, that we would introduce this Bill, and postpone that item of expenditure to a later date.  That conspiracy to deceive the public as to the true significance of the Budget is made more interesting when one realises that the <i>Irish Times</i> surplus of £500,000&mdash;the laurel wreath from Westmoreland Street which the Minister wears on his brow&mdash;was claimed in the full knowledge that not only was there no actual surplus but that, on the figures of the Minister's Budget as introduced here last May there would have been, on the <i>Irish Times</i> calculation, a small deficit, and on the <i>Irish Press</i> calculation a deficit of £400,000, for both those newspapers conveniently forgot to observe that, in addition to the Budget introduced in May, the Minister has introduced cumulatively during the year a very large Supplementary Budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Partially.  Having done that, he baulked when he came to appropriating money to the Local Loans Fund.  I remember very well in 1931 the Minister's predecessor in this House introduced a Supplementary Budget to meet a prospective deficit. The present Minister for Finance went into hysterics.  He wept on the floor of the House at the picture of the appalling burden which was going to be laid on the backs of the taxpayers by this Supplementary Budget.  The <i>Irish Times</i> had its doubts.  They said the hour had come to sound a note of warning that extravagance was running mad in the country, and that something must be done to save the credit of the State.  I forget whether <Col N="2158" /> the <i>Irish Press</i> was in existence at the time, but doubtless if it was it conducted hysterics of its own down on the quays.  That was all because a Supplementary Budget was introduced, for the purpose of raising something over £500,000.  When that course was decided upon, the Budget was introduced, the purpose was fully explained to the House, and the correct procedure followed.  What does the present Minister for Finance do in much worse circumstances?  There is no Supplementary Budget, but there is a pig levy, a coal duty and a sugar duty put on in the course of 12 months by underhand methods.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I sought to make was this: The Minister explained the introduction of the Local Loans Bill in an imperfect form by saying that this is a temporary measure.  My submission to the House is that he introduced the Local Loans Bill in an imperfect form for dishonest financial purposes.  On the Fifth Stage I am warning the House that in passing the Local Loans Bill at this juncture and in this form they are co-operating with the Minister in his dishonest purpose of covering up a very substantial deficit in the Budget.  Not only is he relieving the supply services of £4,000,000 by this Bill, but he has already added to the tax revenue of the country by underhand methods the sum which was realised by the coal duty, by the pig levy, by the sugar duty, and by the tariffs which have accrued to him under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Orders which have been made since last May.  The Minister, through those methods, has raised in taxation a sum considerably in excess of the sum which his predecessor raised by the Supplementary Budget of 1931.  Comparing the two financial procedures&mdash;&mdash;</P>

By the <Col N="2159" /> time he reaches his Budget his laurel wreath from Westmoreland Street will be a very ragged decoration, but still I want him to wear it, tattered as it may be.  The <i>Irish Times</i> surplus&mdash; and the Minister is strutting about the country showing it to his supporters as his certificate of financial probity&mdash;is made up of the chicanery of this Bill, and of the Supplementary Budget, as big as or bigger than that of the Ministers's predecessor in 1931.  The House should realise that when it consents to the passage of this emergency measure. They should realise that although we accept the principle of this Bill we cannot approve of using it as a piece of chicanery in order to cover up, in conspiracy with the <i>Irish Times</i> and the <i>Irish Press</i>, the Minister's financial turpitude.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Committee Stage of this Bill, Sir, I was putting certain questions to the Minister for Finance, and your direction was that they would be better raised on the Final Stage.  I regret that I was not present at the Second Stage, but on the Committee Stage I felt that the Minister for Finance was hedging a bit.  I am sure he will now disillusion me on that point.  I see the necessity for this Bill. I also compliment the Minister on being wise enough to see that a central authority should hold control of borrowing by local authorities&mdash;that is, borrowing in the open market.  I am aware of a lot of schemes which were discussed by local authorities for raising money both separately and collectively.  I presume they came before the Minister for Finance, and he has put this Bill on the stocks in preference to any of those suggestions. I think he was wise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few points upon which I am not clear.  In this Bill the Minister will ascertain the aggregate value of outstanding loans.  I am particularly interested in the manner in which he proposes to manipulate the local loans outstanding that were granted prior to 1922.  It is on that I thought the Minister was hedging on the Committee Stage.  As I interpret this measure, this is the way he proposes <Col N="2160" /> to handle those loans.  This fund will get revenue in the shape of annual or half-yearly payments on foot of those loans that will be paid into the new Local Loans Fund from and after the appointed day, and any money to the credit of local loans in the hands of the Department of Finance will be transferred to the Local Loans Fund on the appointed day and any loans sanctioned but not placed will be placed after the appointed day by the Local Loans Fund.  From the Central Fund, as the Minister thinks fit any time subsequent to the appointed day, he can transfer sums to this Local Loans Fund but the Local Loans Fund will be liable for the service of the money so transferred and the redemption of that capital money to the Central Fund.  The Minister will issue a certificate when he ascertains the amount of the present aggregate value of the local loans outstanding.</P>
    <P>Let us come to that section of the local loans outstanding which represents the money that was advanced by the British Government to borrowers, local authorities and private individuals. That will be included in the Minister's certificates.  On the appointed day, or on the day he issues the certificates, the Minister will indicate that the amount of money representing the present value of the annuities from the loans made by the British has been transferred from the Central Fund to the Local Loans Fund.  In another section he says that the Local Loans Fund must pay back to the central authority any money the central authority gives to the Fund.  In other words, the capital value of the money outstanding representing the loans advanced by the British is going to be deemed by this Bill to be money lent to this Local Loans Fund by the present Government.  I would like Deputies to observe how the whole plot works.  On the strength of that income, including the income from the British loans outstanding, on the strength of the revenue to the Local Loans Fund from the moneys lent by the British, moneys which have not been lent to local authorities or private individuals <Col N="2161" /> by any central government in this country, the Minister proposes to borrow for the credit of this Local Loans Fund.</P>
    <P>Another section says that that money which is deemed to have been transferred to the Local Loans Fund from our Central Fund must be recouped; in other words, the Minister under this Bill is going to ascertain the present value of the money due to the British on foot of the loans made by the British.  When this is an Act he is going to use this Local Loans Fund to borrow that amount of money represented by what is outstanding on foot of the British debt and transfer that into the Central Fund.  In effect, as regards the revenue that is coming to the Government at the present time on foot of moneys lent by the British, he is going to pawn that and from the pawnbroker he is going to get the capital value as a windfall for the Exchequer. That is my interpretation of the various sections.</P>
    <P>In Sections 2 and 3 the Minister fixes the appointed day and establishes the fund.  Under Section 5 he can borrow and Section 6 sets out that the Minister can ascertain the aggregate value of various sums on the appointed day. Sub-section (5) of Section 6 sets out:</P>
    <P>The amount stated in the certificate made and issued by the Minister under the foregoing sub-sections of this section which is for the time being the latest such certificate shall be deemed to be an advance made under this Act to the fund by the Minister on the appointed day out of the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof for the purpose of making issues from the fund in respect of local loans.</P>
    <P>In sub-section (7) of Section 5 it is laid down:&mdash;</P>
    <P>All moneys advanced to the fund out of the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof in pursuance of the next preceding sub-section of this section shall be repaid to the Central Fund out of the fund, and if and so far as such moneys are not so repaid they shall be repaid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2162" /> If this Local Loans Fund is not able to pay the pawnbroker's price, then the taxpayer will have to pay it.  I am surprised at Deputy Dillon if he accepts that juggling with moneys outstanding.  I would like to know what are the conditions which will convince the Minister that an outstanding loan is deemed to be irrecoverable.  How does it arise?</P>
    <P>Section 12 says: &ldquo;Notwithstanding anything contained in any other Act, the rate of interest on and the method and period of repayment of every local loan made after the passing of this Act shall be such as the Minister shall direct either generally or in any particular case.&rdquo;  I wonder the Minister did not say that before.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (2) says &ldquo;the rate of interest fixed by the Minister under the next preceding sub-section of this section shall in every case be sufficient, in the opinion of the Minister, to enable the loans or loan to which such rate applies to be made without loss to the fund.&rdquo; I would like to know from the Minister what relation the rate of interest bears to the rate of interest at which the money can be borrowed in the market, and to the local loans made by the British which amounted to £5,000,000 or £6,000,000.  I do not know which it was, but let us say £5,000,000 was the amount of it.  The Minister lays it down that that sum of money must not be lent at a loss. But surely it costs the Minister nothing.  What is he going to lose on <Col N="2163" /> lending it?  What rate of interest is he charging upon that?  I should be very glad, and it would be very interesting, to have that information from the Minister.  Is he going to charge more than the original charge which the British made when they lent it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-section (1) of Section 14 says: &ldquo;No part of the principal of or the interest on any local loan shall be written off the assets of the fund, save in pursuance of an expressed direction in that behalf contained in an Act of the Oireachtas passed after this Act.&rdquo; On that matter, Deputy Dillon asked, a moment ago, why not include that in this particular Act so that we would have the whole lot together. The Minister proposes what, I think, is an innovation in the matter of public lending by the Government, namely a penal interest.  I would like the Minister either to explain whether that assumption is wrong or frankly to admit that he is about to capitalise the annuities from the loans granted by the British.  I would like him to say whether that is so or not.  Further, I would like to hear from him if at the present time&mdash;he will be betraying no secrets&mdash;any money that he has already cashed is available to transfer to this fund.  The Minister must be aware of the urgent difficulties that are besetting local authorities, without exception, in trying to get sufficient money to carry out their annual programme.  One of the largest local authorities in this country is very much perturbed at the present moment as to the dispensing of money, in useful services, because of the need for ready cash. Responsible officers in local authorities would have their minds put at ease if the Minister made a gesture to show that there was money available and sufficient, and the amount of that money and the rate of interest at which it would be loaned.  A serious position is confronting all local authorities and if this position is going to be alleviated, if collective borrowing on the rates of the local authorities is going to relieve them in <Col N="2164" /> the existing conditions which are almost insoluble, it would be very welcome news to the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Many local authorities are waiting to see if the Minister would make any comment or give any indication that money will be immediately available, or will be available in the immediate future, in order to enable the local authorities to get their requirements through, whether they will be housing schemes directly carried out by the local authorities such as the building of cottages in rural parts, and the administration of the Small Dwellings Act in various other places.  These are matters pressing very severely on the local authorities now.  I would be glad if the Minister would explain how he has successfully pawned these annuities which were hitherto paid to the British, and if he would explain the extent to which he has successfully pawned them, and if he would give us an idea of the money we may expect to be available in the near future for public utility purposes.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Belton did not so often talk, for the sake of talking, he might, occasionally, make an intelligent speech upon a matter like this. It is quite obvious that the Deputy has not studied this Bill at all.  So far as the local authorities are concerned this Bill proposes to make no change in the existing state of affairs. Those of them that are not able to borrow on more favourable terms elsewhere, and desire to carry out works approved by the Minister for Local Government can, if they care to, go to the Local Loans Fund and secure advances upon the terms that at present prevail.  There is nothing in the Bill that touches that at all; but Deputy Belton for the sake of talking for an extra ten minutes kept rambling round and round that point.  Of course, it was not by any means the least sensible or public-spirited part of his speech, nonsensical and all as it was.  The most positively damaging, from the point of view of this country, was the earlier portion of the speech where he referred <Col N="2165" /> to the pre-1922 loans.  The Deputy knows as well as I do that those loans are in dispute.  He knows that the question of those loans is in dispute between this country and another country; that we claim, as Deputy Belton once claimed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash; that they are the property of this State and that they are properly payable into the Exchequer of this people.  That was Deputy Belton's one-time position, but now he gets up here in the House to-day and talks as if we were engaged in rigging the Stock Market and trying to put something over on honest people here and elsewhere.  He said&mdash; I have his exact words here&mdash;&ldquo;we are going to manipulate these moneys which were advanced by the British.&rdquo; The Deputy, certainly, has become absorbed in the Commonwealth.  These moneys were advanced by the joint Exchequer of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and these moneys were moneys collected and raised from the Irish people in taxation and advanced by the common Exchequer for the purposes of local development in this State.  They are our moneys because they were taken from us in the first instance.  But Deputy Belton speaks of them as moneys advanced by the British and says that we are going to manipulate them.  Then he went on to say, &ldquo;Let us see then how the plot works.&rdquo; Notice the choice diction with which Deputy Belton clothes his sometimes confused thought.  The Minister, he alleged is going to borrow on the strength of that.  How much is he going to borrow on the strength of that?  Deputy Belton did not even read the Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy Belton did not see Section 4 of the Bill which limits the borrowing power of the Minister to £5,000,000.  In all his laborious work on the Committee Stage of this Bill, Deputy Belton did not think it worth while to ask the Minister for Finance what was the aggregate value of the <Col N="2166" /> assets we were going to transfer to the fund.  If he had done so, he would then see how nonsensical is the statement he has just made.  The assets which are going to be transferred to this fund are, on the lowest computation, a good deal more than twice £5,000,000, and, apart altogether from the pre-1922 loans, the security which this fund can offer to the people is very much more than the £5,000,000 which it may borrow.  Deputy Belton, however, wanted it to appear that this Government is so dishonest in its financial policy that it is trying to borrow on the security of something that does not belong to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few remarks on this matter, Sir, if I may, before proceeding with amendment No. 1.  It was rather unfortunate that the Second Reading of this Bill was presented only a few days after the House sat after the recess and it went through the House almost unnoticed.  Unfortunately, I was absent for the Committee Stage, and I should like to put a few points to the Minister now, with your permission, Sir.</P>
      <P>This is a Bill which we ought to be unanimous about passing, in so far as the provision of courthouses is a necessity and will, I hope, always be a necessity.  I mean that whatever Government may be in power in this country they must look to it that there is accommodation for law and for the maintenance of order.  There has been in this country a system of dual control so far as courthouses are concerned&mdash;dual custody and dual control&mdash;which has never been satisfactory and, in fact, has been far from satisfactory. I must say that the drafters of this Bill do not seem to be aware of that.  This Bill is an attempt to perpetuate a system that has never been accepted as a satisfactory system by anybody.  My suggestion is that the Minister ought to withdraw this Bill as it stands and get together county registrars and either county surveyors or the secretaries of the county councils and have a consultation with them.  If he does that, I have not the slightest doubt that he will get a much better Bill for the provision and maintenance of courthouses than this Bill is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, this Bill is an attempt to perpetuate the type of dual custody which is enshrined here in <Col N="2168" /> Section 2 and which, I would point out to the Minister, really governs the whole Bill.  Section 2 says: &ldquo;Where a part only of a building is provided and maintained and is used as courthouse accommodation within the meaning of this Act and the residue of such building is provided and maintained and is used for other purposes, nothing in this Act shall apply to such residue of such building.&rdquo;  There is a type of dual custody which we have all over the country in large courthouses.  Let us imagine a courthouse where a county registrar has his office and where he has to carry on at the present time the duties of a sheriff, and where you have also the county offices in the same building and there is need for an extension of offices and office accommodation. That sort of thing is arising every day.  What is going to happen in that case?  Who has the right to say which office belongs to the county registrar and which shall be used by the county secretary?  That section really governs the whole spirit of the Bill and right through the Bill we have instances where the county registrar and the District Court clerk have the right to do certain things, such as letting and hiring out courthouses, which, to my mind, is extremely absurd. I think that there ought to be some one party or person in control of the courthouses and that party or person ought to be the county council that have the responsibility of erecting them.  I object, however, to the county council being put to the expense of £12,000 or £13,000 to build courthouses and then to have them placed in the custody of the District Court clerk I would appeal to the Minister to have a consultation on this matter with the people interested.</P>
    <P>I have interested myself, and I have had consultations with at least two county registrars, and the Bill does not please anybody as it stands, and, in my opinion, will not be effective in its present form.  I should like to have the Minister's view on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Ruttledge) Minister for Justice (Mr. Ruttledge)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>What I would say with regard to that is this.  The Department has had representations from time to time from <Col N="2169" /> people interested, such as county registrars and other officials through the country, and they are aware of the position that exists, and it is very unsatisfactory in parts of the country. The heads of this Bill were drafted a good many years ago.  Since the heads of the Bill were drafted about six or seven years ago various people were consulted.  The only change that has been made in the Bill is what arose with regard to Dun Laoghaire Borough, which was a small matter of adjustment between the respective public bodies concerned. The heads of the Bill remained there.</P>
      <P>The position as it stands at present is that the sub-sheriff has control of the courthouse so far as the matter of courts is concerned.  That is with regard to county courthouses.  The position with regard to district courthouses is most unsatisfactory.  So far as we can see, proper authority does not reside in anybody.  What happens is that courts are held in the great majority of places perhaps once a month, and a room is taken over some business premises when more suitable accommodation could not be got.  We are compelled to take up the position that there must be somebody in definite control residing in them.  The Deputy knows as well as I do that various county councils and public bodies have the habit of letting or hiring them out to certain people for dances and other purposes.  Sometimes they give them gratis.  Complaints have very often come in from district justices and other officials concerned as to the condition in which courthouses were often left. Although the Deputy may be a member of a model county council, I suggest that there are public bodies who have been careless as to the way in which they kept the courthouse, and, as the Deputy knows as well as I do from reading newspapers, district justices have been compelled to abandon the holding of sittings in certain places because lights and other things are not provided.  We are forced to the opinion, at any rate, that so far as we can see the only way to deal with it is to define the responsibility definitely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing reactionary in the Bill.  Local authorities are not being <Col N="2170" /> interfered with as regards the portions of the building with which they are concerned, but, so far as the courthouse itself is concerned, I submit that it is a matter that should be regulated by the officials concerned who have to deal with the business and get their work disposed of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>My endeavour is, if possible, to provide a reasonably good working instrument if we can.  I am as interested in the matter as the Minister, and I am afraid that the <Col N="2171" /> Minister has misunderstood me.  As to having somebody in the courthouse, I am entirely at one with the Minister in that.  This Bill does not at all preclude the giving of a courthouse for the purpose of dances or entertainments. It simply takes it out of the control of the county council and puts it into other persons' hands.  What is really objectionable in the Bill to my mind is that it does not give effective control. You have dual control as far as the large courthouses are concerned and, in the case of the small courthouses, you have the District Court clerk in control, and not the country council.  If a courthouse wants repairs the county council has its county surveyor, who is an expert in these matters, which the county registrar or the District Court clerk is not.</P>
      <P>I would like to see the Bill withdrawn and that some consultation should take place with the people concerned, so that we should have proper control of the courthouses, that they would be properly maintained and that the custody of them would be unquestioned and unquestionable.  I should like to hear the Minister on that point, because no matter how you manage this Bill, as it stands with Section 2 there you cannot properly effect the reforms which we all desire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not want to interfere in any way with any local authority except so far as the courthouse accommodation is concerned.  In the opinion of the Department, and I think Deputies themselves know it is essential, that matter should be put under the control of the officials who have to deal with the working of the courts.  There are certain public bodies who have created considerable difficulty about doing anything with courthouses, or making them fit or suitable for justices to preside in them.  This is as far as we can get to try and provide that courthouse accommodation shall be reasonable and suitable.  It is the only means that we can see to do it effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Bill is not going to do it.  If the Minister consults <Col N="2172" /> county registrars, county secretaries, and county surveyors, who really ought to know about these matters, he will find that they do not at all agree that this Bill will meet the requirements of the situation.  On the question of the courthouse accommodation being in the custody of the officers of the court, the difficulty arises with regard to the larger courthouses where there are other offices.  It is a question of where the custody begins and ends &mdash;at which office door.  The office requirements of county councils and county registrars are increasing daily. As I say, I should like to see an Act passed which would ensure that we would have proper courthouses all over the country because, as I said, no matter what Government is in office that must continue.  I do not at all agree that this is the best way to do it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>We have tried to get as much information as we could in the matter.  If the Deputy has any information as to any better solution of it which we think will do the thing more effectively, I am prepared to have the matter looked into before it goes to the Seanad, but I am not prepared to withdraw the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Imagine a courthouse such as we have in Roscommon with a certain number of apartments.  The county council occupies a certain number and the county registrar and <Col N="2173" /> the District Court clerk occupy others. If the country registrar wants increased accommodation and the county council wants increased accommodation and there is an office vacant who is to get it?  If there are external repairs required, who is to be responsible for them?  Here we have the county registrar under Section 2 responsible at least for the custody of a certain portion of the building together with a room three or four doors away.  The whole thing to my mind is very badly mixed up.  I do not think the Bill is going to effect the purpose which it is thought it will.  I think it is really beyond all reason to say that the District Court clerk should have the letting or hiring out of a courthouse. The Roscommon County Council recently built some courthouses&mdash;one at least very recently&mdash;in which they provided accommodation for technical classes.  Now they will not have the letting or the hiring of this accommodation. It will be in somebody else's hands and may be let for some other purpose.  I do not think that is good enough.  I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 4, Section 3 (1) (b), to delete all words after the word &ldquo;times&rdquo; to the end of line 5.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (b) reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(b)  for the transaction of the business by law assigned to or usually transacted in or by any office or officer of any such court, both during the sitting of such court and at all other times, whether such business is court business or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The words I should like to have deleted are &ldquo;whether such business is court business or not.&rdquo;  There is a further paragraph, (c), which says: &ldquo;for the transaction of the business of the office of the under-sheriff where and so long as such office exists.&rdquo;  I think it is wide enough to embrace everything without adding these words.  What are we to read into it?  Can a county registrar or his clerk or some of his typists carry on some business in any of those courts, whether it is court business or not?  I think the situation is fully covered by sub-section (c), which says: &ldquo;for the transaction of the business of the office of the under-sheriff <Col N="2174" /> where and so long as such office exists,&rdquo; and I do not see any necessity for adding to the section the words &ldquo;whether such business is court business or not.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Subject to the general or particular directions of the Minister, the custody and control of courthouse accommodation which is provided and maintained under this Act shall, where such courthouse accommodation is used for the purpose of a District Court and no other court, be vested in the District Court clerk for the district in which such accommodation is situate, and shall, where such accommodation is used for the purposes of any court other than a District Court (whether it is or is not also used for the purposes of a District Court), be vested in the county registrar for the county in which such accommodation is situate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment, as the Ceann Comhairle points out, really covers all the following ones, that is that the custody ought to be vested in the county council.  It is the authority responsible for the erection of the courthouses and I am prepared to accept that the council must provide by order of the county registrar or by order of the Minister, accommodation for the courts.  I think, however, it is manifestly unfair that a county council having been obliged to provide £600 or £1,000 for a village courthouse and having erected it, making accommodation as we have endeavoured to do, for cookery classes under the Vocational Education Committee, finding the control as far as letting or hiring was concerned, placed in the hands of the District Court clerk over whom the council has neither control nor authority.  Further, that clerk can, according to a further sub-section, <Col N="2176" /> with the consent of the Minister, procure the supply of firing as well as lighting to an amount not exceeding £10 and as far as I can see there is no method provided for checking his account.  I maintain that the proper people in whom the custody of the courthouse should be placed are the local council, the people who erected the courthouse and if the Minister feels that the county council is not of itself, without being pushed by some higher authority, providing proper accommodation for the carrying on of court work, I am quite prepared to accept that the county registrar or the Minister should be the people to compel them to do it.  I do not accept anything like what is in this Bill, that the county council must erect everything they are told to erect and having erected it, cease to have control of it, allowing it to pass into the hands of the District Court clerk or registrar who have no qualifications as far as engineering qualifications are concerned, to see what is really required with regard to alterations. The county council, through the county surveyor, can deal with those matters and particularly in respect of rural courthouses, the council ought to have the right to say who is going to conduct classes or who has the right to have entertainments.  I am afraid that the District Court clerk might possibly be open to persuasion to allow entertainments that might not be possibly of the same type as would be allowed if the county council had control.</P>
    <P>Where you have control like that vested in one person you are always up against the possibility of there being considerations other than the merits of the case.  I would press the Minister very hard to see if we could get some accommodation on that.  I still have no doubt that if the Minister had a consultation with the various interests concerned in this matter he would alter his mind considerable.  However, I must only move my amendment as it stands, if the Minister is not prepared to meet me on the other matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The under-sheriff has got control of the courthouse accommodation. We have seen the position where some county councils attempt to let some portion of their courthouses as accommodation for certain classes. The Deputy has experience on that matter.  I think he mentioned that they let the courthouse in Roscommon for the purpose of technical education, and the sub-sheriff who has been in control has apparently put no difficulty in the way.  When you have the county registrar in charge instead of the under-sheriff, with his authority very clearly defined, you are not going to have any more difficulty than there was in the past.</P>
      <P>In regard to the supply of light and heat, if the county council neglects to do so, then where the amount does not exceed £12 the District Court clerk can get that done himself, and the bill is submitted to the county council in the ordinary way.  There is nothing attempted in that other than what was the previous position, except to clearly define it, and to secure that public bodies who have neglected in the past to supply suitable and proper courthouse accommodation will not be allowed to hold up the position as it has been held up in the past.</P>

      <P>From everybody's point of view.  I can instance for the Minister a case where a county sheriff refused permission for a certain function in the courthouse.  The secretary of the county council and the county registrar were anxious to meet the people.  There was very bad local feeling in the matter, and the Department <Col N="2178" /> of Justice had to interfere.  Until the sheriff ceased to be sheriff the principle which prevailed in that county was that there was never permission given for any function there without the consent of the sheriff, the county registrar and the county secretary combined. Does the Minister want a continuance of that?  I certainly do not. I want to get the matter cleared up. I want to get it under somebody's control, so that you will have nothing like that arising.  I have not objected to the county registrar having certain control.  The point which I laid most stress on, and which the Minister avoided, was my objection to District Court clerks having control of the rural courthouses.  Those are the places where we have the classes.  The county registrar, either in the past year or under this Bill, has no control whatever over them, but the District Court clerk has control under the Bill. I object to that.  I think it is uncalled for.  I think he ought not to have it.  In the series of amendments which I have put down I have given control to the county councils, but I have provided that the consent of the county registrar and of the District Court clerk must be got when the portion they require is being used.  I think that is quite enough.</P>

      <P>Take the position of District Court clerks.  The Deputy may be thinking of many years ago when there was very little business transacted at petty sessions.  Under the 1924 Courts of Justice Act the business was considerably increased.  You had greater jurisdiction given to them.

      <P>The District Court clerk is the person who is really in charge of the courthouse, or at least the person who should be held by anybody as being responsible for looking after it properly.  It is no use trying to put the responsibility on somebody else. The county registrar lives in the county town.  The District Court clerk lives locally.  He has to see that the courthouse is in proper condition when the sitting of a court is held&mdash;sometimes once a month and sometimes oftener in bigger centres.  There is no other person that I can see who can or should be made responsible for looking after the courthouse.  The District Court clerk is there and he is officially in charge of that particular building.  You cannot be always asking the county surveyor: Who is going to ask him? Are you to be going to the county council about every little matter that crops up?  The District Court clerk must be there to see that there is no what I might call foolish letting made by the county council.  He must see that the county council or Corporation will not let the courthouse without having regard to the purposes for which it is being used, or to the damage which might be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would appear to be confusing the position of the District Court clerks with that of caretakers.  We have various courthouses all over the country in which the caretaker is already living.  In those cases the caretaker is paid a certain yearly amount, and it is his job to look after the courthouse.  If anything goes wrong by way of leakage in the roof, or as regards cleaning, lighting or heating, it has to be pointed out <Col N="2180" /> by him.  From what the Minister says, one would assume that the District Court clerk would be obliged to live in the courthouse and be responsible for seeing that everything is spick and span.  That is not so.  Why he should have the right to let or hire the courthouse I do not know.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That has not happened. When a caretaker is appointed he is appointed under certain conditions. It is his job to do certain things and he has got to do them.  I do not see how the intervention of the District Court clerk is going to be any help to either the caretaker or the county council.</P>

      <P>I understand that the District Court clerks or registrars are responsible to the Minister for Justice and not to the Minister for Local Government.  The local bodies are responsible to the Minister for Local Government.  Does the Minister not think it desirable to avoid a clash between those two Departments in this particular instance?  Does he think it is a good principle to compel local bodies to meet expenditure incurred by persons who are under the charge of the Department here?  The Minister seems to assume that certain local bodies would not comply with the requirements for keeping those courthouses in proper condition, and that it would be necessary for the clerk or the registrar to recommend the carrying out of repairs.  Would it not be possible for him to make those recommendations in the first instance to the local bodies, and when they fail an application could be made to the Minister for Local Government? Would that not be better than the suggestion here?  I would like to know what the Minister for Local Government and Public Health would think of any individual under the Department of Justice who would propose to take over control of the courthouses and take on as part of his duty the duty of the local body.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 36, Section 5 (2), to delete the words &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;the county registrar.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think it is obvious to the Minister that this ought to be done. I think it hardly needs to have a case made for it. &ldquo;Whenever a council fails for three months to make any appointment which such council is required by the foregoing sub-section of this section to make, the Minister may make such appointment, and in every such case such council shall duly pay to the person so appointed such remuneration as the Minister shall direct.&rdquo;  Why the county registrar should not make that appointment do not know, because the county registrar is given such authority under some other section.  &ldquo;Whenever a vacancy occurs in the post of a caretaker of courthouse accommodation who is appointed under the foregoing provisions of this section or in the post of assistant to any such caretaker, the county registrar having the custody of such courthouse accommodation may appoint a person to fill such post temporarily until such post is duly filled under the said foregoing provisions, and in every such case the council in whose functional area such courthouse accommodation is situate shall duly pay to the person so appointed such remuneration as the Minister shall direct.&rdquo;  That is sub-section (3) of Section 5.  Now, why the Minister should make the appointment under sub-section (2) and the registrar the appointment under sub-section (3) I do not know, and I should like to know the reason.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>No; they are both temporary.  &ldquo;Whenever a county council fails for three months to make any appointment which such council is required by the foregoing sub-section of this section to make, the Minister <Col N="2184" /> may make such an appointment, and in every such case such council shall duly pay to the person so appointed such remuneration as the Minister shall direct.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>To make a permanent appointment?  For a very good reason. It is done in most of these cases.  It is generally done on the suggestion of the county registrar, subject to the sanction of the Minister.  As regards temporary appointments the registrar always does these things.  Under sub-section (1) of Section 5 it is set out that the county council is really the authority for making such appointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>But it says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whenever the custody of any courthouse accommodation is vested under this Act in a county registrar the council in whose functional area such courthouse accommodation is situate shall, as often as occasion requires, appoint and shall pay...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now they are the persons making the appointment.  If the council fails to make it, the registrar makes it.  If the county council fails for three months, the Minister makes the appointment himself, and the county council pay whatever the Minister shall direct.  I do not see the sense of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed.  But this permanent appointment is made by the Minister.  What knowledge would the Minister have of making an appointment of that nature himself?  He has already referred to the advantage it would be to have the District Court clerk, living in the district, know to whom he would be letting the courthouse, <Col N="2185" /> as distinct from the county registrar.  Now, whatever knowledge would the Minister have of appointing a courthouse caretaker?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I would certainly say that sub-section (2) ought to be reconsidered in conjunction with sub-section (3); that is, that in a case like that, the county registrar makes the temporary appointment that is afterwards, if you like, confirmed by the Minister.

      <P>In page 3, before Section 5 (5), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The county registrar may lodge a complaint in writing against the caretaker (or assistant caretaker) of a courthouse with the council in whose functional area such courthouse is situate, setting out the reasons for <Col N="2187" /> such complaint and if the council refuses or fails to take the steps necessary to have such caretaker (or assistant caretaker) carry out his duties properly and courteously the county registrar may report the matter to the Minister and in such case the Minister shall have the power of dismissal.</P>
    <P>Well, Sir, if the Minister is to retain the powers of dismissal, then I would move amendment No. 8.  I think it would be absolutely unfair that a court caretaker would be subject to dismissal and the loss of his office without being first arraigned on some charge before his employers, that is the county council.</P>
    <P>They ought to be told why he is being dismissed and, if they do not act, I am quite prepared to submit that the Minister then ought to be in a position to deprive the man of his office.  I think, however, that it would be manifestly unfair that because somebody might lodge some kind of secret report against a courtkeeper, which might or might not be true, the Minister should have the power of dismissal over that man without the courtkeeper getting any opportunity of explaining his conduct or defending himself against the charge.</P>

It is <i>ultra vires.</i> It is bad law and contrary to justice. Many a man cannot afford to go to law and in such a case he would have no redress.  A man who had backing and who had somebody to stand up for him could go into court and could win his case.  Why is this arbitrary power taken?  The poor courtkeeper has no friends to come in and fight for him in the court and he has to walk the plank.

      <P>To listen to the Deputy one would think that this was something that had never happened in this House before.  He sat here in this House for a great many years, except for a few years that he was out of it, and he has listened to several Bills being passed on the same lines as this. It is a wonder that, when similar court officials were being dealt with in the same manner in these other Bills, we did not hear all about these men walking the plank and so on.  The same effort was made by the last Administration to remedy that position.  The Deputy knows that no Administration tries to interfere with an official except on reports from the officials responsible and he knows that there is no attempt in this Bill to undo natural justice.</P>

Courtkeepers are people provided with living accommodation in the courthouses.  They are living there with their wives and families.  Under this Bill there is no safeguard and the man can be fired out without any inquiry.  There is no analogy there with the case of a court messenger.  Can the Minister give us any assurance that the position will be safeguarded and that the man will not be thrown out without inquiry?  The Minister says that in practice it never happens.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is true that any servant of a local authority has some rights in respect of his appointment, and if he is dismissed without cause stated he would have ordinarily an action against that local authority for wrongful dismissal, and would be entitled to recover a week's, a month's or six months' wages according to the terms of his contract of employment. There does not seem to be any reason whatever why the Minister should take the right to dismiss this particular servant of a local authority when he has no such power in respect of any other servant of a local authority.  Why is it necessary, by statute, to withdraw from him his common law right to reasonable notice of the proposal to terminate his contract of service?  Why is it desired, without any reference to anything that previous Governments or previous Dála may have done, to establish the principle set out in this Bill that the Minister should have an arbitrary right to dismiss a man from his employment without assigning any reason?  In so far as such a system obtains, it is a bad system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why extend it?  The Minister says quite casually: &ldquo;Who can conceive that anybody is going to have his employment <Col N="2192" /> terminated other than justly under the power conferred on me by the section?&rdquo;  We have every reason to apprehend that there may be grave differences of opinion between us and the Minister as to what is a fair termination of an employee's contract of service such as is contemplated here. I know of a number of temporary postmen who were told that they would not be employed because they belong to a certain political organisation.  I know a number of members of the Army Reserve who were dismissed from the Reserve and no reasons were given.  When the Minister was asked for reasons, he said he would not give any reasons in the House, but was eventually forced to confess that he dismissed them because they belonged to a certain political organisation of which he did not approve.  Surely the type of person contemplated under this section is entitled to be informed why he is dismissed and, if he can convince a court that he has been unjustly dismissed, surely he is entitled to proceed against his employer in the way that the common law provides for such an injustice?  What valid reason can the Minister give for taking statutory power to abrogate the common law in this matter?  There is no valid reason. I submit that the amendment ought to be accepted, and that these people should get ordinary justice and that is all they want.</P>

      <P>Section 6 of the Bill reads: &ldquo;Whenever a council fails or neglects to maintain in proper repair and condition any courthouse accommodation which such council is required by this Act to maintain, the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say:&mdash;&rdquo; and it goes on to set out that the Minister shall have the right to call in the Board of Works and take other steps.  My amendment seeks to have the words &ldquo;after attention has been called&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;maintain.&rdquo;  I think it would be unfair that a county council would have this work done behind their backs, because somebody like the county registrar or the Minister said that the council had neglected to do its duty.  I want proof of that neglect &mdash;that they should first be obliged to call the attention of the council to the matter.</P>

      <P>Am I not right in saying that the court clerk is not the Minister?  Neither is the county registrar.  The District Court clerk has the right under this section to get in fuel and light to the extent of £10.  My point is that in all those matters the council ought first to be asked to carry out the repairs, alterations or whatever they are.  I think it would be unfair that somebody would come in over their heads and carry out elaborate schemes, saying afterwards that the county council neglected the matter. There ought to be some evidence that they did neglect it and there should be some notification served on them to carry out those repairs.  That principle has been observed in many cases in Bills which have been passed here. With regard to the repair of houses, tenants have been empowered to carry out repairs but they must first draw <Col N="2195" /> the attention of the landlords to the necessity for the repairs.  I think that principle should be extended to this Bill.</P>

      <P>No.  My contention on this matter was that the Minister or the Commissioners, or whoever was executing the repairs, was being sufficiently met in sub-section (3) (a) which says: &ldquo;The Commissioners or such county registrar or District Court clerk (as the case may be) shall be entitled to recover the costs and expenses incurred by them or him in the execution or procuring the doing of such repairs or other work or procuring the supply of such substance or thing (as the case may be) as a civil debt in any court of competent jurisdiction...&rdquo;<Col N="2199" /> Sub-section (b) provides that the Minister for Finance shall have the right to deduct those expenses from the grants payable to the county councils. In the first instance the Minister and the Board of Works get the right to proceed in court, to give evidence of the extent of the repairs which have been done, and they have the right to recover.  I think that ought to be sufficient without further having the right to deduct those amounts from the grants payable to the county councils.</P>

      <P>The amendment in my name reads: &ldquo;In pages 4-5, Section 6 (3), to delete paragraph (c).&rdquo;  In view of the fact that the Minister or the Commissioners have the right to go into court, I think they should be obliged to give evidence in the ordinary way.  They should not have rights which any ordinary individual would not have with regard to the costs incurred.  I do not think it is fair for the Government to adopt the attitude that a certificate from the Minister, to the effect that certain sums of money had been spent, is in itself evidence of those sums having been spent.</P>

I think there has been a rather want on neglect of the rights of county councils and I certainly do not agree that the Bill is going to meet the situation that it is endeavouring to meet.  Instead of having some kind of unified custody or control, you will have a continuation of a type of dual control between the county councils and the county registrars.  On the whole, I do not think the Bill is going to meet the situation it originally set out to meet.  I am opposing it particularly because of the right which the Minister reserves to himself and his successors of dismissing a courtkeeper without any intimation whatever to him of the reason for his dismissal.</P>

      <P>I have very little more to say on this Vote.  I hope that when the Minister is making his statement he will deal with the points I have raised.  Some of them are of great interest and the Minister's reply to them is being eagerly watched by local authorities.  I would like in his statement that he would give a clear view of what he anticipates doing by way of local loans, particularly for housing, including the continuance of the facilities afforded under the Small Dwellings <Col N="2203" /> Act.  Those facilities recently&mdash; and only recently&mdash;have been availed of in the City of Dublin, particularly, by a class of people that heretofore were not provided with housing accommodation. They were a class between those for whom speculative builders hitherto catered, and the cottage dwellers for whom the Corporation had catered.  As a matter of fact, a lot of the cottages were provided by the Corporation, as the Minister is aware from first-hand knowledge, at an initial loss to the rates of the city and consequentially a loss afterwards.  These houses in many cases have been occupied, and have become marketable housing property, by people who would be able through the operation of the Small Dwellings Act, to provide themselves with their own houses.  It is the view of responsible officers in the Corporation that use the Small Dwellings Acts to their fullest extent.  By that I mean that the Corporation would lend the full 90 per cent. value of houses built at a certain valuation.  They have differentiated in the last scheme of loans they gave by increasing the percentage advanced from 80 per cent. to 85 per cent. on houses of marketable value of £600 and under.  A further sliding scale might be feasible, and as I have just said, it is held by very responsible technical officers of the Corporation that by extending the use of these Acts by builders catering for a class hitherto not catered for by private enterprise, all classes in the City of Dublin could be provided with dwellings under the Small Dwellings Acts, except that class that is not able to pay 100 per cent. for their own housing accommodation and must inevitably rely on the rates of the city to provide them with housing accommodation.  The key to that idea, and to the schemes emanating from it, is the money to finance the Small Dwellings Act, and we in the City of Dublin will anxiously await the Minister's reply on that particular matter.  Now I have covered enough ground.  I do not want to occupy the time of the House much longer, but I want to draw the attention <Col N="2204" /> of the Minister to a matter that is causing great agitation in the City and County of Dublin concerning milk. That is a provision in the Milk and Dairies Bill, which is at the moment before the Seanad.  I do not want to go into the details of that, but it has aroused technical officers of both city and county, responsible for clean milk and public health in both the city and county to express their views&mdash;the views held by their professions.  What gives rise to this supposed or alleged grievance is that full public health services according to existing legislation and full services under the existing Dairies and Cowsheds Orders are in operation in Dublin City and County.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister appreciates that very little further, if any, services will be imposed in the City and County of Dublin by the Bill now going through the Oireachtas. By that I want to convey to the Minister that if the whole country had come up to the standard in public health administration and clean milk administration of the County and City of Dublin, very little more would require to be done by his Department.</P>

      <P>The point I am on is the administration not of contemplated legislation, but on the administration of existing legislation, and the point I am trying to make is that existing legislation is being administered to the full in Dublin City and County but is not being administered to the full in any other county, entailing consequential commercial loss to Dublin City and County producers of certain commodities. In support of uniformity of administration, I should like to quote a paragraph from the Reorganisation Commission for Milk, held under the <Col N="2205" /> auspices of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in England.  I will just read it and leave it for the Minister to digest.  On page 92 of that Report, paragraph 81 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We consider it essential for the progress of the industry that the Milk and Dairies Order should be brought into universal operation and uniformly and efficiently administered. As one of the measures by which this might be facilitated we recommend that county and county borough councils should be empowered to take over the administration of the Order in cases where it is felt that more uniform and effective administration could thereby be secured.  We must again emphasise our view that the routine clinical examination of all dairy cattle is of as much importance from the standpoint of establishing the confidence of the public and of the medical profession as it is an indispensable part of any scheme of milk grading.  Although we feel that the financial burden of our recommendations for reform and reorganisation should, in the main, be borne by the industry itself, we do not consider that either the Government or the local authorities should shirk the duties already laid upon them by statute.  We have pointed out that the councils of counties and county boroughs have already the duty of causing such inspection of cattle to be made as may be necessary and proper for the purposes of the Milk and Dairies Order.  We have drawn attention to the inadequate manner in which this duty has, in many cases, been carried out, and we indicate later in this chapter the comparatively small expenditure which is necessary in order to set up an efficient veterinary service.  We would, therefore, earnestly beg the authorities concerned to reconsider their attitude in the interests, not only of the milk industry, but of the whole community.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That paragraph was inserted in a British report in connection with conditions in England.</P>

      <P>It is the Report of the Reorganisation Commission for Milk and the date is 1933.  This precisely applies to the case I am making and to the administration of existing legislation. Of course, in the other matter of legislation that is going through, there is no grievance with it so long as it is passed by this House.  The grievance can only arise if there is not uniformity of administration, and that is the point I am pressing on the Minister now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to direct the Minister's attention to the position of nurses in this country.  I think that representations have been made over and over again to the Department regarding them, and I think the answer generally has been that if a scheme is put up it will receive the greatest possible attention.  There is considerable difficulty in lay people, if I may use the expression, presenting a scheme to the Department in connection with nurses.  They fall under so many categories.  There are some, I believe, but very few nurses, who enjoy pensions.  I think that the major number of nurses working in this country have no pensions.  I am not immediately concerned with their present status although I have heard that notwithstanding the vast wealth that has gone into hospitals recently the position of nurses in these institutions has not been improved. That may be so or it may not be.  I am concerned, however, with those who, through ill-health, overwork or age, have nothing to rely upon when they have to retire.  I see in the Estimates here that there is a very large number of officers in the Minister's Department&mdash;medical inspectors, lady inspectors, and other inspectors, first-class officers and so on. If there is wisdom in a multitude of counsellors, the Custom House ought to be bursting with wisdom.  Surely this collection of people with experience of the Government in the country would be able between them to devise some scheme whereby pensions would be ensured for these great servants of the State.  In fact, they compose the major portion of the Minister's army <Col N="2207" /> and he ought to look after them as well as the Minister for Defence looks after his Army.  He has even an intelligence officer, I notice.  I hope he will consider the advisability of introducing a pensions' scheme to help these women. I am sure he has great sympathy with what I am saying.  He must have.  I know sufficient and hear sufficient, however, about this matter to believe that I am warranted in asking that this House should agree that the Minister should bring in that scheme.  There is one institution with which I am concerned in this city for many years, and it is painful to me to see a nurse who has given 40 or 50 years of her life in fighting disease to be left in the end without some provision being made for her old age.</P>

      <P>It is somewhat regrettable that the Minister should break such a record this year in discussing the local government at this early date before the financial year for local bodies has completely closed&mdash;at any rate, before we had the final information as to how the finances of local bodies stand at the end of the year. While the Minister passes that over simply by a statement that according to the reports the position with regard to the rate collection has improved in a number of counties, in other counties the details that are available show that a very serious position with regard to rate collection still exists.  In the case of say, Galway and Cork, there must be considerably more than £50,000 of arrears added to the very considerable arrears that accrued in these counties last year.  The matter with regard to the financial position of local bodies can only be discussed when we get that information, and we may have that information by <Col N="2208" /> the time we come to discuss the Vote for the Supplementary Agricultural Grant.  Nevertheless, it is regrettable that the Minister did not make some more elaborate statement with regard to the financial position of local bodies, in view of the fact that he has advised the county councils that they are going to suffer a cut of something like £716,000, from money they expected to receive from the State, by reason of the non-collection of land annuities in the year ended 31st January last.  A very gloomy prospect must be opened up to those in charge of local government throughout the country when faced with the kind of statement that the Minister has supplied to them up to the present.  If there is any suggestion that that matter is going to be reviewed, the sooner the local bodies know it the better.  Otherwise, with the very considerable arrears that face them in the matter of rates, they will start the work of the new year with a very considerable handicap.</P>
      <P>The Minister thought it necessary in the autumn before last to address a very vigorous circular to the local bodies with regard to the backwardness of the rate collection.  He did not issue any circular of that kind in the autumn that has passed, although the position was considerably worse.  Certainly there must be apprehension as to the position that will disclose itself when the figures for the year ended 31st March are available.  As I say, in the case of two counties alone, it would look as if something more than £50,000 was going to be added to the considerable arrears which existed last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter to which the Minister might address himself. A considerable sum of money was withheld from local bodies the year before last on the ground that the Unemployment Assistance Bill was going to be introduced, that it would relieve local authorities of a very considerable amount of the money that they were spending on poor relief.  The local authorities were disappointed because they had to bear the full burden of the poor relief for that year; and it was only during the year just passed that the Unemployment <Col N="2209" /> Assistance Act came into direct operation.  It was only in operation from about April or May last.  We had the position in the first week of January, 1935, that upwards of 75,000 persons were being given assistance under the Unemployment Assistance Act.  Nevertheless, the local bodies found that they were at that time responsible for almost as big a burden of outdoor relief as they were supporting before the Unemployment Assistance Act came into force.  The average weekly expenditure for home assistance in January, 1932, was £12,226 and in January, 1935, £12,217.  The total number of persons in receipt of home assistance on the last Saturday of January, 1932, was 90,270 and in December, 1934, 86,104.  The total number of persons was very nearly the same, and the cost to the local authorities was almost exactly the same, although very considerable sums of money were being paid out weekly under the Unemployment Assistance Act to more than 75,000 people.</P>
    <P>Many local authorities have shown by the discussions which have taken place that the home assistance bill is a very considerable burden on them.  It was only the other day that we had the Board of Assistance in Galway declaring that their bank had dishonoured some of their cheques, and they were in fact not able to meet the demands for home assistance. On several occasions throughout the year, as the Minister must be aware, local authorities found it necessary to suspend the payment of home assistance. That must have been a considerable hardship in the districts where it happened.  Yet we have had no word from the Minister as to how it happens that the cost of home assistance now is as big as it was in 1932, in spite of the fact that very considerable sums of money are being spent in relief in other ways.  Has the Minister taken any steps to see that what occurred during the last 12 months, when persons entitled to and passed for home assistance by local authorities were unable to obtain the <Col N="2210" /> home assistance because the money was not available, will not occur again? Have any steps been taken to remedy that position for the coming year? It is all the more necessary that steps should be taken to prevent occurrences like that this year, because the Minister is aware that an order has been issued under the Unemployment Assistance Act withholding unemployment assistance payments from certain classes during a period in April and May and during a period from July to the end of September.</P>
    <P>Endeavour has been made by different Deputies to find out what there is in the economic condition of the country that indicates that payments under the Unemployment Assistance Act need not be paid during certain periods.  If the Minister wants advice from anybody outside his own Party, he will find plenty to tell him that he need not expect any economic improvement in the months of April or May or July and September.  Nevertheless, these moneys for relief are being cut off this year.  They were cut off after the local authorities responsible for the provision of outdoor relief had made their estimates and had their estimates established in the matter of rates, so that there will, undoubtedly, be a deficit in certain areas in the amount of money that has been provided. If there was a deficit last year when there was full provision made, the position is likely to be worse this year.  It is essential that the Minister should say what he hopes to do to meet the situation, for situation undoubtedly it is, and to prevent what happened last year happening again in certain areas.</P>
    <P>When the Minister had a Supplementary Estimate before us a few weeks ago I urged on him the necessity for making a more detailed and more intelligible statement on the general matter of housing than he had up to then, and apparently, than he was prepared to make at that time. He comes before us and gives us no more information with regard to the general housing position than he did <Col N="2211" /> on the last day.  Certain statements have been made as to the number of houses actually built.  These have been apparently contradicted by statements issued recently to the Press and apparently by a statement which the Minister has issued.  It is essential that we should get clear on the statistics of housing, in order to be perfectly sure of where we are going, but I think it is even more essential that we should get clear on the spirit in which he is pursuing his housing policy and what is happening to the people.  We had the Mayor of Wexford, Deputy Corish, complaining in respect of the persons to whom houses were given by the Wexford Corporation, that when they had got houses, the next demand from the tenants was for work, so that they could pay their rents.  In view of the fact that most of the houses in urban districts that are being built at the present moment are being built at a cost to the State of two-thirds of the total cost, and in view of the statistics the Minister quoted last year of the increases in the non-payment of rent in, at any rate the labourers' cottages, it would be desirable, that with instances no doubt before him in the country, he would give us some idea of the classes of persons that are being put into these houses and the extent to which he was assured that the comparatively small rents being demanded were likely to be paid.  It is, I say, a very serious thing when a Deputy, a member of a local authority with the experience of Deputy Corish, with his understanding of the housing situation and the situation of the workers, finds himself driven to complain that that is the position of some of the tenants put into the newly-built houses in Wexford.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a statement, published in the <i>Irish Times</i> of about three weeks ago, that the total number of houses built during the year ended December 31, 1934, was 12,332, the number built by local authorities being 6,093, and the number built by private persons and utility societies 6,239.  The <Col N="2212" /> Minister, in reply to Parliamentary Questions, indicated the number of houses built under the different sections of the Act by private persons and public utility societies in various types of areas, and if he will refer to figures issued in that particular way he will find that the figures quoted for local authorities tally with the statement in the <i>Irish Times</i>, but when he comes to the figures for houses built by private persons he will find a discrepancy of 3,236.  In other words, he says in his statement in the <i>Irish Times</i> that 6,239 houses have been built by private persons and public utility societies during the year ended December, 1934.  He has given figures to the House showing that only 2,983 have been completed in that time, namely: in urban districts by private persons, 285; in urban districts by public utility societies, 60; in rural districts by private persons, 1,324 and in rural districts by public utility societies 1,314.  When the Minister is so skimpy in the statement he makes to us with regard to housing generally, I think it is essential that there should be some kind of clear examination which will show us where the missing 3,256 houses are. The same type of discrepancy exists in the statement that he made recently in answer to Deputy Norton.  He told Deputy Norton that the total number of houses completed at the end of February by private persons and public utility societies was 9,645.  The figures he has already quoted to the House in greater detail show that 6,499 houses were completed under the Act by December 31 last.</P>
    <P>The question of cost was raised with the Minister when this matter was under discussion before, and I put it to him that the 6,646 houses built by local authorities and the 3,010 built by local authorities in rural areas had cost £1,816,000 to the State and that the 2,473 houses built by private persons in urban areas and the 4,026 in rural areas by private persons and public utility societies had cost the State in grants £4,365.</P>
    <P>I think it is essential that the Minister would come down more definitely <Col N="2213" /> to numbers and cost, and it is because the Minister has shown such reluctance to do so and because I consider the matter so important that I want to give the Minister, as it were, my side of that position.  There is no use in thinking that the quotation of a big number of houses springing up, raising the hopes of the people that they are going to get houses, is going to give them houses or to help them to pay for them.  Housing in the City of Dublin is in a very critical position at the present time, and the number of people who want houses in the City of Dublin is very great.  The distresses that most of them are incurring at present are almost unbearable and I do not think that the present system of housing finance is going to use the money that is available in the country for housing in such a way that these people can be provided for.  There are, unfortunately, people in the city looking for houses at the present time. They all get the same answer to their applications and the answer is something like this: that cases are being dealt with in the order of hardship; that the cases that are being dealt with first are those where people are living 12 to a room; next, 11 to a room; next, ten in a room, continuing that type of thing and then&mdash;next, tubercular cases; next, basements; next, dangerous buildings.</P>
    <P>When the ordinary person is looking for a house a very considerable time must elapse before he has any hope of getting it, because a number of those classes require to be dealt with before the ordinary person can be touched. In the meantime, the ordinary person who is able to pay for a house, and who must be the foundation upon which the whole of our housing finance rests, is living in conditions which are demoralising, and which are sapping his strength and capacity to be a wage earner.  As I say it is essential to get a clear idea as to what exactly is going on in building, and what it is costing.  The Minister has thrown doubt on the figures that are being quoted.  He has given us statistics with regard to the number of houses completed, which require to be reconciled. <Col N="2214" /> It is for that reason that I want to tell him that the following figures show the achievement in the completion of houses, in so far as we have been able to get information from him by detailed question and answer, up to the 31st December, 1934.</P>
    <P>Clause 5 (1) (a) of the 1932 Act provided a grant of £45 for houses commenced between 1st April, 1929, and the 12th May, 1932, and completed on or before 31st December, 1932.  One hundred and ninety-six in urban districts and 198 houses in rural districts were completed under that section, and I submit to the Minister that the cost to the State was £17,730.  Under Clause 5 (1) (b) (1) grants of £70 were made available for houses commenced between 12th May, 1932 and 31st May, 1933.  Under that clause 393 houses were completed, costing the State £27,510.  Under Clause 5 (1) (b) (2) provision was made for a grant of £60 on houses commenced on or before 12th May, 1932, and completed between 1st June, 1933, and 31st March, 1934. Under that clause, 694 houses were completed, costing the State £41,640. Under Clause 5 (1) (b) (3) grants to the extent of £50 were payable on houses commenced on or after 12th May, 1932, and completed between 1st April, 1934, and 1st March, 1935.  Under that clause, 667 houses were completed, costing the State £33,350.  Under Clause 5 (1) (c) (1) grants of £70 were payable to persons deriving a livelihood from agricultural holdings under £15 valuation.  Under that clause, 396 houses were erected at a cost of £27,720.  Under Clause 5 (1) (c) (2) grants of £60 were made available to persons deriving a livelihood from agricultural holdings of between £15 and £25 valuation.  Eighty-seven houses were built at a cost to the State of £5,220.  Under Clause 5 (1) (d) grants of £70 were made available for agricultural labourers.  One hundred and ninety-seven houses were completed at a cost of £13,790.  Under Clause 5 (1) (e) grants of £45 were made available to private persons who built houses in rural areas; 1,329 houses were built at a cost of £59,805.</P>
    <P>All those houses were built by <Col N="2215" /> private persons.  They were completed, under the Act, up to 31st December, 1934.  In all, 19,950 houses were built in urban areas, while 2,207 houses were completed in rural districts. The cost was £226,765.  Public utility societies erected 523 houses in urban districts, and 1,819 houses in rural districts at a cost of £173,600. Those houses were erected as follows: Under clause 5 (1) (a), where there was a grant of £45, 30 houses were built in urban districts, and 12 in rural districts, the State grant amounting to £1,890.  Under clause 5 (1) (b), where grants of £70 were made available, 84 houses were erected in urban districts, the cost to the State being £5,880.  Under clause 5 (1) (b) (2), a grant of £60 was made available.  In urban districts 175 houses were erected, the cost to the State being £10,500. Under clause 5 (1) (b) (3), where a grant of £50 was available, 214 houses were erected in urban districts, the cost to the State being £10,700.  Under clause 5 (1) (f) (1), a grant of £80 was available for persons deriving a livelihood from agricultural holdings under £15 valuation.  1,219 houses were erected, the cost to the State being £97,520.  Under clause 5 (1) (f) (2), a grant of £70 was available for persons deriving a livelihood from agricultural holdings between £15 and £25 valuation. 193 houses were erected, the cost to the State being £13,510.  Under clause 5 (1) (f) (1), a grant of £80 was available in respect of agricultural labourers.  395 houses were erected, the cost to the State being £31,600.  Under clause 5 (1) (I), 20 houses for town workers were erected at a cost of £2,000.  I think the Minister informed the House that the cost would be £3,000, but I have put the cost down at £2,000 as I think that would be the statutory limit.  The total number of those houses built by public utility societies was 523 in urban areas and 1,819 in rural areas, the cost to the State being £173,600, so that the total cost to the State under grants raised out of taxation was £400,365.</P>
    <P>As far as local authorities were concerned, they built under clause 6 (1) (a) (1), 6,100 houses under replacement <Col N="2216" /> schemes.  I have put it to the Minister that the average cost to the State of houses erected by the local authorities, when you take in Dublin City and other areas, is £300.  6,100 houses were erected in urban areas under replacement schemes during the period ended 31st December, 1934, the cost to the State being £1,220,000.  Of ordinary houses erected under clause 6 (1) (a) (2), in respect of which the State pays 33? per cent. of the interest and sinking fund, 546 were completed at a cost of £54,600.</P>
    <P>In the case of labourers' cottages, where the State pays 60 per cent. of the loan charges for 35 years, the total number built was 3,010, the cost to the State being £541,800.  Therefore, I say, that the 6,646 houses erected by the local authorities in urban areas up to 31st December, 1934, and the 3,010 erected in rural areas, are costing the State £1,816,400.  The total of 16,000 odd houses are then costing the State £2,250,000.  I have already pointed out that under the previous Administration 24,000 odd houses were erected at an expenditure of about £1,250,000.  The figures are more correctly: 24,131 houses were erected at a cost to the State of £1,609,152 as against 16,155 houses which are now costing the State £2,216,765, and whereas the £1,609,152 that went to the building of the 24,131 houses was paid out of revenue raised from year to year, leaving no debt on the State, the houses that have been built by local authorities are leaving a debt of £1,800,000 in respect of 9,656 houses.</P>

      <P>Under the Housing Acts, 1932-34, it is possible for the local authority to secure subventions towards interest charges in connection with the erection of labourers' cottages and houses in slum areas under slum clearance orders.  Is any calculation <Col N="2217" /> of that amount of expenditure made in the figures quoted by the Deputy?</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of replacement schemes, where 6,100 houses have been built in urban areas in order to wipe out slums or meet overcrowding, £1,220,000 is included for that.  The £1,220,000 constitutes the capital cost of the subvention that is going towards these 6,100 houses.  In the case of 546 houses, ordinary houses for the working classes, where the State only provides 33? per cent. of the loan charges, £54,600 is accountable for that and, in the case of labourers' cottages the capital cost of the State provision for 60 per cent. of the loan charges for 35 years amounts to £541,800, so that the total capital cost is £1,816,400.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Was any similar expenditure involved in the figure of £1,609,000, which the Deputy stated was incurred in respect of 24,131 houses built under his Administration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of that the assistance to local authorities was given by lump sums of money paid as an assistance to the cost of the houses and the sums went to reducing the rent. If Deputy Norton's point is that such money was not granted under the previous Administration for the reduction of rents of the houses being built by local authorities, that is a fact; but <Col N="2218" /> what I want to get at is that the Minister will tell us what the cost of this scheme is going to be in the first place and, in the second place, to what extent it is providing the people with the houses that he set out to provide.</P>
      <P>I would have Deputy Norton understand that while this enormous charge is being provided for, it might be well to take an example of what is being done.  Let us take the case of the County Borough of Limerick. Although this capital charge is being placed to be met by the taxpayers in the future, the only houses that have been built in Limerick, where the slum conditions are very serious, total 74 houses, and there are many urban districts from one part of the country to the other where practically nothing has been done.  If this charge is going to be left on the State, increasing year by year in respect of a certain number of houses built every year, I hope that the Deputy will join with me in telling the Minister that we would like to hear him at greater length on his general plan, and also that we would like to hear him much more clearly on the statistical side of the question.  It must be very confusing to Deputy Norton to get, in reply from the Minister, figures which he cannot reconcile with the figures I get, and it certainly does not increase our confidence in the general progress of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole thing is all the more regrettable and inexcusable in view of the fact that we have a Housing Board and the total number of persons employed on the general administration of housing in the Department of Local Government is rising enormously, both the persons employed on the indoor and on the outdoor staffs.  It is up to the Minister to let us know the facts with greater clearness and to let us have returns in a different kind of way from the kind of summary that he gives either to the Press or when he speaks here&mdash;to let us know more clearly in a statistical way the progress that is being made and the extent of the problem that requires to be attacked.  It is only then that we can see whether we are cutting our cloth according to our measure and what hope the people who are down at <Col N="2219" /> the tail-end of the waiting list for houses in Dublin City, Limerick or in any of the counties have of ever getting into a house.</P>
    <P>The Minister had indicated that the houses that are being built in the rural areas are being built in those areas where the housing conditions were shown to have been worst under the Census of 1926.  I would like to hear the Minister in greater detail on that subject too.  Take a county like Wexford, which was the best housed county in the country according to these statistics and you find that the total number of houses completed up to 31st December, 1934, in Wexford, was 533, whereas in Galway, which is one of the worst counties, there were only 263 houses completed.  In Clare, which was nearly as bad as Galway, you had only 290; in Sligo, which was as bad as Galway, you had only 176; and in Donegal, which was worse, you had only 170.  So that again we would like to hear the Minister in more detail as to the housing conditions, at any rate in certain small country districts, and what is being achieved there.  Last year, I had occasion to point out that the reconstruction grants were being distributed in a very peculiar way.  I pointed out that there was an area around Cavan, Monaghan and Louth that was getting very substantial grants in money under the construction section of the Act&mdash;more than the whole of the West of Ireland, where reconstruction was so important, and where the really bad housing belt of the country lay.  The figures quoted here by the Minister up to the end of December last continued to show the same thing.</P>
    <P>If we take the whole of the bad housing area that was &ldquo;blacked out&rdquo; in the census of 1926&mdash;that is Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Roscommon, Mayo, Galway, Clare and Kerry&mdash;we have a part of the country where there are 195,000 houses and 872,000 of a population. The total amount of grant for reconstruction that has been put into that area up to December last was £81,000. When we turn to Monaghan and Louth, where as against 195,000 houses there are 24,000 houses and a population <Col N="2220" /> of 90,000 as against 872,000&mdash;we find that that area receives £81,000 for reconstruction.  Louth and Monaghan got as much since the reconstruction work began under this Act as the whole of the counties in the West of Ireland which formed the real bad patch, and that have nearly ten times the population.  It would be interesting to hear the type of work that is being done in Monaghan and Louth under the reconstruction provisions of the Act, and whether the Minister is satisfied that it is good development; and we would like to know the effect generally on the lives of the people in the area, by the improvement that was brought about in their dwelling-houses by these grants; and why it is that so little of a stir of that particular kind is taking place in the West of Ireland, where the position is so bad.</P>
    <P>We always wanted to know from the Minister what is the function of the public utility society in rural areas. When we last entered on the subject at any rate, we pointed out that the public utility society in the urban districts was passing out of the picture, but that the public utility society in rural areas was showing up in a strange but interesting way in certain counties; and we have never been able to get from the Minister a statement as to what the function of the public utility society is.  I think that, considering the example that must have come before the Minister from Kildare, we ought to have some kind of a statement from the Minister as to the function of the public utility societies and whether they are doing good work. It is possible to understand a public utility society in a county erecting only a few houses, working where there are a large number of houses being erected.  There are places, however, where is it quite clear that the public utility society machinery is just a kind of facade to put in front of a certain type of semi-political organisation which helps, at any rate its friends, to make profits out of the operation of that section of the Housing Act which gives an additional £10 of grant to a house put up by a public utility society.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2221" /> The case in Kildare shows that you had there a public utility society of which the members, including one Deputy member, declared that the only function the public utility society had was to get the increased grant for the person building a house.  On a question, the Deputy declared that they had no function to assist the person to get materials, or to assist him in any other way.  We had a case of a person who applied for a labourer's cottage, when his application was refused by the local body on the ground that the cottage was not available, approached by the secretary of County Kildare Public Utility Society.  He was got to give a subscription of £1 and then 30/- to the public utility society. He did not become a member of the society, but he was made pay into their fund.  In some way he arranged with a person, who was introduced to him by the society, to build a house for him, and the only thing the society did was to stand in front as a kind of protection to a local building-material-providing society there, which charged him more for the materials than he would pay in any ordinary building provider's place. A considerable scandal was brought out there, showing the way in which members of the public utility society acted as philanthropic people in the public utility society's body, but acted as business people making unreasonable profits in their own interests, while acting as a builders' providers' society in the shadow of the public utility society. If the Minister does not stand for the wasting of public funds, if he does not stand for assisting the imposing on unfortunate persons in rural districts, and getting money out of them that ought not to be got, he will take the precaution of stating publicly what the functions of these public utility societies are&mdash;whether they are working well&mdash;and the districts in which they are not working.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that the position with regard to the Dublin Corporation in the matter of housing was a very serious one.  Undoubtedly, building will be held up in the City of Dublin before very long&mdash;that is, corporation building&mdash;if it is not being held up already&mdash;arising out of the financial <Col N="2222" /> difficulties in which the corporation is finding itself in the matter of housing. The Minister for Industry and Commerce gave a Parliamentary answer some weeks ago which indicated that the total number of persons unemployed in the building trade on 7th January, 1935, was considerably greater than on the 1st January, 1934.  There were 943 carpenters unemployed where there were only 580 in 1934.  There were 120 bricklayers where there had been only 43, and soon generally throughout the whole line of occupations&mdash;masons, slaters, plasterers, painters, plumbers, and builders' labourers.  The total number unemployed in the building trade in the City of Dublin on 7th January, 1935, was 7,580 as against 4,196 on the 1st January of the year before.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be aware of the desire that exists through the country to get assistance under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act, so that persons can finance their housing desires; that there are large numbers of people who would take advantage of that Act; that there is a type of person that ought to be assisted; and that it would help to keep a greater number of work people in the building trade employed, if whatever difficulties exist with some of the local authorities could be overcome, and if the county councils generally could be made grants to facilitate the operation of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act for those various people that are looking for the assistance.  This is a way in which the Minister could help out, but again, as I say, he has given us a most skimpy statement with regard to housing.</P>
    <P>I do not profess to have touched on anything like all the various aspects of housing that ought to be touched on. The Minister is keeping up a very extensive housing staff in his Department. He has a Housing Board.  I do not know where they are hiding.  We have heard very little from them.  We have had broadcasts from members; some of them have been sacked.  The Minister has not taken the House into his confidence as to why one of the members of the Housing Board has <Col N="2223" /> had his services dispensed with.  He has not told us either what the others are doing and if the board have not something on their conscience.  I think it is high time we got some kind of a report from them as to what they have been doing.  They ought to be able to assist the Minister in giving the kind of statement that the House would like to hear as to his housing achievements and the extent of the problem that he is tackling.  Only when we have a statement like that can public opinion really keep the Minister right on his housing programme and can the Minister be kept safe on the financial side. Everybody is terribly anxious to tell the Minister to go ahead and God bless the work&mdash;clear the slums and build the houses&mdash;but it would be a very dangerous thing for the happiness and well-being of a lot of people who want houses, if, urged on in that particular way, the Minister were to go along blindly.  I submit that he is going along very blindly at the present moment and that he is, apparently, spending money that is not there to spend.  I suggest that it is near time we had a review of the housing position.</P>

      <P>The statement was published in the <i>Irish Times</i> of the 6th March last.  That statement said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The official return shows tremendous progress made in the house-building scheme of the Free State Government during the year 1934.  In the 12 months ending the 31st December last there were completed 12,332 houses.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>Below that it gives figures for the number of houses completed by local authorities, by private persons, and by public utility societies.  It says that during the year ending 31st December, 1934, 6,239 houses were completed by private persons and public utility societies.  I ventured to <Col N="2224" /> tell the Minister that he has given figures to the House which show that only 2,983 houses were completed by private persons and public utility societies during that 12 months and that the detailed figures upon which he based that statement show that private persons built in urban districts 285 houses, that public utility societies built in urban districts 60 houses, that private persons built in rural districts 1,324 houses and that public utility societies built in rural districts 1,314 houses&mdash;totalling 2,983 and leaving 3,256 to be found in some place or another.  A discrepancy, of somewhat the same size, arises between figures quoted by the Minister in a reply to Deputy Norton on, I think, the 15th February, where he stated that 9,645 houses had been completed by private persons and public utility societies up to, I think, the end of January, since the 1932 Act came into operation, whereas the figures provided by him, in a more detailed way, to me, indicated that by the end of December, 1934, only 6,499 houses had been completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few observations on one side of the work for which the Minister is responsible. I refer to the matter of public health.  In the debate similar to this last year, I criticised the Minister's Department on two questions mainly, and I am glad to notice that during the 12 months that have elapsed he has taken away, as he then stated he would, the grounds of my criticism on these two very important points. He was able to tell us, in introducing this Estimate, that the number of county medical officers now appointed almost covers the whole area of the Irish Free State.  I criticised him last year on the grounds that he should press on the appointments more rapidly, and he then said he hoped to have them made in the ensuing few months.  He has certainly been more active since that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point on which I criticised him was the delay in the production of any legislation dealing with the matter of the milk supply.  We are all aware <Col N="2225" /> that the Minister has now introduced a promising measure in this connection to this House, so that we may hope that in the near future that will have a very definite effect on the health of the country.  I am interested in some of the statements of fact which the Minister was able to report to us a few days ago.  He informed us that the infant mortality had shown some improvement in the year under review and that it had fallen from 65 per 1,000 births to 63 per 1,000 births, the previous average having been 69 per 1,000. That is a matter upon which we may congratulate ourselves.  I should be glad, however, if the Minister would tell us how far the urban areas have improved in this matter of infant mortality.  From the last figures available, one sees that the infant mortality in some of the urban areas was more than double what it was in the country as a whole.  The last figures available were three years ago, and in Galway the infant mortality was 136 per 1,000 births, in Waterford 132 per 1,000, in Sligo 124 per 1,000, in Wexford 113 per 1,000, and in Dublin 100 per 1,000.  While one can be pleased, and while the Minister has a right to take pride in the reduction of the general average from 65 to 63 per 1,000, one would like to know that that improvement has shown itself to a considerable extent also in the urban areas as well as in the rural areas.  In the rural areas we know that infant mortality has never been high as compared with the mortality in other countries. But, while we have such mortality rates as those of Galway and Waterford, and even Dublin a couple of years ago, it is clear that there is much more work to be done in regard to putting infant mortality into a satisfactory condition.  I agree in that respect with the Minister's statement, that good housing is the foundation of all the social services. I believe that in no department of health will the effects of good housing be more evident when the Minister's programme is completed than in regard to infant mortality.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that, while the rate of maternal mortality had remained stationary, there was an increase in the number of deaths from <Col N="2226" /> puerperal sepsis from 80 in 1933 to 92 last year.  Taking the percentages, that is a very heavy increase in the number of deaths, and it would make one anxious that more investigation should be made of the causes and treatment of this very fatal malady than we have had opportunities for up to the present. I stress it particularly in the hope that the Minister will give encouragement to any scheme of medical research which will have as one of its objects the investigation of the causes and treatment of puerperal sepsis.  It is not necessary to stress the human importance of this very tragic disease.</P>
    <P>It is satisfactory to know, as the Minister has told us, that there has been a decline in diphtheria both as regards incidence and mortality.  It is interesting to note that he gives some of the credit of that to the immunisation campaign which some of the medical officers of health are carrying out.  I associate myself with the plea put forward by Deputy O'Dowd that that campaign should be intensified and not only be active at the time when there is an epidemic or fear of an epidemic, and that it should be carried out not only in the cities but in the counties. I associate myself also with the argument of Deputy O'Dowd that, as far as possible, those in charge of the scheme, the medical officers of health, should make use of the general body of the profession in carrying out immunisation.  I think we will bring it more closely home to the people through the dispensary doctors and other general practitioners than if the whole campaign is in the hands of whole-time officers.  I think that the campaign will be better understood if it is, to a considerable extent, in the hands of those with whom the public are dealing habitually.  I suggest, too, that it is not fair to private practitioners that work of this kind should be absorbed by whole-time departments&mdash;work that can be thoroughly and efficiently carried out by private practitioners.</P>
    <P>I associate myself also with what Deputy O'Dowd said about the importance of vaccination.  We have developed a sense of false security in this country as regards smallpox, <Col N="2227" /> because we are living on a past in which the vaccination laws were very thoroughly carried out, with the result that smallpox has hardly been seen in this country except in a few imported cases for very many years.  That we have not seen smallpox depends on the fact that the population up to recent years was very thoroughly vaccinated. Unfortunately, there has been a slackening in the application of the vaccination laws, notably in certain parts of the country, with the result that the country is not at all as well protected now as it was 20 years ago if smallpox chanced to be introduced, as it is very likely to be introduced from time to time when it is fairly common in other countries.  I trust that the Minister will press on the local authorities the necessity of carrying out their duties in this respect. He has shown a very praiseworthy energy in keeping them up to their duties in other respects, and I hope he will add this to the list.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps disappointing that there was not during the year any extension of the number of schemes for the inspection and treatment of school children. One hopes, as the Minister said, that with the number of county medical officers of health appointed, these schemes will be extended.  He hopes to bring the entire school population under inspection in the very near future.  I am afraid he will have to recognise, and the local authorities will have to recognise, that if that is to be done the staff available for the purpose of inspection will have to be increased. If the inspection is to be valuable each school child should be inspected at least twice during school age&mdash;when he enters school first as a young child, and again before he leaves, and, if possible, between times.  With the amount of staff that there is at present, it would be quite impossible to make an inspection as often as that.  Up to the present, according to the figures we are given, apparently, only one child in three attending school has ever been inspected at all.</P>
    <P>I do not know how far the Minister has control over the sanitary conditions of school buildings.  I may be wrong, <Col N="2228" /> but I understood the Minister for Education a few days ago to say that that matter fell to the Department of Local Government and Public Health. To-day we had the Minister for Education stating in answer to a question that in the Dublin area the accommodation in school buildings for school children would accommodate some 29,000 children, as well as I could hear, but that the average attendance was 31,000.  So that we have a position, whether these figures are exact or not, that the average attendance in the Dublin schools is greater than those schools are able to accommodate, if proper attention is given to sanitary conditions.  I am not sure how far the Minister for Local Government has any control over that matter, but I think the responsibility has been put upon him by his colleague and, if so, I would wish that he would take that responsibility very seriously.</P>
    <P>With regard to child welfare, I was rather surprised to notice that the Estimate has been reduced from last year and I hope that the Minister will give us an explanation of that fact. One would like to see the child welfare schemes greatly increased rather than reduced.  The sum spent last year was £24,000; it is now proposed to reduce it to £22,800.</P>
    <P>There are some points with regard to dispensary services to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention. It is quite true that there has been a general improvement in the salaries of this service during the past 30 years, an improvement which approximately has made up for the altered value of money, but it has not made any great advance beyond keeping in step with the altering value of money.  There is still great need for standardisation of scales of salaries in several counties.  There is considerable variation&mdash;some counties begin at £175 and others at £250, and it is unfortunate that in the counties where there is the least possibility of securing some extra income from private practice, the scale is the lowest.  In the counties where there are more people able to pay for medical assistance the amount is larger.  That is anomalous and creates considerable discontent in the service. <Col N="2229" /> I would suggest to the Minister that he should devote some attention to an attempt to standardise salaries throughout the medical service and thus approach nearer to the ideal of a State medical service.  It will remove one of the difficulties which existed in the past towards establishing a State medical service.</P>
    <P>There are a number of matters in the administration of the Poor Law medical services which cause discontent from time to time and I would like to draw attention to some of them.  In regard to the question of study leave for dispensary medical officers, great advances have been made in recent years.  Boards of health are permitted to give medical officers study leave amounting to three months during a period of three years. That is a very great advance.  The board of health provides a substitute for the officer while he is absent from home studying for improvement, but it does not give a medical officer any assistance towards the expenditure on his study.  The Committee of Inquiry into Medical Services in its majority report, recommended that study leave and grants should be given and that medical officers should be encouraged in every way to improve the value of their services to the public by that means.  I hope that the Minister, in considering any steps for the improvement of the dispensaries generally, will not lose sight of that point.  He would find a considerable number of medical officers really anxious to undertake studies but who cannot afford the fees themselves.  They would be encouraged if they had some help towards meeting fees even without getting a further grant towards the extra expenses involved.  Courses of study are not benefits peculiar to the medical officer concerned.  They are benefits which react on his service to the public.</P>
    <P>I would also like to draw attention to the considerable irritation which is caused by a certain lack of reasonableness shown in regard to the giving of what may be called emergency leave to medical officers.  It must occur to any of us that there should be <Col N="2230" /> a sudden family illness or urgent business to be attended to.  It is laid down in the regulations that an officer must not leave his duty to a deputy without leave from the board of assistance and permission from the Minister.  It must be recognised that it is not always possible to go through all these formalities and the medical officer, if a relative becomes suddenly ill at some distance, breaks that regulation by leaving.  That will not occur very often and I have no doubt that the Minister and his Department would show reasonableness, but in some cases complaints have been made that medical officers have gone through the course of applying to the board of health and to the Minister and the leave has been refused without, as I am informed, adequate reason.  In some cases where medical officers of long service wished to spend a few days with a relative who was very ill, the leave has been refused and there is some considerable delay before the particular circumstances can be explained to the Department.  I think that the Department might show itself a little more ready to deal with these special cases but, at the same time, I recognise that too great slackness in this matter might lead to considerable abuses.  I do not think, however, that any confidence shown in medical officers would often be abused.</P>
    <P>There is one other more general matter which requires very serious attention at this particular moment. That is consideration of the general hospital services of the country.  The Department, in the hands of the present Minister and of his predecessor, has shown a very keen desire to improve the hospital services throughout the country and we all know that very considerable improvements have been effected within the last 15 or 20 years.  But, those improvements have been made in individual hospitals rather than in the system as a whole and it is to ask the Minister and the House to consider what is necessary for an efficient hospital system that I draw attention to this matter now.  I must draw the Minister's attention particularly to the <Col N="2231" /> criticisms which were made public in a very helpful and constructive speech delivered a month or so ago by the President of the Royal College of Surgeons.  Speaking with a due sense of his responsibilities in the matter he pointed out that the public hospital system, apart from institutions for special purposes, consisted of district hospitals and county hospitals or hospitals corresponding to those titles, with power to send patients in special cases to voluntary hospitals in one of the larger cities.  At first sight, it appears to be an admirable system. It is, if it is well worked.  These several classes&mdash;the local district hospitals and the larger county hospitals with some equipment for doing surgical work, ought to be able to deal with much of the therapeutic work of the county but at the present time there has been very little attempt to define the functions of these institutions or to plan these institutions to suit particular areas.  The President of the Royal College of Surgeons suggested that the first step should be a survey of each county having regard to the distribution of population and the health of each district and that definite plans should be followed in planning hospitals and in determining the sizes most suitable.  That has never been done though it may seem elementary. He gave examples of the number of hospitals in County Cork where there are no fewer than 17.  Five were in a radius of 30 miles from Cork City, and in that county, each of the institutions served a population of 17,000.  In Meath two hospitals deal with 60,000 and in Sligo there is one hospital for over 70,000.  It is clear that if these figures are exact, and I am sure he has taken pains to make them as exact as possible, there is need for planning the hospital system, bearing in mind the number of people to be served.</P>
    <P>It is not merely that those hospitals have existed for a considerable time and have not yet been considered from the point of view of amalgamating or abolishing some of them, but similar mistakes are being made at the present moment.  The President went on to say that in another county there had <Col N="2232" /> been for some years two district hospitals with 15 and 20 beds respectively, and that the number of beds occupied in each was 50 per cent.  According to the local Press they were to be replaced by two new hospitals with 30 beds each, that is 60 beds to take the place of 35, although only 17 of the 35 were ordinarily occupied.  That is in regard to the need for suiting the hospital system to local conditions.</P>
    <P>I now come to another point, and that is in relation to the relative functions of the district hospital, the county hospital and the city voluntary hospital.  It should not be a difficult matter to fix their relative functions. We realise that many cases requiring a simple form of medical attention, without elaborate equipment, could receive adequate treatment in the district hospital.  The cases requiring urgent surgical treatment and cases which could not readily be transferred elsewhere could receive adequate attention in the county hospital.  Many acute medical cases could, no doubt, be treated in the district hospital also. Many boards of health appear to think that the county hospital is, and must be, the last word in treatment, and that it is a confession of incapacity when the county surgeon from time to time sends patients to the city hospitals. What is the staffing of these county hospitals?  There is a county surgeon.  Most of the county surgeons have been appointed in comparatively recent years and are competent men. No criticism can be made of them. The assistance given to them varies very much.  In some places there is also a physician who acts occasionally as anæsthetist to the hospital.  In some of them there is a house surgeon&mdash;not by any means in all.  In not less than 16 county hospitals, the President stated, there was no house surgeon.  In nine county hospitals, the county surgeon had to work single-handed, or with only inadequate assistance.  It is impossible for any county surgeon, no matter how competent, to do efficient work without proper skilled assistance. In many cases, if the county surgeon recognises his disabilities and insists on sending cases to the city for investigation and treatment, he is criticised <Col N="2233" /> by the board of health.  In one case an advertisement actually appeared for a county surgeon who would have to undertake all operations which required to be performed.  It is not recognised by those boards of health that nowadays the investigation of many cases of disease requires the co-operation of a large number of experts of different capacities.  The county surgeon is himself frequently an expert in the use of X-rays.  He is expected to be, and may be, expert as a pathologist, but it is unreasonable to demand or expect him to be expert in those matters as well as in the ordinary work of a surgeon.  It is necessary that he should send patients to other institutions where expert advice can be had at call&mdash; where, not only the expert advice of an X-ray expert or pathologist, but the expert advice of a gynæcologist, an eye surgeon and so on, may be available when required.  Such advice is required in a constantly increasing proportion of the cases which come up for investigation in the city hospitals.</P>
    <P>It may be said that I am criticising the system rather than the Department. The Department, of course, is responsible for the system or lack of of system, and I do complain that very little help has been given to the county surgeons in the way of assisting them to convince boards of health that some of the demands made on them are unreasonable, and that it is reasonable and proper for the surgeon to send cases on to a hospital where a greater variety of expert advice is available.  He would not be doing his duty to his patients if he did not seek that advice in certain cases.  Of course we are all aware that the Minister has the advice of the Hospitals' Commission on particular matters as to the hospitals of the country and their equipment, and as regards the distribution of Sweepstake Funds.  I hope it is not to be expected that the whole hospital problem of the country&mdash;the planning of the hospitals and their future upkeep&mdash;is to be dependent on the amount of money which comes to the country from the Sweepstakes.  I believe that the Minister will get very <Col N="2234" /> helpful expert advice from the Commission. They are working hard and thoroughly, but the ultimate responsibility rests with the Minister.  Many of the matters which I have been discussing in regard to this hospital system would have arisen and would have called for attention and criticism&mdash;as they have called for criticism at any time during the last ten years&mdash;had there been no Sweepstakes and no Hospitals Commission.  I hope my criticism is constructive and not destructive. It is certainly not intended to be hostile, and I do not wish it to be taken as conveying any suggestion whatever against the work of the Hospitals Commission.  It is merely my intention to point out that those problems are not altogether dependent upon the work of the Hospitals Commission, or on the funds in regard to which the Hospitals Commission alone has the power to give advice.  Those are the only matters arising out of the Estimate upon which I wish to make any comment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to take advantage of this Vote to offer my criticism of the Ministry for their change of policy in so far as the distribution of free milk is concerned.  Up to March, 1934, that is to say, during the financial year 1933-34, the local authorities were directed to give free milk to children, regardless of age, provided that they were delicate and that their parents were able to procure a medical certificate.  That was a great boon to the children and a source of great consolation to their parents, especially in cases where the father had been unemployed for some considerable time.  Everybody knows how hard it is for an unemployed man to provide proper nourishment for his children.  At the beginning of the last financial year, that is 1st April last, the Minister refused to permit local authorities to give free milk to children over a certain age.  He fixed a maximum amount of milk to be given to each family, regardless of the number of children, and regardless of whether the children were delicate or not.  One could understand the attitude of the Minister in this connection if the amount of money would not permit him to continue that policy; but so far as I know, in districts with <Col N="2235" /> which I am familiar, a larger amount of a grant was notified to the local authorities at the beginning of the year than they were able to spend under the changed policy of the Department, with the result that a good deal of money reverted to the Minister at the end of the year in consequence of the restriction in the giving of milk.  I appeal to the Minister to revert to the policy which obtained in the financial year 1933-34.  It certainly was welcomed by the poor people who were unable to provide proper nourishment for their children.</P>
      <P>I would like to add something to what Deputy Rowlette has said about the dispensary doctors.  There is no question about it, some time or another the Minister will have to set himself to the task of standardising the salaries of the medical officers.  In some areas the salaries given to dispensary doctors are absolutely scandalous.  In recent times more especially, people who hitherto would not think of getting a red ticket to bring to a doctor are taking them, and obtaining the services of the doctors in that way.  I am aware that on various occasions county boards of health were in favour of increasing the salaries of their medical officers, but the Ministry turned down the proposal for some reason or other.  I have in mind a case from County Wexford.  It was not exactly the case of a dispensary doctor.  It was the case of a lady doctor in the county fever hospital and her salary was £200 a year.  The county board of health agreed to raise it to £275, but the Ministry were very reluctant to agree, and it was only after pressure that they finally agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there should be any hesitancy on the part of the Minister to agree to an increase of that kind, because everybody knows that a doctor in attendance upon fever patients has not the same chance of getting private patients as another doctor, as there is a reluctance on the part of people to have any contact with a doctor who is in touch with fever patients day after day.  It may be foolish, but nevertheless the objection is there and the doctor suffers in consequence. I suggest that the Minister <Col N="2236" /> should standardise the salaries of these medical officers.  I would go so far as to agree with the suggestion made by Deputy Rowlette that there should be some sort of a State medical service set up in this country.  I believe the time is opportune for such a service. In a great many local areas the county boards of health, in consequence of the depression, will be reluctant to raise the salaries of their medical officers and I believe the Minister should come to the aid of the medical officers who are very badly treated in some of the rural areas.  I would like to stress the point in connection with the distribution of free milk.  I do not think it is too much to ask that the Minister should revert to the policy that prevailed in this connection in 1933-34.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDavis" hpid="Mr. Davis Mr. Davis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davis</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few matters to which I wish to draw attention. They do not exactly bear relation to the construction of houses, but they have reference to the payment of the grant for the construction of houses.  I am now referring to houses in rural districts.  I think it should be known that in the county which I represent the people who are applying for grants are almost in every case poor people. They are not possessed of means and whatever assets they may have in the way of stock there is one thing which they have not got, and that is cash. I now refer to cases in which the applicants are entitled to a building grant of £80.  I am not conversant with the rules or regulations that govern the payment of these grants, but I am conversant with the manner in which the grants are paid.  Instances have come to my notice where it has been determined by the Department that people are entitled to a grant of £80.  Very grave cases of hardship have arisen in this connection and, instead of the grant being regarded as a favour, it is, in reality, as a result of the way in which payment is made, a most harassing thing to those who are entitled to receive it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The circumstances of the applicants are probably known to contractors, who are consequently somewhat reluctant to undertake the responsisibility of carrying out a contract without <Col N="2237" /> some guarantee with regard to payment.  The contractor will go a certain distance with the work and when he has reached a certain stage he looks for some money.  I have brought several instances to the notice of the Department and I went so far as to get the applicants to go to the housing inspector and seek a certificate from him with regard to the amount of work done.  I urge them to get a certificate that the building of the house had been brought to the stage of what is known in the country as side-wall high; that is, that the masonry part of the work had been carried out.  The position is that no proportion of the grant will be paid until the roof has been reached, and in the majority of cases poor people have tremendous difficulty in proceeding with the work.  The Department informed me that no payment would be made until the roof was on.  That is really the crux of the whole thing. In one case a widower with a big family was in very poor circumstances. The Department indicated that no part of the grant would be paid until the roof was on.  That almost means the completion of the work, because when the roof is on the house is practically built.  I consider that is a matter the Minister should interest himself in.  It deserves serious consideration, because if poor people are left in that position they will be utterly unable to complete the contract they have undertaken.  It is a great boon to them, I admit, to get a grant of £80 to assist them to do something that would otherwise never be possible.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the question to which I should like to draw attention, that is withholding payment of portion of the grant which inflicts further injury on them.  I expect it is known to the Minister that where holdings are vested in tenants the Land Commission refuses to make grants.  Loans are made by the Land Commission on certain conditions. They will not be given until the amount of the grants have been expended or, in other words, until a certificate of final completion of the house has been <Col N="2238" /> lodged.  The fact that a part payment will not be made renders it impossible for the party who has to get a grant to complete the building.  It renders it impossible for him to secure from the Land Commission the loan to which he would otherwise be entitled.  The Land Commission makes the loan on the completion of the work.  That is the position and I consider it a very grave injustice to the people concerned. I am speaking of a matter of which I have knowledge, and about which I hold correspondence both from the Department of Local Government and the Land Commission.  I am giving actual particulars of what occurred and I can produce the correspondence for the Minister.  I consider this is a matter that requires the immediate attention of the Minister because he will realise that it is one of outstanding importance to poor people.  The Minister's first duty, in my opinion, should be to come to their rescue, and to assist them to complete houses of which they are badly in need by having them paid some portion of the free grant to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>There is another matter dealing with administration to which I should draw the Minister's attention.  I refer to the construction of a county hospital in the urban area of Castlebar, County Mayo.  Needless to say, that county hospital is being constructed from a grant provided by the Irish Hospitals' Sweeps through the Department of Local Government.  A contract was entered into some considerable time ago and the work was carried on for months.  For reasons of which I have not heard a satisfactory explanation construction then came to a standstill. In the circumstances that now exist in that area I cannot explain the real position or say who is really responsible. The contract was for about £100,000 and the work has been held up for months.  That fact must have come to the knowledge of the Department. If so, what is the real explanation? The delay is inflicting not only inconvenience but great expense on the ratepayers of the county.  The ratepayers are aggrieved in this way, that while the hospital should now be almost completed nothing has been <Col N="2239" /> done for the last four months.  I think the public are entitled to an explanation because even if the people had not to put their hands in their pockets to pay the expenses of constructing the hospital, the money was provided through the Hospitals' Sweep and the hospital should now be available without any compliment.  The work has not been carried on with the efficiency or with the speed that one would reasonably expect.  That is where it comes home to the Minister as a duty to take the matter up.  I should like to have an explanation with regard to the cause of work having ceased.  What is the meaning of it?  It has meant considerable expense on the ratepayers of the county, because an institution that was to be available as a surgical hospital is not available and the expense of sending patients to other hospitals for treatment had to be incurred.  Is that good business?  Is the Minister aware of it?  I feel inclined to think that he is not.  If he was aware of the facts I think he would have an inquiry held.  It is a case in which the holding of a sworn inquiry would be fully justified.  I make that statement here on behalf of the ratepayers of Mayo, and as one who feels charged with a grave responsibility as their representative, I feel it my bounden duty to call the Minister's attention to it.  When closing the debate I hope he will give some indication of the position now, and when we may expect that the work will recommence and the hospital be completed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few matters to which I wish to draw the attention of the Minister.  I need hardly say that I am glad to be amongst those who congratulate the Minister on the extent to which housing has been assisted by the Central Government. Nevertheless, although a great deal of work is being done, with a view to the ultimate solution of the housing shortage, I suggest to the Minister that we should not lose sight of the immediate evils that exist and that demand radical and prompt abatement. One of the most prominent of <Col N="2240" /> these is the question of slum rents. Those who have been in any way associated with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul are familiar with the rents charged for certain tenement rooms in Dublin, and which seem to be out of all proportion to their value.  We know that the Rent Restriction Act which is in force should provide an effective remedy for tenement dwellers against certain landlords who are overcharging for houses, and we all know that if individual tenement dwellers could be instructed in the provisions of the Rent Restrictions Act, and were financially able to seek the assistance of the courts, in the vast majority of cases they could not only get rents reduced, but could recover from landlords substantial sums that they had overpaid during the period of their tenancy.  So much for the tenants who paid the rents regularly but, when you look into the problem you find that while the nominal rents of many of these rooms seem ridiculously high, in many cases the tenants have not paid their rents because they were unable to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I shall relate rents to housing in a moment if the Minister will have patience.  What I suggest to the Minister is this: That on careful investigation it might emerge that the adequate housing of <Col N="2241" /> the poor in cities is, in its essence, an uneconomic business, and that if we fixed fair rents for the accommodation available in the existing tenement houses it might appear that it would be impossible for the slum owner to repair or maintain the houses, because, as we all know, many of these houses are very dilapidated and their maintenance has become ridiculously expensive because they have not been kept in the state of repair in which they ought to be kept.  If that is so, it in no way reduces the responsibility on the Minister to intervene and deal with this evil.  It is no defence whatever for insanitary conditions to say that it is not an economic proposition to keep the house in a sanitary condition.  If it is not an economic proposition, then the duty devolves upon the State to provide sanitary and decent accommodation for the people living in those houses.  I suggest to the Minister that he should institute an inquiry into slum rents because I am quite satisfied that both he and I are far more concerned to see justice done in that matter than some of the gentlemen who conduct rent strikes in back streets in Dublin, not for the purpose of securing reduced rents for the people, but for the purpose of promoting anarchy in the city. Let us recognise that there are unscrupulous people who delight to exploit any passing evil for the purpose of promoting anarchy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having, as I believe the Government have, effectively met that sort of activity and put an end to it, let us then deal with the evil which these people have sought to exploit.  An inquiry should be held, a reasonable rent should be arrived at for the existing accommodation, and, in order to make it reasonably known to potential users, I suggest that a system should be adopted somewhat similar to that being put in force under the Hotels Code in America at the present time and that is, that the fixed rent of every room should be painted on the door.  If a room is decided to be one which the landlord may legitimately set for 5/- a week, let some note be affixed to the door or some part of the room informing any tenant <Col N="2242" /> who may go into it that the statutory price is 5/- a week and that the landlord has no right to charge any more. Having done that, if it emerges that the rents are insufficient to maintain and repair the houses or yield the owner any interest on his investment of capital, then the Minister must seriously consider taking over these houses and administering them for the short period that must elapse before he or the municipal authority have had time to provide alternative accommodation for these tenants, as, I have no doubt, that in the long run he intends to do away with all the existing tenements and put in their place modern sanitary and more comfortable flats, or separate houses under the building schemes that are at present proceeding and that he proposes to initiate in the future.  But whatever details he may decide on in his method of procedure, there should be no delay whatever in examining this question closely and making it perfectly clear to the poor people of this city that the law in respect of the restriction of rents will, if needs be, be strengthened in respect of tenement rooms and that the Government is determined that the poverty of people, for which they themselves are not responsible, will not be exploited either by slum owners or by the Department of Local Government itself.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the Rent Restriction Act in order to point out to the Minister that if the tenants were comparatively wealthy and educated people they could quite easily enforce their rights themselves.  Owing to circumstances over which they have no control, they are not getting the benefit of the legislation that was passed in this House, and it is up to the Minister to see that they do get it.  I do not wish to delay the House unduly, and the only other reference of a critical nature that I desire to make to housing is that the Minister should stop ribbon building on the main roads.  At the present time, a large number of labourers' cottages are going up all over the country and the tendency is for the people to ask that the land acquired for the erection of labourers' cottages shall be adjoining <Col N="2243" /> the main road.  You then have a row of cottages, the average juvenile population of which will be four children, along the main road.  You will have small children playing in the evening and running in and out of the cottages. Inevitably, you will have serious accidents, taking into consideration the heavy motor traffic on the roads at the present time.  If the people want the houses built so immediately adjacent to the main road, then by-roads should be driven in to the acquired land and the houses faced away from the main road.  God knows, there are enough of all kinds of roads in the country already, and by-roads can be found.  If possible, the cottage should be set back some considerable distance on the proposed plot in order to prevent that constant danger of children chasing one another in play out on to the main road and under the wheels of passing traffic.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have noted, I am sure, that this question has greatly agitated the minds of responsible Ministers in Great Britain and that a Bill is being drafted, or has already been submitted to the British House of Commons, to put an end to ribbon building.  The problem has not assumed dimensions comparable to the British problem in this country yet, and therefore I suggest, before it becomes a real evil, that the Minister should take active measures under his existing powers to restrict ribbon building.  I remember, Sir, that I may not advocate the enactment of legislation.  Now, in regard to the labourers' cottages which are being erected, many local authorities have already laid down a rule for themselves that married labourers and those living in houses already condemned by the medical authority will get the preference.  I should like to know from the Minister definitely whether or not he is determined to enforce that preference in every case, because I have been obliged to bring under the attention of his Department recently a case of a very grave departure from what I believe to be the well-established policy of the Department over which he presides.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2244" /> I have mentioned on more than one occasion a minor problem which, owing to its minor character, is being neglected.  The Land Commission when dividing land ever since 1885, have been in the habit of building accommodation roads.  Some judgement was delivered by the late Chief Baron Palles defining a road of public convenience and it was held that a local authority might not undertake the maintenance of any road that was not a road of public convenience.  Substantially, the definition of a road of public convenience is a by-road which connects two main roads.  The vast majority of these small Land Commission roads do not connect two main roads, but go off the main road to serve three, four, or perhaps more houses, and sometimes to serve no house at all, but to lead into a patch of land, or to a series of patches of land.  On roads of this character in more than one case the local authority has acquired land and built labourers' cottages.  Having built the cottages on the Land Commission road, they have disowned responsibility for the maintenance of the road.  The Land Commission will not maintain the road, and eventually we find that nobody will maintain the road.  I know of one such road which in wet weather is more than ankle-deep in mud, and no one is responsible for its restoration to a passable condition. I submit to the Minister, though that is a minor problem from the point of view of the general administration of the Department, it is one which causes a very great deal of inconvenience to the people living in the rural parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I have on more than one occasion, and with reference to more than one Department, raised the question of correspondence with each Department. I fully appreciate that in the Department of Local Government the volume of correspondence must be very great. Let me say at once that certainly, in my experience, if I ever approach the Minister or any of the higher officials with a specific complaint that any of my correspondence has been neglected, it has always been promptly and courteously attended to.  I want, <Col N="2245" /> however, to submit to the Minister that something more than that is required.  Every business house of any size has long ago discovered that in order to carry on its business efficiently it must establish what is known as an adjustment bureau.  An adjustment bureau consists of a trusted official, with a sufficient number of assistants, whose sole business is to deal with complaints or inquiries. Every letter that comes in containing an inquiry or complaint is referred to his department.  They are divided according to the subject matter, or according to the officer who deals with the particular division of the department to which the inquiry applies. Somebody who knows his way about the Custom House, in the case of the Department of Local Government, who is well acquainted with the responsible officers, who has some knowledge of the ordinary procedure of the Department, starts out in the morning with, perhaps, a bunch of 50 or 60 letters. He knows whom to go to; he knows the kind of information required; and in the course of an hour he can get from the responsible officer a note on each one of the letters which he can bring back to the office whence he came and there elaborate that note into a suitable reply to the inquirer or the person who is complaining.  If further correspondence arises it joins the files and goes into the hands of the man who dealt with the first inquiry or complaint.</P>
    <P>In that way you save the time of hard-worked and highly-paid officers, who are spared the necessity of dictating long letters in answer, sometimes, to somewhat fatuous inquiries.  You also provide, if somebody comes in with a specific complaint, that the person who has been in charge of his correspondence to date may be able to give him all the information he wants or, in any case, can act as his introducer or intermediary with the more hard-pressed officer in charge of a division.  The result of the whole scheme is that you spare the time and labour of highly-paid, highly-efficient and hard-worked men and get a lot of the donkey work done by persons who are suitably remunerated and <Col N="2246" /> with suitable intellectual equipment for that kind of work.  The Minister, if he inquires, will find that every up-to-date business establishment operates such a service.  I have often heard him say, albeit in his salad days, that he intended when he took charge of the Government of this country to shake it up from the foundations, to establish sound business principles, to eliminate red tape, and do away with the evil institutions set up by the base, bloody and brutal Saxon.  Let me suggest to him that this is a new departure which will mark him out beyond all the despised dispensations of the past if he will set up an adequate correspondence bureau in his own Department, and in doing that he will set a headline for his other colleagues.</P>
    <P>As to the question of blind pensions, at present there does not seem to be any common standard of blindness whereby the claims of persons for blind pensions are decided.  I recognise the difficulty, but I submit to the Minister that that is a question deserving of close investigation.  I know of one case of a man called Michael Scanlon, of Meenreagh, County Donegal, who applied for a blind pension and was examined by the doctor.  He had one blind eye and I do not think that he had more than one-third of normal vision in his other one.  Yet he was refused a pension.  I have come across other cases in which the disability was not as great and the persons have been granted pensions.  I think the Minister will find, if he inquires in the Department or calls for the file of correspondence in connection with claims, that there are many similar cases.  I invite him to institute an inquiry into the matter and to satisfy himself that there will be some common denominator for the decision of these claims.</P>
    <P>There is one last question to which I wish to direct the Minister's attention. The Minister may have noticed that his colleague, the Minister for Education, has recently been discussing and investigating conditions obtaining in industrial schools.  I want to submit to the Minister that a great many committals to industrial schools might be <Col N="2247" /> avoided if he would encourage the boarding-out of the children of destitute widows or destitute parents with the parents themselves.  At present, if children are taken from the care of their parents on the grounds of financial inability to maintain them, they must be put in an industrial school where the charge for their maintenance and upbringing is 12/6 per week.  If there be two children that would amount to 25/-.  What objection is there, instead of committing children to industrial schools to taking them into county homes and boarding them out with the parents who would not then be obliged to part with them because they were not able to support them?  It seems to me the money would be much better spent in keeping the children in the family circle and while I do not desire for a moment to reflect on the excellence of many of the industrial schools in the country, I think the Minister will agree that as between institutional upbringing and the family circle, the family surrounding is very much better.  If he is prepared to accept my view that boardingout of any kind is better than institutional maintenance, he will agree, I think, that it is far more desirable to board a child out with its parents than to send it to an institution.  I do not know whether that scheme has ever been put before the Minister but I know at least of one case where a widow was left destitute with, I think, five young children and she was obliged to send four of them to industrial schools because she was unable to maintain them.  How much better would it have been if that widow could have gone through the necessary formalities to get those children boarded out to herself for the same money that was paid to the institution or even less?  If she got 50/- to maintain her four children she might then have said with the Roman matron: &ldquo;These are my jewels.&rdquo;  She would have attained a measure of prosperity which she probably never knew before. I therefore suggest to the Minister that he should set out to ensure that the Irish matron would be in a position <Col N="2248" /> to say to her neighbours when she is asked to describe her five children: &ldquo;These, through the intervention of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, are my jewels.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SydneyBMinch" hpid="Mr. Minch Mr. Minch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say one or two words without going over the ground which has been covered by the previous speakers, on the question of housing as it refers to the rural districts.  I presume it is realised by everybody that, after agriculture, the greatest industry in this country at the moment, is the State building of houses and it seems to me that the great offensive which was started some time ago is now beginning to expend itself somewhat.  That is probably because the administration of this huge industry has shown itself to be a job that is taxing to the last degree the energies and capabilities of the very efficient staff which surrounds the Minister.  My own view is that if this great scheme is ever to be brought to a stage of completion to the satisfaction of those who are behind it, and I hold the country is behind it, it will have to be done, more or less, under a Ministry of Housing.</P>
      <P>It is quite obvious that in the rural districts between vacillating public bodies and all sorts of obstructional jealousies which occur, this great housing scheme is not getting the chance it should.  I believe that a commissioner of housing with a committee of five appointed by county councils or urban councils should be set up to speed up and develop housing in rural areas.  Some system of speeding up, and more essentially, control, is desirable.  I would like to ask the Minister to define exactly what is a public utility society.  I do not want to refer to the case which is now before the courts in my own county, but is the position that any four or five persons can come together, pay 10/- and register themselves as a public utility society in the eyes of the Minister? My view is that if it is going to function properly it would need a capital of £10,000, but it seems to me there is something very wide between what constitutes one that is going to be effective and one that is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2249" /> I have seen houses built and the people occupying them were forced to put up additions to the chimney so that they would be habitable. This was necessary to draw the smoke which would otherwise smother them out.  They are becoming a very ugly sight along our country roads.  It may sound a petty thing to mention this matter.  It may sound a thing not worth consideration, but I have seen it in several cases already, and it seems to me that proper control is not being exercised by those contracting for or building houses in country districts for rural people.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to give serious consideration to the question of the expedition of the schemes that he has in hands.  I believe that he will have to set up a new driving force behind this whole scheme&mdash;that although his present steps have worked and worked well, the support behind it is not strong or powerful enough to push on the schemes to conclusion within reasonable time.  Your problem is not in the City of Dublin&mdash;it is mainly in the country and byeways. There are some of the most disgraceful houses, lying up in the boreens, where people live in muck and filth, where this propaganda for better housing has not reached.  Unless there is intensive propaganda in the schools and by inspectors and commissioners sent around, the energy and ambition that is desirable will not be behind schemes.  The whole question therefore to my mind wants to be investigated in a stronger way and in saying that I want to pay a tribute to those who are with the Minister, without wishing to curry favour.  At any time they have been asked to assist local boards or to reply to communications involving complications, they have given always their best services and for that reason and with those fine officials behind him, I say that there is something wrong when we cannot get along faster.  I suggest that a commissioner be appointed for every three counties and that public bodies be obliged to appoint three or five representatives to hasten the job.  Let them utilise all the propaganda, the films, if necessary, <Col N="2250" /> to get the whole country roused to the urgent necessity of housing in the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on this Vote in regard to the increased number of officials.  I am quite prepared to admit that they may be necessary, but it is very hard to reconcile their existence with the various promises of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I do not want to go back on those promises.  Deputy McGilligan or somebody else will remind the Minister of them.  I notice in the details of the Estimate that there is an increase of four in the number of junior executive officers.  The number is increased from 17 to 21.  The minor staff posts have been increased from 3 to 5, while the number of clerical officers has been increased from 64 to 79, and so on.  I do not want to go through the whole lot.  Those are a few examples of increases.  Of course, I quite appreciate the Minister's difficulty in trying to reconcile his promises of increased services and reductions in the number of officials.  He now has responsibility on his shoulders for reconciling those promises of his Party.  Now his Party has fled, and left him, like Casabianca, on the burning deck, to take care of himself.  With the exception of a few die-hard friends, he is left alone to defend the situation.</P>
      <P>With regard to the collection of rates, I think that there is certainly something to be said in relation to the Minister's attitude.  It was never known before that ratepayers were pushed so hard, or that rates were squeezed out of the unfortunate people at a time when they are unable to discharge their liabilities.</P>

If we go into the <Col N="2251" /> question of grants, and the question of equity, it will be found that there is no equity at all in the assessment of rates.  This matter has been discussed on other occassions; and I do not want to go into it now.  I think it is generally admitted that the unfortunate farmers are not able to pay their rates at the moment.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will admit that there is hardly any farmer in his own constituency, or anywhere else, who would wish to see his cows go to the pound, and it is only on account of the difficulty in which they find themselves that they allow that to happen.  The farmers of this country were always good payers. That is on record, because up to the start of the economic war they promptly met all their liabilities. There is no necessity for this wonderful drive against the farmers, or this increased expenditure in erecting pounds.  I might mention also that the Minister has not discharged his duty to the local bodies in defining their right to make regulations where they are compelled to pay money.  They have to insist on the collection of the money, and bring extraordinary pressure to bear upon unfortunate people, in order to meet expenditure which is not being incurred by the local bodies elected by the people.  Power is being given to other persons, such as happened here to-day when the district court clerk and the registrar were given power to expend money on courthouses, and to compel the local bodies to raise the money in rates.  I expected the Minister to defend the right of the local bodies in this case&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is another matter to which I should like to refer.  I think it is the Minister for Finance is responsible for the stamping of rate receipts, but if the Minister for Local Government is not to be directly charged in that regard he is at least liable to be charged with contributory negligence. He should not have allowed the Minister for Finance to insist upon this new departure in the collection of rates&mdash; the stamping of receipts of over £2&mdash; especially at a time when it is so difficult to collect rates and to find the last 2d.  There should not have been this insistence on collecting the last 2d. from people whose cattle are being sold at 10/- apiece in some cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I mean. It is 2d. over and above.  The Minister has failed to stand up against those departures.  Power is steadily being taken away from the local bodies. They are bodies elected by the people. It does not matter on what vote they are elected, or what Party happened to be in the majority.  Those bodies are elected by the people for the purpose of local administration, and if the power given to them under the Local Government Act is not increased, it should at least not be diminished.  The tendency of late is to diminish their power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey, Deputy Minch and others referred to houses.  There is a general complaint about the roofing material used in those new houses. There is a general opinion, and it is backed by experience, that tiles prove very unsatisfactory.  I believe it is almost impossible to get timber which is able to bear the strain over a number of years, owing to the weight of those tiles.  I do not know whether the new tiles are lighter than the tiles used some time ago, but unless they are very much lighter and very much better than the old ones they are going to be a complete failure.  In the part of the country where I come from <Col N="2253" /> a number of those old tiled houses were put up.  In every case the timber shrunk.  The houses began to leak and they turned out not only very ugly, but absolutely useless.  I hope, if it is at all possible to develop the slate quarries I heard other Deputies say are in the country, they will be encouraged so that we can get really good material for our houses.  There is no use in building houses for only 20 or 30 years.  We should aim at erecting good houses that would last at least 100 years.</P>
    <P>There is another very important matter to which I would like to call attention, because it is causing general complaint all over the country.  I refer now to the slippery state of the main roads.  Something should be done to make the roads available, not only for motor cars but for the men who use horses and who drive cattle.  There is a general complaint in this respect and the matter has been discussed at county council and other meetings all over the country.  Nothing definite has been done so far.  I believe the Minister is more responsible than local bodies for the present condition of the main roads.  The local bodies have not complete control so far as the main roads are concerned.  The roads are partly administered nationally, the trunk roads at least, and they are the roads that are the cause of most complaint. I have had some experience of slippery roads and I found that there could be a remedy provided in the use of certain material with which to finish them off.  If the roads were finished off with sand, instead of limestone chippings, I believe that would prevent the roads acquiring a slippery surface.  I have seen it tried and it proved a success, and I think it would be worth the Minister's while to recommend to the engineers under his control the use of white sand, where possible, for finishing off the roads.  I believe that would prevent any further slipping.  It might mean a little extra trouble, but it would result in a better road surface.  All things considered, it would not cost very much extra and it would mean that the roads could be used safely for all kinds of traffic.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2254" /> This is a very serious matter in some districts; many accidents occur because of the slippery road surface. Horses and cattle have had their legs broken and even the people driving them have been hurt.  This may seem to some people quite unimportant, but it is a very serious matter for the farmers who are paying towards the maintenance of these main roads and they are entitled to the use of them. It is not fair that motor cars should be given a monopoly of the main roads, turning away the people for whom the roads were mainly intended and who contribute a large amount towards their maintenance.  Anything that can be done by the Government to remedy this grievance should be done.</P>

      <P>The debate on this Estimate has given us an interesting insight into the widely divergent views of the members of the United Ireland Party on the subject of housing. Deputy Minch, in a tornado of eloquence, told us that every conceivable piece of publicity must be mobilised in order to have houses built at the utmost possible speed.  He suggested that a whirlwind campaign ought to be conducted in order to have houses built much more rapidly.  Even the films were to be pressed into service in order to awaken the people to the necessity of building houses at a much greater speed than the rate of building obtaining to-day.  If the Deputy had been listening to Deputy Mulcahy, I do not think he would have made a speech of that kind in the course of the same debate, because Deputy Mulcahy treated us to a regular epidemic of statistics as to the cost of house-building. The whole philosophy of the Deputy's speech was &ldquo;Can we afford to spend so much money on housing?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputy Mulcahy said that a sum of £2,216,000 was being spent on the erection of 16,000 houses. In reply to an interjection by me as to what proportion of that was in respect of subsidies towards interest charges on slum clearance schemes, Deputy Mulcahy said the figure amounted to £1,220,000, that another £54,000 represented a subvention towards interest charges in the case of the erection of houses under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, and £541,000 represented the subvention towards interest charges in respect of the erection of labourers' cottages, making a total of £2,216,000, which, he said, was being spent in the erection of 16,000 houses.  He mentioned that a sum of £1,816,000 was in respect of reducing rents, on slum clearance schemes, on labourers' cottages and on the erection of houses under the Housing of the Working Classes Act.

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That in the opinion of the Dáil the Government ought either to abandon the profession of Republicanism or to seek authority from the electorate for the immediate establishment of a Republic.&mdash;(Deputies Frank MacDermot, Seán MacEoin.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion is not a Party motion.  It was put down by <Col N="2257" /> Deputy MacEoin and myself back in 1932 because we objected to a policy of drift.  The last general election automatically removed it from the Order Paper, but we put it down again a year ago and I think recent events make its discussion particularly timely.</P>
      <P>Now, Sir, those who believe that we are gratuitously raising a dangerous issue are living in a fool's paradise. Patience, forbearance, caution are valuable elements in statesmanship, but they are not the same thing as mere indecision and timidity.  If this country accepts a Republic with its eyes open I have no complaint to make, but we are betraying its interests if we allow it to slip into such a situation without knowing what it is doing. Unlike Deputy Belton, for instance, I do not believe that it is practicable to set up the ideal of a Republic and to go on indefinitely refusing to realise that ideal.</P>

      <P>In the eyes of those people the attitude of Fianna Fáil towards the Commonwealth to-day is identical with that of Cumann na nGaedheal ten years ago.  In spite of all the bribes of the I.R.A. by Fianna Fáil, in spite even of the denunciations of the Church, there are and, so long <Col N="2258" /> as Republicanism without a Republic continues in vogue, there always will be a large number of people who deny the authority of the State and make their principles a justification for disorder and crime.  Sooner or later that will become intolerable, and we shall go over the Niagara Falls whether we want to or not.  Of course, I know that taking a plebiscite, even if it was a plebiscite of All Ireland, which is impracticable, or a plebiscite of the Irish Free State, which is practicable, neither one nor the other will conciliate the I.R.A. if it goes against them. Lord Danesfort and Miss MacSwiney are in complete accord in denying the Irish people the right to decide their own destiny.  But even so, any step which brought sham Republicanism to an end would enable rational men to get together.</P>
      <P>The real gulf in this country is not between those who call themselves Republicans and those who do not; indeed, I believe that the greater part of our population are in a mental fog about the whole question of a Republic. The real gulf is between those who want order and those who want anarchy, those who want concord among ourselves and those who want class warfare, those who want friendly relations with Great Britain and those who want perpetual hatred and hostility in her regard.  The President was very fierce a few days ago with Senator O'Farrell because the Senator ventured to allude to the gospel of hatred which is being propagated among us.  Yet Senator O'Farrell was perfectly right, and there is no one except the wilfully blind who cannot see that the present state of our politics brings out the ugliest side of human nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here in this House, however, let us try for once to have a dispassionate consideration of the Republican idea. Surely there is something more to be said for it than merely calling us Imperialists or appealing to the memory of the Republican dead.  If Imperialism means the claim of the strong to exploit the weak, it is utterly dishonest to apply the term to anybody on this side of the House.  We want no destiny for Ireland that Ireland does <Col N="2259" /> not accept of her own free will.  As for closuring discussion on matters vital to the country on the ground of loyalty to the dead, those who do so ought to take warning from what happened after the European War.  On the plea of devotion to the memory of the dead a general election was held in Great Britain shortly after the War to the tune of &ldquo;Hang the Kaiser,&rdquo;&ldquo;Make Germany pay,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Squeeze Germany till the pips squeak.&rdquo;  Catch cries of a similar degree of nobility were prevalent in other Allied countries.  On the plea of devotion to the memory of the dead a Carthaginian peace was enforced at Versailles.  On the same plea a succession of pacifist and democratic German Governments were harried and discredited by external pressure to comply with impossible conditions.  The end of it all has been that if those who died in the War to end war and to make the world safe for democracy were alive to-day they would see autocracy triumphant in numerous countries (sometimes under the guise of proletarianism), they would see a Germany more militarist and under more despotic rule than the Germany of 1914, they would see the nations feverishly arming, they would see treaties, pacts and covenants being broken on all sides and they would see the world wrapped in an atmosphere of suspicion and fear.</P>
    <P>The Republic was, after all, a means to an end, and that end was the peace, prosperity and dignity of the Irish nation.  That Ireland should take and keep her place securely among the peoples of the earth with a life and culture of her own of first rate quality &mdash;is not that what matters, has not that been the fundamental aim of every Irish patriot through the ages&mdash;of the Republican Emmet, Pearse, and Griffith &mdash;if Griffith was a Republican&mdash;as much as of the Royalist Sarsfield, Grattan and O'Connell?  If persistence in the Republican formula impedes the realisation of that ideal, it is a very mistaken form of loyalty to the memory of the dead.</P>
    <P>My own reading of Irish history is that the main stream of Irish nationalism has been non-Republican. <Col N="2260" /> Prior to 1916 there are few indeed of the leaders of Irish national opinion whose careers have shown consistent Republicanism.  The man most often quoted as the separatist par excellence, Wolfe Tone, is one of those whose life will not stand examination in this respect.  The inspiration which I draw from the labours and sacrifices of those who have worked for Irish independence and unity on the basis of allegiance to the King is quite as strong as that which Deputies opposite draw from men holding other views.  The memory of the Irish Nationalists who fought and died in Gallipoli or in the dismal ditches of Flanders, who endured hardships of which those accustomed only to warfare in this country can have no conception, who were so patient and so valiant and carried out such forlorn and obscure tasks in frightful danger without popularity and publicity to console them, is fully as present, I can assure the House, to my heart and conscience as is to the majority of Deputies the memory of their comrades who fell between 1916 and 1923.  But, in spite of this, and in spite of the fact that even in the matter of mere numbers, I think I have far the stronger tradition to appeal to, I would consider that I was behaving neither intelligently nor patriotically if I yielded to the compulsion of such loyalties and refused to consider the question of separation on its merits as it affects the Ireland of to-day in the world of to-day.</P>
    <P>Let us then examine with as open a mind as we can the alternatives which this motion presents to the Government and afterwards return to a consideration of the policy they are actually pursuing.</P>
    <P>Naturally, of these alternatives&mdash;the abandonment of Republicanism or the prompt establishment of a Republic&mdash; it is the former I would like to see adopted.  But I am not all in agreement with those who look upon a Republic effective only over the Twenty-Six Counties as the worst of all possible evils.  I believe that the ultimate result of a Republic of either Thirty-Two or Twenty-Six Counties would be to explode separatism and that we should end up by accepting <Col N="2261" /> the Crown and Commonwealth.  This, of course, is disputable and I do not expect Deputies opposite to agree with me about it.  On the other hand, if a Republic were established, it would be the duty of all of us to make the best of it, to do everything we could for its success.  In those circumstances, I would certainly advise all those who now favour the Commonwealth connection to put their opinions in cold storage, to refrain from any propaganda in their favour and to treat the matter as settled for our generation or until such time as the general mass of Irish sentiment had been changed by facts and experience.</P>
    <P>There is a feeling that a Twenty-Six County Republic would be called upon to face shocks to its economic system which might be beyond its strength to endure.  I agree that there would be great difficulties, but the difficulties would be just as great if it were a Thirty-Two County Republic that we were setting up.  In fact, I suggest that in the latter case they would be even greater.  The blow to our agriculture, the sacrifice of our assets overseas that our kith and kin have done so much to create, the closing of careers to our young people, the intensification of our unemployment difficulties arising from our being treated by the British as aliens, the loss of security against aggression by Great Britain which is at present provided by the Constitution of the Commonwealth&mdash;all these things we should have to face just as much in the case of a Thirty-Two County Republic, and, in addition, we should have to find substitutes for the great northern industries of shipbuilding and linen which depend so enormously on the British market.  Government spokesmen are fond of saying that their policy of economic self-sufficiency facilitates the establishment of a Republic.  If so, it is a Twenty-Six County Republic that it facilitates; no preparations of the sort are being made in the six northern counties and the inclusion of these counties would, therefore, be, on the economic side, an embarrassment rather than otherwise. But whether a Twenty-Six or a Thirty-Two County Republic would be the <Col N="2262" /> better, the former has, at any rate, tremendous advantage&mdash;that it is the only one within our power to establish, and I submit that if Republicanism rejects in principle the only kind of Republic within the bounds of possibility it deserves to be called a humbug and a fraud.</P>
    <P>The thing I care most about in politics is the question of Partition. The constitutional policy of the Government since they came into office might have been specially designed to consolidate Partition.  The onslaught on Commonwealth symbols has not brought us an inch nearer a Thirty-Two County Republic; it has merely exasperated the very feelings that we have got to assuage in order to achieve unity.  To set up our own Republic will not make things a bit worse in this respect.  To use the President's phrase, we shall have got down to bed-rock and ten years of the Gaelic and self-sufficient Republic may teach us a good many lessons worth learning.  If it is a success, there will be that much gain.  If it is not, we may revise our ideas and go on to something better. In any case, it would be an improvement on the present state of demoralisation.</P>
    <P>Let us turn to the other alternative &mdash;acceptance of the Commonwealth. The President of the Executive Council speaks as if such acceptance must involve duress.  He tortures himself by thinking about the Treaty and the British maintenance parties in certain of our ports.  Why not forget about these things until after studying the question of Commonwealth membership on its merits?  I, for one, assert our right to separate from the Commonwealth if we want to.  The question is: do we want to?  As long as we are in the Commonwealth, the British Navy is our Navy and we should be as willing to welcome it as the South Africans are.  There is no more sense in our complaining about Cove than there would be in South Africa complaining about Simonstown.  What then should we gain by being in it freely and cordially on a basis of a partnership at will, symbolised by allegiance to the <Col N="2263" /> Crown?  In the first place, we should make a long step towards getting rid of Partition.  The Northerners' case against Irish unity is based on our attitude towards the Crown and the Commonwealth.  There are, of course, vested political interests in Ulster which would hold out as long as they could against Irish unity, but, in the long run, a fire must go out if it has no fuel to feed on.  Orangeism, like Separatism, is a symptom of a disease and to expect anything except intransigeance from the North until that disease has been tackled is to expect the impossible.  This House has unanimously accepted a motion that all constitutional questions should be subordinate to the question of Irish unity; if that means anything, it means that we ought to accept the Commonwealth and its symbols.  They are the key to the heart of Ulster Unionism.</P>
    <P>But, even aside from Partition, I suggest that the arguments in favour of Commonwealth membership are overwhelming. I ask the House to reflect for a moment upon the logical consequences of separation.  I have already mentioned some of them incidentally. If we become aliens in the eyes of the British&mdash;and no ingenious reciprocity proposals by the President of the Executive Council could save us from that fate&mdash;very serious economic consequences must follow.  Every Department of the British labour market would be closed to citizens of this country&mdash;a fact that would have violent repercussions in all classes of our community.  Irish citizens now resident in Great Britain who are unemployed or in any way a charge on public funds might easily be deported and sent back to us to provide for.  Our prestige and influence in the world which have been considerably higher than the size of our country would seem to justify would be greatly diminished.  And what would we not be throwing away in the matter of national safety?  Ireland has always been unfortunate in the fact that owing to her geographical position England can commit any act of spoliation or aggression against us which she likes without threatening the security of any other nation.  If Germany, for <Col N="2264" /> instance, wishes to occupy Belgium, France and England are up in arms to prevent her doing anything of the kind. But we are so situated that no nation except ourselves need sleep uneasy in their beds if the British choose to invade our country?  As a small, weak, thinly-populated country within a stone's-throw of one of the richest and most powerful countries in the world we have the almost incredible luck to be offered membership of an organisation which guarantees us freedom and equality and in which for all time we shall have behind us public opinion in Canada, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand if Great Britain venture to interfere with our liberties.  I confess that I am exasperated by the almost inconceivable folly of proposing to abandon such a safeguard and exposing ourselves to the possible renewal sooner or later of the agonies of our past history.</P>
    <P>What is to be said in favour of doing so?  Beyond the monotonous reiteration that they are extreme Republicans, and that nobody can possibly be more extreme than they are, and that they and nobody else represent the true succession from 1916, we never hear a thing from Deputies opposite that has any bearing on this question. They disdain to give us any explanations or arguments in order to justify their alleged Republicanism.  If only they would begin doing so even now we might get a little thought expended on this subject by the people whom it so deeply affects between now and the next general election.</P>
    <P>What is the policy that they are actually pursuing?  Can we make any sense of it?  Can we reconcile the various statements of Ministers about the Government's intentions?  If, for example, the British explicitly renounce all claim to keep us against our will, is the Government prepared to consider afresh whether after all it might not be worth while to stay in of our own accord?  The speech made by the Minister for Finance last summer in the Seanad certainly implied this and emphasised the wrench it would be to sever political connection with the Irish communities overseas&mdash;even in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2265" /> I am quoting from column 2047 of the Parliamentary Debates of 18th July (Seanad Report).  The Minister for Finance then said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am not going to deny that there are attractions in free association with Australia, Canada, South Africa and even Great Britain. There are people of our own blood in Australia and in Canada and we are proud of the achievements of our race in these countries.  I should hate to think that our future would be permanently divorced from theirs. In Australia, the greater Ireland as I regard it, in Canada and even in Great Britain there are many people of Irish birth, Irish extraction, and Irish nationality so far as their sentiments and ideals are concerned, but if there is going to be any association of ourselves with these peoples, with these great nations now coming into being, it must be really free and voluntary association which will recognise our separate nationhood and be consistent with our complete and independent statehood.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He then goes on to complain that the British have refused to say explicitly that we are free to decide for ourselves whether to stay in or go out. A little later he adds this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I say I believe that a clarification of that position is the first essential step to the establishment of satisfactory relations between ourselves, Great Britain and the other States.  There is no doubt as far as Canada and Australia are concerned. We feel that our association with them is free and voluntary that there is mutual recognition of the position which exists between us. We fear there is no such recognition on the part of Great Britain.  Until there is that recognition expressed frankly and fully I believe the present unsatisfactory position must continue.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a lot of good sense in that speech.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am certainly not going too far in saying that it implies that, if the sort of declaration from the British were obtained for which the Minister for Finance asked, the Government would be prepared to consider with an open mind whether it would be to our advantage to remain in the Commonwealth or not.  Unfortunately, it would seem that that speech cannot have been a success among his political associates; but if so, he has no doubt re-established his orthodoxy by his recent effort on the subject of the Protestant Succession, the penal laws, the Tyburn martyrs and the roofless monasteries.</P>
      <P>Speaking in this House quite recently, as reported in column 1437 of the Parliamentary Debates on the 22nd March, the Minister for Finance alluded to the fact that the Opposition were in favour of accepting the Commonwealth and its symbols.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It can be pointed out that one of the symbols of the Commonwealth is the Throne and, indissolubly linked up with the Throne, is the acceptance of the principle of the Protestant Succession in this country.  You cannot blink it.  The symbol of the Commonwealth is the Crown and the Crown must descend to the heirs and successors of William and Mary they being Protestants...there is no question of bigotry or intolerance in this.  It is merely a fact that this great Catholic nation is going to accept the principle of the penal laws.... What were they passed for except to establish this Protestant Succession? The martyrdoms at Tyburn to what are they due?  Throughout this country you will see roofless monasteries and ruined and desecrated shrines&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here, unfortunately, he was pulled up by the non-sentimental Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I think that by a collector of specimens of human folly that speech would be regarded as a museum piece.  It certainly is one of the choicest specimens that I have ever come across.  In the first place, it is <Col N="2267" /> amazing that anyone at this time of day should try to turn the Irish question once more into a religious question.  It takes one's breath away that anyone should have such an ambition.</P>
    <P>It would be interesting to know in what country in the world the Catholic Church has more liberty than within the boundaries of the British Commonwealth or to what country Catholic missionaries look more readily and more successfully for protection in the hour of need.  The Minister's proposition that acceptance of the Crown is impossible for Catholics was exactly the principle alleged by those who supported the enforcement of the penal laws and denied by those who opposed them and if it was taken seriously to-day by the various Governments of the Commonwealth it would justify the immediate disfranchisement and persecution of Catholics throughout that Commonwealth. That was not the only remarkable thing about these observations of the Minister for Finance.  They constituted a severe rebuke to His Holiness the Pope who almost at that very moment was making a speech saying kind things about the British Commonwealth and was offering congratulations to the King of Great Britain on his jubilee.</P>
    <P>I suppose the head of Christendom must also be regarded as having accepted thereby the principle of the penal laws.  Or, again, is the Government not prepared under any circumstances to establish a Republic unless and until it can make that Republic effective over the whole of Ireland? The speech of Deputy Hugo Flinn in this House last December on the motion for the adjournment implied that it was not, and that to do such a thing would be unpardonable.  I have the speech here, but I do not think I need detain the House reading it.  He was quite explicit on the matter.  He said that to do such a thing as to tear away &mdash;I think that is how he described it&mdash; the Six Counties would be unpardonable, Can Deputy Hugo Flinn, however, be accepted as the authentic <Col N="2268" /> spokesman of the Government in this matter, and, if the only sort of Republic available is definitely ruled out, has not the nation a right to be told so by the President of the Executive Council?  I know that some at least of the Deputies opposite do not agree with Deputy Hugo Flinn but would like to see the Government seek authority at the next general election to establish a Republic over the area which we do control.  The majority of Government pronouncements, however, suggest that the policy is to establish a Republic&mdash;<i>de jure</i> for 32 Counties, but actually for 26 Counties.  When? At some mysterious point in the future to be determined by the Government itself.</P>
    <P>Now, this seems to me to ask quite a lot of the Irish people.  It seems to ask, indeed, a good deal more than the inconsistencies and ambiguities of the President and his colleagues would justify.  It is equally unsatisfactory to the I.R.A. and other activist organisations and to those of us who really care about abolishing Partition and about achieving good relations with the people across the water, and who realise the manifold domestic evils which flow from having the institutions of the State regarded as fragile and transitory.  From the Party point of view, unfortunately, this attitude of pontifical reserve on the part of the Government has one enormous advantage. It enables Fianna Fáil to go on, in <i>sæcula sæculorum</i>, calling themselves patriots and Republicans and their opponents West Britons and Imperialists.  I do put it to them, however, that the time has come when they might relinquish that Party advantage for the good of the country.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear about one thing. If this country is in the Commonwealth under duress, and against its own interests, there is no party in favour of continuing so in this country except the Party led by President de Valera&mdash; and, possibly, I might add, the Labour Party, if I am to regard as separate those eight stalwart pillars of the great twin causes of sham Republicanism and the Public Safety Act.  The only Party which would be prepared to keep this country in the Commonwealth under <Col N="2269" /> duress and against its interests, as they allege, is the Party which, 13 years ago, said that such duress must be resisted even at the cost of civil war.  With what face, then, can they plead duress to-day as an excuse for keeping this country suspended between the heaven of separation and the hell of the British connection?  Must we not say that the President uses all these reminiscences of the Treaty and British duress merely to torture himself and his colleagues and to maintain that fine frenzy which shuts out the pressure of realities?  It is time for Ministers to give up seavenging around for evidences of imaginary oppression.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude, Sir, on a note of conciliation.  Speaking in this House last June, on the Vote for the Department of External Affairs, I said that this country could come to no good until people in positions of responsibility had arrived at a common policy regarding our relations with Great Britain.  Everything in our national life is poisoned by this issue.  I believe that if we took the trouble to think, instead of blindly surrendering to a revolutionary current, we should find that we have far more in common than is usually imagined.  The object of this motion is not to make cheap Party scores.  Its object is to stimulate such thought as I have suggested, and I therefore commend it to the public spirit and good will of Deputies of all Parties.  If I have punctured or tried to puncture some pretentious shams and unrealities, it is easy to replace them by something better.  There are plenty of tasks worth doing, plenty of dragons in this country that really are worth fighting&mdash;intimidation, intolerance, ignorance, poverty, brutality, moral cowardice, personal spites, and racial antagonisms.  Our history has left Ireland, North and South, with more than her fair share of such evils. These are the real enemies of our country and I hope that some day we may be able to unite in driving them far from our shores.</P>

      <P>I am sure that all the Deputies in the House are interested in the terms of this motion.  The Deputy, as he was sitting down, said that he simply wanted to provoke thought.  I suggest that he would provoke thought and provoke a careful examination of the fundamental political position here in this country if he had tried to express his resolution in somewhat less offensive terms.  He says, in his motion, that &ldquo;in the opinion of the Dáil the Government ought either to abandon the pretence of Republicanism or&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Oh, I am sorry, the word is &ldquo;profession&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;they ought either to abandon the profession of Republicanism or to seek authority from the electorate for the immediate establishment of a Republic.&rdquo;  I used the word &ldquo;pretence&rdquo; because it has been used a great deal in this particular connection and, although the word &ldquo;profession&rdquo; is somewhat less objectionable, I think that for the ordinary person it carries more or less the same implication.  The first question is whether we are Republicans or not.  I do not care who questions the fact. Let them apply any test they like. Some of us&mdash;I would say practically every member on the Bench here&mdash; stood for the Republic as declared by the Irish people's representatives; stood for it when it was first proclaimed; took the risks that attached to soldiers who were fighting for it, and to-day have exactly the same ideals as they had when they first entered the movement.  They want to see established here a completely free Ireland and they believe that this country is not completely free until its freedom is expressed in the form of a Republic. Where is the pretence or profession about that?  Is there one member of the Executive Council who has not, by his efforts for the last 15 or 20 years, shown that he was sincere in desiring to see a Republic established here?  We have gentlemen on the opposite benches trying to pretend that there is something of a sham about this.  If I desire to see a thing done and if, at the <Col N="2271" /> moment, I have not the means to secure its being done, am I shamming, because I do the best for the time being to secure my desires?  Those on these benches desire to see the complete independence of this nation established and they are prepared to lead the nation in the establishment of it when they think there is the slightest prospect of success.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has suggested that there is some tremendous inconsistency between our present position and the position we took up some 13 years ago; a difference between our position and the position we adopted when we tried to maintain the Republic, even though the maintenance of it meant that we were forced into a civil war. We tried to maintain it in arms and we failed.  We are here because we failed then, and because we believe that we could not at the present moment make good our desires, and for no other reason.  Are we shams because we adopt that attitude?</P>
      <P>My first objection to this motion is that it is an offensive motion, prompted by a purely Party desire to try and make it appear to others, who are pretending that we are sham Republicans, that we are so, There is no inferiority complex here, so far as we are concerned anyhow, about Republicanism.  We believe that we are real republicans because we are taking the best means at our disposal at the moment to try to re-establish the Republic.  The Deputy says &ldquo;You must do it at once; it does not matter whether the time is ripe or unripe, propitious or otherwise, do it at once.&rdquo; Why?  Because he is in a state of mental distress; because he is distressed that there is a certain confusion which does not please his desire to have everything perfectly logical and mathematically straight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He shows the nonsense of the whole thing himself when he says: &ldquo;If there was a plebiscite, and if the majority of the people decided for a Republic, then we would suppress all talk about the Commonwealth connection and all the rest of it and accept the result.&rdquo; I suggest that in 1918 there was a <Col N="2272" /> plebiscite and that the Irish people then, even though they knew the declaration was going to involve grave consequences for them, even against the threat of force employed at the time, did decide.  That does not stop Deputy MacDermot and other people from questioning that decision and saying that we should have the test all over again.  Because there is a certain amount of mental distress on the part of Deputy MacDermot and others they want us to put it to the test again.  I suggest that they think it would be a rather good time for them, that their whole anxiety is that they might commit us at a time when they think that the majority might possibly have changed its mind.</P>
    <P>As far as getting any finality is concerned, I should like Deputy MacDermot to remember that there can never be finality about these questions.  Suppose to-morrow there were to be a plebiscite and the majority were to decide in favour of the acceptance of the Commonwealth&mdash;I am going to come to that afterwards and ask are you given the opportunity even of that &mdash;but suppose you were given the opportunity and you did decide, do you think that is going to end the question? Are there not going to be people here still who would think that this country's destinies would be best attained by cutting the connection? What is the purpose of saying that we are voluntarily associated, that we must have the right of secession, if there is to be finality?  He knows perfectly well that there can be no finality in that direction.  Nor, even though there would be a closer approximation to it, I believe, would there be any finality if you were to decide that you wanted to have an independent Republic?  We would have new events, new situations created, and under these new circumstances that I am imagining some Deputy MacDermot would come along and suggest that it was not in our interests to be isolated and separated and that it would be well for us to go back again.  Therefore, it is all nonsense to imagine that you can have, by a vote taken at any particular time, a decision which is going to cover the <Col N="2273" /> whole future and settle these questions. There is no definite finality in these things.  If anybody imagines there is and wants to get out of a distressful state of mind by having such a vote or such action taken, I want to disabuse him of any idea that there is finality in that.  But as between the two, as between a decision taken for complete independence and a decision which would lead the other way, to my mind there is no comparison whatever as to which would be the more final and lasting.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacDermot has not really dealt with the motion at all.  He has used the opportunity to talk a good deal about the material advantages of connection with the British Empire and of being a member of the British Commonwealth. He has stressed that. But the motion he has on the paper does not really deal with that at all. He has not told us why we should do it now any more than to suggest that there are a number of people like himself who are in a distressful strain of mind and would like to be relieved of that.  That is the only reason, in fact, that he has given.  He told us that it would settle a number of things here, that it would clarify politics and a number of things of that sort.  It would go a certain distance towards that, but I hope that nobody is so foolish as to think that doing something of the sort suggested here would finally end this matter.  It would not.</P>
    <P>Before I deal with his argument for connection, which is really, I think, not strictly in accord with this motion at all, I should like to deal with the motion more closely than Deputy MacDermot has dealt with it.  Why is it that we do not do exactly what he says?  Why do we not, as he has suggested, immediately declare a Republic?  Why are we waiting? The answer is that we believe that at the moment we could not make our desires effective.  That is the only answer.  Because we do not see at the moment a way of making our desires effective, are we to abandon completely the idea of ever obtaining a Republic?  If so, then the same argument could have been used in every generation in the past to show that <Col N="2274" /> Irishmen should abandon the idea of ever getting their complete freedom. All the arguments which have been suggested here to-night could have been applied in the past.  We do not, then, take the course which has been suggested and declare a Republic simply because at the moment we do not believe that we could make our desires effective.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Over any area at the moment.  I do not want, for instance, to see the British care and maintenance parties in our ports, and I want to see some means of getting them out.  I want to see, when we have a Republic here, a genuine effective Republic in which every inch of the whole of Ireland will be under the control of the Government selected by the Irish people.  Even for the Twenty-Six Counties I say that I want to see here every inch of the territory which we claim to govern under our control.  Because there are difficulties in the way Deputy MacDermot says: &ldquo;Oh, you should give up all attempt. Try to get yourself to believe that you would be happier with the bonds which you cannot get rid of than you would be if you were rid of them. Be happy in your chains.  Think they are good for you.&rdquo; But that has not been our attitude at any time.  The British, by the Treaty, have here in this country secured a certain position which they have secured by the threat of force and for no other reason.  We certainly will never be happy, never be contented and never be satisfied as long as they maintain that position and maintain it, as I hold, against the will of the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Why do you not have courage?&rdquo; Deputy MacDermot says; &ldquo;you have a perfect right to do all those things.&rdquo; Suppose we had an election to-morrow, and that question was before the Irish people, I wonder would Deputy MacDermot come along and tell the Irish people: &ldquo;You can declare your freedom; you can declare your independence here, even in the Twenty-Six Counties, as a Republic; you can do that without any type of retaliation by <Col N="2275" /> Britain&rdquo;?  Or would he, the moment we started the election campaign, do as was done on previous occasions by others, go and tell the Irish people: &ldquo;If you dare to assert your right in this particular matter, you are going to have British forces against you in one form or another&rdquo;?  They will not merely be telling the Irish people then of the material advantages which they will have to sacrifice.  They will tell them of another sort of thing.  They will directly suggest and threaten that if we take this action of asserting our independence and our rights we are going to have force of one kind or another used against us.  We will be told: &ldquo;We are a small, weak nation. We are beside a powerful neighbour who will, whenever its interests suggest it, come along and invade us.&rdquo; We have had it even here to-night. When the matter suggested itself to him Deputy MacDermot could not refrain from putting forward the argument that if we were independent we would be open to attack; not an attack from Germany, mind you; not an attack from France, but an attack from whom?  From a nation that could, he suggests, attack us with impunity, because an attack upon us was not going to threaten any other country and, therefore, no other country would be interested in our fate.  I suggest that the moment there was an election on this issue, until it was made quite clear to the Irish people that by taking this course they were not going to involve themselves in a position in which hostile action would be taken by Britain, we would have very different speeches from the type of speech which the Deputy suggested at the start would be made.</P>
    <P>When we came into this movement originally there was none of us, I hope, so foolish as to think that the achievement of our freedom was an easy matter.  If I wanted to, I could turn up hundreds of speeches from the first day on which I had anything to do with public life until to-day, showing that I pointed out all along the line that for a country like ours to win its freedom in its present position was a <Col N="2276" /> difficult task&mdash;a task that could only be accomplished by continuous effort and by patient and unrelaxing effort. Therefore, if we do not declare a Republic to-day or to-morrow, we are waiting for a time when we think there is a fair prospect of our being able to maintain it when it is declared.  I for one, whilst I should like to see another 1919 in the morning, do not want to see it followed by a 1921.  It is easy enough to declare and to take up a certain position.  It is not so easy to maintain it when it is declared, and I hope to goodness that the next time we take up a position we will not have a large section of those who urged us to take it up running away from it when it is taken up.  I am not blaming people for doing that.  I know the difficulties, and always knew the difficulties.</P>
    <P>What we are doing to-day by our attitude is this: We are pointing out that though we are in the British Commonwealth to-day we are not of it. We have done everything in our power to make that position clear.  We regard the Treaty which has been forced upon us as having no moral binding force.  We have said that in public, and have told the British Government that.  What we have been doing to the utmost of our strength is asserting on every possible occasion what the rights of the Irish people are, and doing our utmost at every point to maintain those rights, always within what we regard as the limit of our strength. We have pointed out then why it is that there is no rush at the moment, and why it is that we are not doing the things which two Parties desire us to do.  Two Parties desire us to do it. Is it in the interests of the ideas that we have, or is it simply because they think that it would be good politics to force us quickly into that position? I suggest that the Parties, whether they are on the Right or Left, who are urging us to take precipitate action in this matter are people who want us to do it simply because they believe it would be our undoing.  As I believe that the whole future of the country is bound up in the success of the policy of the present majority.  I for one, at <Col N="2277" /> any rate, am not going lightly, to be persuaded by the gentlemen who can have only one real purpose in doing so.  I certainly am not going to be pushed into that position by them and I do not think that any member of the Executive Council is going to be pushed into it either.  What is more, I believe the vast majority of the Irish people approve of our policy; know that we are genuinely anxious to secure for this country the maximum amount of freedom it can attain and that we are never going to be satisfied until full, complete freedom is obtained.  I believe the majority of the people realise that and the majority of the people approve of our actions and the methods we are adopting.  So much for the strict motion.</P>
    <P>Now, as for the merits.  Nobody is better pleased than I am that this question should be argued on its merits. I believe the more we argue it with ourselves and with others, the more we will be satisfied in the end that the best interests of this country will be served by securing our complete independence. As a first reason, I am perfectly satisfied that there never will be real peace amongst our people until that position is reached.  The same political factor which has disturbed us in the past, the same political factor which has put us in such relations, such unhappy relations, with Britain&mdash;that same position will continue until complete independence is reached.  You are not going to get our people at this time of the day to be led away by arguments which failed to impress them in the past.  There was a time when Ireland, with Great Britain, ruled this Empire.  We were partners in it, full partners in it, with full representation in it; every post was open to our people in it.</P>
    <P>The attractions of that position were such that we had a large section of the Irish people so attached to it that they fought every effort of the majority of the Irish nation to get out of it.  It was a position far above the position of being one of a number or group of co-equal States.  It was a position in which our people&mdash;I am talking now of <Col N="2278" /> our people apart from their nationality, apart from any national feeling&mdash;our people as a people, shared with the people of Britain the position of being at the head of that great Empire, at the head of it at a time when it was more powerful relatively than it is to-day, when it occupied a more commanding position in the world, when it had more advantages to offer to those who were in the partnership than it has to-day, and they rejected it.  I suggest that if the arguments of advantage were so powerful, the arguments which Deputy MacDermot put forth to-day, they would have affected our people then, but they did not.  Why Because they were in conflict with the fundamental idea of the people's nationality.  Deputy MacDermot will, no doubt, say: &ldquo;Oh, but that is just the difference between the position then and the position to-day.&rdquo;  Then we were absorbed, we were rapidly becoming indistinguishable from the people of Britain; we were being absorbed in this Empire, and there was no opportunity given to us for an expression of our nationality.</P>
    <P>The Deputy suggests that now there is full opportunity for an expression of our nationality.  I suggest that has to be determined by the sentiment of our people as a whole, and I differ fundamentally from Deputy MacDermot in this, that I believe the Dominion position, being inconsistent with the history of our people, will never satisfy completely the sentiment of our people. We are not a British colony. That is the fundamental fact in this situation.  We have fought for our independence.  We are not going to be satisfied until we get it.  That is the feeling of the vast majority of our people, and I believe it is going to persist.  I am satisfied that my judgment in that regard has a better background to suggest its probability than has the opinion that is suggested by Deputy MacDermot.  Hence I am satisfied that until we have got our independence, no matter what we may do with it afterwards, until we have won our independence, you are going to have a troubled political position here. Therefore, in order to get rid of that <Col N="2279" /> disturbing factor, no matter what the future may be, the moment we have an opportunity of making good and seeing that another 1921 did not follow another 1919, I think it would be right that we should declare the Republic, and I think if it were declared, then, after that, feeling that you were free and our people having got the feeling that the long centuries' fight was won, they would be in a position to examine on its merits any proposition of relationship or association that might be put up to them.  But until that position is won they are not going to be satisfied with the position in which they will have to accept the bonds that they dislike, in which they will have to accept them pretending that they are bonds which they would have imposed on themselves in any case.</P>
    <P>Fundamental, therefore, in this whole matter is the question of the sentiment of our people, the national sentiment of our people, and I differ with Deputy MacDermot in believing that that will ever be satisfied until there is complete independence.  From the point of view of the welfare of our people, the future welfare and content of our people, I want to see our independence established, no matter what we may do with it afterwards.  Deputy MacDermot posed here as if he were the only person who had ever considered any one of these questions, the only person who was bringing reason to bear, the only person who wants to examine these things on their merits and who does not want to take a political advantage of somebody who objects or holds a different point of view.  That is not true.  All these matters were debated very fully by a very strong political party here from 1916 to 1919. There is not an advantage that has been suggested by Deputy MacDermot that was not held out to our people at that time and, none the less, our people decided in an unequivocal manner.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacDermot thinks that after the passage of time perhaps our people may be prepared to revise and change their opinions.  I do not think so.  I have been closely in touch with our people during the whole period and I am satisfied, no matter what changes <Col N="2280" /> there may have been on the surface, that there is no change in the fundamental objective of our people, none whatever.  I saw that Deputy MacDermot was all wrong there when he was speaking.  There was not, so far as I could see, one of his colleagues on the Front Bench with him. I suggest to him that he should canvass his colleagues quietly and ask each one of them separately: &ldquo;Would you not prefer to be in the Commonwealth than to be completely independent as a Republic?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy MacEoin who seconded the motion.  He has reserved his speech.  I would like to hear, when he stands up, whether he is going to say that, now the circumstances have so altered and so changed, he thinks that if we could now reach the Republic he fought for and very nearly died for at one period, it would not be worth, as one former Minister said over here, raising his little finger to get it.  I hope I am not misjudging their views.  I think that if Deputy MacDermot tries to find out what is the feeling of the Irish people in this particular matter he will get it even by going amongst the members of his own Party and asking any of them, who in the past worked for the Republic, whether if they got a free chance of voting for it to-morrow, or voting for the Commonwealth, they would not be prepared to accept the Republic and take it even with all the material disadvantages which Deputy MacDermot suggests would be attached to it.</P>
    <P>I can only say then with regard to all the advantages that these and more, or as much, at any rate, were offered to the Irish people in the past and they resisted them all.  They preferred to continue to work for the independence which they desired.  I do not believe that you would get them to believe that to-morrow, even if it were offered to them, a position in the Commonwealth as a Dominion for the whole of Ireland would be regarded by them as a satisfaction of their national claims.  That is my view.  I have said more than once, I think, that while I see as clearly as <Col N="2281" /> Deputy MacDermot does the material advantages that could be derived I, with this country, would be prepared to face complete separation and isolation rather than face inclusion unless it was a position that was arrived at after the Irish people had secured and got acknowledgment of their complete right to be free.</P>
    <P>Now what has been the position of the Executive Council in this whole matter?  We tried, all of us who sit on these benches, to maintain the Republic because it had been established by the Irish people.  We tried to maintain it as long as it was possible to do it&mdash;as long, even, as there was a hope of doing it.  We failed to maintain it because the forces against us here at home were too great.  We tried then to get the Irish people to give us a majority, as our opponents had claimed to act in the name of the majority of the Irish people.  We asked the Irish people to give us a majority, and said that if we got a majority we would reproclaim and maintain the Republic that was declared in 1919 without coming to this Assembly at all.  That was the policy up to the time that we entered here.  Why did we change that?  Because our opponents here passed a law which made it impossible for anybody afterwards to go up for election unless they pledged themselves, when going forward as candidates, that if elected, they would come in here. There was no alternative left to us then but to come in here or try force. Believing that a further trial of force would be unsuccessful and disastrous for the country, we took the alternative and came in here.  The moment that we came in here we made up our minds that we would use to the full the position that we had here, and try to advance to the position that we believed was the position desired by the Irish people.  We have done that consistently.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacDermot has suggested that we have adopted a nagging policy in regard to Britain.  It has not been a nagging policy.  We have done one thing by it, and I suggest that it is a very important thing.  We have got people accustomed to the idea that there could be a free <Col N="2282" /> Ireland here which need not necessarily be inimical to England or to England's interests.  We have got the English people accustomed to the idea that there could be here beside them an independent people and a friendly people.  We have got them to see that it was not necessary that there should be the Oath to prevent us, as they had imagined, from cutting their throats some fine morning, or something of that sort.  We are gradually accustoming the British people to realise that there could be here an independent Ireland which will not necessarily be a menace to them.  That has been the view that we have held all the time.  We told the British people that they would be in a safer position with a free Ireland here beside them than they would be with an Ireland that was held by them by force.  They have not got accustomed to the idea completely yet.</P>
    <P>I, for one, have not lost hope.  I believe that I see signs of sanity coming to the people across the Irish Sea.  I believe they are beginning to see that they had pictured to themselves a completely false situation.  I said in one or two speeches that I believed we would have secured here in a very short time such a position that if you declared a Republic overnight it would be simply a mere formal declaration: that everything else would have been done in advance.  I suggest that that is not an unreasonable policy, because there would be less anxiety on the part of the British in the matter and less anxiety on the part of people like Deputy MacDermot here at home, and that would be all to the good.  So that this supposed unconsidered policy of ours has a background of reason behind it and a proper understanding.  I have suggested further, that what we were prepared to do in 1921 we are prepared to consider to-day.  At that time a united Republican Cabinet made it clear that to meet the sentiments of a certain section of our people we were prepared to consider some form of association, but that was based on a couple of provisos.  The fundamental thing was that it should be based on the unity of this country.  When <Col N="2283" /> people like Deputy MacDermot talk as if unity is immediately at our hands if we would only accept the Commonweath situation I would point out to him&mdash;I am sure he knows it full well&mdash; that when that position was about to be accepted before the unity of Ireland was not provided for in it: that when it was only a question of milk-and-water Home Rule even it did not secure the unity of the country.  In 1921, we said that we were prepared to make a settlement on the basis of the unity of Ireland: the unity of Ireland accepted and the rights of the majority, then, as far as it was possible, we would take cognisance of the sentiments of a certain minority of our people who wished to have some sort of association.  We said that on certain conditions, and one of the conditions was that any such proposed settlement should be submitted to the Irish people under such circumstances as would make it clear that their decision on the matter was a free decision: that they were at liberty to reject it or to accept it, and that there was no feeling of compulsion behind it.  I hope still.  Perhaps it is too much to hope for, to see a problem of this sort completely settled within a short time, even within our own lifetime. That may be foolish.  I would hope to see it within my own lifetime, but if I do not, as long as we lay the foundations that will make it possible for our successors, then I shall be happy.</P>
    <P>I feel that we have done our best in the circumstances and that, if we are not able to complete the building, we shall, at least, have put one good course upon it.  That is no mean achievement in the circumstances. Deputy MacDermot pretends that the unity of Ireland is available if we accept Commonwealth association.  I suggest that that is altogether false. There has been no suggestion of the kind.  When Lord Craigavon says something like that the Irish people may pay some attention to it&mdash;Lord Craigavon and the people with him, not the British Government, although Partition was the creation of the <Col N="2284" /> British Government and though I believe that if the British Government wanted to get rid of it to-morrow, they could.  Still, any suggestion by the British Government that they would bring that about would not be worth the snap of your fingers because the moment there was an attempt made to make the promise effective we would have the same happenings in the North that we had before and the British would tell us quietly in the end that they could not force or compel the people of Ulster, as they call it, to accept their view.  When the people near talk about the unity of Ireland&mdash;unity being held far away in front of us&mdash; to be based upon our attitude, they have sufficient sense, gathered from their experience, not to bother their heads about it.  When the people in the North and when Lord Craigavon talk in the strain in which Deputy MacDermot has spoken, then, perhaps, the Irish people will pay some attention, but, until that day arrives, it is vain for Deputy MacDermot and those who think with him to try to lure us away from the present position by saying that, by getting away from it, we shall bring Partition to an end. Nobody is now going to be fooled by that sort of talk.  We have too much experience to be fooled by it.  We might have believed it in 1917, 1918 or in 1919 but since 1921 we are not likely to believe it.  Of course, we were then the bad boys.  But for us, Lord Craigavon would have come in immediately and accepted the whole position.  I have never seen anything from Lord Craigavon or any of the people up here to suggest that there was any truth in that.  It was another good stone to throw at those who did not accept the Treaty, just as it is a good stone for Deputy MacDermot to fling at us and say: &ldquo;If you are not sham Republicans advance to the goal in the morning, immediately re-proclaim the Republic&rdquo; without any consideration of our power to maintain it.</P>
    <P>I should be glad to have all these things considered on their merits.  I do not think that anybody would suffer <Col N="2285" /> by that in any way.  I believe the more we talk about these things the better. I do not believe that discussion will weaken our will in the matter.  As regards this question being closed at any time.  If we were to regard this as a decided question, I suggest that the very argument which Deputy MacDermot has used would be used, if not by him, at least by some people in his Party or, perhaps, some Deputies like Deputy Thrift, who might possibly want to reverse the decision. If a decision were taken for a Republic, Deputy MacDermot suggests that he would not use any propaganda against it.  But there might be people like Deputy Thrift who would not feel quite like that.  Would he be able to keep him quiet if such a decision were arrived at?  Republicans have very good reason for saying that the matter was decided in 1918 in circumstances so decisive that they led to our taking a very definite step&mdash;a step which it would be extremely difficult to retreat from with national honour. A decision like that does make for strength of will and prevents vacillation and questioning as to whether or not you are on the right road.  There is such a thing as considering a matter calmly, quietly and fully once and for all, particularly when there is a large body of people in question.  When a decision is taken, it should be acted upon unless there is a new factor introduced which completely changes the situation.  There is steadiness and continuity secured by going ahead when a decision is arrived at, not hesitating and looking back and asking if you are on the right road.  From the point of view of practical success and material progress, it is advisable that we should not be asking ourselves every day whether or not we are on the right road.</P>
    <P>If Deputy MacDermot wants to talk about this matter in the country, he is at full liberty to do so.  Perhaps I may take advantage of this opportunity to say that everybody in this country is free to advocate any political opinions he chooses and that any suggestion that there is coercion or any obstacle to freedom of speech is <Col N="2286" /> not true.  Full liberty of speech is allowed.  One thing is not allowed and cannot be allowed&mdash;that is, the advocacy of the use of force against the Government elected by the majority of the Irish people.  The position is not the same as it was some years ago&mdash;as it was, for instance, when the test to which I referred was put up and we were given the alternative either of coming in here under conditions which, though we accepted them, we regarded as humiliating, or else going out and using force.  There is no such position to-day.  People can go and advocate whatever opinions they like.  There is full liberty of speech for every section and, with that full liberty, I hold that we should have finished now with threats of force.  As long as he does not try to build up an organisation which would fall back on the use of force, Deputy MacDermot can go out and talk about the Commonwealth as much as he pleases.  Similarly, those who call themselves the real republicans and who call us sham republicans can go out and preach their doctrines to the Irish people. They can suggest to the Irish people that Deputy MacDermot is right and that we should declare a Republic at once and get done with it.  Let them go out in that way and, if they get a majority, they will probably find that some of the people in the past who stood for the State set up by the Irish people will again not be wanting when the time comes.  But theirs is not our policy.  We, also, shall go to the Irish people.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>This morning I asked the Minister for Lands a question in connection with a parcel of land allotted to a small farmer named John Rawl, of Drumnacross, Moatefarrell, Edgeworthstown, on an estate known as the McDowell Hollinshead, and on another estate in Drumnacross, Longford. I asked the Minister if the Land Commission had received a letter from <Col N="2287" /> Mr. Rawl saying that he was prepared to surrender the portion of land allotted to him on condition that it was reallotted to the McDowell family.  The Parliamentary Secretary denied the receipt of such a letter.  I also asked him if Mr. Rawl made application for any other portion of land in the district and he said &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; but that as Mr. Rawl had been allotted a portion of land on the McDowell Hollinshead estate none was granted to him on the Bond estate in Newtownbond. I then asked him a further question if he proposed to migrate Mr. Rawl from that district, and he said that the matter was not considered.</P>
      <P>Of course, it was quite obvious that there must be reasons why I asked these particular questions, and with your permission, Sir, I wish to put this case to the Parliamentary Secretary for Lands in the following manner: Mr. Rawl is a small farmer living on an uneconomic holding in a rather congested area in North Longford, not far from the village of Ballinalee.  His holding is on or adjoining this farm of McDowell Hollinshead.  Some years ago the Moatefarrell farm was about to be divided, and Mr. Rawl made application for a portion of land there.  For some reason or other his application was not granted.  He then made application for a portion of the estate of Ballyhoolivan, but he did not get any allotment.  For some reason or other the Land Commission acquired the estate known as the McDowell Hollinshead estate.  Mr. Rawl never made any application whatever for any portion of these lands.  But the Land Commission, having inspected and acquired that estate, invited Mr. Rawl to accept a portion.  Mr. Rawl refused to accept unless those in possession were in agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purpose of finding out whether the family of McDowell were in agreement or not, the Land Comission Inspector saw Mr. McDowell.  Mr. McDowell objected to anybody getting portion of these lands which the Land Commission had acquired.  Mr. Rawl there and then refused to accept the portion offered him.  At a later stage, that is nearly 12 months afterwards, <Col N="2288" /> the Land Commission inspector or somebody on their behalf invited Mr. Rawl again and the same routine took place.  Then Mr. Rawl and the inspector saw Mr. John McDowell.  The family were agreeable to Mr. Rawl acquiring portion of the land and there and then both signed an agreement for the repurchase of the holding.  I want it to be understood that at no time did Mr. Rawl make application for that portion of land.  In other words, by agreeing to accept this parcel of land Mr. Rawl was assisting the Land Commission and was assisting the McDowell family, in so far as by agreeing to take it he was preserving for the McDowell family their home and portion of the land.</P>
    <P>After he had signed the agreement an agitation sprang up to compel him to surrender the land.  If you will recollect, Sir, some time ago I asked a question in connection with it and everything seemed satisfactory.  The local Fianna Fáil club took the matter up and for very good reasons I believe dropped it, and did not take any further part in the matter.  But like a lot of things when once started it is hard to stop and another organisation was invited to take part in the campaign. The result was that North Longford was posted all over with posters declaring that a meeting would be held and would be addressed by certain people and that the people of North Longford would be informed of what these people thought of Mr. Rawl's action in acquiring portion of the estate.  No action was taken officially in connection with the matter but a number of people congregated in the vicinity of Mr. Rawl's home.</P>
    <P>However, the net result of the meet ing was that Mr. Rawl agreed to surrender the land on condition that the McDowell family would get it.  He agreed under compulsion, notwithstanding that he wanted the land as he is a small farmer on an uneconomic holding.  He surrendered the land on that condition&mdash;that the McDowell family would get it but he was not prepared to surrender the land for the benefit of anybody else.  If the Land Commission were going to give the <Col N="2289" /> lands to anybody he thought it should be to the McDowell family or to himself. After some days Mr. Rawl received a receivable order and a demand for his annuity.  He returned that receivable order with a letter accompanying it pointing out that he never had possession of the lands; that they were unfenced and that in view of the opposition that had arisen to him in the district he was prepared to surrender the lands on condition that they were given to the McDowell family.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesVictory" hpid="Mr. Victory Mr. Victory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Victory</NameTxt>
      <P>Is he not grazing that land for the last seven or eight years?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, Deputy Victory can go and look at it and see whether Mr. Rawl grazes it himself or not.  The Deputy butted into this matter, but the Ballinalee Fianna Fáil Club who took it up ran away from it. At any rate Mr. Rawl got no reply to that letter.  Then the fences were put up but immediately after they were cut down by some people whom I do not know.  I am not going to say who they are.  I say that because I am half inclined to think that the second association that came into this matter dropped it and did not take any further part since then.  I am not quite sure of that but anyhow it seems that Mr. Rawl's decision to surrender the land on condition that it was given to the McDowell family seemed to satisfy them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Still, however, Mr. Rawl has never had possession of the land, and the only reply that he received to that letter of his, returning the receivable order, was a sheriff's notice some weeks ago to pay within 31 days or there would be a distraint.  That places him in a very unfortunate position. He is a man who has always paid his rent and rates and, as far as I am aware, has his rent and rates paid on his present holding.  He is an ideal type of man, hard-working, and he feels that if he surrenders this land altogether, as has been suggested to him, without condition, it would militate against his ever getting any land again from the Land Commission. Whether that is right or wrong I do <Col N="2290" /> not know, but that is his point of view.  In discussion with me, however, he said that he was prepared to do anything that the Land Commission thought well, and to show that he was agreeable to any decision they might take he said that he was prepared to accept alternatively the piece of the Newtownbond estate which he did not get or, alternatively, that he was prepared to become a migrant.</P>
    <P>In view of all the circumstances&mdash; and I know that the Land Commission are aware of the fact that I am not overstressing the case, because there are difficulties to which I do not wish to give expression and there are some dangers to which, again, I do not wish to give public expression&mdash;but the Land Commission are aware of these facts and, considering all that, I think that the Land Commission should give Mr. Rawl an alternative piece of land somewhere else or migrate him, when he is willing to go.  Of course, it may be argued that if they do that now it will be because there was pressure brought to bear on them.  I think that, in the circumstances, they could ignore that particular line of thought and that, in the interests of peace and harmony in the district and in justice to Mr. Rawl, they should treat him generously.  I suggest that they could do so by either allotting him a portion elsewhere or migrating him or keeping him in mind for the next division of an estate, wherever it may be, in the district.</P>
    <P>I am not trying to charge the Land Commission with neglect in any particular way, except just the one point that there was a considerable delay in the fencing.  I think that if the fencing had taken place a little bit sooner a lot of this trouble could have been avoided.  I do not want, however, to charge the Land Commission with doing anything that should not have been done.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Sir, through you, to say that he will consider that matter along the line of thought I have suggested to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands (Mr. O'Grady)</NameTxt>
      <P>This unfortunate case has a very bad history. <Col N="2291" /> As Deputy MacEoin has pointed out, or, at least, as I could infer from his remarks, the McDowell people seem to have forfeited their right and title to these lands, and, far from the Land Commission having maltreated them or not given them fair and due consideration, what happened was that in 1922 a certain sum of money was advanced for the purchase of this holding.  During the ten years that followed, the McDowells never paid one cent in respect of that advance.  In the meantime, the tenant had gone into bankruptcy and the Land Commission could not obtain payment of the annuity for all these years.  Subsequently&mdash;I think it was in 1930&mdash;the Land Commission made an offer to the Official Assignee in Bankruptcy consequent upon which eventually they agreed to appoint the elder McDowell, the son of the former tenant, to become the new tenant of approximately two-thirds of the old holding and made an offer of 15½ acres to Mr. Rawl.  Both agreements were signed on 14th of April, 1934, and Mr. Rawl was then given possession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position of the Land Commission is that they are prepared to give whatever protection he requires to Mr. Rawl to hold and work his holding, but neither the Land Commission nor the State, as such, can surrender to any organisation or any agitators in the district who may get up a similar agitation. What would be the position all over the country if the Land Commission were to be weak enough to surrender to similar agitations cropping <Col N="2292" /> up all over the country?  If they were to surrender to such agitations, the last position would be worse than the first. It is no wonder that the various organisations to which Mr. McDowell turned for sympathy all turned him down, as Deputy MacEoin has pointed out, because no organisation or no self-respecting man could stand over McDowell in the agitation he is seeking to create.  The Land Commission had no option but to insist on the annuity payable on these lands both by Mr. McDowell, junior, and by Mr. Rawl. As I have stated, any protection which is needed will be adequately given.  I do not think there is anything further that I have to say on the matter.</P>

      <P>The charge was made against Mr. Rawl that he applied for this particular land, and I think that the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that he did not apply for this land but for a portion of land elsewhere. This, however, became available and was offered to him.  The application he sent in was for the Moatefarrell land, although the charge was made against him that he actually applied for this land.</P>
