      <NameTxt>Major Myles</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state the amount of agricultural grants, etc., withheld from the Donegal County Council for the current year and the reasons for withholding these grants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Seán T. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>A sum of £50,289 is unissued in respect of the share of Donegal County in the agricultural grant.  I am sending to the Deputy a copy of a circular letter issued to the County Council on the 17th ultimo dealing with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesSprouleMyles" hpid="Major Myles Major Myles">
      <NameTxt>Major Myles</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider, in the interests of local government throughout the country, the great hardship it is to county councils to have this money withheld from them, and would he consider the advisability of introducing legislation that will remove that burden?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Seán T.O. Ceallaigh Seán T.O. Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Seán T.O. Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be glad of anything that would facilitate the county councils in this matter.  The alteration of legislation, however, does not lie with the Minister for Local Government and Public Health alone. The Minister for Finance would have something to say to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesSprouleMyles" hpid="Major Myles Major Myles">
      <NameTxt>Major Myles</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would pass that on to his colleague the Minister for Finance.  We must all recognise the tremendous hardship, particularly at the present time, it is to every county council to have these moneys withheld.  Councils <Col N="1956" /> when looking for an extension of their bank balances find that bank managers are drawing longer faces than ever.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state the number of consultative councils established up to date under Section 19 of the Local Government Act, 1925, the composition of the councils so established, and the extent to which they have been consulted in connection with matters affecting the health of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Seán T. O Ceallaigh Seán T. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Seán T. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>No consultative council has yet been established.  It is, however, the custom of the Department to consult informally the various medical, nursing and other organisations interested in public health administration.  The establishment of the Hospitals Commission put at the disposal of the Department an advisory body dealing with important branches of medical organisation.  The unification of approved societies has rendered the creation of a consultative body in connection with insurance less urgent.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether representations were made to him by any of the existing trade boards that the present inspection arrangements are not adequate to secure effective enforcement of the board's determinations, whether it is a fact that in the case of the trades covered by one board at least, only 5 per cent. of the premises affected were inspected last year and whether in the cases inspected a substantial number of the employers concerned were found not to have complied with the determinations of the trade board; and if it is his intention to make provision at an early date for more effective inspection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Representations have been made to me by some of the existing trade boards in respect of present inspection arrangements.  It is not a fact that, in the case of any trade covered by a trade board, inspection was as low as 5 per cent. last year.  In the case of firms coming under the trade board determinations it was discovered that a number of the employers had not complied with the determinations of the trade boards and necessary action was taken to enforce compliance.  Inspection services were adversely affected over a certain period by the general pressure of work in my Department but this is being remedied as rapidly as possible.</P>

In addition, under special arrangements which I have made 4,210 of these appeal cases have been reviewed by unemployment assistance officers and qualification certificates more favourable to the applicants issued in 3,010 cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No slow motion procedure has been adopted.  The Deputy must remember that these are cases in which, in the opinion of the unemployment assistance officer concerned, the applicants are not entitled to assistance, and in which the applicants are exercising their right of appealing against that determination by the unemployment assistance officer.  The procedure laid down by the Act itself, however, is being dealt with as rapidly as possible.  It must be remembered that every single person who applied for a certificate and was refused a certificate exercised his right of appeal because it cost him nothing to do so. It was inevitable that that would take place, and the appeals are being dealt with as rapidly as possible so far as the procedure, as laid down by the Act, allows.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister say whether or not it is possible for him to find some additional machinery for accelerating these appeals?  I understand that there is only one Appeals Committee, and while there may be certain subsidiary committees or certain machinery since created for dealing with some kind of appeals, the fact that there is only one Appeals Committee is choking the whole machine.  Would the Minister consider the setting up, by means of an amending Act, of a number of appeals committees?  It is not much consolation for an applicant to know that he will have to wait for two years to have his appeal considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Minister's answer indicates that most <Col N="1963" /> of the appeals on the question of means have been successful, taking roughly the figures he has given us. In view of his statement that the consideration of the remainder of the appeals will probably take a period of two years, does he not consider that it is a terrible injustice and that it defeats the purpose of the Act entirely, particularly in view of the fact that no payments of arrears are made to the people when their appeals are successful?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest to the Minister that in the cases already dealt with he would probably find a precedent for dealing with the cases still outstanding&mdash;I mean that he would probably find a guide in the cases already established which could be applied in bulk to the 22,000 cases still unheard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is being done. The appeals are being considered in the light of decisions already made. In some 4,000 cases new decisions by the unemployment assistance officers have been given following the precedents laid down by the Appeals Committee; but, of course, these appeals still appear nominally as awaiting decision, although, in fact, the applicants have received the benefit of the appeal procedure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the number of appeals to the Unemployment Appeals Committee under the <Col N="1964" /> Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933, now awaiting decision; the number of such appeals which were lodged prior to November 1st, 1934, and the approximate date on which the appeals now pending will be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of appeals against either the refusal of an application for a qualification certificate or against the determination of the applicant's weekly rate of means, corresponding to the annual rate calculated in accordance with the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933, which await decision by the Unemployment Appeals Committee on the 11th February, 1935, was 26,624.  Of these 17,718 were lodged prior to the 3rd November, 1934. Having regard to the difficult nature of the questions involved and to the fact that the decisions of the Committee are final, progress is necessarily slow and the Unemployment Appeals Committee are unable to fix a time within which the appeals now pending can be disposed of.  Under special arrangements made by me, cases in which appeals have been lodged are pending the consideration and decision of the appeals by the Unemployment Appeals Committee, being reconsidered by unemployment assistance officers and where the facts so warrant revised decisions, favourable to the applicants given.  Under these arrangements over 4,000 of those cases under appeal have been reviewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister is not able to indicate an approximate date when these appeals will be decided, and since he has indicated in the answer to Question 7 that some of them will take two years, will he bring that fact to the notice of the Executive Council and cause some instructions to be issued to boards of health to the effect that some of these applicants are likely to be without benefit for two years?  My reason for that is that it is the experience of Deputies on all sides of the House that, where applicants are eligible for this unemployment assistance, boards of health are not paying them home assistance. It appears now that some of them are going to have to hold on for two years.</P>

      <P>The approval of the Executive Council to the personnel of the Committee of Inquiry into Resignations and Dismissals from the Royal Irish Constabulary was given on the 17th January, 1934.  The number of applications received by the Committee is 332.  The Committee have not presented an interim report, and I am not aware of the precise number of cases which now <Col N="1967" /> remain to be dealt with by them.  I understand, however, that they have almost completed their investigations and that they intend to present a report covering all the claims submitted to them, at a very early date.  Every effort is being made by the Committee to expedite the completion of the inquiries outstanding.  Many of the cases have proved very troublesome, and, in a very large percentage, the Committee have found it necessary to make independent inquiries as to the veracity of the applicants' statements and as to the value which might be attached to recommendations submitted on their behalf. It will be appreciated that, in view of the time which has elapsed since the resignations and dismissals, independent investigation has been very difficult.</P>
      <P>With regard to the last part of your question, individual applicants will be informed of the decisions in their cases with as little delay as possible after the Committee have presented their report.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether it is a fact that the Industrial Trust Company of Ireland, Ltd., was established in 1925 with a subscribed capital of £162,827 of which the Government provided a sum of £50,000; whether certain members of the board of directors of the company were nominated by or elected as representing the Government and, if so, whether in that capacity such directors informed the Government that the company invested from time to time substantial sums of money outside Ireland in speculative enterprises; whether arising out of these transactions the company incurred losses amounting to £151,396; whether steps were taken by the Government to safeguard its interests in the company and whether the whole or any portion of the sum of £50,000 originally provided by the Government is now recoverable.</P>

      <P>The Industrial Trust Company of Ireland, Ltd., was established in 1925 with a subscribed capital <Col N="1968" /> of £162,827 in ordinary shares of £1 each, £50,000 of which were taken by the Government and held in the name of the Minister for Finance.  Two of the members of the then existing board of directors of the company were nominated by the Minister for Finance to act as his representatives on the board.  In that capacity they furnished annual reports on the policy of the company towards Irish investments and, in particular, on the work of the company with regard to loans guaranteed under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts; they made no report on the other work of the company and no information was at first furnished to the Minister regarding the nature of the investments held other than that made available to all shareholders at the company's annual meetings.  The liquidator of the company reports that the total net loss incurred on realisation of investments amounts to £157,396.  From the time that it became apparent that the company was likely to be in financial difficulties, my Department has had the position under review and has taken all possible steps to safeguard all the interests involved.  In this connection, however, it should be appreciated that, apart from the right of nominating two directors of the board, the Minister for Finance was in this case only an ordinary shareholder and, as such, his rights were limited to those conferred on shareholders by the Companies Acts and by the articles of association of the company.  I am not yet in a position to state what part, if any, of the original investment of £50,000 will be recoverable.  The report of the liquidator is being examined and the extraordinary general meeting to consider his report and accounts has been adjourned until the 29th of March next.  I should, accordingly, be glad if this portion of the question were deferred.</P>

      <P>In the prospectus on the basis of which the ordinary shares of the Industrial Trust Company of Ireland, Ltd., were offered for subscription it was stated that the Irish Free State Government had agreed to seek power to subscribe for 50,000 £1 shares in the company.  Apart from this, no representations appear to have been made to the investing public that the Government had any special interest in the company, that it would control or direct its policy, or that any legal or moral guarantee for the safety of the company's capital was being given by the Government. No authority was given by the Government to any person at any time to make such representations; and, accordingly, it is not seen how the Government can be called upon to indemnify investors against any loss they may have incurred as a result of the winding-up of the affairs of the company.</P>

      <P>One complaint, in general terms, as to illegal trawling in Donegal Bay has reached me during the past three months.  The latest visit of the fishery cruiser to that area was in the period between the 6th and 11th instant, during which the place was thoroughly patrolled.  I am determined to do the utmost possible with the means at my disposal to prevent breaches of the fishery laws and regulations on our coasts.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that the protection is absolutely insufficient?  Would he endeavour to institute some system whereby information can be passed on to headquarters when trawlers are discovered trawling illegally?  It is well known that in Donegal when the fishery cruiser had gone out of sight, the trawlers came in broad daylight and carried on illegal trawling.  It is very difficult to get the information passed on to the patrol boat's headquarters.  Will the Minister institute some system whereby the minute the trawler is seen fishing illegally, the office in Dublin will be notified and adequate steps taken?</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 4&rdquo;:</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 15 a new section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>15. &mdash;(1)  Whenever a fishery or a fishing right is acquired (whether compulsorily or by agreement) by the Board under this Act, every person who proves to the satisfaction of the Board or of the arbitrator all the following matters that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  that during the whole on substantially the whole of each of the three complete open fishing seasons next before such acquisition, he was constantly and regularly employed at a weekly wage in or about the working on such fishery or the exercise of such fishing right, and</P>
      <P>(b)  that he was so employed by a person or the predecessor in title of a person entitled to receive the price or a portion of the price payable by the Board in respect of such acquisition, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  that the wages received by him in respect of such employment formed the whole or a substantial <Col N="1981" /> part of his livelihood while he was so employed, and</P>
    <P>(d)  that his said employment related exclusively to the working of such fishery or the exercise of such fishing right, and</P>
    <P>(e)  that he was not regularly employed outside the open fishing season by the person by whom he was so employed during the open fishing season,</P>
    <P>shall (subject to the provisions of this section) be entitled to be paid by the Board compensation in respect of his loss of employment by reason of the said acquisition of such fishery or fishing right by the Board.</P>
    <P>(2)  The compensation payable to any person under this section shall be calculated as follows, that is to say, for every complete open fishing season during which such person complied with all the conditions mentioned in the next preceding sub-section of this section, such person shall receive a sum equal to four times the average weekly wage received by such person in respect of such employment during the complete fishing season next before the said acquisition of the said fishery or fishing right by the Board, but subject to the overriding limitation that such compensation shall not in any case exceed 52 times the said average weekly wage.</P>
    <P>(3)  A person shall not be entitled to any compensation under this section in relation to the acquisition of a fishery or a fishing right by the Board where it is shown to the satisfaction of the arbitrator that by reason of an undertaking by the Board to continue the employment of such person or for any other reason such person will suffer no loss or diminution of employment in consequence of such acquisition.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to provide for the payment of compensation to certain fishery employees who may lose their employment in consequence of the acquisition of fisheries by the Electricity Supply Board under the provisions of the Bill.  The amendment provides that to qualify for compensation an <Col N="1982" /> employee must have been employed for the whole or substantially the whole of three complete open fishing seasons before the date of acquisition; that he was employed by a person entitled to receive the acquisition price; and that the remuneration received by him for his work formed the whole or a substantial part of his livelihood.  In such cases compensation is payable upon the basis indicated, that is, a sum equal to four times the average weekly wage for each complete open fishing season for which the person was employed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that one of the principal fisheries which will be affected evidently by this amendment&mdash;the Lax Weir fishery &mdash;is not at present working and if the section is to be strictly enforced men who have been operating there for 30, 35 and 40 years may be debarred from getting compensation because of the fact that the fishery company does not propose to operate this season.  I suggest that this is a matter that ought to be taken into consideration, if at all possible, as there are, roughly, 30 or 40 men affected.  Owing to reasons over which the men have no control, namely, the company's own reasons, they have not fished so far this season and the company have indicated that they do not intend to fish.  It would be unfair, therefore, that the men should be debarred from getting any compensation because of this action at the last moment on the part of the company, who will themselves be getting adequate compensation either in the shape of compensation for the loss of the fisheries already, or for acquisition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment sets out that operation over three whole seasons is to be taken into consideration and in compensating the men the average of their working over that period should be taken rather than the working in the season immediately preceding acquisition.  It is set out in the amendment that they must have worked in three seasons; but in fixing compensation at four times their wages at a particular time it is to be deter <Col N="1983" /> mined for such time as they worked during the last season before acquisition. I may also say that last year was a particularly bad season for them.  The Lax Weir Company decided not to operate for the full term of six months&mdash;they only operated for nine or ten weeks.  These men have been working for 40 years for six months at a time and are now going to be robbed of their livelihood and will be debarred from compensation owing to the action of the company in not giving work this year and not working for the complete term last year.  It is a matter of the interpretation of the section; and I ask the Minister to see that a generous interpretation is given to it.</P>
    <P>I also ask the Minister to consider the possibility of compensating the Castleconnell fishermen.  I admit that they are not affected by this Bill, but the men have lost their employment and will be debarred from compensation because they have not been employed since the fishing was closed down by the diversion of the waters into the head-race of the canal.  The owners of the fisheries, consisting of eight men at Castleconnell, are being compensated; but the men who were doing the fishing have not got one penny of compensation and they will never get employment there as rod-fishing is definitely finished for all time at Castleconnell.  The Minister should find some means of providing some little compensation for these men in respect of the five years' wages they have lost and for the fact that they will not get employment any more. Whether it is statutory or not, I believe that in justice to these men some effort should be made to provide compensation for them and allow this whole scheme to be placed on a harmonious basis so as to leave no friction behind, because these men have reason to be aggrieved when they see the owners getting adequate compensation while they are ruthlessly set aside and no provision is made for compensating them.  I, therefore, ask the Minister to consider the matter carefully and see if there is any possibility of doing justice to these men.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the Lax Weir men are concerned, the Deputy's mind can be at rest.  The basis of the compensation is that a man was employed during the whole of the three complete open fishing seasons next before the date of acquisition.  This Bill will, presumably, become law in the course of a week and the acquisition of the Lax Weir fishery will take place at once because there is no difficulty as the arbitrator has already determined the price of acquisition and it is only a matter of formality to complete the transaction, in which case the basis of compensation will be, of course, employment in the season of last year and the two previous years.</P>
      <P>I am afraid that it is not possible to do anything in the case of the other men.  They have been out of employment for five years and the circumstances under which they lost their employment did not arise out of this measure.  They arose out of the construction and operation of the Shannon Scheme and their loss of employment commenced from the year 1929 onwards.  To attempt to go back over all these cases and assess and award compensation would be an impossible task and would open up a very wide field which it would be impossible to cover.  The only thing I can tell the Deputy is that the Board will, so far as possible, having regard to the obligations to the men who may be directly disemployed, endeavour to provide employment for these men in connection with fishery work.</P>

      <P>The Minister dealt briefly with this matter yesterday, and when questioned by Deputy MacDermot as to the effect on the revenue generally of the operations of these various quota orders, in respect to the motor industry, he said he did not know what the effect was going to be.  The Minister pretends to the House that he is dealing systematically and effectively with the establishment of the motor assembly industry here, but he declines, as I stated when dealing with the other orders, to give the House any information with regard to it.  The position with regard to imported motor cars, taking the years 1929, 1930 to 1931, is that the number of touring cars imported in 1929 was 7,627; in 1930, 7,560, and in 1931, 7,333.  When Fianna Fáil policy hit <Col N="1987" /> this country in 1932 that was reflected in the import of motor cars, only 2,903 being imported in that year as against over 7,000 in each of the previous three years.</P>

The Minister is obviously developing the motor industry here, but the policy of the Government is creating a situation whereby the people are less able to use motor cars.  The price that the people have to pay for these cars is infinitely greater than they have to pay in the Six Counties.  The total employment the Minister considers can be given in the motor car industry here amounts to 1,000 persons, but there is going to be a definite drop in the revenue. Without having seen the Orders, the Minister asks the House to pass resolutions empowering him to go blindly along the path he is travelling, without getting any information as to the number of cars likely to be used, the cost of these cars here, and the effect on the revenue.  The Minister may claim that he does not know what is going to happen under some of these headings. Again, where it was possible for other Ministers to give certain information when asked for it, he systematically refused to give it.  When asked yesterday what the effect was going to be on the revenue, he said he could not say. The Minister for Finance approached the matter in a different spirit, but he may not be fighting the same corner. When replying to a question yesterday with regard to motor cars, the Minister for Finance said the duty in 1933 was £150,397, in 1934, £162,302 and for three months, approximately from the 20th October to the 31st January, 1935, £23,000.  At that rate, for the whole year the duty would approximate to £82,000, and it is an indication that the full amount of duty on motor cars <Col N="1988" /> imported would be half what it was last year.  The Minister implied that he hopes to wipe out the whole of that, so that on the import of motor cars alone this policy was going to cost the revenue £162,000.</P>

      <P>I am quite sure the House, when discussing this in a constructive spirit, would like to hear something from the Minister for Industry and Commerce on that matter. When invited to deal with it yesterday, he declined to say anything about it. The Minister for Finance, in reply to a question, stated that the total duty received on completely assembled chassis in 1933 was £53,557, and in 1934, £39,890.  At the present rate the prospective yield for this year would be about £10,800, so that £26,000 less would go to the revenue on the importation of chassis during the current year.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce hopes to wipe out all that; hopes to take the whole £37,000 from the revenue receipts under that heading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then a smaller amount, something not exceeding £1,000, is going to be lost to the revenue when the whole of this matter is worked out under Quota Order No. 10.  The motor-car assembling industry is of importance to this country.  No one will deny that the mechanical and technical work connected with it is a valuable kind of work to have done here.  It is valuable for our people to get an opportunity of putting their hands to that particular class of work, so that they may spread from that to other classes of work, but it is definitely unfair to the future of the industry which has been started that the Minister should treat the subject in this way.  He has had it definitely put to him here&mdash;and there is no doubt that he has also had it put to him privately&mdash;that some of the industry which has been started under his fosterage in this way is not likely to last economically; that greater costs are going to be paid for cars; that, even with those greater costs, the capital involved in setting up some part of this industry is not going to be recouped, and then there is this substantial loss to the revenue which is <Col N="1989" /> indicated here, at a time when every action of the Government in handling money shows that the revenue is not in a satisfactory position.  As I say, the discussion on this matter is restricted to this particular type of discussion.  It is embarked on without any of the orders being in the hands of any Deputies of the House, and without any general statement of policy or any simple statement of fact placed before them by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He has dealt with the matter in a very reckless and irresponsible way, and his attitude to the House is nothing but an insolent one.</P>

      <P>I suppose nothing is going to prevent Deputy Mulcahy from forcing a division on this resolution, as he did on similar resolutions yesterday, but, before we divide, some of us would like to be quite certain as to what we are going to vote on.  What is Deputy Mulcahy's particular grievance? Is he quite sure of his ground when he says that the capital which is being invested in motor-car assembly is in danger, that it is not going to be remunerative, and that those enterprises are not on a sure foundation? Has he had any communication with the people who have embarked on this line of development to justify him in making such a statement?  I think if he inquires from the people who have gone into that business he will find that they have no nervousness whatever, and that as a matter of fact they would not be at all agreeable to a return to the system of importing complete cars in preference to assembling the cars here as they are now doing.  He talks of recklessness on the part of the Government, but I suggest that he himself should be more careful than to make such reckless statements as those.</P>

      <P>Does the Deputy not understand that the attitude of the people who have been engaged in the motor industry here, and who have been trying to keep pace with the <Col N="1990" /> Minister in respect of those orders is: &ldquo;Oh, for God's sake let the Minister alone at the moment to do what he is at now.  He has been shifting and twisting and turning, going in seven different directions at the same time Now he has pinned himself down to one particular direction which he is likely to be able to stay in for a year or two.

      <P>Has he authority from Messrs. O'Neill, Summerfield, McCairns or McEntaggart?  I think these are the principal firms engaged in the business at the moment.  I am sure that if he went to them for support for the daring statement which he has made he would get a very cool reception.  Again, when he says that the prices of the cars have been increased as a result of this development, is he quite sure of his ground?  As a matter of fact, the first car which was assembled was selling at a lower price than that at which the same model was being sold in Great Britain and that may be so still.  I can tell him further, and he should be glad to hear it, that the directors, having seen the models that have been turned out here, expressed their complete surprise that such splendid work could be done in this country, especially at the start off.  What then is the Deputy's grievance?  He wants to know about the employment that is to be given. Some of those firms have only just gone into production.  In the case of some of them their premises are not yet complete. How can the Minister or anybody <Col N="1991" /> else state what the employment is going to be, or conjecture what the demand is going to be during the present year?  If the country is bankrupt, as the Deputy suggests, no doubt there will be very few cars sold, but that is not the expectation of those who are assembling the cars.  The state of their business generally does not at all indicate that there are going to be no sales.  They are very well satisfied, I know, with their prospects, and there is not one of them engaged in the business up to the present time who does not think that the Government has done an excellent thing in bringing about this change.  The only people who are agrieved are the people who, perhaps for political reasons, have refused to conform to the Government's desires in this matter, and have not attempted to adopt government policy.</P>

      <P>It would hardly be fair to the individuals to discuss them here, and I did not want to make mention of them except in a general way.  This development has been productive of considerable employment.  As Deputy Mulcahy himself admitted, it is healthy employment; it is very remunerative; it is the sort of employment that <Col N="1992" /> should be particularly welcomed in the present position of industry, inasmuch as it means employment for males, and skilled employment particularly.  It is not merely in the motor-car assembly but in the coachbuilding line that the new policy has brought excellent results.  I think if Deputy Mulcahy inquires he will find that the progress in that industry, and the amount of new work which has come to skilled men who are earning high wages, are things which we ought to be most proud of, and with which it would be most reckless to interfere.  Taking those things into account, I should like &mdash;provided the Deputy has permission to do it&mdash;if he would even now tell us what his grievances are.  I am still astray as to what I am going to vote on.</P>

There is no use in mixing up a whole lot of points, some of which obviously he has no grounds for stating at all.  If he can pick out a particular matter on which he thinks there is more information required, or on which he thinks the Government is going wrong, then we can really know what it is we are going to divide on and we can be more sympathetic to him in his present position.</P>

      <P>I think it is very offensive and very silly at the same time for the Deputy to suggest that any business man is going to cut his own throat for political reasons.  The Deputy said that he had evidence of political motives, but he did not mention what the evidence was.  I refuse to believe, without strong proof being adduced, that intelligent, educated and successful business men will refrain from making use of an avenue of profit which the Minister for Industry and Commerce thinks he has opened up for them out of spite against the Government. I think the thing is quite incredible. My own feeling is not one of any particular violence against the <Col N="1993" /> policy of the Government in this respect with regard to the motor car industry, but I do think that it will probably turn out that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has been a false friend to such businesses as the Deputy has just mentioned&mdash;Summerfield, Treacy and others&mdash;that those business will lose money, and that only the Ford factories, amongst the protected industry, will be able to make a good thing out of it.  If they do not lose money it will be because they will start doing less and less skilled work over here, and because they succeed in inducing the Minister, as time goes on, to make them concessions which will put their business almost back on the old basis again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The resolution we are discussing deals with motor chassis.  I, like Deputy Moore, am left completely in the dark as to what is troubling Deputy Mulcahy and his colleagues. Deputy Mulcahy apparently decided to begin his speech on this matter by indicating the extent to which the Government of which he was a member neglected the industrial possibilities of the country by quoting for us the number of completed motor cars imported from abroad during the years 1929, 1930, and 1931.  I do not know what he thinks he was achieving by reading these figures except affording an indication to the House and to those listening to him of what might have been done in those years if the Government then in office had the least interest in developing our industrial possibilities or in affording employment for Irish workers.  Every car that was imported in 1929, 1930 and 1931 could have afforded employment for a skilled Irish worker for six weeks.  It is one of the things of which I am very proud that we have succeeded almost entirely in eliminating that particular item from our import list.  In the year 1932 a beginning was made by the duties then imposed and a conclusion is now being effected to that policy by these import orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The industry has been established.  It has been well established on lines similar to those adopted in most other countries.  There is very little international trade in completed motor cars at the present time.  The Deputy spoke as if the idea of this assembling industry originated with the Government of the Irish Free State and was operated here and here only.  It is true that we may have given a lead to other countries in that connection.  They have all followed the lead so that a similar industry to our own is now in operation in practically every country.  The work of assembling motor chassis, like the work of assembling complete cars, is being undertaken here by a number of concerns and they are doing it very <Col N="1995" /> competently.  As Deputy Moore remarked, the directors and managers of the parent companies that manufacture parts have taken the opportunities that we gave them of expressing their appreciation of the skill of Irish workers and of the managerial capacity of those who are directing them in this industry here.  The prices at which the complete cars have been sold are, in consequence of the various changes in duties which have been brought into operation, being reduced.  It is true, as Deputy Moore said, that most of the American cars that are on sale here are on sale at prices lower than those charged for corresponding models in Great Britain.  The development of the industry is going to mean that that position will be maintained and improved upon because, of course, with increased production each one of these concerns will be able to reduce its costs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister used the phrase &ldquo;Most of the American cars.&rdquo;  I take it that what he meant was most American makes of cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It is not possible to say what the effect of this is going to be on the revenue because, of course, it is not possible to say how many cars are going to be sold this year.  But Deputy Mulcahy assumes that all the revenue collected from Customs duties on imported cars is going to be lost.  That is not so because a Customs duty is still chargeable on the parts of bodies and parts of chassis imported in a knocked-down condition. The duty charged on these parts will yield revenue to the Exchequer to compensate for the loss of revenue that may be occasioned by the cessation of complete car importations.  There will be a certain loss of revenue arising from the fact that a concession is to be given in the Road Fund tax on those Irish-assembled cars.  The full benefit of that concession will be enjoyed by the users of the cars.</P>

If any relevant information is desired, any information that is worth the trouble of getting, it can be and will be readily supplied, but a whole lot of unnecessary information concerning the people on the register of importers and things of that kind cannot be supplied, because the officers <Col N="1998" /> of the Department of Industry and Commerce have much more useful work to do and that useful work is reflected in the industrial results now evident throughout the country.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Eireann hereby approves of Control of Imports ((Quota No. 10) Order, 1934, made on the 19th day of October, 1934, by the Executive Council under the Control of Imports Act, 1934 (No. 12 of 1934).</P>
      <P>This order covers motor bodies and motor shells separately.  The importation of motor bodies and motor shells separately is something which is done only transitionally by certain firms proposing to engage in this work.  The quota for the previous six months period was fixed at 500.  In due course these imports will cease, and in any case under the order the quota period will terminate the operation of this.</P>

      <P>Deputy Moore was very puzzled to know why Deputies on these benches were adopting towards these resolutions the attitude they are adopting.  He asked a question under circumstances in which entirely within his own power and the power of the Minister I was prevented from replying to him.  When I get an opportunity under this resolution to reply to him, Deputy Moore conveniently clears out of the House.</P>

      <P>If he were listening yesterday when important industrial matters were being discussed here, he would not have been under the necessity of asking the question to-day.  We are dealing here with an industry which the Minister for Industry and Commerce considers is important.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the last three orders deal with the motor assembly industry and in order to develop it here the Minister has created and is creating the greatest possible chaos amongst those people who were earning their livelihood here in connection with the motor industry.  He has dislocated the whole commercial side of the industry.  In spite of what Deputy Moore has said and what the Minister has left unsaid, the Minister is putting a very big impost upon people in connection with cars and he is taking considerable sums of money out of revenue. The motor industry must, in the Minister's eyes, be giving a considerable amount of employment or he would not be doing all this.  But in dealing with the matter in the House the Minister adopts a method that practically prevents discussion.  As far as the members of this House are concerned the position is that a notice appears in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> that a particular quota has been issued.  There is nothing in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> to show whether it is bull's eyes or glass eyes or boots or glass or shirts.  No Deputy up to the present has got any copy of these orders.  Until yesterday no Deputy could have seen any of the orders that indicated the quota.  No Deputy has got any indication of any kind in any of the order papers issued that these papers are available in the library and <Col N="2001" /> the type of discussion which the Minister insists will take place on these matters here is a Second Reading discussion. In our opinion, matters of importance cannot be dealt with in that way here.  The President has gone some distance to redress the absurd position that exists and has promised that the order in connection with any of these things will be circulated to Deputies in future.  The very type of intervention we have had from Deputy Moore ought to persuade the Minister that it would be much more satisfactory from his point of view as well as from the point of view of the people interested in the industry here, if a different type of discussion took place. I would like to hear the Minister support the arguments that Deputy Moore attempted to put up.  They were not arguments but generalisations&mdash;not backed by a single fact.  I would like the Minister to tell the House how he makes out that motor cars here are to be cheaper than in Northern Ireland; and that the cost to the revenue and the cost of cars to the people here are to be such as to be in any way worthy of the increased employment that is to be given.  If the Minister has a case to make about these things he ought to make it here.  Otherwise he is taking up, in a casual way and certainly without the knowledge of the House, most dictatorial powers and he is precluding discussion by refusing to put in a plain statement before us. It is for this reason that these orders are being made.  The House is no wiser now in relation to any of these things.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did his best to keep from the House the facts.  He withheld from the House facts which were within his knowledge and in other cases in the most cold-blooded and brutal way he declined to give these facts in reply to a Parliamentary question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>While there is something to be said and perhaps a good deal to be said about the manner in which the Minister for Industry and Commerce has approached matters of a <Col N="2002" /> similar character before, and for the manner in which he has approached these two motions for the control of imports, at the same time while there has been a considerable lack of detail in most of these matters of a similar character that have come before us, I would like to point out to Deputy Mulcahy the fact that this industry gives considerable employment to male adults.  That, in my view, is one of the best recommendations it can get.  The fact also that the cars assembled here, in turn-out, in finish and in every other way have earned the good opinions of persons not alone in this country but in other countries, who are capable of judging, should, in my view, commend this order not alone to the Fianna Fáil Party but to the members of the United Ireland Party as well.</P>
      <P>In this respect, too, in my view, it is a departure from the policy that has been adopted by the Minister since the advent of Fianna Fáil to power.  We have had a number of factories set up in this country which, in my view, are not worth &ldquo;tuppence&rdquo; to the male adult population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Sir, but I think I am entitled to relate it to the quotas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact, at any rate, remains that this is an attempt, in my view almost the first attempt&mdash;I may be wrong, but I think it is the first attempt&mdash;to provide for adult males, some decent and well-paid employment in this country.  The question of revenue has been raised.  Whether there will be a loss of revenue to the State or not is a matter for conjecture, but, even if there is a small loss, it will be more than set off by the increased employment that will result after the Quota Order becomes effective.  The question has again been raised by Deputy Mulcahy that it may mean an <Col N="2003" /> increase in the cost of cars.  He has not said what kind of cars.  If it may result in a slight increase in the price of imported cars, that will be more than offset by the employment given.  I am aware that in Cork City alone increased employment has resulted because of the enterprise of the Ford firm, and I feel that when this Order comes into full operation it will result in interesting other people in the manufacture of these commodities in this country.  For that reason I support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not very much to say in reply to the remarks of Deputy Mulcahy.  Apparently his sole grievance in regard to this Order is that a copy of the Order was not sent to him.  He said he did not see it.  I am surprised he did not.  It was published in all the daily newspapers, it was broadcast from the Broadcasting Station, and it received the usual amount of publicity.  I gathered from Deputy Mulcahy that he does not read the morning papers.  He reads <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> with his breakfast coffee, perhaps <i>Stubbs' Gazette</i> in the middle of the day, and spends the night reading <i>The Blueshirt</i> which, of course, does not deal with matters of this kind.  All the information that he could possibly have desired was available to him.  If he merely had taken the trouble to come down here to the House, as was his duty as a Deputy, to inspect the records in the Dáil, he could have seen the actual text of the Order.  A number of articles dealing with it appeared in the daily newspapers and could have been persued by any Deputy interested in the matter. I am very sorry he did not get all the information he required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wanted to get the Order officially he could have gone to the library for it.  The statute <Col N="2004" /> required me to lay these Orders on the Table of the Dáil for the information of Deputies, and the provisions of the statute were carried out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <P>They were there for the Deputy or any other Deputy to inspect them, and he could have got all the information he wanted about them. He said that he could spend the whole day discussing these Orders and he would be no wiser in the end than he was in the beginning.  I interrupted him to say that I had done my best. I hope to continue the educational process, so that in due course it will be evident to everybody that he is wiser than he has been.  The Order in this case is not of very great importance. It is only one of a series required to foster the motor assembling industry, but the motor assembling industry would be fostered whether it is passed or not.  There are very few people likely to be interested in the import of motor car bodies without the chassis attached, but if there are, this Order restricts them in respect of the number. In due course economic considerations will prevent their bringing them in, in any event.  The principal Order, which refers to completely assembled cars, is the main one on which we are relying to develop the motor assembling industry, which is of considerable importance to the country and will become of greater importance in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that economic considerations, too, will compel the Minister to take the Dáil more into his confidence, and look for the assistance of the Dáil in these matters.</P>

    <P>1. &mdash;(1)  That a duty of excise at the rate of sixpence the gallon shall be charged and levied on, and shall be paid by the manufacturer of, all mineral hydrocarbon light oil made in Saorstát Eireann which, on or after the 1st day of February, 1935, is sent out, on or for sale or otherwise from the premises of the manufacturer thereof or is used by such manufacturer for any purpose other than the manufacture or production of mineral hydrocarbon oil.</P>
    <P>(2)  That, subject to compliance with such conditions as the Revenue Commissioners shall impose, the duty mentioned in this Resolution shall not be charged or levied.&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  on any mineral hydrocarbon light oil in respect of which it is shown, to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners, that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  such oil was sent out from the premises of the manufacturer thereof on or after the 1st day <Col N="2007" /> of February, 1935, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  the duty mentioned in this resolution was paid in respect of such oil when it was so sent out, and</P>
    <P>(iii)  such oil was subsequently brought back to the said premises from which it was so sent out or into other premises occupied by the said manufacturer, nor</P>
    <P>(b)  on any mineral hydrocarbon light oil which is shown, to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners, to be intended for use in Saorstát Eireann in any process of dyeing or cleaning of textiles carried on by way of trade, nor</P>
    <P>(c)  on any mineral hydrocarbon light oil which is shown, to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners, to be intended for use as an ingredient in the manufacture of articles which are not of the character of mineral hydrocarbon light oil or not merely a mixture or blend of such oils with or without the addition of some ingredient such as colouring matter.</P>
    <P>(3)  That a drawback, equal to the amount of the duty mentioned in this resolution which is shown, to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners, to have been paid in respect of the goods in question, shall be allowed on the exportation from Saorstát Eireann or the shipment or deposit in a bonded warehouse for use as ships' stores of any mineral hydrocarbon light oil chargeable with the said duty, and on the loading into any aircraft of any such oil for use on a voyage to a place outside Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    <P>(4)  That there shall, as on and from the 1st day of February, 1935, be charged, levied, and paid, on a licence to be taken out annually by every refiner of hydrocarbon oil, an excise duty of one pound.</P>
    <P>(5)  That the Revenue Commissioners may make regulations for securing and collecting the duty mentioned in this Resolution, for prohibiting the refining of hydrocarbon <Col N="2008" /> oil otherwise than by persons who hold a licence in that behalf and have made entry for that purpose, for regulating the issue, duration and renewal of such licences, and for governing generally the manufacture of mineral hydrocarbon light oil and the removal of such oil from the refinery, and the Revenue Commissioners may by such regulations apply to the duty and the drawback mentioned in this Resolution or to refiners of hydrocarbon oil any enactment for the time being in force relating to any duty of excise or of customs or to persons carrying on any trade which is for the time being subject to the law of excise.</P>

    <P>(7)  That for the purposes of this Resolution the expression &ldquo;hydrocarbon light oil&rdquo; means hydrocarbon oil of which not less than 50 per cent. by volume distils at a temperature not exceeding 185 degrees centigrade, or of which not less than 95 per cent. by volume distils at a temperature not exceeding 240 degrees centigrade or which gives off an inflammable vapour at a temperature of less than 22.8 degrees centigrade when tested in the manner prescribed by the Acts relating to petroleum.</P>
    <P>(8)  That the method of testing oil for the purpose of ascertaining whether it complies with the provisions of the next preceding paragraph of this Resolution relating to the distillation of a certain volume thereof at a certain temperature shall be such as the Revenue Commissioners shall prescribe.</P>
    <P>(9)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that <Col N="2009" /> this resolution shall have statutory effect by virtue of the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    <P>2. &mdash;(1)  That an excise duty of five shillings shall be charged, levied, and paid for and upon every licence issued under the Tobacco Act, 1934 (No. 37 of 1934), and in that Act referred to as a grower's licence, that is to say, a licence to grow tobacco in a specified year on specific lands and to cure such tobacco.</P>
    <P>(2)  That an excise duty of ten shillings shall be charged, levied and paid for and upon every licence issued under the Tobacco Act, 1934 (No. 37 of 1934), and in that Act referred to as a curer's licence, that is to say, a licence to cure, in the premises to which such licence relates, tobacco grown in a specified year.</P>

    <P>(4)  That an excise duty of five shillings shall be charged, levied, and paid for and upon every licence issued under Part IV of the Tobacco Act, 1934 (No. 37 of 1934), and in that Act referred to as an experimental manufacturer's licence, that is to say, a licence to grow tobacco <Col N="2010" /> in a specified year on specified land and to cure and rehandle such tobacco.</P>
    <P>(5)  That sub-section (1) of section 3 of the Finance Act, 1908, shall be repealed.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister what return the tobacco growers are to get for the payment of this 5/-.  When this Resolution was before the House, in Committee, there was a certain amount of criticism of the Government's attitude towards this industry.  It was pointed out that there was a time when the Government considered this a tremendous industry and believed that the time had arrived, in this country, when they were in a position to foster it.  The position is that in 1933 there were something like 730 acres of tobacco grown.  For 1934, there was a very large number of applications in from farmers to be allowed to grow.  The Minister for Finance permitted those who had grown the tobacco in 1933 to grow, I think, about 1,200 acres, but there were upwards of 5,000 other persons in the country who wanted to be allowed to grow tobacco in 1934 who were not allowed to grow it.  I should like to hear from the Minister how many persons are going to be allowed licences this year for growing tobacco; whether the growing will be confined to the 1933 growers, and, if not, what classes of persons are going to be allowed to grow tobacco and to what number.</P>
      <P>Again, I would ask the Minister, as this is perhaps the only opportunity of asking him in time, when the licences for tobacco growing in 1935 are to be issued?  Much of the work in connection with the growing of tobacco for this year, such as the preparation of the ground and so on, was begun in October last, and, as far as we know, none of the people who have been preparing to grow tobacco this year have any idea whether or not they are going to be allowed to grow it this year or to what extent they will be allowed to grow it.  The matter is of particular importance for them in view of the losses that many of them sustained last year.  The Minister is aware that, owing to drought and wind last year, a very considerable amount of damage was done to the tobacco crop, and that many farmers, whom he is now saddling with a licence in order to get a permit to grow tobacco, met with substantial losses and are being paid coolie rates for the tobacco grown.  A substantial amount of the tobacco grown last year will mean only 2½d. with a gross income to the farmer of 5d. with the subsidy taken into account.  Foreign tobacco can be landed at 4d.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Has not this all been decided upon in the Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Was it decided in the Act that farmers would be let run on until late in February without letting them know whether they would be allowed to grow a crop this year for which they have had to begin preparations in October last?</P>

      <P>What was or was not decided upon in the Act may not be debated here.  It is not for the <Col N="2015" /> Chair to suggest what would be in order in that connection.  I might say, however, that it would be in order to discuss the effect of this Resolution on the growers of tobacco.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking what the growers are going to get for this 5/- that they are being asked to pay for a licence, and that involves some indication as to what arrangements the Minister for Finance, or the Minister for Agriculture if it is his Department, is making now to tell the farmers when they will be allowed to grow it and to what extent they will be allowed to grow.  I suggest that it is not too much to ask the Minister how many licences he is going to issue this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy put down a question yesterday on the 23rd January, I think, for answer on Wednesday, 13th February in which he asked for information as to the total acreage in each county for which applications for licences were made in 1934.  He has asked for further information since and I suggest that he should use the proper machinery for eliciting that information, and that is, that he should use the Order Paper and put down a Parliamentary Question. In any event, the Minister for Finance is not the Minister who is responsible for the determination of the area to be devoted to tobacco cultivation.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the Act.  In the Act he will find that the Minister for Agriculture has a very <Col N="2016" /> important function in this matter, and that it is to the Minister for Agriculture his questions should have been addressed.</P>

      <P>One question, possibly, is pertinent to the debate, and that is what were licence-holders going to get for this 5/-.  I think that that is the question the Deputy intended to put.  They are going to get the right to grow tobacco on a certain limited acreage.  I can say, for the information of the country generally, that I understand that the Minister for Agriculture proposes to fix the total acreage at 1,500 as the maximum amount of tobacco which he will permit to be grown and that, with certain exceptions provided for in the Resolution and the original Bill, subject to the condition that no person will be allowed to grow more than two acres, applications for acreage will be considered from all comers.</P>

      <P>As was pointed out when this Resolution was considered in Committee, this is simply a case of the Minister in a scandalous way endeavouring to get back on the Dublin Corporation because they stood on their legal rights and succeeded in vindicating their attitude in the courts. The rights they stood for then and that they got vindicated in the courts are to be taken away from them by this Resolution.  The Minister is so determined to pursue that line that he sweeps into the net every county council and a large number of other local bodies and imposes upon them a tax that they never had to pay before. The Minister's attitude in both cases is a scandalous one.  He is imposing additional taxation on local bodies although he knows the condition in which some of these bodies are and has some indication as to the condition in which some of them will be when he tells them the position of the land annuity collection in the country.</P>

I do not understand Deputy Brennan's reference to repercussions in view of the way rates are being paid.  The rates will have to be paid.  It is the intention of the Government to see that the rates are collected and that people who are perfectly well able to pay their rates will pay them. This will not have any repercussions on them except very remotely and indirectly.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;  This Bill, as members of the Dáil are aware from what I said on the Second Stage of the Nationality and Citizenship Bill, is one of a set of three Bills which, when they are passed, might together be regarded as comprising our whole nationality code.  Logically, perhaps, it would have been better that we should first have taken the next item on the Orders of the Day, but as the Constitution (Amendment) Bill is a very simple one, I do not think that any harm will be done by our not keeping to the strictly logical order.  It is recognised that the political community has a right to define for itself who shall be members of it, and to impose obligations and conditions on strangers to the community who may be residing on its territory.  In the Nationality and Citizenship Bill we define those who are to be members of our political community in the sense of being citizens.  As that Bill has just recently passed through the House it is not necessary to recall its provisions. This Bill is to deal with those who are not regarded as citizens, and are not to be members of the sovereign political community.  We have a right to define what is to be their status amongst us.  Formerly, in other countries aliens, as they are called&mdash;non-citizens; that is the meaning which we attach to the term under this Bill; those who are not citizens in accordance with the Citizenship and Nationality Bill&mdash;were not allowed, for example, to hold real property.  Very often foreigners have to reside, for the purposes of trade and business, in a country of which they are not citizens, and as time went on it became unsatisfactory that they should not be entitled to hold property.  The modern usage is to permit them to hold property to such an extent and in such a manner as may be deemed expedient by the country in which they are residing.</P>
      <P>Our provisions here are liberal ones. Under Section 3 we make it clear that aliens are entitled to acquire property, to hold it and to dispose of it in practically the same manner as citizens of the State.  Giving them privileges of such a type, we are entitled to impose obligations upon them, and one of the obligations is that they should be subject to our laws.  It is customary also for the State to protect itself and to protect its citizens by taking power to impose restrictions of various kinds.  In times of danger and times of war it may be very necessary for the safety of the community that it be in a position to impose such restrictions.  We have here, under Section 4, power given to the Minister to impose restrictions indicating at what points aliens may be allowed to enter.  In certain cases he may take power to confine them to residing in a particular area, and he may order that in leaving the country they will leave only through a specified port.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2025" /> Under Section 9 we have power to exempt citizens of certain countries from the application of provisions of this Act.  The intention there is to parallel the provisions which we have in the Nationality Bill by which we can give to citizens of other countries who are alien to us privileges corresponding to the privileges which our citizens would enjoy in their countries.  In other sections of the Bill power is taken to deal with a contravention of the orders which may be made under the Bill and penalties can be imposed.</P>
    <P>I think that in the main these are the broad features of the Bill.  There is nothing complicated in it.  Those who have lived through the war period are accustomed to the nature of the restrictions that may be imposed for the safety of the community, and I do not think that we shall have from any part of the House strong objection to any part of the Bill.  I do not think it is necessary for me to give the House any further explanation of it. In its nature this Bill is one that lends itself more to Committee work than to any detailed statement on Second Reading.  I just want to indicate that there are a few amendments which I propose to make at a later stage.  In the first place, in Section 2 there is no reference to ownership of aircraft. That will have to be remedied.  In Section 5, sub-section (2), paragraph (b) we propose to insert the words &ldquo;officers of customs and excise.&rdquo;  We also take power there to impose certain obligations on hotel keepers in regard to the registering of aliens who may be residing in the hotel.  There are two printers' errors which will have to be corrected.  In Section 5, sub-section (1), paragraph (a) the word &ldquo;which&rdquo; will have to be changed to &ldquo;whom,&rdquo; and in Section 8, sub-section (1), paragraph (b) the word &ldquo;amending&rdquo; to &ldquo;assuming.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should also draw attention to the fact that it is proposed to continue in force the Aliens Order of 1925 and bring it in as if it were made under this Act.  The intention is to keep it for a short while until a comprehensive Order can be made which will supplant it.  We do not expect that the doing of that will take any appreciable time, <Col N="2026" /> but at the same time we think it well to keep the Order in force until the new Order comes in.  I think it well to explain to the Dáil that the intention is that the three Bills that I have referred to should, when they have passed through the Dáil and Seanad with their amendments, become law on the same day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>The President insisted on the right of this House to pass this Bill.  What is of more importance to the country is whether it is in the interests of the Irish people that the Bill should be passed.  I only intend to say one word about it.  What is, I suppose, the principle of the Bill is contained in Section 2 defining an alien as &ldquo;a person who is not a citizen of Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;  We are thus labelling our kith and kin in all the various parts of the Commonwealth as aliens.  We are setting up a new sentimental barrier between ourselves and the North of Ireland by doing that. In addition, we are starting a train of events which may quite possibly lead, and which is even likely to lead if Government policy continues in general on its present lines, to the exclusion of our fellow citizens from a number of careers that are at present open to them.  A speech is reported in this morning's newspapers that was made by Mr. Hofmeyr, the South African Minister of the Interior.  Replying to some questions raised on this subject in South Africa he said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That his Government stood by the position laid down at the Imperial Conferences of 1929 and 1930, the effect of which was that in each part of the Commonwealth there was a particular status based on membership of the local community and common status based on common allegiance to the sovereign.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a view of the case that I should like to see adopted in any legislation passed in this country on the subject of citizenship and alienship.  I regard this as a foolish Bill quite in keeping with many other foolish Bills that this Government has introduced and with the generally foolish policy of this Government.  They are busily engaged <Col N="2027" /> in pulling down a building that, in the fullness of time, others will be called on to build up again.  They have an obedient majority now by which they can pass anything they like, but a time will come when history will pass judgment on them and when the Irish people will repudiate what they are doing.  We must oppose this Bill.</P>

      <P>This Bill makes Archbishop Mannix an alien.  That is not the only object of the Bill.  When the Bill becomes an Act a certain hiatus will exist in the law in reference to aliens in this country.  The President mentioned that the Aliens Order of 1925 is to remain in operation and that the intention is to re-enact it under this measure.  I see that in the Schedule we are repealing the Aliens Restriction Act of 1914 and Aliens Restriction (Amendment) Act of 1919.  I think it will be found that that will leave certain loopholes and that there will be a necessity for further regulations by the Government.  At the present time there is a general agreement between the British and Irish Governments with regard to the control and admission of aliens into this island. There is a mutual agreement, but I do not know that it has ever been brought before the Dáil.  At any rate it has been carried out for a number of years by the police forces of both countries. There has been co-operation between the two Governments and between the police forces of the two Governments with regard to the administration of the Aliens Acts, and the regulations made under them.  I presume that when this Act comes into operation the agreement which has hitherto existed between the two Governments will come to an end, and that fresh agreements will have to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the present time no passports are required between this country and Great Britain, but passports are required from most countries for admission either into Ireland or into Great Britain from external sources.  From now on, I cannot see how we can avoid <Col N="2028" /> being forced to introduce a system of passports between this State and the United Kingdom and between this State and Northern Ireland.  It would be very difficult for any Customs officials, or police officials at the Border to distinguish between those who are citizens of the United Kingdom and those who are citizens of some other country when they come into the Free State, unless there is at least some system of passports or cards of identity introduced, such as exists between the United States and Canada.  This will necessitate a great deal of work and a great deal of red tape on the part of the Government Departments, and its administration will put a considerable burden on the already overtaxed officials along the Border and at the ports.</P>
    <P>A further agreement, as far as I remember, which was come to by this country and the United Kingdom was that if a citizen of one country who happened to be in the other needed a passport to go abroad, he would be provided with the passport by the Government of the country in which he happened to be, so that a Free State citizen in Great Britain would be supplied with a passport in London and a United Kingdom citizen could obtain a passport here in Dublin.  I assume that after this Bill comes into operation that agreement will come to an end.  As one goes through this Bill, one cannot help realising that many difficulties are bound to arise.  It is very difficult for the ordinary citizen to foresee all the circumstances in which rearrangement will be necessary in view of the breakdown of the existing agreements between the two Governments.  In Committee Stage, the President has mentioned, several Government amendments will be introduced, and I think that perhaps in Section 5, sub-section (4), it might be made clear that not only persons recognised as being diplomats and consuls-general, but also persons holding the position of high commissioner or trade commissioner should be exempt in the same way as the holders of the other positions are exempt.</P>
    <P>In the Citizenship Bill, high commissioners were included in the definition <Col N="2029" /> of &ldquo;Ministers,&rdquo; but that does not appear in this Bill and perhaps it should be introduced.  There are other matters in other sections which will need to be discussed in Committee.  I mentioned at the beginning that such persons as Archbishop Mannix will become aliens as a result of this Bill, and also, I understand, Mr. Bernard Shaw will become an alien.  When the possibility was mentioned to him, on the passage of the Citizenship Bill, he said that he was open to suggestions as to what country he should adopt or what country would adopt him.  I notice a leading article in a recent number of a responsible daily paper in Madrid suggesting that, in view of the fact that President de Valera has made Mr. Bernard Shaw an alien by his legislation, Mr. Bernard Shaw should be invited to become a Spaniard.  As to whether Mr. Shaw will accept the suggestion or not, I do not know, but certainly the proposition had been put to him, presumably on the principle that Spain at the moment needs a Don Quixote and that we have a surplus of such people in this country for export.</P>
    <P>A great number of distinguished people all over the world who have hitherto been accustomed to look upon themselves as Irish, and who have brought lustre and distinction or fame to this country will be, by this Bill, branded as aliens in this, our national State, and for that reason alone, I think that more care should have been taken in arriving at a definition of &ldquo;alien&rdquo; and that the bald statement should not be put down that everyone who is not a citizen of this State shall be branded as an alien in this, our national State.  I realise that a Bill was inevitable after the passage of the Citizenship Bill, which is, I understand, being delayed in the Seanad until such time as this Bill comes also before that body.  Possibly by the time this Bill comes back to us, it will be in its second or third edition, just as I understand the Citizenship Bill, when it comes back to us, will be a very different measure from what it was when it was first introduced.</P>

      <P>If the definition of an alien had not been such as to comprise <Col N="2030" /> within its scope every citizen of every State of the Commonwealth of Nations, there would be nothing to be said against the provisions of this Bill. With that exception, the Bill does nothing more than to put into one Bill the provisions of the existing law, with the necessary adaptations.  With the possible exceptions of the provisions of Section 7 and Section 8, the remainder of the Bill is nothing but a restatement of the provisions of portions of the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act, 1914, the Aliens Restrictions Acts, 1914 and 1919 and the Aliens Order of 1925, so that we are not asserting the sovereign right of this Assembly to deal with, or define, or otherwise regulate the status of aliens in this country. Under the existing legislation, they were perfectly adequately provided for.</P>
      <P>I agree that this Bill is a proper Bill to bring in and we would have little or nothing to say upon it if it did not contain that wide definition of the word &ldquo;alien.&rdquo;  Although there has existed in the British Commonwealth of Nations that common status, or that idea of common status, to which Deputy MacDermot has referred, it is not unknown that some members of this Commonwealth of Nations have excluded from their privileges, and even from entering into their territory, other members of the States members of the British Commonwealth of Nations.  The outstanding example of that is, of course, the Australian Government, who by their own legislation prohibited Indian subjects from entering Australia.  So that we are not committing what you might call a very grave or original sin if we do say that we will subject to certain restrictions citizens of the British Commonwealth entering this country.  That is to say we could restrict British subjects, whether Australians, New Zealanders, or South Africans, from entering this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We pointed out during the passage of the Citizenship Bill through this House that in order to retain our separate Irish nationality we have to recognise that so long as we are a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations we have certain rights and, <Col N="2031" /> perhaps also following that, certain obligations.  I pointed out at that time that membership of the British Commonwealth of Nations, or that our being a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, did not involve the idea of being British; that while the Association was called the British Commonwealth of Nations, it was not a commonwealth of British nations; and that South Africa had its own idea of nationality, its own consciousness of South African nationality just the same as we have our consciousness of Irish nationality.  But while we are within this Association of States we ought to recognise our obligations decently and honourably, and while recognising these obligations decently and honourably, to get what we can and to extract for this country such practical substantial advantages as we can gain for the citizens of our own country through membership of that Association of States.</P>
    <P>If we had a Republic it would be another matter, but up to the moment we are certainly within the British Commonwealth of Nations.  Our status is such as is conferred upon us by virtue of that membership.  We have very practical rights which can be obtained as a business proposition for the citizens of this country.  I say now, as I said during the course of the debate on the Citizenship Bill, that it is bad business merely for the sake of putting something on paper in the nature of make-belief, something that will enable certain people to go around the country and say that we have called the citizens of Northern Ireland aliens and that we are almost a Republic, if not a Republic.  I say that is bad business, and I say it is also bad nationality.  Apart, however, from being bad nationality, it is certainly bad business.  We are not going to get anything through calling citizens of Northern Ireland or citizens of Scotland aliens.  It is because the Government are doing something that is utterly needless from the point of view of the consciousness of our own Irish nationality, as a separate nationality in the community of <Col N="2032" /> nations, that we object to the proposals in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde has referred to the provisions of Section 5 of this Bill dealing with the exemptions to diplomatic missions through the provisions of this Bill.  I understand that we have in this country a trade representative from Great Britain and also a trade representative from Canada.  These will be aliens under this Bill as it stands at the present moment.  The provisions of the Bill, to which the President has referred, keeping in force the Aliens Order of 1925, will certainly, from the legal point of view, form a very interesting statute.  That Order is going to be continued as a temporary measure. Under the Aliens Order of 1925, an alien means a person who is not a British subject, so that you are continuing an Order which says that the meaning of an alien under the terms of that Order is a person who is not a British subject.</P>
    <P>Here in this Bill you are saying an alien is a person who is a British subject. For that reason I say the situation will be distinctly interesting. Whether the Government intends it or not, the position will be that after the passing of this Bill persons coming down from Newry to Dundalk will have to register with the registration officer under the Aliens Order of 1925, or else subject themselves to prosecution and subsequent imprisonment.  That is the sort of thing this Bill is doing at the present moment.  Anybody who comes in from Newry or elsewhere over the Border will have to register himself. That is one of the provisions of the Aliens Order, 1925.  Similarly, anybody coming in from England will have, straight away, to go to the registration officer and register himself.  In addition to that he will have to inform the police authority of every change of address.  That is a nice prospect for them.  It is worse for us, because it is going to do us damage from the material point of view, and we cannot afford any further damage from that point of view.</P>
    <P>The provisions of Section 9 of the Act to which the President has referred are also rather interesting.  I take it that it is intended to mean that when <Col N="2033" /> we are getting privileges from Great Britain we will give Great Britain privileges.  I would like the President to ask his legal advisers to look at that section and to ask whether it carries through what he intends it to carry through.  He will have a nice problem to solve there.</P>
    <P>Sections 7 and 8 were not referred to by the President.  They appear to be not so much novel as new, certainly in this country.  I would have liked to have had something from the President as to the scope of these sections.  I find it difficult to understand sub-section (2) of Section 7, which provides that a person must carry on business under the same sort of name&mdash;that is assuming he is an alien&mdash;as he had on the 6th December, 1922, or on the day after he started business.  So that he could start business to-day under the name of Stravisky or something of that kind and to-morrow morning he could start under the name of O'Brien, and he would be entitled to continue on as O'Brien apparently under the construction of that Section.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill provides for a change of name by licence.  This country would be flooded with licences of one kind or another before long.  I would suggest for the President's consideration that there ought to be some sort of record office where the public can inspect these licences.  According to the proposal in the Bill they are given at the moment at the absolute discretion of the Minister.  Under the Bill as it stands there is no way by which the public can ascertain who it is who has got a licence, when he got it and what were the conditions under which the licence had been granted. I suggest that if those provisions are to be carried out there should be some public office where the names of those to whom the licences were granted will be entered, and that this list should be open to inspection by the public.</P>
    <P>We oppose this Bill because of its scope in relation to our co-members of the British Commonwealth of Nations. We think that it will in practice probably be that Section 9, or some similar section will be so operated as to exclude those members from the scope of the Bill.  We think on <Col N="2034" /> this section that the question of exemption from the provisions of citizens of the British Commonwealth of Nations will not operate.  The remainder of the Bill is a rehash of the law as it exists at the present moment, and under which we have been operating since 1925.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two minor points upon which I should like to get information before speaking on the generality of the Bill.  Deputy Costello has referred to one of them. Section 7, according to the side-noting, imposes restrictions on a change of name by aliens, and under sub-section (2) it appears it shall not be lawful for an alien to carry on, or continue to carry on, after the appointed day, any trade or business unless in the name under which such trade or business was carried on, &ldquo;on whichever of the following days was the later.&rdquo;  What does &ldquo;later&rdquo; mean?  Does it mean further removed from us, or later in point of date?  I should imagine that the 6th December, 1934, was later than the 6th December, 1922; and if that is the interpretation, what Deputy Costello suggests must happen.  Say you have a gentleman called Wassenfeldt or some name of that kind, that he decides to Irishise his name, and that he becomes The O'Maguire on a particular date.  If it is later than 6th December, 1922, he may continue as The O'Maguire, and later he may find that there are too many O'Maguires in the country, and he can change that name to something else.  I wonder is that what is intended?  Does it mean further removed in time from us, or earlier in date, or does it mean later in the sense that the 6th December, 1934 is later than the 6th December, 1922?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Costello has pointed out that under Section 5, say, a trade representative of Great Britain resident in this country is an alien.  If he is, I do not think he yet realises the awkward position in which he is going to be placed under this Bill, because under a Ministerial order, his house may be broken into and he may be arrested, despite our having Constitutional provisions guaranteeing the liberty of the person in this country.  Under this Bill <Col N="2035" /> he may be exempted from the application of such an aliens order, and when you get on down, you find that his wife and child are exempt.  Suppose you get a female representative here, her husband is not exempt.  There is a clause in the Interpretation Act which says that words importing the masculine shall import the feminine, but not <i>vice versa.</i>  These are, however, only minor points.</P>
    <P>The big point arises in connection with Section 9 and it has to be taken as colouring the whole Bill.  Section 9 as it stands definitely does make, until an exemption order is passed, everybody, even a person of Irish descent, who is not as Section 2 states, a citizen of Saorstát Eireann, under the nationality and citizens law, an alien.  That applies to a considerable number of people whom we claim as being very near and very dear to us, and as being of Irish descent.  See what may happen them.  Section 5 operates in full force against any of these people.  Consider Section 5 in relation to the constitutional guarantees that we gave under the Constitution to a variety of people.  In Article 7 we say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The liberty of the person is inviolable&rdquo;&mdash;not of citizens&mdash;&ldquo;and no person shall be deprived of his liberty except in accordance with law.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are going to make a distinction here and it is not a distinction which is going to be assented to by any judicial authority.  It is by a Minister.</P>
    <P>Under Section 5, sub-section 2 (b)&mdash; as if it were not wide enough the President is going to enlarge it&mdash;the Minister for Defence, or even a Customs officer, is going to have power to arrest and detain, and to search premises and places.  Article 7 says that the dwelling of each citizen is inviolable. It is &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; that is used there.  Article 8 says that freedom of conscience is, subject to certain things, guaranteed, and Article 9 gives the right of free expression of opinion, apparently to everybody in the country.  It has been a moot point for many years as to whether the word <Col N="2036" />&ldquo;citizen&rdquo; in these four fundamental articles means citizen as defined in the nationality law, or means a resident.  In Article 3 a citizen is described as every person who was born in Ireland or either of whose parents was born in Ireland or who had been ordinarily resident in the area of the Irish Free State for not less than seven years.  That particular term &ldquo;citizen of the Irish Free State&rdquo; is used in the Constitution, but certainly in interpreting modern constitutions, the general trend of opinion is that where no set phrase is used, a phrase like &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; does not merely tie you down to your own citizens, but extends to resident aliens.</P>
    <P>What are going to be the reactions of these four fundamental articles of the Constitution on this Bill and on the one which is not tied up with the word &ldquo;citizen&rdquo;?  Article 6 says that the liberty of the person is inviolable and that no person shall be deprived of his liberty except in accordance with law.  We should know how far the distinction goes.  The President in his opening remarks made it appear that Section 5, is only for use in time of war or such time of excitement.  The President's example was in relation undoubtedly to a time of war.  He may have meant to suggest that Article 4 might be regarded, notwithstanding the liberty that is guaranteed to every person in the State, as being subject to what may happen during a state of war or armed rebellion but there is no such phrase in Section 5 of the Bill. Whenever the Minister issues an order he can do a variety of things.  He can pass an order in respect to, either all aliens or aliens of a particular nationality and incidentally, later on, he can define the nationality of an alien.  Here he seems to be tied to particular aliens or aliens of a particular nationality.</P>
    <P>Apparently in this way, we have guaranteed freedom of a variety of things, freedom from arrest, from search, from detention, liberty of speech, liberty of association, liberty of conscience for the people of the country.  We are now about to decide, not that a judge shall decide, who has the right to do these things, that a <Col N="2037" /> Minister by order in relation to individuals, may grant to officials of the Department of Justice or to a Customs and Excise officer the right to arrest and detain, the right to break into premises and search premises.  That is a very far reaching provision and it is certainly in complete breach of the Constitution.  It certainly does give power to make distinctions as between individuals.</P>
    <P>The reactions of this Bill, which in precise terms aims at Article 6 and Article 7&mdash;the freedom from arrest and the inviolability of the dwellinghouse&mdash; may have a reaction also on the interpretation to be given by the courts hereafter to the meaning of the word &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; in these two Articles and may have a very narrowing effect upon what we intend or what it is now believed we intend, by the freedom of, say, religious belief or practice of religion, and the freedom of expression of opinion given in Articles 8 and 9, which are not at the moment limited in any way.  I object to Section 5 for a variety of reasons.  It is definitely giving over to a Minister, in relation even to individuals, the exercise of judicial power.  Definitely and clearly it is given over to him without any check or limitation which would enable this matter to be brought before a court. It gives him that power without tying him down to the avoidance of distinctions as between groups of people or individuals in groups.  Without putting any of these limitations upon him, it gives him power, if and whenever he thinks proper, acting through agents&mdash; civil servants&mdash;to arrest and detain, to break open a house and to search. There ought surely to be some limitation of that peculiar freedom.  If it is to be exercised mainly in times of war or armed rebellion, let the section say so. If it is thought wise to reserve the use of such a power for some other emergency, which cannot be foreseen at the moment, let it be reserved for that but requiring the promulgation of notice to the Dáil before any interference of this kind is attempted in respect of any individual.</P>
    <P>The President says, in introducing a Bill which has this clause, that it is &ldquo;a <Col N="2038" /> liberal measure.&rdquo;  He says further that, when we are so liberal in our gifts to these aliens, we should demand certain consideration, and that the consideration is that we subject them to our laws.  We do not.  We do not subject them to our Constitutional guarantees. We prevent their getting the benefit of those guarantees if the Minister thinks fit.  That would be a considerable blot on the Bill even if it were narrowed down to a small number of aliens, as the phrase is used at the moment, but when, by Article 9, it can have the widest possible extension, when an Englishman who visits this country for the purpose of trade or a person born of Irish parents who does not happen to be an Irish citizen may, at any time the Minister thinks proper, have his house broken into, his premises searched, and his arrest ordered, it is very serious.  Apparently, there is no way to have that proceeding brought before a court.  The Minister can do this with regard to particular aliens. Section 5, apart from the breaches which it makes in certain other Constitutional guarantees, does certainly leave open the argument that it is a breach of Article 64, which provides that judicial power shall be exercised and justice administered in the public courts by judges appointed in a particular manner.  Power is being taken to abrogate a particular provision with regard to freedom of the person, freedom of speech and the right to have a house sacred from entry.  As if that was not enough, the Minister is given authority to issue an Order which may contain provisions &ldquo;conferring on the Minister and on officers of the Minister and the military and police forces of the State all such powers (including powers of arrest and detention and powers of searching persons and places) as are, in the opinion of the Minister, necessary for giving full effect to or enforcing compliance with such order.&rdquo; If that is a &ldquo;liberal Bill,&rdquo; the full content and extent of its liberality should be brought vividly before the mind of any alien who is thinking of coming into the country and should be brought particularly before the mind of those of our people who still look to us as in some way attached to them.  They <Col N="2039" /> should be given some notice of the latest benefaction that we are conferring on them if they come to the country.  We are giving a Minister power to wipe out these Constitutional guarantees so that their premises may be raided and they themselves arrested and put into jail.  Eventually, according to this mysterious phrase, they can be prevented from leaving the country. If they want to get out to avoid all these things, the Minister can prevent them.  Part of the Order may be devoted to telling them that they must stay in the country, even though it be in Arbour Hill.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>If one is to follow the Deputy's argument to its logical conclusion, the Constitution prevents the Oireachtas from making any provision by way of restriction on aliens which would put them in a position different from citizens.  If I followed the Deputy's argument correctly, that is the conclusion.  His whole speech, and particularly that part which was devoted to Section 5, seemed to be infected with what I thought was now an out-of-date conception of the Constitution.  I understand that the Deputy is now Professor of Constitutional Law.  One would have imagined that, as such, he would have made himself familiar with a recent decision of the Supreme Court regarding the Constitution, involving, as it did, the question, which figured very largely in the arguments, as to whether there were or were not fundamental provisions in the Constitution. As I understand the majority judgment of the Supreme Court, it is incorrect legally to describe any of the Articles of the Constitution as more fundamental than others.  However, I suppose the Deputy will read the judgment and bring himself up to date on this branch of Constitutional Law. Another curious thing about the Deputy's treatment of that section and his application of Article 6 to it is that he did not advert to the fact that Article 6 says that the liberty of the person is inviolable and that no person shall be deprived of his liberty except in accordance with law.  Surely this is a law&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is a law and, so far as that sentence in the Article of the Constitution is concerned, it is absurd for the Deputy to contend that this Bill in any way conflicts with it.

      <P>The Deputy speaks loosely of &ldquo;the spirit of the Constitution,&rdquo; but we are dealing with the precise interpretation of the Constitution and its legal effect.  I understood that Deputy McGilligan was purporting to interpret Articles of the Constitution in the strict way in which they would be interpreted by a court when he suggested that this Bill, in that section, was unconstitutional. Nobody can reasonably suggest that it is not fitting in any properly organised community to have a distinction drawn between the position of aliens and the position of citizens.  I do not suppose that there is any country where very drastic powers are not remitted to some Minister to deal with aliens.  That has been found necessary for very obvious reasons&mdash;so obvious that it is quite unnecessary to elaborate them.  As was pointed out by the President, this Bill is simply making the position clear.  It confers upon the Minister a power which one assumes he will not exercise unreasonably.  It confers upon the Minister power to use on occasions when it should be reasonably exercised. As to the point whether the register should be open to inspection, and several other similar points, they are rather, I think, matters for Committee. Generally, as the President has said, the Bill is a liberal Bill, and aliens are given rights under it which they did not, until recent years, receive in many countries.</P>

      <P>I thought really that all the nonsense that it was possible to speak, on a subject like this, would have been exhausted by the nonsense spoken upon the Nationality Bill.  We are told we are making Archbishop Mannix and Bernard Shaw aliens. They are not being made aliens by any Act of ours.  They can remain Irish citizens; there is nothing to prevent them.  If they were born here they are entitled, under our Nationality Bill, to be regarded as citizens. There is nothing whatever that I can see in our Nationality Bill that makes them aliens.  Deputy McGilligan spoke of people born here and said that we are making aliens of them and that we are subjecting them to all those restrictions by this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

      <P>If people of Irish descent are not citizens they are free to become citizens if they desire so to do.  If they have reasons for not becoming part of our political community, I take it these reasons are sufficiently good from their point of view to counterbalance any disadvantages that may arise from being regarded as outside our community. Our Nationality Bill, as far as those who have any attachment to this country goes, is very wide.  It was wide when it was introduced into the Dáil.  It was wider still when it left. We went to the utmost limit to make it easy for anybody of Irish connections to become a member of our political community and be regarded as an Irish citizen.  Therefore, when we talk of aliens we are talking of people who, although they have Irish associations, for some good reason or other prefer association elsewhere.  And I think we ought to have primary regard to our people here whose destiny and whose whole fate is <Col N="2042" /> immediately bound up with our community here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacDermot, apparently, is going to succeed again in bringing with him into the Division Lobby Deputies on the opposite benches whose whole outlook has been proved by their past conduct to be quite the opposite of his.  Why they should subordinate their viewpoint on this to his I do not know.  But it is quite clear Deputy MacDermot has a conception of common status different from us.  I notice that the former Attorney-General has become a disciple of his in that regard.  There is no evidence that when Deputy Costello was Attorney-General he held any such views as he appears to hold now as to the implications of common status.  There was no accepted definition of what is meant, and nothing to show the basis of it.  There was common recognition that there were certain rights and privileges which were accepted and bestowed in various States of what is called the British Commonwealth.  But one of the things I would like to remind Deputy MacDermot not accepted by the representatives of this country or by the representatives of South Africa or any of the countries I know, except Britain, was that there was anything like common citizenship.  Even the British did not hold that there was common citizenship for all the States. They recognised clearly that it was the right of any one of the States of the Commonwealth to define who were to be its own nationals and to impose any restrictions they thought necessary on people coming from other parts of the Commonwealth.  What is the use in pretending that there was common citizenship and that this common status meant anything of that sort? It did not.  What it did convey we are providing for by reciprocal action. We are making full provision for the maintenance of any rights or privileges to which members of one State of the Commonwealth, travelling into another, are entitled.  We are doing that by order.  Once this set of Bills is passed we can, by order, make available all those privileges in virtue of the fact that, by law in some of those States, similar privileges are <Col N="2043" /> allowed to our citizens.  But if any of these privileges are denied to our citizens, we would be free to deny similar privileges.</P>
    <P>The whole of the criticism of this Bill, it seems to me, arises from a misconception of what is the existing position and what changes are being made by this Bill and the previous Bill.  The big change is that the term &ldquo;British subject&rdquo; will no longer run in this country; that we will have our own nationals, defined in our own way by our own law as we are entitled to have.  With regard to the continuance of the Aliens Order of 1925, even though we are repealing the Act upon which it is based we provide in this Bill for making a similar order.  The order can be amended in certain respects that will make it immediately recognisable as an order made under this Act.  Talking about passports, and the rest of it, there is no necessity whatever for any departure.  We can have them when this Act is passed if we think it advisable.  Agreements, we are told, will go by the board if this Bill is passed.  Nothing of the kind; it does not interfere with any agreement made and any existing agreement can be continued when this Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>Now, with regard to the Constitution: the Attorney-General dealt with the points made by Deputy McGilligan with regard to an apparent contravention of the Constitution.  There is nothing of the kind in this.  The powers that are given in this and the orders that can be made are exactly the powers that are given and the orders that can be made under the existing law.  There is nothing that I know of that we are putting in here that is not already possible under the existing law.</P>

Supposing we get to that point, will it then be regarded as a liberal measure under this Constitution to have a Minister in power in a position to make discriminations between citizens and enable the residences of some of them to be broken into and entered and the persons of others to be arrested, and whether the same will not apply to the generality of people?</P>

      <P>The majority of Section 5, as I read it, is simply giving in the future power which exists at the moment.  I said that it was a liberal measure, and I believe that it is a liberal measure.  There are numbers of States that deny aliens the rights and liberties that we are giving to them here.  I used the word &ldquo;war-time,&rdquo; and the Deputy made the most of it.  I used it simply in this connection.  I said that the nature of restrictions and so on that are imposed on aliens at such times was known to the full extent to us who have lived through the war period.  I did not say at all that these measures here were for a war period.</P>

      <P>I have nothing to say on that matter.  With regard to the liberality of the measure, I say again that it is liberal.  There are several States, in the United States of America for instance, which do not give the rights and privileges which we propose to give in regard to the holding of rights to property; and a number of other States, both European and Asiatic, impose conditions far beyond anything we are suggesting here and restrictions far beyond anything we are suggesting here.</P>
      <P>Now, with regard to the Commonwealth and the points that have been raised by Deputy MacDermot and others: full provision is made in this Bill for continuing the privileges that have been recognised for individual citizens coming from or going into one or other of the States up to the present. They can all be provided for.  With regard to the point made by Deputy Norton about the change of name, there may be a reason for it and a licence can be given, if good cause is shown to the Minister and the Minister has had an opportunity of examining the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo; It is not necessary, I think, to spend much time on this Bill.  It is simply to remove from Article 3 certain restrictive words which created, or purported to create, a local citizenship in the sense that the privileges and obligations of a citizen were within the area of the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State; in other words, this Article 3 is of a limited and local character.  In practice, of course, it was not so.  The strict terms of this were never in fact adhered to and the object of the Bill is simply to make the Constitution comformable to the practice by deleting the limiting words of the Article.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly the words themselves, every person, etc., who conforms to certain conditions is a citizen of the Free State and &ldquo;shall within the limits of the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) enjoy the privileges and be subject to the obligations of such citizenship&rdquo; have a very plain meaning.  They purport to limit the area in which these privileges shall be enjoyed to a certain area&mdash;the area of the jurisdiction of Saorstát Eireann. The object of the Bill, whatever may be held to be the extent of the limitation, is to remove it.  In any case, even if by some construction the words could be held not to have a limiting effect, I think they should not be there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, nobody objects to this measure, but to my mind it is rather futile.  I should like to know who has stood over the definite <Col N="2050" /> statement that these words have a limiting effect.  The President dodges that and says they have a plain meaning. The word &ldquo;only&rdquo; is not there. It is not &ldquo;shall only within the limits.&rdquo; What is it that is marked out?  The enjoyment of privileges and being subject to obligations.  That, of course, will be governed by the law&mdash;the law affecting whatever these privileges and obligations are.  Remember that Article 12 gives the Government of the Irish Free State the right to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the country.  Surely these words give an extra-territorial effect to the laws of the country.  If they do, surely our nationality laws have an extra-territorial effect, and there is no limit by reason of this.  If the word &ldquo;only&rdquo; was put in there might be some reason in saying that a definite construction must be put on it. I never heard a doubt raised about it, and I should like to hear of a case in which a doubt was raised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    <P>The following appeared on the Order Paper:</P>
    <P>Seanad Eireann has passed the following resolution:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That it is desirable that a conference be held between members representing the Seanad and the Dáil for the purpose of considering the amendments made by the Seanad to the Electoral (Revision of Constituencies) Bill, 1934, with which the Dáil has disagreed and on which the Seanad has insisted:</P>

      <P>I do not know what the procedure is for dealing with a resolution of this kind&mdash;whether it has to be moved or whether I should simply <Col N="2052" /> state the Government's attitude towards it.  The Government's attitude is that we cannot see our way to accept the suggestion that has come down from Seanad Eireann.  The Bill was fully discussed in this House and also in the Seanad and, as it stands, the Government are satisfied that it is an improvement and that it embodies the ideas which the Government wish to have passed into law.  The Government cannot see that any suggestion that was not made when the Bill was before this House or the Seanad is likely to be made which would be of any advantage.  There were certain amendments suggested in the Seanad to the Bill as sent up from the Dáil and while, both in this House and in the Seanad, suggestions were made that we did not pay the respect that was due to county constituencies, the chief amendment offered in the Seanad erred just as much in the same direction.  The difficulties that we had in arranging boundaries were repeated in the amendment offered by the Seanad.  They did not respect boundaries any more than they were respected in the Bill as introduced and passed here.  I cannot see that any useful purpose would be served by the suggestion offered by the Seanad and therefore do not propose to agree to accept it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that there is a strong case for some consultation with the Seanad in this matter.  I have in mind one amendment which was discussed here in reference to the constituency of Kerry.  There was one amendment with reference to one constituency which was accepted by the Dáil on a free vote.  The House decided in favour of retaining Limerick, I think it was, as one constituency. In the case of Kerry the <Col N="2053" /> matter was also left to a free vote of the Dáil and an amendment in my name and that of Deputy O'Sullivan was only beaten by a majority of one or two.  Shortly after that decision had been taken by the House some of the Kerry Deputies, who had voted against the amendment, actually came to me and asked by what method they could revoke the decision they had taken.  Apparently, they did not understand that the Whips were off in relation to that amendment.  If they were given the opportunity again, if I interpreted rightly what they said, they would have preferred to have left the Kerry constituency as it was; that is, having seven members instead of being divided into two constituencies of four members and three members.</P>
      <P>I am speaking without having looked at the Seanad amendment, but I think included in it was a proposition to retain Kerry as a seven-member constituency.  If that is so, there is a case for discussion between a Committee of the two Houses, to see whether an agreed Schedule could not be arrived at which would satisfy all Parties.  I do not see that any harm could be done by having a consultation of that kind.  In fact, it might be a very good precedent to create, so that such discussions would take place between Committees of the two Houses sitting jointly where differences have arisen.  As a result of such a meeting on this occasion there would probably be a Schedule arrived at which would be more satisfactory, from every point of view, both to Deputies and to the electors.</P>

      <P>I should like to appeal to the Minister to give this matter further consideration.  There is no immediate hurry to give immediate effect to this Bill.  Nothing is to be gained by rushing it.  As far as I can understand, there are many Deputies, on all sides of the House, who did not properly understand proposals which were carried, simply by a majority and without reasonable cause.  As Deputy Lynch pointed out, a precedent might be created which would bring about a better understanding in important measures of this kind.</P>

      <P>In making this appeal I should like to point out that the Bill, once it becomes law, is one that cannot be changed for a long time.  This should not be approached in a Party spirit, but in a spirit of reasonableness, and after calm consideration by everyone concerned.  There are local matters which were not taken into account when the Bill was going through this House, and I question if they were before the Seanad either.  Both Parties might be susceptible to reason if they had a little more information.  There are anomalies in the Bill, particularly with regard to Cork and other constituencies, which would want to be reconsidered.</P>

      <P>I do not think I have anything to add.  The amendment proposed regarding Kerry was unquestionably carried by a majority, as were most of the amendments that were put up, but, if they were not accepted unanimously, they would have to be carried by a majority of some kind.  I do not think the Bill was rushed when going through the House.  There was a great deal of discussion, not with many Deputies on the other side of the House, but with a few, and with some Deputies on my own side.  When Deputies belonging to one constituency came to me to discuss the proposals in the Bill, I found it difficult to get agreement at any rate on my own side. If there was any agreement, generally, in the end, it was to leave the Bill as it was, because the amendments suggested raised greater difficulties and greater anomalies.  Even if we had a Committee of the Seanad and the Dáil sitting together to discuss the Bill, I do not see that we could arrive at any better conclusion.</P>
      <P>Question put: &ldquo;That the Dáil do not concur with the Seanad in their request for a Joint Conference.&rdquo;</P>
