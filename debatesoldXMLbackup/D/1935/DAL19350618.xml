      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will state what steps, if any, have been or are being taken to effect an agreement with the French Government, whereby a larger quota of lobsters, crayfish and similar fish may be exported from the Free State to France.</P>

      <NameTxt>Vice-President (Mr. O Ceallaigh) for Minister for External Affairs</NameTxt>
      <P>The French Government had maintained the position that the Saorstát had exceeded its quota in these classes of fish for last year to such an extent that no export could be allowed this year. However, following further representations, a quota of 400 quintals for the period 15th May to 31st December, was obtained.  Every effort is being made to improve our trade position with France, and the Government is giving particular attention to the interests of the lobster fishing industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware of the urgent necessity for the erection of labourers' cottages at Tullow, County Carlow, to replace the insanitary houses there; if he will state the number of such cottages which have been erected within a radius of two miles of that town under the Housing Acts, 1932-34, and whether any recent proposals have been submitted to his Department for the erection of cottages at Tullow; and if so, for how many such cottages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>A survey of the housing needs of Tullow was made last <Col N="395" /> October from which it appears that 106 cottages are required in the town to house persons coming within the definition of &ldquo;agricultural labourer.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>No cottages have been erected since 1932 within a radius of two miles of the town, but the Carlow Board of Health included sites for the erection of 28 cottages in the Tullow district in a compulsory purchase order made in 1934.  These sites were, however, excluded from the Compulsory Purchase Order, as the Inspector who held the public local inquiry in the matter found them unsuitable.</P>
      <P>The Board of Health were communicated with in October last as to the necessity for the early acquisition of other sites in the town, and they have since included sites for the erection of 30 cottages in a Compulsory Purchase Order which they made on the 11th instant.  I understand also that the Board intend to acquire sites for the erection of a further 30 cottages at Tullow under a proposed new scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Séamus A. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that Mr. John P. Swann, of the Dublin Spring and Sheet Metal Works, and Mr. Joseph H. Dixon, solicitor, having been informed by representatives of the Minister's Department that if their projected company for the manufacture of springs for motor and other vehicles could deal with the demand a tariff would be imposed, decided to promote a company called the &ldquo;Galtee Steel and Iron Works, Ltd.&rdquo;; if he is further aware that the promoters of the proposed company, who are all Irish nationals, incurred considerable expense in promoting the scheme; if a licence has been granted to a British firm to manufacture the very articles which the Irish company was being formed to manufacture; if he is further aware that, as a result of the belief that such licence has been granted, the promoters of the proposed Irish company have ceased to operate further, to the great loss of the people of Tipperary, and if he will make a statement on the circumstances of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement in the first part of the question is inaccurate. Mr. John P. Swann was in communication with my Department for a considerable time, and certain proposals <Col N="400" /> which he made for the extension of the duty on imported springs were not acceptable.  Mr. Joseph H. Dixon, solicitor, was informed to this effect in a letter dated 20th July, 1934.  Following further representations, Mr. Swann and Mr. Dixon were informed that I was prepared to make a recommendation for the extension of the duty provided Mr. Swann's business was reorganised, and my attitude in this respect has not altered.  No licence under the Control of Manufactures Acts has been granted to an English company for the manufacture of springs, but I have arranged to issue a licence to a new company which is to be incorporated in the Saorstát for the production of various types of components of motor and horse-drawn vehicles, including springs.  This does not involve a breach of any undertaking given to Mr. Swann.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether any customs facilities are granted to persons visiting this country who bring motor cars with them for the purpose of touring through the country; whether such tourists are prejudicially affected by the duties on motors, particularly on secondhand cars; and whether any customs difficulties are put in the way of tourists and visitors who bring with them full supplies of such outfit and necessaries as they may require during their stay here.</P>

      <P>(1)  On production of a triptyque or tarnet; or</P>

      <Col N="401" /> (3)  In the case of a car brought from Northern Ireland on bond being entered into in an amount sufficient to cover the duty on the car, the bond being discharged subsequently on re-exportation.</P>
    <P>With regard to (1), members of an automobile club belonging to the International Federation of Recognised Automobile Clubs, or of an association belonging to the International Touring Alliance, may arrange with the club, or association, for the issue to them of a triptyque or tarnet.  These documents are recognised internationally for touring purposes, and this country is a party to the International Conventions bearing on the matter.</P>
    <P>These facilities are as extensive as those available in other countries, and consequently tourists are not prejudicially affected by the customs duties on motor cars (whether new or secondhand) in this country.</P>
    <P>Tourists and visitors are allowed to bring in, free of duty, all private effects ordinarily necessary for use by persons entering for holiday purposes, including articles which may have to be provided by persons who take furnished houses, such as blankets, sheets, knives.  The concession extends to golf clubs, fishing and other sporting tackle, and to perambulators, bicycles, cameras, etc.</P>
    <P>The simple fact is that, so far from customs difficulties being put in the way of tourists, every possible customs facility is extended to such persons, and in no case is a charge of customs duty made in respect of belongings for personal use which are brought in and subsequently brought out of this country.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Nos. 12 and 13 together.  Owing to the fact that assessments for the years 1933-34 and 1934-35 are held up pending a decision in the Supreme Court, no final figures can be supplied for those years.  Subject to the decision in the Supreme Court, the revenue (income tax and surtax) assessed and collectable in respect of stallion fees is anticipated to be approximately £10,000 for 1932-33, £7,500 for 1933-34, and £6,300 for 1934-35.  The number of owners of thoroughbred stallions concerned is estimated at 31 for 1932-33, 26 for 1933-34, and 25 for 1934-35; while the number of thoroughbred stallions involved in the assessments is estimated at 46 for 1932-33, 38 for 1933-34, and 38 for 1934-35.</P>

      <P>I am aware that a number of persons, including those mentioned by name in the question, failed to make application for compensation under the Damage to Property (Compensation) (Amendment) Act, <Col N="403" /> 1933, within the time prescribed by the Rules of Court framed under the Act.</P>
      <P>The question of late applications has, however, been the subject of a recent judgment of the High Court, the general effect of which is that a circuit judge has power to extend the time for lodging applications under the Act where it appears to him that such extension is just and reasonable. Accordingly, it is open to any person to apply to the Circuit Court for an extension of time to enable him to lodge a claim for compensation under the Act, and it is within the discretion of the circuit judge to grant or refuse such an application.</P>
      <P>Any person who intends to make a claim for compensation would do well to take the necessary steps in the matter without delay.  State solicitors will be instructed to oppose strenuously the granting of an extension of time where the claim is not lodged on or before the 30th September, 1935.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 5 a new section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>5. &mdash;(1) Section 63 of the Principal Act is hereby amended in the following respects and shall be construed and have effect accordingly, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  by the substitution in clause (i) of paragraph (a) of the said section of the words &ldquo;and was continuously employed (whether such employment commenced before or after the grant of such licence) whole-time, for a period of five years ending on the day preceding the critical date in the operation of the said vehicles, either by such licensee or by such licensee and his predecessor or predecessors in title to such business&rdquo; for the words &ldquo;and was so employed continuously for a period of five years ending on the day preceding the critical date&rdquo; now contained in the said clause;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  by the substitution in paragraph (b) of the said section of the words &ldquo;(whether such employment commenced before or after the grant of such licence) whole-time, in the operation of the said vehicles, either by such licensee or by such licensee and his predecessor <Col N="408" /> or predecessors in title to such business&rdquo; for the words &ldquo;whole-time by such licensee in the operation of the vehicles used for the purposes of the business authorised by such licence to be carried on&rdquo; now contained in the said paragraph;</P>
    <P>(c)  by the substitution in paragraph (c) of the said section of the words &ldquo;either by such licensee or by such licensee and his predecessor or predecessors in title to such business&rdquo; for the words &ldquo;by such licensee&rdquo; now contained in the said paragraph.</P>
    <P>(2)  This section shall have and be deemed to have had effect as from the passing of the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>When this matter was mentioned here on Friday last, Deputy McGilligan raised some questions concerning possible interpretations that might be placed upon the section of the Principal Act which has been amended by this amendment.  I have looked into the matter and I find that no representations have been made to us from any quarter that further amendment was required.  I think it is unlikely that the very narrow interpretation which Deputy McGilligan suggested will be placed upon that section when it does come to be interpreted by the courts.  The amendment which was inserted in the Seanad meets the only question that has been raised so far by those interested in the interpretation of the relevant section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister in a position to state that no case would arise such as was mentioned by Deputy McGilligan with regard to continuous service by men employed on particular vehicles?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No such case has arisen, and I am satisfied that the wording of the Act is such as to prevent its arising.  I cannot say definitely that a judge will not put a particular interpretation on it but I think the interpretation that Deputy McGilligan suggested might be put on it, is most unlikely.  In any event the practice of persons operating transport services has been to use the full service in the areas over which they are <Col N="409" /> operating.  It has never been the practice to use one set of vehicles for one service and only for that service. Consequently, even if the courts were to put the very narrow interpretation which Deputy McGilligan suggested on the section, such a case would hardly arise in practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Assuming that such an interpretation were put on it and that a person lost compensation by such a decision, is it the Minister's intention that that should be allowed to occur?  Is he in a position to make another amendment of the Act to meet any case of that kind?  I assume for the moment that no such case has arisen.  If such a case as was suggested by Deputy McGilligan here the last day were likely to arise, what is the Minister's attitude with regard to that or is such a person to be disentitled to compensation?  In other words, is the Bill exhaustive and is it the Minister's view that if such cases arise they can be dealt with under its existing provisions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is intended that any person employed in the operation of a transport service entirely, prior to the acquisition of the service, should be compensated, if not given alternative employment.  If the rather peculiar interpretation which Deputy McGilligan suggested were placed on the section by the court we would have to consider an amendment of the law in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that also hold good with regard to any other technicality not covered by this particular amendment, which would preclude a person who had been employed in a service of this kind from getting compensation? There may be some other infirmity in the enactment that would preclude his getting compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 12:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 39, sub-sections (1) and (2). The sub-sections deleted and the following new sub-sections substituted therefor:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Wages payable to a workman employed at licensed premises shall be at a rate not less than the rate generally recognised by trade unions and employers as the rate applicable to workmen employed in a similar kind of work at similar licensed premises.</P>
      <P>(2)  The conditions of employment (other than the rate of wages) of a workman employed at licensed premises shall not be less advantageous than the conditions of employment generally recognised by trade unions and employers as the conditions of employment applicable to workmen employed in a similar kind of work at similar licensed premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was some discussion in the Seanad on the wages clause in the Bill, and I agreed to bring in an amendment with exactly the same wording as appears in the Cereals Act, governing wage conditions in flour mills.  We have some experience of the working of the clause in these mills, and that experience has proved satisfactory.  I may say that the idea to which we desired to give expression was that areas should be fixed within which certain standard rates should operate. The clause in the Cereals Act is <Col N="413" /> worded in this way, and the effect of it was that they could fix wage areas.  That is the reason we changed the amendment in this case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The standard as defined here is the recognised trade union conditions. It is a matter for negotiation really between the parties.  If, say, you have five bacon factories in an area like Monaghan and Cavan, an area in which the conditions might be looked upon as more or less uniform, and if one factory were paying less than the other four, it would be compelled to give the same conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it follow that one nearer Cavan than Monaghan would be compelled to pay a different rate of wages to that paid in Monaghan?  A case might arise where a factory would be contiguous to the boundary line of the area and still might be paying different wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  We have, of course, only a short experience of the flour-milling business, but it appears that this clause has worked very satisfactorily in that business.  I do not know what the areas are.  I just mention Cavan and Monaghan as a likely area, as they have the same type of bacon trade, and would probably pay the same wages.  I should like to point out, however, that a small factory in Dublin would be compelled to pay the same wages as a large factory.  The effect of the amendment is not that a big factory in a city would pay a certain rate of wages, and that a small factory in that city would pay another rate.  The effect of it is that certain areas will pay a certain rate of wages, whether the factories in them are big or small.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether a certain return recently issued by the Statistics Branch of the Department of Industry and Commerce has come under the Minister's notice. <Col N="414" /> An examination of that return shows that there has been almost as big a difference as could be imagined in increases in wages in some classes of employment.  One particular case occurs to my mind.  There were 688 persons employed in a particular industry.  The average wages in 1931 were, approximately, 225 per cent. over the corresponding average paid to the persons employed in the industry in 1933.  Despite that, there has been a reduction in the number of persons employed.  I do not know whether the same big changes would be effected by this amendment.  If there are to be zones, how are you going to schedule them so as to ensure that there will be anything like a level rate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That would really be a matter for agreement between the trades unions and the employers.  I do not think that under this section the Minister could be asked to interpret the area.  If it were reported to the Minister that in a particular area one factory refused to pay the recognised rate, then he might be asked to interfere in the case of that factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>Who will define the area under this amendment?  I understood the Minister to say that the same rates of wages will apply to a particular area, whether you have big or small factories in that area.  For instance, you may have a factory with a small output.  That factory may be situated in some small town.  Will that factory be compelled to pay the same rate of wages as big firms like Denny's and O'Mara's?  The output per man is, of course, much greater in the large factory than it is in the small one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the amendment would be that if there was a small factory, say, in Waterford, then it would have to pay the same rate of <Col N="415" /> wages as Denny's, in Waterford.  The amendment has been put in really for the purpose of making areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That will have to be done by negotiation between the two parties.  There is no other way of doing it.  So far as an area is concerned, I presume that if a trade union thought it had a grievance or, on the other hand, if a factory thought it had a grievance, one of the two parties would bring the other to court and seek for an order defining the area.  That is not provided for in the amendment, but it is the only sort of appeal that can be resorted to, so far as I can see.</P>

It speaks of &ldquo;a similar kind of work at similar licensed premises.&rdquo;  That does not mean premises similarly licensed.  I take it that similar licensed premises would mean premises of much the same size.  My reading of the amendment leads me to the conclusion that the scale of wages will not be level in a particular area as between a small and a large factory.</P>

In the discussions that took place on it in the Seanad I did not speak for or against, but the Seanad decided in favour of a three-year term rather than a two-year term.  I do not know if Deputies have any very strong views on this.  I think everyone can see that there are arguments for and against the three-year term and the two-year term.  If the members of the Board prove to be satisfactory, then we would all prefer the three-year term.  If, on the other hand, they were unsatisfactory, we would prefer the two-year term.

      <P>(c)  subject to conditions approved by the Minister, sell bacon or establish a marketing organisation for the sale of bacon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment was pressed upon me by the Seanad and I do not know that it is going to prove of much value. However, I do not see any great objection to having it inserted in the Bill. The Seanad thought that the Bacon Board might turn its attention to the organised marketing of bacon for foreign consumption.  I thought that, if such a thing were to arise, new legislation would be required.  This amendment gives the Board power to <Col N="422" /> set up a marketing scheme in a modest way.  It is also laid down that it must be subject to the control of the Minister. I think the amendment cannot do any great harm.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter arose on Report Stage here.  It was feared that the Board might make an order and bring it into operation immediately.  The Prices Board is not likely to do a thing like that, but we have put in, as a safeguard, <Col N="423" /> a provision that the order cannot come into operation until the following Monday.  It was the practice heretofore with the curers to meet on Friday and agree upon a price for the following week.  That price is sent to the various buyers on Saturday and they start to buy on Monday.  We are, more or less, following that practice in the Bill.  We assume that they will meet on Friday and that the price can be published over the wireless or in the Press so that farmers will have a clear idea, at latest by Monday, of what the price will be.</P>

That is the reason that the Curers' Association held their meetings on Friday. The prices could then be sent out for the following Monday.  I can promise that the influence of the Department will be brought to bear upon them to meet on Friday.  There are three producers on that Board and, naturally, they will be anxious that everybody should know what the price is going to be.  We do not expect these prices will be changed more than three or four times in the year.</P>

    <P>41.  Section 147, sub-section (3). Lines 6 to 10, inclusive, deleted and the following substituted therefore:&mdash;&ldquo;proper, subject however to the following limitation, namely, that the total amount payable under this paragraph in respect of all carcases of that grade of that class purchased by licensees and registered minor curers during such sale period shall not, unless the Board is of opinion that it is just and equitable that the said total amount should not be so limited, exceed a sum calculated by reference to the total weights of such carcases and a price equal to the difference between the appointed price for carcases of that grade of that class and the hypothetical price for carcases of that grade of that class.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>These amendments are all to the same effect.  As the Bill stands, the Board could not pay out a higher bounty than the difference between the appointed price and the hypothetical price.  The altering of these prices <Col N="426" /> may lead to difficulty.  The hypothetical price does not make any difference to the seller, or producer, of the pigs.  So long as the appointed price is all right, he will not trouble. The altering of the hypothetical price may present difficulty to the Board and it may be well to give them power to pay more than the difference at times.  It will be easier to regulate matters in that way, and to find out absolutely the limit between the two prices.  This gives the Board greater freedom of action.  Naturally, it can only pay out what is collected in levies at certain times.  There is power to borrow because at times the Board may be insolvent.</P>

      <P>In this Budget the Minister has laid under contribution &mdash;possibly he was constrained to do so&mdash;nearly every possible commodity except, perhaps, cabbage-stumps, pluiricin and jelly fish.  Indeed, the Midas touch of the Minister would, for revenue purposes, almost turn a dog's bark into gold.  The Minister will very likely ask what could be done in the circumstances. He had to meet certain expenditure and he will say that he tried to distribute the burden in the most equitable way possible.  The Free State is an infant State, still in its nonage. I am afraid its growth has been over stimulated and that it has bitten off more than it can chew.  The legislative machine is working at such limited mail speed and is turning out Acts of Parliament so rapidly that panting time toils after them in vain. Considering the resources of the State, I think the cost of administration is entirely too high.  It has been reckoned that nearly one out of every seven adult persons in the Free State is a public official of some kind.  I am of opinion that, without impairing the efficiency of the administration, the cost could be considerably reduced.  I think also that in regard to some services there is a very great waste of money.  We have, for instance, premium bulls and prize cows but their progeny is ruthlessly slaughtered.  A county councillor recently, in language which may be considered a bull but was, in fact, pointedly appropriate, said, that the beach in front of his residence was &ldquo;alive&rdquo; with dead calves.  That is a state of affairs by no means uncommon in this country.  Again the expenditure on free meat is wasteful <Col N="429" /> and ridiculous to excess.  When I say that I do not suggest that the distribution might not be defended and might not be justifiable in certain circumstances.  It is a well-known fact, however, and I am sure it is well-known to Deputies in this House, that a great deal of that beef is being given to professional beggars who never did and never will do a day's work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the wheat and beet schemes I am entirely in agreement, subject to certain limitations.  It is quite possible that, if the policy of the Government is carried out in its entirety, there will be in this country such over-production that there will be a surplus for which there will be no market abroad and for which there can be no profitable market in the Free State owing to the restriction of livestock.  The ideal economic State, unquestionably, is the one that can produce all it wants for home consumption and that can consume everything that is produced at home; but if the wheat policy, especially, is carried out on too extensive a scale, much as I support the growing of wheat, it is bound to lead to such a surplus of wheat that it will have to be used, as they use it in some of the Western States of America, for fuel and firing purposes, because there will be no cattle or pigs in the country to consume it.  I would point out to the Minister&mdash;and I say it in the most perfect good faith and not through any desire to find fault with this Party or any other Party&mdash;that in the ultimate analysis taxation sent Charles I to the block and sent Louis XVI to the guillotine, and there may arise such a state of distress and poverty in this country that even the citizens, if they are hopelessly oppressed, may be entitled to revolt even against their own Government. If their grievances are not redressed; if reason, pleading at the bar of justice is spat upon and rejected, the day may come when the citizens would be entitled, provided there is a reasonable chance of success, to rise against and overthrow a Government that places on them a burden which is <Col N="430" /> intolerable and which they cannot bear.</P>

It has become a food. The tax on tea will press very severely on the very poor section of the community, and I can assure the Minister that housekeepers, to use a biblical expression, will not rise up and call him blessed.  However, I am a confirmed optimist, and I believe that every cloud has a silver lining Happily, in this country the lining is better than silver, it is gold.  I understand that there has been discovered in a dried-up lake in the delectable county of Wicklow an auriferous deposit which is estimated to be worth £17,000,000 of money.</P>

With these few remarks, I hope that the Minister will be able to see his way&mdash; of course, he may be subject to difficulties which we do not appreciate&mdash;to reduce the cost of administration through the various Departments and to put a check on wasteful expenditure on unproductive services.  If he can do that, he will earn the thanks and gratitude of the whole community.</P>

      <P>Deputy Little, apparently, overlooks the fact that this Finance Bill is the most important Bill that comes before the House during the year, that it covers all the activities of the State, and that every member of this House has, not only the right, but the responsibility to his constituents&mdash;particularly to those who are going to be most severely hit by the extra taxation&mdash;to give expression to his views and to point out to the Minister that, in his opinion, the burdens which the Finance Bill will place on the people of this country are far greater than the country should be asked to bear.  I want to get back, Sir, to an aspect of this Budget that I dealt with during the course of the Budget Resolutions.  In the course of that discussion I made the statement that, as a result of the Government's activities and as a result of their taxation upon the necessaries of life&mdash; their quotas, import orders, and so on&mdash;the cost of living and the cost of the necessaries of life have been increased to such a point that, in my opinion, it would be equivalent to a reduction of 4/- per week in the wages of a working man with an average family.  The Government's organ, a day or two afterwards, took that matter up and wrote a subleader, in which they said that the statement in another newspaper, which had reported my statement that the increases brought about by the Government were equivalent to a reduction of 4/- per week in the wages of an average working man, was an exaggeration of 800 per cent.  The <i>Irish Press</i> told us that the increase to the average family in this country would not be more than sixpence per week.  Is there any member <Col N="432" /> of this House of any Party who knows anything about the cost of running a house&mdash;is there any member of the Labour Party&mdash;who would agree for one moment with the statement in the Government newspaper that the increase would not amount to more than sixpence per week?  Let me deal with just a few of the necessaries.  Tea is taxed to the extent of 4d. a lb.  The average family will consume at least a lb. of tea in the week.  With regard to sugar, the Budget itself, of course, imposes an impost of over ¼d. a lb., but it is well known that the residents of the Free State are paying at least a penny a lb. more for sugar than is being paid in Northern Ireland or Great Britain.  I suggest that a low estimate of the consumption of sugar in a week by the average family would be seven lbs.  That will be agreed, I think.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have gone to the trouble of making enquiries from the heads of a number of families and in some cases I was told that the consumption would be ten or 11 lbs.  In other cases the consumption would be as low as five lbs. or six lbs., but in only one case where there was a family did I get a figure lower than five lbs.  I am striking a fairly low average at 7 lbs. and I am speaking of a family of five persons&mdash;a man and his wife and three children.  I do not think I can be accused of putting the average too high at 7 lbs.  Butter is a very important item, and at present, and for a considerable time, the consumers of butter in this country have been paying 7d. to 8d. a lb. more for creamery butter than is being paid in Northern Ireland or Great Britain.  The Minister may say that there is a very good reason for that.  I am concerned with proving my point that, as a result of Government activity, the cost of living has been so increased as to be equivalent to an increase of at least 4/- a week in the case of the ordinary working man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Flour to date has increased in some districts&mdash;and we know it will go still <Col N="433" /> higher in price when the cost of the wheat subsidy comes directly on the consumer&mdash;by 4d. per stone and we know that bakers' flour is from 10/- to 12/- per sack dearer here than on the other side.  We know that in many towns, including the town in which I live myself and in the City of Limerick, they have increased the price of the 4lb. loaf by 1d., and we know that the bakers have said that, when the full cost of the wheat subsidy comes on this year, there will have to be a further increase in the 4lb. loaf of 1d. to 1½d.  There is a duty of 5/- a ton on coal coming in here and there is no way of evading that duty, because we are not allowed to import any but British coal.  It means more than 5/- to the consumer because people are to-day compelled to pay 10/- per ton, which includes the 5/- per ton duty, more for coal than they were paying prior to the coal-cattle pact.  With regard to tobacco, the Minister may say that it is a luxury but I do not think he will get many people to agree with him in that.  There is another increase in that.  I am speaking, as I say, of the necessaries of life and I am leaving out what I might call borderline cases, articles in respect of which there will be a certain amount of disagreement as to whether they are luxuries or not. I am prepared to prove to any person who is open to conviction that, as a result of the activities of the present Government, the cost of living has been so increased as to be equivalent to 4/-, and, perhaps, 5/-, a week in the case of the average family in this country.</P>
    <P>In this Budget there are a great number of what might be described as hidden taxes&mdash;hidden in the sense that they have not yet been brought home to the ordinary person in the country and have not been published in the newspapers.  We know that in one of the Resolutions there is a schedule of ten pages of duties.  In so far as those duties are imposed for a protective purpose and to help industry at home and in so far as the articles so tariffed are being produced at home to meet home requirements, I have no objection whatever to them, but in <Col N="434" /> this Bill there are numerous articles, which are not produced here, and of whose production here there is no prospect, taxed and heavily taxed for one purpose and one purpose alone&mdash; to get in revenue.  The Government take great credit to themselves for their activities in building houses in this country and I, for one, have never denied their right to credit for their activity in that direction, but it does seem to me a very peculiar state of affairs, when the Government claim that they are so anxious to build houses and when they know that it is essential that so far as the vast majority of these housing schemes are concerned the houses should be built at the least possible expense and let at the lowest possible rent, because a great number of them are to accommodate people who are being taken from the slums and who are unable to pay high rents, that practically everything used in the building of houses&mdash; cement, glass, wallpaper, and so on&mdash;is taxed in this Budget.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce told us within the last three weeks that the glass factory, the cement factories and, I think, the paper factory would not be in working order for two years.  Therefore, we are to have 5/- a ton on cement; we are to have a duty on glass; and we are to have a duty on paper&mdash;wallpaper and other classes of paper.  These imposts will necessarily have a big bearing on the cost of the house.  They will increase the price of building and, therefore, will increase the rent to be paid by the tenants.  There is another point: many of those poor people &mdash;I suppose nearly all of them&mdash;will make an effort when going into those houses to have them furnished and decorated a little better than their old homes and everything they buy for those houses, even the simplest thing they will require to make it somewhat better than their old slums, is taxed.  As I say, in the case of furniture and such articles which can be, and are being, produced at home, I have no objection, but I do think that it is unfair and unjust that the Minister should put such heavy imposts on these particular articles.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="435" /> It seems to me that since the State was set up no Budget has been introduced in this House which will lean so heavily on the people of this country, and particularly heavily on those who are least able to bear it, as this Budget.  I would ask the Minister and the members of the Labour Party, when they speak of wages of 22/- a week on forestry schemes and the starvation wages, as they have been described by Deputy Norton, in the Post Office Service, to remember that they are no longer worth 22/- a week. The wages which Deputy Norton described as starvation wages will be considerably lower after the passage of this Bill, because the 22/- per week will not purchase as much food when this Bill becomes law as before the Minister introduced his Budget.  It is a bad Budget, in my opinion, and I think the Minister will find it very hard to justify it either in this House or in the country.</P>

      <P>One of the results of this Budget which has not been mentioned so far in the House is the cancelling of numerous contracts entered into prior to the introduction of the Budget. In many cases contracts for reconstruction, for new roofings, or for engineering work, have been so gravely affected by the Budget that they have been cancelled.  On top of that we have a restive labour movement against the increased cost of living, with the result that there are many in industry to-day who can foresee the repercussions of this Budget in the next six months.  There is not the slightest doubt whatever that up and down the country this Budget will bring about an appeal, in the first instance, for an increase of wages, and, in the second instance, possible strikes, together with all that bad feeling and all that aftermath of bitterness which take such a long time to get rid of, and from which business takes such a long time to recover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other evening here Deputy Hugo Flinn, when he got up to defend the Budget, created a sort of clever smoke screen, in his attempt to draw a red herring across the trail and get away <Col N="436" /> completely from the Budget.  He baited the Opposition by saying: &ldquo;Come and tell us where you will reduce any expenditure.  Is there one single item in this Budget which you, as an Opposition, will suggest to the Minister that he can dispense with, and in doing so hurt no individual member of the community or section of the community?  He proceeded along those lines and, towards the end, referred to Deputy Fionan Lynch's Department and the manner in which he handled his own Department. Then, as a wind-up, he said that if we have an economic position here where we have to pay to send things out, as well as pay to bring things in, that economic position must be got rid of at all costs.  But he made no defence of the Budget.  He never touched the Budget, with the result that to my mind we had three-quarters of an hour wasted.</P>
    <P>The Government to-day is like a board of directors of an industrial company, with a wide range of different interests.  The Cabinet has its fingers so much in every commercial activity in this country that they can very easily say, &ldquo;we have complete proprietorship of the internal and external activities of the commercial would in the Irish Free State&rdquo;; they can readily say to the wage earner and the taxpayer.  &ldquo;You are the shareholders.&rdquo;  Each year they reverse the procedure which an industrial company has got to go through.  They show their balance sheet a year in advance of their trade, whereas an industrial company has got to produce its balance sheet at the end of the year's trading.  I can imagine the Minister for Finance, as head of the board of directors, telling the taxpayer and the wage earner of this country, who are the investors in the industrial activity of the country: &ldquo;Our trade has been very bad; we have no surplus; we cannot pay your dividends, or in other words we can give you no relief.&rdquo; Why?  Because the whole business activity of the Free State is just the same as a business concern; unless you have trade you cannot maintain it; you cannot build up any reserve, and you cannot pay a dividend.  That is <Col N="437" /> what is happening here in this country at the present moment.  Our trade is becoming so dislocated, our overhead charges are so high, and our reserves are gradually becoming so depleted, that unfortunately the result is that the investors are to be called on for more money to put into the concern in order to keep it going&mdash;in order that it can carry on its commercial activity in the minor way in which it is carrying it on.  As far as we can see, there is no prospect that our trade developments are going to warrant the Minister for Finance saving next year that he is now in a position to reduce taxation, to relieve the taxpayer or the wage earner, to declare a dividend, or to give encouragement and hope to those who are rallying behind the board of directors&mdash;the Government&mdash;to help the industry of this country.  That is the whole trouble.  If Deputy Hugo Flinn, as a business man, would come down to brass tacks in his whole defence of the Budget, and deal with one thing, namely, trade, then we could come to grips and know at once that our whole Budgetary position is due to bad business and bad trade, just as in the case of an ordinary business concern or an industrial company.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister for Finance, with his Cabinet colleagues &mdash;who are really more than a board of directors; they are invested with extraordinary dictatorial powers&mdash;to go into that question purely from the point of view of ordinary business, remembering that our Budget can never be balanced in any other way, and that this economic war, which is responsible for the smashing up of the major industry in the Irish Free State, is also responsible for our bad Budgetary position.  There is no use in any sensible man, either on this side of the House, on that side of the House, or here on the Labour benches, trying to hide his head in the sand and persuade himself that this Budget is a good Budget or a satisfactory one.  It is a bad Budget; it is an unsatisfactory one; to my mind it will require the greatest imagination of any Minister for Finance to <Col N="438" /> try to discover new sources of revenue and new means of bolstering up the financial position of the country.  I must say that it reminds me of an artery being opened in one arm and a transfusion of blood being put through the other.  It will end only in one way and that is that further and further we will recede and our business activities will become more narrow until the period is reached when the country cannot afford to carry on and pay for the cost of administration of ordinary social services.</P>
    <P>The Budget must be regarded from the purely business standpoint, and let the political side be cut out.  Unfortunately, when one endeavours to talk ordinary business in this House, it is immediately suggested that one is speaking from a political standpoint. If there is one Department that should carry a semblance of dignity with it, it is the Department of Finance.  The Minister for Finance is our Chancellor of the Exchequer.  He is responsible for an important Department.  I am sorry to say that it is mighty hard to discover any element of dignity in the manner in which that Department is now being conducted.  If one endeavours to criticise the Department from a business standpoint, or to suggest a way in which we might remedy our bad position, one is considered as acting politically.  The only cure for our present deplorable financial position is the development of trade outside the Free State.  Only by that means can we hope for a reduction of taxation, and only in that way can we give an impetus to business.  There are limitations to the development of the home market.  Unless an ordinary trader sells well and can earn good returns in comparison with the amount he expends on labour, etc., he cannot carry on.  Similarly, a Government, unless it is prepared to develop its trade abroad to the fullest extent, cannot hope to carry on and pay its way; it must inevitably fall heavily into debt and the financial position of the country must necessarily become a matter for grave concern.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to let this occasion pass without saying a few <Col N="439" /> words on the Finance Bill.  Although I spent a very hard week-end in Galway, I made it my business to look up the records of the House, and I was fortunate enough to find a speech of the Minister for Finance on the Finance Bill of 1928.  I will confine myself principally to the reading of his remarks in criticism of the Budget of that year (Vol. 23, column 1549, 17th May, 1928):</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. MacEntee: I take it that at this stage of the Bill the discussion is to confine itself to the principle of the measure only.  Therefore I intend to confine myself to considering the purpose of the Bill and the method of securing it.  This Bill proposes to increase taxation, and to aggravate the already too heavy burden upon our people and upon their industry. We must ask ourselves whether such an increase is justifiable and unavoidable, and whether also it is equitably distributed.  According to the figures supplied to us, the minimum amount to be raised by taxation in the current year is £20,735,000.  The actual amount raised last year was £20,396,000, so that at the very lowest computation taxation during the current year will be heavier than last year to the tune of £339,000.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In passing, I would like to say that the amount proposed by the Minister this year to be raised by way of taxation is £28,337,710.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Can we impose such an additional burden?  Will industry sustain it, for if industry cannot sustain it I submit that we are not justified in imposing it.  At the present moment, in proportion to our resources, in population and in wealth, we are the most heavily taxed country in Europe.  I dare say that we are almost the most heavily taxed country in the world.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was at a time when the taxation was fully £8,000,000 less than it is to-day. The Minister went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not wish to make any debating point about the matter.  I simply wish to draw attention to the question, irrespective of parties, in order <Col N="440" /> that it may receive the serious consideration of this House, for I believe relief from that tribute is one of the first things necessary to restore prosperity to the Free State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to refer to the land annuities, and he said that in 1925-26 the sum of £3,400,000 was paid. It might be no harm to mention here that the amount collected by the British Government by way of taxes on our exports was in the neighbourhood of £5,553,000.  I might say also that Mr. J.H. Thomas said recently in the House of Commons that last year they collected £4,700,000 and that they are making provision this year to collect £5,000,000.  The fact is that our responsibilities have been increased, and we have lost our market.  I will read some more extracts from the Minister's speech in 1928:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is no use in attempting to minimise that payment.  When I was referring in the discussion on the financial statement to the amount of money we paid by way of land annuities, the Minister for Agriculture interjected a remark and asked me how much of these annuities come back to citizens of the Free State.  I thought it worth while to inquire, and I found that out of £3,400,000 paid in 1925-6 the actual amount that came back by way of interest to the citizens was £211,000. That is thought by the Minister for Agriculture to be some justification for a financial transaction of that description, but then on top of the combined burden of the tribute and the taxation we have the effect of our adverse trade balance.  The real difficulty is in the trade balance, which in the calendar year amounted to £8,750,000, representing the value of the actual assets which we had to realise in order to meet our external commitments.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will tell us what is our adverse trade balance for this year.  He says further on:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Is the Dáil going to connive at that process of industrial strangulation? Is it going to cry halt and face up to the Executive Council and say boldly: &lsquo;You are asking more than the country can give, more than the country can afford and survive&rsquo;? That is the real situation.  We are being taxed far beyond our capacity to bear or pay.  Taxes indeed have been screwed up and up until now they show a diminishing return.  I think that is the most ominous feature of the financial table explaining the Budget which was furnished to us by the Minister for Finance. We have found that taxes which years ago yielded an increasing return to the Exchequer are giving a steadily diminishing yield, and that the Minister for Finance has been compelled to drop some taxes altogether as being unproductive and worthless. That very fact is of the gravest significance.  It indicates that the danger signals are up and that we must call a halt to this extravagant expenditure or go smash.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Although the danger signals are up, the unfortunate thing for the country is that we have a Finance Minister who, though he sees the danger signals, cannot read them.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>How true that is to-day!  The Minister went on:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Obviously taxation must be reduced if industry is to prosper and taxation cannot be reduced unless expenditure is reduced.  The ratio of non-producers to producers in this country is altogether too high.  The number of drones is altogether out of proportion to the capacity of the workers to support them.  The number of men in services like the Army and the Gárda Síochána should be reduced, not in order that they may starve, but in order that they may be absorbed in industry and given employment as producers of wealth.  At the present time they are only consumers of wealth maintained by the rest of the population, maintained in a state of luxury to which the general mass of our people can never aspire, and in conditions of comfort that the general mass of our people do not know.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Further on the Minister says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister proposes to give an extra £150,000 to old age pensions. We do not quarrel with that.  Our only quarrel with it, indeed, is that it is not sufficient, but while the Minister gives £150,000 to the old age pensioners, or to the section of the community from which they are drawn, he, with the other hand, takes away in the form of a sugar tax something like £200,000 from exactly <Col N="443" /> the same section of the population. A device like that is, to my mind, like dropping a penny attached to a string into a blind man's tin to make it rattle.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is good.  Then he goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is just as senseless and unjustifiable, and just as hard.  For the reason, therefore, that the Finance Bill does not consider the economic needs of the State and people, because it does not propose to grant any relief to industry, and the workers in industry, and because it makes no attempt whatever to deal with the adverse trade balance which is draining our capital, and because the whole incidence of the taxation which it proposes to impose is inequitable and unjust, we feel on these benches that this Finance Bill should not be given a Second Reading.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Tá go maith, a thailliur.</P>
    <P>I would like to say that the policy of the Government is completely destroying the productive capacity of our people and will inevitably mean an increased cost in the State machinery. Deputy Corry last week said that the small farmer was better off than ever he was.  I have met a great number of small farmers.  I live amongst them, and I put it up to the Government on several occasions to set up a commission to inquire into the position of the small farmers.  The agricultural industry is the most important in the community.  It is the main industry in this country, for on it depend all the other industries.  If the Minister is sincere in his contention that the small farmers are better off than they were previously I ask him to set up this commission.  I can give him my word in advance that if he does I will put up a number of small farmers to give evidence before that commission.  Then the Minister will be in a better position to judge than he is to-day.</P>
    <P>We have heard the argument here that the small farmer is better off and that it is only the big farmer who is <Col N="444" /> suffering.  Now, I maintain the very opposite to that.  There is no doubt about it that when the economic war started the big farmer lost a good deal at the beginning.  But the big farmers have since then been buying cattle from the producers at such a low price that they can hardly lose on the transaction.  I would like to give a couple of examples.  I do not want to go into the matter at too great length, but as the Minister for Finance, coming as he does from Belfast, has little experience of farming, it is only natural that I would like to improve his education.  At the Ballyvourney Fair, a month ago, I met a man who had sold ten heifers and I asked him what he got for them, and he told me that he sold them for £25.  A neighbour of his who had sold him some of them as calves two years before that, then told me that he got £3 for the calves.  Some of those calves were amongst the ten heifers that he sold for £25, or 50/- apiece.  The man actually did pay £3 apiece for some of these calves when dropped.  After feeding them for two years he got £25 for them.  Look, then, at the position if this man sold the cattle to a shipper.  There is a sum of £3,143,000 in this Budget for bounties and subsidies. The position with regard to these ten cattle the farmer sold for £25 would be that the shipper would get a bounty of £1 on each of them.  The producer was actually getting 50/- apiece for them, but the shipper was only paying 30/- apiece for the heifers, as the State paid him £1 each as bounty.  It is a tragic plight for the Government to bring those unfortunate poor people to.  When these cattle were shipped to John Bull, John Bull got £60 of a present with these ten cattle.  Surely there can be no hope whatever for any country that is expected to carry on under such conditions. There is no use in trying to bluff the people.</P>
    <P>I am not at all ambitious about hunting the Government out of office at once.  I would like, first, to see the full effect of their policy.  But, on the other hand, the people will say to you: &ldquo;We cannot stand it; we cannot carry on.&rdquo;  There is another policy <Col N="445" /> which the Executive Council have adopted, that is, the policy of slaughtering the calves.  A question asked in the House during the past week elicited the information that £118,000 had been paid for bounties on calf skins on the past year.  At 12/6 per calf skin, that shows that 188,000 calves had been slaughtered for their skins.  Speaking on this motion a few days ago Deputy Haslett said that at a fair in Monaghan he saw a beast sold for £10, and a few days later he saw the same beast in Northern Ireland sold for £16, and the purchaser of the animal at the County Monaghan fair got a £1 bounty.  If these calves that are being slaughtered by the Government were reared for two or three years, at £16 each they would be sold for £3,008,000, which would be just about what the President said last week the land annuities amounted to&mdash;£2,900,000.  So that after three years, if the policy of the Government is persisted in, the result will be that the country will be losing on calves alone about £3,000,000 a year.  A couple of years ago Dr. Ryan, the Minister for Agriculture, speaking before the United Farmers' Association in Dublin, said that anybody who argued that the number of cattle should be reduced was either a fool or a knave, because we wanted our cattle to consume our surplus grain.  It is only a few weeks ago since an ex-Deputy of this House told me he had 45 tons of oats for which he could get no market whatever.  I know a dairyman in my own neighbourhood with a lot of oats who cannot sell it.  He could not get a market for it.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that as the time passes on the people cannot possibly pay their way.  The position to which they have been brought is the result of the Government policy.  Now, what remedy are they applying for this state of things?  Well, they are putting a tax on every article that the small farmer consumes.  Tea, sugar, butter, tobacco and bread are being taxed.  On their wheat policy the Minister for Agriculture made the boast here that next year they would grow 200,000 acres of wheat.  I asked the Minister what the subsidy per acre was, and he said it <Col N="446" /> would be 6/6 per barrel.  I asked him how many barrels to the acre and he said seven.  I pointed out to him that his own figures gave eight barrels to the acre, and at 6/6 per barrel that means 52/- on every acre of wheat grown.  Suppose we calculate the subsidy at 50/- per acre; on 200,000 acres of wheat the subsidy would come to £500,000.  I asked the Minister who was to pay for that bounty, and he replied that the taxpayer paid it in the past but that in the future we would put it on the consumer.</P>

      <P>I am very nearly finished now.  The Minister said that formerly the taxpayer paid the subsidy and now we are putting it on the consumer. But everybody knows that the consumers and the taxpayers are the same people.  That incident in itself shows how far the Front Bench go to bluff the people of this unfortunate country.  Now, going still further, the aim of the Government is to grow 850,000 acres of wheat in order to meet the total wants of the people in flour. That at £2 10s. an acre would work out at £2,125,000.  That would leave a tax of 16/- per sack on flour that should be paid by the consumer, as the Minister for Agriculture said about a fortnight ago.</P>

No one could be more pleased than I am at the additional houses that have been built, but <Col N="447" /> we must remember that three years ago before the Fianna Fáil Government came into office, they promised to reduce taxation by £2,000,000 instead of putting on any additional burden. We now find ourselves in the unfortunate position that instead of decreasing taxation by £2,000,000 they have increased it by £8,000,000.  There was a good deal of criticism of the late Government when in office for not building more houses.  That Government, unfortunately, had to go in for the building of bridges and the repair of other destruction carried out by the present Government Party when in Opposition which cost the country no less than £35,000,000.  I always felt it was a most unfortunate thing that such wholesale destruction should be carried out, and but for that terrible destruction and what it cost the country we would be the most happy and prosperous people in the world to-day.</P>

      <P>It is said about this year's Budget that it is a complete departure from the policy of Fianna Fáil.  That is partly true, but it is also true to say that it is a necessary consequence of their previous Budgets. When the Minister for Finance was framing his previous Budgets he thought of putting all the taxes he could upon the so-called wealthy classes and that policy of the Government and the Minister was cheered on by the Labour Party, particularly by Deputy Davin, who seemed to think that income tax could never be too high. But the Minister learned something after some years of experience here. After an income tax of 4/9 in the £&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With an average of 4/6 in the £ and with the best will in the world the Minister found that he could <Col N="448" /> not get more by increasing the income tax.  You cannot perform a Cæsarian operation on the golden goose which will enable it to lay two eggs when it can only produce one.  The Budget is described as a departure from Fianna Fáil policy.  It is in this sense: we were told by the Government when they came into office that their policy was to reduce the standard of living to the lowest common denominator.  But it is considered that even that standard is too high now, because people living at the lowest possible common denominator are being brought to a lower stage still.  The Minister has imposed taxes on the necessaries of life&mdash;bread, butter, tea, sugar, and tobacco.  I do not call tobacco a luxury of life.  After a working man has done his day's work it is no luxury that he should be allowed to have his smoke at a reasonable rate.  Deputy Morrissey suggested that the increase in the cost of living of a poor family of five persons is 4/- per week.  I suggest that that is not an over-estimate, but I regard it as an under-estimate.  As we know, the poor buy in the very smallest quantities, and they have to pay an increase in price out of all proportion even to the increase in the tax.  We are told that there is a tax of 5/- on coal.  But what do the poor people pay for it?  They buy in the very smallest quantities.</P>

I suggest that he might go back to the plan of Fianna Fáil in 1932, when they told us that they could save in the cost of administration the sum of £2,000,000 a year without any decline in services. If they had made such an exhaustive examination of the public services that they found that they could save £2,000,000 a year in economies without in any way impairing the public services&mdash;if the Minister would take up that line of action and save that £2,000,000 a year, I cannot conceive why some of the very necessitous poor should have these additional burdens put upon them to-day.  I say that this is the worst Budget that was ever introduced by the present Ministry&mdash;it is a great deal worse than any of their previous Budgets, because it is causing discontent, reducing the standard of living and producing a position in which discontent and misery can only result.</P>

So far as we are concerned, we are prepared to support any proposal designed to extend the social services and any proposal designed to make sure that the cost of the social services is imposed on backs capable of bearing that taxation.  There are valuable social services provided for in the Budget and the extension of social services will always be welcomed by this Party.</P>

    <P>The housing activities which are now being undertaken by the State are, of <Col N="452" /> course, a commendable improvement on the previous position in that respect.  It is not so long since that Deputy Rice posed as being the person who was going to solve the whole national housing problem if only the people of a particular constituency elected him.  The Deputy was elected, but the people did not get the houses they were going to get at the rate at which Deputy Rice then promised them.  Deputy Rice was going to build all the houses the people needed on that occasion, but look at the house-building record of his Party.  In ten years they built 24,500 houses.  Since the 1932 Act was passed there have been built, are in course of erection or approved for erection, about 45,000 houses.  Twice as many houses have been built in two years as the Party opposite were able to build in ten years.  Deputy Rice did not tell us what happened his famous plan to build houses.</P>

      <P>If there is a yard-stick for measuring worms, the Deputy would be a very good yard-stick in that respect, having regard to his political gyrations for a number of years.  The Deputy should not talk about turning.  How he can use such an awkward word, I do not know. Deputy Coburn, speaking in this House on Friday last, said this Budget was 80 per cent. socialistic.  Apparently, according to Deputy Coburn, this socialism takes the form of a tax on tea and sugar, cutting unemployment assistance and old age pensions.  The Deputy ventured a prophecy that ultimately this Government would introduce a Budget 100 per cent. socialistic.  The Deputy feared that if that happened it would be the end of all things, but Deputy Coburn can go to sleep peacefully to-night and feel satisfied that, far from this Budget being 80 per cent. socialistic, there is not even a spark of socialism in it. There is not even 1 per cent socialism in it, much less the 80 per cent. which Deputy Coburn feared.</P>
      <P>It is not so long since the Minister for Agriculture said he was proud of this Budget, but apparently the Minister for Finance does not share in the pride which the Minister for Agriculture feels because, speaking outside this House a few nights ago, he said that he did not desire to minimise the Budget, that it was a war Budget.  If this is a war Budget, it deserves a place all of its own in the museum of the world's war Budgets.  It is the most extraordinary war Budget I have ever seen, and I am sure it is the most extraordinary war Budget many members of the Government Party have ever seen.  The Minister, in saying it is a war Budget, explained that it was necessary, because of the economic war, to raise taxation in this way, and went on to make an eloquent plea to all to realise that the Budget was necessitated by the events of the economic war.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister ought to have realised that it is a peculiar war Budget.  This is a peculiar war Budget which is being balanced by taking goods from the enemy that we are at war with.  This Budget is being balanced because of the fact that we are giving a preference to British coal.  That fact cannot be denied.  Yet, the Minister talks about being at war, and the war, apparently, is of such a character that we are giving a complete preference to our enemy to supply coal to this country during its continuance and keeping out of the country, for the benefit of our enemy, coal from other nations cheaper in price and superior in quality.  Now, if this is a war Budget, I think that the whole war Cabinet needs to be reconstructed.</P>
      <P>This Budget has none of the attributes of a war Budget.  It has none of the courage, resource or imagination of a war Budget.  It lacks, fundamentally, what is associated with most war Budgets, namely, a determination and a resolve to organise the resources of the nation in order to carry the war to a successful conclusion. This is a timid Budget. In many respects it is a conservative Budget.  I do not know that the Minister would find much support, even amongst his own Party, for a Budget that he describes as a war Budget.  If this is the Minister's method of defending the country in times of war, then I shudder to think what he would do if there was any real invasion of the country.  This Budget has neither courage nor imagination.  There is not even audacity in this Budget, from the Minister's point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we look at this Budget and consider it in the light of the Minister's declaration that it is a war Budget, we find some strange anomalies. We have a war Budget here which reduces the income tax rate for the wealthy income taxpayers and transfers the burden of taxation from backs capable of bearing it to backs not capable of bearing it.  In other <Col N="455" /> words, we say to the income taxpayers, &ldquo;We will reduce your income tax rate for you and ask the old age pensioners, the claimants for unemployment assistance benefit, and the users of tea and sugar to bear the taxation which in every country is properly imposed upon the backs capable of bearing it.&rdquo;  Yet, the Minister says this is a war Budget.  It seems to me that, if they could arrange it, it would pay the income taxpayers of the country to maintain a perpetual war in this country, because this war Budget is notable for the fact that it reduces the income tax rate for the wealthy while imposing heavy burdens on people who are not capable of bearing them.</P>
    <P>The efforts of the Government Party to explain this Budget are extremely interesting.  One Deputy says that it is necessary to impose a tax on tea and sugar in order to give people unemployment assistance benefit and old age pensions, and to make provision for widows' and orphans' pensions.  The State is making a contribution of £250,000 towards widows' and orphans' pensions, and, in order to get that, according to some of the apologists for the Budget, it is necessary to take £350,000 from the recipients of unemployment assistance and from those who are applicants for old age pensions, quite apart altogether from the taxes that are being imposed on the community in general, especially the taxes on tea and sugar.  Last year provision was made in the Budget for widows' and orphans' pensions.  The Minister then indicated that there was an allocation of £250,000 for that purpose.  When that allocation was made last year it was unnecessary to impose these taxes on the people.  It was not necessary to propose any reduction in unemployment assistance benefit, nor was it indicated that it would be necessary to save £100,000 on old age pensions. While the provision of widows' and orphans' pensions was a liability proper to last year's Budget, and common to this year's Budget, it was not by any means necessary last year to impose new taxation; but we are <Col N="456" /> now told that is necessary in order to ensure that the scheme for widows' and orphans' pensions will be put into operation.  Last year the Minister reduced the income tax rate, and at the same time gave relief to the community by dropping the tax upon tea.  One might describe that as a distribution of benefits to all sections of the community, but this year the Minister proposes to reimpose the tax on tea, and to add to it a tax on sugar.  While that is so, there is no proposal this year to restore the income tax rate to its former level. Thus we see clearly that the burden of taxation is being lifted from the backs of the wealthy and put on the backs of the poor, and all this in a Budget which the Minister describes as a war Budget made necessary by the economic conflict with Great Britain. If this were a war Budget and the Minister was mobilising the resources of the nation in the interests of the nation, I could support it with much greater enthusiasm, but there is a complete absence of any such measures being taken.  The Minister talks of such measures outside, but when we come to this House and look at the Budget we find that there is a complete absence of the measures that one might expect in a war Budget.</P>
    <P>It is true, of course, that the social services are being provided for in the Budget, and that our social services to-day are on a vastly improved scale to those formerly in operation.  It is true that the State is now making better provision, through its social services, for the needy and helpless sections of the community, but that does not justify the Government in transferring the burden of taxation from the backs of the wealthy to the backs of the poor.  That transfer, which we find in this Budget, represents a very definite swing by the Government to the Right.  The Minister is now bestowing on the income taxpayers the same paternal outlook, the same paternal benevolence, that the Party opposite bestowed on them when they were in office.</P>
    <P>I suggested to the Minister before, and I do so again, that this is not the time for the imposition of taxes on tea <Col N="457" /> and sugar because burdens of that kind on the poor and the needy are unjustified. The Minister, I think, ought to reconsider the imposition of these taxes and decide to drop them.  My submission is that to tax tea and sugar and other foodstuffs of the people is quite unjustified so long as there are alternative sources of taxation available.  These alternative sources of taxation are available, and the Minister knows that taxation could be raised in other ways than by taxing tea and sugar.  I suggest to him that even now that portion of the Budget might be dropped&mdash;that he should decide to raise his taxation in other ways&mdash;and so lift the burden which is being imposed on the backs of the poor under this Budget and transfer it to the backs of those who are capable of bearing it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton did justice to the Budget in pointing out that we were making full provision for the social services.  Deputy MacDermot stated, by way of interruption in Deputy Norton's speech, that coal does not have to bear a tax.  I gather from some statements made in the House that this tax on coal is not a popular tax and I am sure that Deputy MacDermot does not think that if we could avoid putting on this tax and, at the same time, do our duty to the people, we should, merely to afford him debating material, have imposed it.  Of course, coal does not have to bear a tax if&mdash;and this is the rub&mdash;you are prepared to revert, say, to the position of 1931 in regard to social services. If you are prepared to dispense with unemployment assistance, if you are prepared to go back to the conditions in which the Dáil failed to provide <Col N="458" /> houses for the people in 1931 and to the housing conditions that existed then, coal does not have to bear a tax.  If you drop widows and orphans' pensions, if you decide to limit the provision which we are making for the building of new schools throughout the country, coal does not have to bear a tax.  Coal, in short, does not have to bear a tax if the Government is prepared to take up, towards the general body of the people, the same callous attitude which was taken up by Deputy MacDermot's leader when he was responsible for administering the affairs of this State.  But if you want the present standard of social services to be maintained, if you want our house-building programme to be carried through to its completion, then no tax which this Budget proposes to make can be dispensed with.</P>
      <P>It has been charged against us by Deputy Norton that we have not placed the taxation on the backs capable of bearing it.  Everything we could do to distribute taxation equitably has been done.  At first sight, it might appear possible to increase certain property taxes.  I desire to say emphatically that I am satisfied that any increase in the rate of income tax here would, owing to the peculiar circumstances which exist in regard to double taxpayers, only result in a considerably reduced yield.  If the yield went down by £500,000 or £600,000, not only should we have to impose the existing taxes on sugar, tea and tobacco, but we should have to increase these taxes in order to make good the reduced yield from income tax and property tax.  In framing his Budget, as I presume Deputy Norton will be called upon to do in due course, he will have to take that fact into consideration, just as I have had to do. It is a fact which I cannot possibly get over.</P>

      <P>We shall wait and see.  This Budget has been attacked by Deputy Rice, Deputy Morrissey, Deputy Mulcahy, Deputy O'Sullivan, and Deputy McGilligan&mdash;I shall deal with Deputy McGilligan towards the end of my speech, in the vain hope that he will arrive here before then&mdash;on the ground that it puts a taxation on necessities.  What are necessities?  I propose to deal with commodities which are in the less controversial category.  Sugar is a necessity.  Boots are a necessity, except for the infant in swaddling clothes.  Clothes are a necessity. I suppose furniture would be regarded as a necessity.  By import duties on sugar, sugar confectionery, cocoa preparations, boots and shoes, clothing and wearing apparel and furniture, and by a customs entry duty, the Cumann na nGaedheal Administration collected no less a sum than £2,500,000 for the year 1931-32.  They went out at the end of that year.  Two and a half million pounds were collected by our predecessors by way of taxes on necessities.  Yet, this debate has been conducted for almost 24 hours on the basis that this is the first time any Budget introduced here imposed a tax upon necessities.  This year&mdash;this is one of the reasons why we have had to increase taxation&mdash;the amount of revenue which we would have collected from those taxes, including the tax upon sugar at its original rate, would have been £1,200,000. There was a decline of more than 50 per cent. in the revenue from those import <Col N="460" /> duties&mdash;a decline from £2,500,000 to £1,200,000.  That decline was foreseen three years ago, because, three years ago, we were faced with exactly the same problem with which Deputy Cosgrave's Administration had been faced. We tried to solve that problem, but they ran away from it.  I refer to the problem of unemployment, the problem of giving this country a balanced economy, the problem of developing our industrial resources so that they might absorb our surplus population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave had that problem before him in 1931-32, and he saw, as we saw, that if he was going to increase these import duties, so as to give real protection to our industries, and to afford employment to our people, he was going to be faced, as we have been faced, with the problem of a declining revenue, and to make good that revenue he was going to have to put an increased tax on tea and an increased tax on sugar. But, he thought he was a good politician. He had the belief, which is shared by many people, including, apparently, members of the present Opposition, that a tax upon tea and a tax upon tobacco are unpopular in this country and, therefore, rather than do the unpopular thing, he was prepared to allow our idle people to starve.  There were not going to be for Deputy Cosgrave any new boot factories to diminish the import of 90 per cent. of the boots worn in this country because, if Deputy Cosgrave was to build new boot factories the revenue would have gone down by £300,000, which is much more than would be brought in by an increase of a ¼d. a lb. in the tax on sugar. Deputy Cosgrave was not prepared to encourage the manufacture of clothing and wearing apparel in this country because, once again, some part of the odd £600,000 revenue which he was deriving at that time from the import of foreign-manufactured clothing and wearing apparel, would have to be made good by an increased tax on tobacco, say, or possibly by the imposition of a duty upon tea. Therefore, the £2,500,000 revenue, in Deputy Cosgrave's eyes, was very much more important than the problem of <Col N="461" /> finding employment for our people and building up native industries. He ran away from it.</P>
    <P>When we came in we had exactly the same choice to make.  We had either to allow the continued import of things which we could make, and to-day are making for ourselves, and to keep the revenue from import duties from these articles up to the former level, or we could go ahead, saying that we were going to have these things made in this country, and that we would have to make up what we are losing in Customs duties upon them, either by imposing alternative import duties or by increasing our Excise duties on certain commodities. It has been said here that so far the figures have not justified the choice we made.  Deputy McGilligan in the course of his speech referred to the figures in 21 out of 28 industries.  He said that the figures for 1933 showed that the total increase in wages paid in this country was £25,000.  One need never expect a true or accurate presentation of the case from Deputy McGilligan. The figures which he relied upon were based mainly on two specialised industries, brewing and coach building.  In 1930-31 peculiar factors were operating in this country, which made the output from the coach-building industry very much larger than it would normally have been.  The coach building and motor car assembling at Ford's Tractor Factory was then working at high pressure, turning out tractors for Russia.  Even at that period everyone knew that there was an ephemeral prosperity attending that industry because they knew that once the new Ford factory in England got working, and as the special Russian demand from the factory in this country ceased when the new Russian tractor factories got going the output here was going to fall off.</P>
    <P>Everyone knows that the brewing and distilling industries have been declining, not because of any decline in the prosperity of the population as represented by the decline in the consumption of beer and spirits, but due to the changed habits of <Col N="462" /> our people.  What is true here is true, to some extent, of people elsewhere. In any event, whatever decline there was in the number of people employed in brewing and distilling took place very largely at the end of 1931 or 1932, and was due to the decreased demand in Great Britain for beer and spirits, beer particularly, and had nothing to do with our industrial domestic conditions whatever.  Leaving these two industries aside there are a number of industries for which fairly full figures are now available.  I had not much time to check them.  I will deal with boots and shoes, clothing and apparel, sugar, confectionery and jam making. In the year 1931 the total output of these commodities from Irish factories was worth £2,950,000.  In the year 1933 the value of the output jumped to £4,045,000.  In the year 1931 the number of operatives engaged in these industries was 9,638, and in the year 1933 the figures jumped to 14,547.  The revenue derived from import duties upon these articles in 1931-32 was £1,012,000, and it fell this year to £650,000.  We have lost £350,000 there. Between the 31st March, 1932, and 31st December, 1933, almost 5,000 additional people were put into employment in these industries.  The value of the output jumped by over £1,000,000.  Not merely that, but while in 1931 the wages paid in these industries amounted to £607,000, in 1933 it had risen to £841,000, or an increase of £234,000, which more than made up for any loss which the Exchequer sustained in revenue between 1931-32 and 1933-34. If that was the position on 31st December, 1933, whatever was lost in revenue was more than made up in wages, and I am perfectly certain that when the figures for 1935 become available, it will be seen that what the State has lost has gone to the workers in these industries.  And not merely what we have lost in revenue, but what we used to send out of the country year after year to pay other people to make goods that we could have made for ourselves.</P>
    <P>We have been criticised for increasing the tax on sugar.  Deputy Morrissey, who is not in the House now, devoted <Col N="463" /> the greater part of his speech to a criticism of the tax on sugar. What were the facts in 1931-32?  In the year 1931-32 Deputy Cosgrave's Government collected no less a sum than £1,426,000 out of a tax on sugar and sugar confectionery alone.  This year, even allowing for the increase of a farthing per lb. that we are imposing on sugar, we will only get £800,000 out of a tax on sugar.  In other words, the Exchequer has lost £626,000 of revenue from sugar.  But where has it gone?  It has all been distributed among the farmers who are growing the beet and the workers who are turning it into sugar. Not merely are they getting this £626,000, but they are also getting the amount which, if these factories were not working, we should be sending to Czecho-Slovakia or to the West Indies to pay other people either to grow the sugar cane or the sugar beet and to make the sugar for us.  Every penny of that money that is being kept here at home is being distributed among the Irish people.  Not alone that, but the distribution of that money among the farmers who are growing the beet, the labourers who are helping them to grow it, or the operatives who are making it into sugar, does not end with them. They are taking that money and, except for what they have to spend on tea and other such commodities that have to be imported, are spending every penny of it here in this country. That money is going to the shopkeepers, from the shopkeepers to the wholesalers, and from the wholesalers to the manufacturers who are making clothes, boots, shoes, furniture, and all the other commodities which are now being manufactured at home and which these farmers, farm labourers and operatives are now buying from these home manufacturers.  In that way that money is being distributed over the whole population.</P>
    <P>What is true of our loss of revenue in regard to sugar is also true in regard to our loss in boots, shoes, sugar confectionery, and all other commodities which used to provide Deputy Cosgrave's Government with revenue but <Col N="464" /> which we have given back to the people and which is now being distributed through the whole population in general.  When we come, however, to make good that loss in revenue as we have to do, unless we are going to adopt Deputy Cosgrave's and Deputy McGilligan's callous attitude towards the less fortunate portion of our community here and reduce the social services, the only way in which we can make good that loss, because of the peculiar limitations to which I have already referred, which are imposed on our Budgets, is to make it up out of the general revenue.  Apart from everything else, I say that it is quite equitable to make it up in that way, because anything that the Exchequer has lost has been given to the people in general and, if there has to be taxation for distributive purposes, such as is taxation through death duties and imposts of that sort, then it is only right that we should get it from the people who are employed and who are in a position to pay taxes and give it back to the other people.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give the Deputy that also.  In February, 1932, before this farthing a lb. went on, the average retail price of sugar was 3.37 pence. It was sold, in some cases, for more than 3½d. and in other cases for a trifle under that; but you may take it that, on the average, it was 3.37 pence.  In February of this year, before this farthing a lb.  went on, it was 3.46 pence.  In fact, there was no practical difference, as far as the people of this country were concerned, between the price of sugar in February of 1932 and February of 1935.  The general sacrifice, which the community as a whole have had to make in order to manufacture all our sugar at home and to provide work for at least 2,600 hands in the factories and about 20,000 additional beet growers, represents about a farthing a lb.  Even <Col N="465" /> at that, however, it is not a one hundred per cent. sacrifice because it is very largely compensated for by the increased purchasing power which has been put into the hands of the community. The money which, formerly, was being sent abroad is the money that we are now keeping at home, and, apart from any other ways in which we may have benefited, we are at least this much better off, that whatever we are keeping here is money that, formerly, was sent out to buy imported commodities for which we got no adequate return, because we do not sell cattle or anything else to the countries to which we used to send our money for sugar.</P>

I used to have different views myself, but I am telling the Deputy now that when he comes into these benches he will find there a limitation which he is not going to exceed, if he has any regard for the future.  If we do not collect that revenue by a tax on coal, we can do only one of two things: either put a tax on something else or reduce some element in the social services. There is no way out of that dilemma.  In regard to coal, after all, we have a native fuel here, and this Government is very anxious to do in <Col N="467" /> regard to that native fuel what we have succeeded in doing in regard to sugar. If people feel aggrieved about the tax on coal, let them turn to peat or let them turn even to Irish coal.  There is coal mined in this country.  Let them turn to it.  Let them even use Irish electricity.</P>

      <P>When we have sufficient people mining our coal and a sufficient number engaged in cutting our turf, we should be in a position, if we did not burn imported coal, to reduce very considerably the amount that has to be set aside for unemployment assistance.  When we do get to the stage which we want our people to reach, at which they will use, first of all, their own natural resources to the limit, I believe we will be able to reduce taxation considerably, because there will not be the same demand or the same need for unemployment assistance, and those other services which the Government has to provide in order to relieve poverty arising very largely out of unemployment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton said that the Government and the Opposition Party had voted for a preference for British coal.  We have not voted for a preference for British coal as such.

If we have to import coal, in view of the fact that the British are prepared to take an equivalent amount of cattle in exchange, and if we have surplus cattle in this country and unless we are going to kill them and bury them, are we not perfectly justified in entering into an agreement of that sort which can be <Col N="468" /> entered into without any infringement of principle upon either side?</P>

      <P>And when the Opposition Deputies walked into the Lobby in order to swallow in the Lobby the declarations which they have been making here on the floor of the House, they did that, not to give a preference to coal from one source of origin over coal from another source, but merely because they were convinced of the wisdom of implementing what was a purely commercial agreement.  That has got nothing to do with, and is quite outside, this question of the tax on coal.  The tax on coal was imposed on its merits because we wanted revenue and because it seemed more equitable to us to put it on coal than on some other commodity, and for the reason that the people have an alternative source of fuel-supply.  We are anxious to make it cheaper for them to buy turf and to use Irish coal than to use imported fuel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this question of who pays the tax on cattle, I do not know whether any of the Deputies were listening to Deputy Haslett when he was talking here on Friday last.  To my mind, he made a most illuminating speech.  He evidently was of the opinion, which apparently is shared by some people, that the Irish producer is paying the full import duty on cattle into England, <Col N="469" /> and, in order to prove that, he adduced some figures in the Dáil.  He said he knew of cattle bought at £10 a head in Monaghan and sold for £16 in Belfast, and he said &ldquo;There you are; the import duty of £6 per head was paid on those, and that shows you that we, in Monaghan, were paying the whole of that £6 duty.&rdquo;  It seems to me that there were a number of other items and other factors which entered into that £16.  There was, first, carriage to Belfast, and, as I gather, the cattle were sold by auction in Belfast by salesmen, there were salesmen's fees.  There was the middleman's profit on the transaction; there were drovers' fees and insurance.  All these elements, and there is none of them inconsiderable, were included in that £16 per head, and yet the margin of difference between the price at which the cattle were bought in Monaghan and the price at which they were sold in Belfast was only the import duty per head upon the animals.</P>

      <P>It may have been, but I took the Deputy's figures and the case quite clearly proves that the Belfast importer, at any rate, was paying carriage, salesmen's fees and drovers' fees, and was taking his profit on the transaction as well.  Therefore, the British consumer, or, in this case, the Northern Ireland consumer, was bearing a very substantial portion of the import duty.  I do not want to press that too far&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am stating what I heard Deputy Haslett say, so far as I can recollect.  I took a note of what he said at the time.  I am not an expert; I am merely dealing with a statement which, I think, was made in the Dáil, and I remember it particularly because I took a note of it immediately. I thought I saw the factors which ought to enter into the selling price in Belfast and I went over it and I put the results of my examination before the Dáil now.</P>
      <P>In any event when the Opposition are criticising the protective tariffs which we imposed, such as those which have kept out the foreign manufactured boots, shoes and wearing apparel, we are told that the consumer must pay the whole of the increased price.  That is the argument on the other side.  When people outside this country impose an import duty upon the commodities which we ship to them, we are asked to believe that it is the other way round&mdash;that the producer must pay the whole of the tariff.  I do not want to put it further than this; it is quite obvious that the increased burden is shared between the producer on the one hand and the consumer on the other; by the producer, because he will try to cut down his selling price as low as possible in order to get over the tariff; and by the consumer because there is a certain margin below which the producer will not cut his price&mdash; the margin below which it does not any longer pay him to produce&mdash;and, therefore, the consumer has to make up the difference if he wants to get the article.  The position in regard to our cattle is that our customers want to get the article.  There is no other article half so satisfactory for their purpose as what we are producing here in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to deal, first of all, with one or two misstatements which he made in regard to income tax.  They are not misstatements which Deputy McGilligan has made for the first time, nor are they <Col N="472" /> misrepresentations of facts which have gone uncontradicted.  Speaking on the Budget Resolution, Deputy McGilligan stated that last year when the income tax rate was 4/6 in the £, the British secured more from income tax than they had secured at the 5/- rate.  That statement by Deputy McGilligan is not in accord with the figures officially published in the <i>London Gazette</i>, because the total receipts into the Exchequer for the year 1934-5 were £228,877,000, and for the year 1932-3 they were £228,932,000.  The figures for last year, therefore, were slightly lower than those for the year before.  On a previous occasion Deputy McGilligan said that they were more, but I think on the last occasion he mended his hand and said they were the same.  In a case like this&mdash;particularly with a Deputy like Deputy McGilligan, who is fond, by unnuendo and insinuation, of attacking and, if he can, of blackening the character and reputation of his colleagues in the Oireachtas&mdash;it is important that the House should know that wherever there are figures by which Deputy McGilligan's statements can be tested, the Deputy is almost invariably found to be wrong.  He was wrong in this particular instance; he was wrong, although it had been pointed out to him on a previous occasion that a statement which he was making in the House was inaccurate and untrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, he said that in 1927-28, when income tax was only 3/- in the £, the yield was £3,600,000.  Once again that statement is a half truth, and it does mislead the House, because the rate of tax for the years 1925-6 and 1926-7 was 4/- in the £, and for the two previous years was 5/- in the £.  Of the income tax collected during the year 1927-8, £1,640,000 was in respect of the year 1926-7, and about £30,000 was in respect of 1925-6 and the earlier years.  The House must not imagine that Deputy McGilligan made that statement because they were the only figures which were at his command, or because he was not aware of the effect which the higher rates in the years 1925-6 and 1926-7 had on the income tax yield in 1927-8.  The Deputy was a member of the Executive Council, and, in fact, I <Col N="473" /> think that on occasions one of his colleagues has asked me when the reports of the Revenue Commissioners were likely to be to hand.  He knew, at any rate, from table 77 of the Revenue Commissioners' Report for the year ending 31st March, 1929&mdash;it is from those reports that Deputy McGilligan got his figures&mdash;that the net produce of income tax from assessments actually made during the year 1927-8 was not £3,600,000 as he represented it to be, but £3,020,000.  That was a deliberate misstatement of fact to the extent of £580,000 per annum.  Then he goes on and challenges us, asking why it is that income tax at 4/6 in the £ is not bringing in an additional £1,000,000 over and above what it brought in for the year 1927-8, or what it brought in for the year 1931-2.  The explanation is quite simple.  There has been a decline in investment income, it is quite true, but that does not relate to this country alone; it has been the experience everywhere.  The principal reason why the old ratio between yield and rate has been completely overthrown since this Government came into office has not been a decrease in our national income but the fact that there has been a complete rearrangement of the former income tax allowances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesIvanMcGuire" hpid="Mr. J.I. McGuire Mr. J.I. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.I. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Labour Party point was a good one?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The rearrangement operated in this way, that whereas before the allowance for earned income used to be one-tenth, it is now one-sixth on the first £450 of earned income and one-tenth on the balance, with a maximum relief of £200; but that whereas the allowance for each child used to be, I think, £35 for the first and £29 for the second, it is now £50 for each child.  The effect of those adjustments&mdash;and there are some others&mdash;has been this, that whereas in the year 1931-32, when the nominal rate was 3/6 in the pound a married couple with three children would pay £3 18s. 9d., they would be paying nothing under our rate of 4/6d.  So far as married people with earned income and three children in family are concerned, they are now free of tax altogether.  In the lower <Col N="474" /> ranges of income, where formerly workmen were paying income tax, they are now free of tax altogether. It is quite true that at the upper end of the income tax scale there has been a considerable increase, but the numbers of people, with families, in receipt of earned income are proportionately greater at the lower end of the scale.  There has been this remission of tax to counterbalance some of the other changes that have been made, and it is due to such remissions that the income tax is not bringing in as much.</P>
      <P>The higher incomes, I agree, are paying a higher rate than they were when Cumann na nGaedheal were in office.  So far as those of the income taxpayers, who are the more highly paid operators in factories and clerical workers, are concerned, they are paying a lower rate if they are married and have families to maintain.  So far as a single person with an all-earned income is concerned, he is paying slightly more than he was&mdash;if he is single, with no dependent&mdash;and I think people will agree that that is fair. It is due to that rearrangement of the allowances and not to a startling decrease in the taxable income of the community that this decrease in our yield is due.  Therefore, when I was listening to Deputy Norton talking about the Budget and referring to courage or imagination or even audacity, I felt the same words might with more force be applied to himself. He went on to tell us how we were reducing the income tax of the wealthier classes, and I thought it required both imagination and audacity to make that statement, because it is quite contrary to the fact.  So far as the smaller incomes are concerned, and so far as the people with dependents are concerned, we have reduced their income tax liabilities.  I cannot see anything in the present Finance Bill that represents a reduced income tax upon the wealthier classes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt the Deputy was convinced.</P>
      <P>I was talking about the fact that this Budget was a war Budget.  We must raise this revenue if we are going to carry through our housing programme, to maintain our existing social services and provide the increased one which will come into operation this year in the form of widows' and orphans' pensions.  We can get rid of all that if Deputies say they will not suffer this burden to be imposed on the community, and that they would prefer we would revert to the old conditions which existed here prior to the Fianna Fáil Government taking office.  Then I have no doubt our successors would reduce taxation considerably by reducing expenditure upon the services to which I have referred.  Let us see, with the limited figures we have available, what the result of the Fianna Fáil policy has been so far as the general mass of the people are concerned. I have only figures for 1933, but here is what the vital statistics for that year show.  In that year there was the lowest general death-rate ever recorded, and that can only be due to an improvement in the conditions of living of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In that year there was the lowest infantile mortality ever recorded, and its fall was most marked in the urban areas.  The death-rate in that year from tuberculosis was the lowest ever <Col N="476" /> recorded.  All these three things were due to better feeding, better housing and a higher general standard of living. For the first time since 1847, I think, there was the highest recorded increase in population per 1,000&mdash;that was in 1933.  That is an epitome of the advantages which the Fianna Fáil policy has conferred upon the general mass of the people of this country.  It is on those facts that we are prepared to stand or fall.  If we wish to go back to the days of a decreasing population, of an increasing infantile mortality, an increasing death-rate, a decreasing marriage-rate &mdash; I forgot to mention that the marriage-rate in that year was the highest recorded&mdash;if we want to go back to those things we can do without the tax on coal and sugar, and throw open our ports, close down our factories and put our workers on the streets.  We can do all that if we want to do without the taxes that are necessary in order to carry through the Fianna Fáil constructive programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I interrupt for a moment?  As the Minister seems anxious that Deputy McGilligan would come in, I think he may be here in a <Col N="477" /> few moments.  If he wishes to deal with another matter before the Deputy comes in, I would like to mention that there was a question I put to him of very great importance, and that is, why he invites us to regard the bounties as being temporary, a sort of transitional thing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I might say why not and I think it would be almost a sufficient answer to that question.  There are a number of reasons for my view, however.  In the first place, we are finding new outlets for our agricultural produce, or rather I should say for our exportable agricultural surplus.  Although these outlets are undoubtedly small, nevertheless they are a beginning.  I am perfectly certain that these new markets which are now being found will continue to expand and develop, and, therefore, there will not be the same need to maintain the bounties at their existing level.  Secondly, because our agricultural economy is becoming less dependent upon the export market, and, therefore, import duties are becoming less effective as a coercive instrument and will in time come to be discarded; and in the third place, because our cattle are the raw material of the cattle feeding industry of Great Britain.  They are not going to tax that raw material, particularly in view of the fact that our agricultural economy is becoming less dependent on them and because of the fact that we are finding other outlets.  Limited and small as these are at present, they are tending to develop.  Therefore, what we will need to send to the British market is becoming less and will become more rapidly less and less.  I am satisfied that as long as the British are concerned to maintain their cattle feeding industry the tendency will be to discard these tariffs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I never said it was. When the British market was the sole customer for what Deputy Flinn has so often described as our perishable export surplus it was a different question. <Col N="478" /> That day is going.  The British market in that form is going.  It is going to be replaced by a better market, a market in which we shall be a free seller, a market in which the purchaser will no longer have a monopoly of purchase.  Therefore, for that reason it is a market that is becoming, from our point of view, a more valuable market.</P>

      <P>The substance is more important in this matter than the form, and, accordingly, I withdraw it.  But I will say that it is very extraordinary that Deputy McGilligan, who as Minister for Industry and Commerce was responsible for passing through this House the Mines and Minerals Act of 1931 under which this concession was granted, should have suffered so serious a lapse of memory as to mislead the Chair by making the statement that the matter to which he referred came under the State Lands Act.  Mr. McGilligan is a very&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan is a very intelligent gentleman and has a very acute and retentive memory. I therefore find it hard to believe, notwithstanding the withdrawal which the Rules of the House compel me to make, that what he stated was not untrue to his knowledge.  Deputy McGilligan then pointed out and went on to say: &ldquo;This matter comes under the State Lands Act, and the Minister for Finance is the operating authority there.  He is primarily responsible.&rdquo;  And I said &ldquo;No,&rdquo; and then Deputy McGilligan said: &ldquo;The Minister for Finance is the man who controls the letting of mines and minerals under the State Land Act....&rdquo;  I then said that it was true that I had certain functions under the State Lands Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with these functions certain transactions took place.  The Vice-Chairman of the Seanad, an honourable and upright man, was concerned in this matter and came before me.  I was asked to grant a lease of certain State lands.  I refused to grant the lease, Sir, not because I did not think there were many other ways in which that land could be used, but because it would not be beneficial to the State to grant the lease.  The lands referred to were lands which had been let from year to year for tillage purposes to small farmers, and we did not think it advisable at that stage to grant the lease to any one person for a <Col N="481" /> long term.  This matter came before me personally, and I directed the Department to refuse to sanction a lease to Senator Comyn, for the reason that we required the land to be used in another way.  That would have been a perfectly justifiable transaction, but that is the only case in which Senator Comyn has been concerned in an application for a lease under the State Lands Act.  There was another case in which Deputy Briscoe was concerned in the letting of some old barracks down at Naas.  The matter was never completed and the negotiations fell through.</P>
    <P>But the Deputy who was making the allegation about the attitude of the present Minister for Finance in regard to colleagues of his Party could easily, if he turned round to a Deputy sitting beside him, have asked him if he ever had a lease of lands or property granted to him by the then Minister for Finance.  There is a Senator sitting in the Seanad who always supported the policy of our predecessors and he similarly had such a lease.  I am not suggesting or insinuating, and it would be far from me to do so, either in regard to one or the other, that my predecessor did anything dishonest or questionable in the granting of either of these leases. If there had been anything questionable or anything dishonest about them I would have tried to get them upset. I am merely pointing out that this is not the first time that members of the Oireachtas got facilities available to all people that are prepared to make use of State lands or properties which are not being utilised by the State and if they are prepared to make the best use of them.  I have been pointing out that Deputy McGilligan, in order to drag this matter into the debate, said that what he referred to came under the State Lands Act. It did not.  The mining concession, and the prospecting lease, granted to a certain Senator and Deputy in this House came under the Mines and Minerals Act, 1931, for which Deputy McGilligan was responsible as Minister, and which he helped to draft, and piloted through <Col N="482" /> the Dáil and with every detail of which he must be familiar.</P>
    <P>It was alleged that I was the person to control the letting of mines and minerals under this particular Act. The fact is that responsibility for the administration of the Mines and Minerals Act of 1931 is vested in the Minister for Industry and Commerce. In Section 11, sub-section (1), it is provided that the power of granting a lease of State mines and minerals or exclusive State mining rights is exercised at the sole discretion of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I am perfectly satisfied that if Deputy McGilligan decides to ventilate this question to the House that the Minister for Industry and Commerce will justify the matter to the fullest extent. I am concerned only to this extent: that Deputy McGilligan, whom I find it impossible to believe was not fully aware of all the facts, made a statement knowing it to be misleading and, thereby dragged the matter into discussion on the Finance Bill, an abuse of the rules of procedure and debate.  I do not enter into this until you come to sub-section (3), in which it is stated&mdash;</P>
    <P>Every lease made under this section shall (unless the Minister and the Minister for Finance are jointly of opinion that such lease should in the public interest be made free of any payment) be made subject to the payments to the Minister of such moneys whether by way of fine or other preliminary payment or by way of rent (including a royalty rent variable according to the price or value of the minerals gotten) or by both such ways as the Minister and the Minister for Finance shall jointly think proper and shall agree upon</P>
    <P>I enter into it for the purpose of seeing that the amount to be charged is in all the circumstances fair and just to the State, and to the person taking the lease.  In making that determination I am bound by Section 11, sub-section (5), which says&mdash;</P>
    <P>In exercising the respective powers conferred on them by this section, and in particular in determining the <Col N="483" /> terms of any demise or the payment to be made thereunder, the Minister and the Minister for Finance may take into consideration the general advantages that are likely to accrue to the State from the development of the mines and minerals to which the demise relates.</P>
    <P>Now, what is the position in regard to this mining concession in Wicklow? The matter had been mooted on a number of occasions before by other people.  It was then found that owing to a deficiency in our law there was no power to enable these leases to be made.  When the Act to remedy that was passed in 1931 a register of all persons who had at any time indicated that they were prepared to undertake this work of prospecting, with a view to developing our mineral resources, was made, strictly in the order of priority of receipt of their communications relating to this matter.  These lists were subsequently transferred to the Department of Industry and Commerce. When an application for a lease is made, as soon as it comes into that Department, these lists are consulted and if there are prior applicants for a licence for this or some other area, communications are addressed to them to ascertain if they desire to renew their application. I have been informed by the Department of Industry and Commerce that before any leases were granted prior applicants were consulted, in the manner I have indicated.</P>
    <P>The question came along about this lease.  I do not think I would be over-sceptical if I said that whatever may be the position now, in 1933, at any rate, I would have thought it a very wild cat scheme.  The matter never came before me at all.  It was dealt with departmentally.  The Department was satisfied in the circumstances that this lease and this dead rent of £10 with the royalty of 4 per cent. which it was proposed to charge per annum, was sufficient having regard to the speculative nature of the venture.  As I said, other people who manifested any interest in the area had <Col N="484" /> already been consulted.  It is our intention to have whatever mineral resources we have in this country investigated, and, if they are capable of being developed to have them developed.  My Department passed this, having regard to the terms of subsections (1) and (5) of Section 11; they passed it as they were bound to pass it.  It did not appear to me having regard to the terms of the lease and the history of adventures of that sort, that I could hold out for any more&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Not the least.  They were three people, Senator Comyn, Deputy Robert Briscoe and Mr. H. C. Norman.  It will be noticed that Deputy McGilligan claimed to be very well informed about this matter.  At any rate, he knew quite a lot of which I was not aware.  Yet he asked why did three Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party and the Vice-Chairman of the Seanad get that concession.  Three Deputies!  There was one Deputy and one Senator and one other person whom I did and do not know&mdash;his name means no more to me than that of any other citizen.</P>

      <P>I am making no imputation as regards this particular lease, but out of curiosity as to the procedure of the Department I ask would such a lease be given to anybody who might come along or would not the Department inquire into the solidity of the person.  They would not give a lease to anybody I presume, who had a mind to try his luck?</P>

      <P>That I am afraid is a question that the Deputy will have to address to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The point I want to make is that I have no administrative function in this matter at all.  Under the Act which Deputy McGilligan drafted when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, every administrative function is reserved to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and Deputy McGilligan knew that.  Notwithstanding the knowledge that he must have had at <Col N="485" /> that time, he misinformed the Chair as to the true position in order that he might drag this matter into the debate and in order that he might, as far as he could, by innuendo, charge myself, my colleague and the members of our Party with something dishonourable and dishonest.</P>

      <P>This is rather in the nature of a post-mortem as the thing is now done, but, on a point of order, the Minister for Finance has said that it lay with him to approve, or disapprove of the proposed lease.  That being so, I submit that, on the face of it, there was a fair case and that it was in order to raise this subject in connection with the Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>I have no final responsibility.  It says that we must agree but, obviously, when the Oireachtas places the complete administration of an Act in the hands of one Minister and makes merely the terms of the lease, subject to the agreement of the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Finance cannot take up the attitude of refusing his sanction unless there is a <i>prima facie</i> case against sanction being given and there was not in this document.  Unless it is quite clear on the face of the document that there is good reason why my agreement should be withheld, I am bound to agree with the Minister for Industry and Commerce in a matter like this, otherwise I should become an obstructive factor and not one, as it is my duty to be, who is anxious that the Government's general policy should be carried out.</P>

This matter did not arise under the State Lands Act at all and Deputy McGilligan knew that as well as I did, at least I think he must have known it.  I am not going to waste very much more time on Deputy McGilligan further than to say this, that a number of people have listened to him in this House from time to time, making a speech of exactly the same tenor and the same purport as he made on Friday. I was speaking to a person who had been in the Public Gallery during one of those statements made by Deputy McGilligan.  He came away, came down and met me and asked me: &ldquo;Do you know what McGilligan reminds me of?&rdquo; and I said &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  He replied: &ldquo;A woman with a serpent's tongue.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that this Bill be now read a Second Time.  I propose to deal with certain principles embodied in this Bill, and to leave minor points over to be dealt with section by section on the Committee Stage.  The principal change contemplated under this Bill is that the miller should pay the full price for the wheat when it is delivered to him by the grower.  As Deputies are aware, under our present legislation when a farmer brings his wheat to the miller he gets a certain price which is roughly related to the world price.  Some months afterwards he gets a bounty from State funds to make up the difference between what the average price was, as received by the farmer, and the standard price as fixed by the Executive Council.  In future, if this Bill becomes law, the miller will pay a price to the farmer based on the bushel weight and the price fixed from time to time by the Executive Council.  I need hardly dwell on the advantages of that scheme for the <Col N="489" /> farmer.  I know from my experience in the Department of Agriculture that farmers are anxious to get the full price for their wheat as soon as possible.  They have complained from time to time about the delay in paying the bounty which is part of the price they have received up to this for their wheat.</P>
      <P>The growers of wheat will undoubtedly favour this scheme. There will also be a certain saving in administration under the scheme because there will be no necessity for keeping a register of growers, of making the necessary calculations after getting in all the returns, or even for the mechanical work that was involved in sending out a cheque to each grower.  There will be all that saving in administration.  It is intended by the Government that the State should be relieved of the responsibility of paying a bounty, but this Bill does not prevent any Government from paying an equivalent to the bounty.  If State funds permit at any future time a bounty can be paid to the miller instead of, as it has been paid up to this, to the farmer.  But, we need hardly dwell on that possibility at the moment, because it is intended by the Government that for the present at any rate the full price should be paid by the miller, and the price of the wheat passed on to the flour miller, the baker and the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, in any case, that the full price for Irish-grown wheat will have to be paid by the consumer at some future time.  It is hoped that what wheat we require for the country will be grown by our own producers some time or other.  If we maintain the progress we have been making for the last two or three years, we shall reach that stage in six or seven years.  That would require 4,500,000 barrels, on present consumption, and, on our present average bounty, it would call for £1,500,000 in cash as a Government subsidy.  I think it is fairly certain that, at some time or other, consumers will be asked to pay the <Col N="490" /> full price for the bread produced from our own wheat, in that way giving the farmers the full cost of production.  So far as that point is concerned, there is no necessity, however important it may be, to go into any further explanation or even to deal with the clause under which it is provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The second point dealt with in the Bill is concerned with storage and drying.  We have been warned, over and over again, and more particularly by the Opposition, that some time or other we may have a wet harvest.  Providence was very kind to us during the last couple of years and the wheat was harvested in very good condition.  Although our storage was not very good and our drying facilities were poor, on the whole, the wheat reached the miller and was milled into flour in very good condition. If we should meet with a very wet harvest, it would be difficult to deal with the wheat crop.  Millers, who, I am quite sure, are the best judges in this matter, say that the only hope they would have of dealing with the wheat under these circumstances and making good flour would be to get it immediately after it had been threshed by the farmer.  If that is the only way it can be dealt with, it is quite certain that we have not got sufficient storage.  There are, probably, between 180,000 and 200,000 acres of wheat being grown this year.  If we had a bad harvest and if most of that wheat were to be delivered to the millers within two months, I do not think they could deal with it from the point of view of storage and certainly not from the point of view of drying. We are, therefore, taking power in the Bill to compel the millers to provide certain storage accommodation and also certain drying accommodation. That can be fixed from time to time by order.  It is intended to require the millers to provide storage for about 80 per cent of the full amount of Irish wheat which they will be required to take for the year.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, the Minister for Agriculture will have to make, at the end of December, an estimate of the <Col N="491" /> amount of wheat likely to be grown in the following year.  Having made that estimate, he fixes the national percentage for the following harvest. Having fixed that national percentage, he serves an order on each miller telling him the amount of wheat he will be required to take during the following cereal year, commencing 1st September, and requiring the miller to provide storage for a certain stated percentage of that amount of wheat.  The present intention is that he should provide storage for about 80 per cent of the full amount he would be required to take.  He will be asked, at the same time, to provide drying accommodation, so as to be able to take in that wheat over a period of two or three months, as may be considered advisable or necessary. As these orders will be served about the end of December, the miller will be given reasonable time to provide the necessary storage and the necessary drying accommodation, before 1st September following.</P>
    <P>It is also provided in this Bill that the miller will be required to purchase a certain percentage of his quota or national percentage each month.  During the year 1934-35, we fixed, under existing legislation, a national percentage of ten.  Each miller had to take, in Irish wheat, 10 per cent. of his whole requirements. There was nothing to compel the miller to take all, or even a large part, of that 10 per cent. at once. The miller would be doing his duty by taking 1 per cent. of the 10 per cent. each month.  Unfortunately, our producers cannot wait in such cases. The producer is anxious to get rid of his wheat as soon as it is threshed and we know, from the experience of the last two years, that about 80 per cent. of the wheat delivered to millers is delivered before Christmas.  We are taking power to compel the millers to take a certain percentage each month. It might be 15 per cent. in September, increasing to 40 per cent., including the 15 per cent., in October; 60 per cent. in November and 80 per cent. in December.  I am giving these figures merely at random.  They have <Col N="492" /> not been considered.  I merely give them as an example of how the scheme will work.  The miller will be compelled, subject to penalty, to take that amount himself or through an agent.  He can appoint an agent in some other part of the country to buy wheat on his account, subject to the sanction of the Minister.  When we brought in the cereals legislation originally, a very big inducement was given to the grower to hold over his wheat until after Christmas because we foresaw the difficulty to the millers of dealing with all the wheat immediately after the harvest.  In the first cereal year, the price fixed was 23/6 per barrel up to the middle of December.  Then, we had a waiting period and, after the middle of January, the price was 25/- per barrel.  That did not appear to be a sufficient inducement to the producers to hold over their wheat.  The following year, we made the price 23/6 before Christmas and 26/- after Christmas.  That applied during the past season, and it induced a certain number of farmers to keep over their wheat; but it did not induce a sufficient number.  I am afraid that to get farmers to keep over their wheat the financial inducement would have to be very big.  They want the money, but farmers who admitted that they did not want the money told me that they had difficulty as to storage.  If they store in the stack, there is considerable damage done by vermin. They have also the increased cost of threshing their corn twice in the year&mdash;a considerable item.  If they thrashed all the wheat at one time, then they have not got lofts to store it, so that taking everything into account they think they are better off by getting rid of it as soon as possible, even though the price is a little lower.  Of course, there are other considerations.  There is a certain amount of shrinkage, and those farmers who sow their own seed would be compelled to thrash a certain amount after the harvest, in order to supply the seed.  The result has been that we have not induced any considerable number of farmers to keep wheat over until after Christmas.</P>

      <P>That is so.  I am afraid we will have to face the fact that a greater part of the wheat grown will be thrown upon the market after the harvest.  In order that there may be no serious doubt about getting it absorbed, it is necessary to put in a provision to take a certain part each month, and in that way to get rid of it as it comes on the market.</P>
      <P>There is a slight change in the cereal year.  It commenced on August 1st and ended July 31st.  It is now changed, so that the year commences on September 1st and ends August 31st.  That was considered advisable both by growers and millers on the Consultative Council. Practically no wheat is sold before September 1st.  In any case farmers who thrash before then will have only a short time to wait for the market to open.  Last year was a very early year, as some wheat, I think, was reaped in the first week of August.</P>

      <P>Last year was an extraordinarily early year, some wheat being out during the first week in August. Even so, by the time it was harvested, brought to the haggards and thrashed, it was the 16th or 20th of August, and it will not be any hardship on farmers to hold over the crop for ten days. Still, if a farmer wishes, there is nothing to prevent millers taking delivery then.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think no miller will refuse to take any what even before September 1st seeing that the cereal year will commence then.  The millers <Col N="494" /> are anxious for the change and the growers saw no objection to it.  I was asked why we were changing.  Because it is rather difficult sometimes to get matters cleared up.  They may seem to be cleared up, but we find that there are always a few odd lots left over. There is provision in the Bill to deal with that.  Whatever we may fix as the national percentage, it is impossible to imagine that we can absorb exactly the amount of wheat available.  If we fixed it at 20 per cent. this year we might have more than that, but with anything else we might not have enough.  We have to give the millers until the end of May to use 20 per cent., especially as time goes on and the percentage gets bigger.  If we want to get a more or less uniform mixture of flour the difficulty is to deal with odd lots that are in the hands of farmers.  There is a provision which gives the Minister power to serve notice on any miller to take wheat from any farmer provided that it does not exceed ¼ per cent. in the case of any miller.  That may take some time.  We get complaints from farmers that they have wheat on hands that they cannot sell.  We cannot assume that every farmer is in that position.  Therefore, we will have to give time for the issuing of advertisements asking farmers with wheat to notify the Department.  We will also have to serve notice on millers to take individual lots.  Taking these things into account, we may require longer than the last day of July.  It is going to do no harm to anyone to make the cereal year September 1.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We can discuss that in Committee.  That necessitated another sub-section making the next cereal year one of 13 months.  The present year ends July 31st.  The next cereal year will begin August 1st, 1935, and will run to August 31st, 1936.  With regard to imported wheat, the miller is compelled to take the quota on a 13 months' basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister can lend money for the building of stores and drying plant.  If notice is served on a miller requiring <Col N="495" /> him to provide certain storage or drying facilities he may possibly put up the plea that he has not got the money to do so.  That may or may not be true. Fearing it may be true, it may be necessary for the Minister to be in a position to lend the money.  I can assure Deputies that we are not looking for this business and that our terms will not be more attractive than the terms to be got from ordinary banks.  If any Deputy represents the banks he need have no fear that the Minister has any intention of going into competition with them.</P>
    <P>There is a provision with regard to seed wheat.  We have a scheme under which a merchant could supply seed on credit and the farmer authorises the Minister to pay what is due out of the bounty when it is ascertained.  Under this Bill that scheme must go.  But it is unfair, we believe, to merchants who are still out of their money, and who gave credit, to leave them without any provision for payment this year.  Naturally, merchants gave the seed on credit expecting that the Minister would be in a position to pay them for the seed when the bounty became due.  We are meeting that in a certain clause, by making the wheat crop, in effect, the property of the Minister.  When the Minister directs a farmer to sell to a certain dealer or a certain flour miller, he pays for the seed out of the proceeds of the sale and gives what is left to the farmer.  After this year, however, I do not think it will be possible to have a credit scheme&mdash;certainly not of that nature, because there is no fund out of which the merchant would be guaranteed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, it will be so in quite a lot of cases.  This Bill, of course, continues the principle of fixing the price two years ahead.  Under the original Act, the Executive Council made an order, two years before the cereal year commenced, fixing the price of wheat.  That is to say, if we were working under the present Act without this amending Bill, the Executive Council would be required, before the last day of July of this year, to fix the price for the 1937-38 crop.  We are providing in this Bill that the price that has been already fixed by the Executive Council for the 1936-37 crop and the 1937-38 crop will stand as fixed and that, in future, the Executive Council will fix the price two years ahead as in the original Act, with certain changes such as that, instead of fixing a standard price, they would fix the minimum price in accordance with the bushel weight and so on as set out in the Second Schedule of this Bill.  I think that these are the main principles of the Bill, and I do not think it is advisable to go into the different sections of the Bill in detail at the moment, because I believe that they can be dealt with better on the Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the principal points in the Bill, as the Minister pointed out, is the provision that, practically speaking, does away with the bounty and, instead, passes the cost of the scheme, whatever it may be, on direct to the consumer.  I <Col N="497" /> think that is a fair presentation of what the Minister himself considers to be one of the principal points in the Bill.  There was no indication in the Minister's speech of what that would cost to the consumer, even in the coming year.  One would have expected that, in the case of an important Bill of this kind, a Bill that the Minister has had before him for a long time and that he and his Department have fully considered, he would have been in a position to give us an estimate of how that affects the consumer and how it affects the price of bread.  Some time ago, speaking in the House&mdash;I think it was on the General Resolution of the Budget&mdash;the Minister will remember that he estimated, I think, the number of acres that he expected to be under wheat this year at 200,000.  Am I correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>From 180,000 to 200,000 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good, between 180,000 and 200,000 acres.  The Minister will remember, I think, that there was a slight difference of opinion between him and Deputy O'Leary as to the number of barrels he can expect per acre.  The Minister was not anxious to dispute that, possibly, it would be about seven or eight barrels and that that would mean, practically speaking, at least £2 10s. 0d. of a subsidy, if a subsidy continued.  Accordingly, this year alone, we may take it for granted that, had the old system continued, the Minister would have had to provide on these figures&mdash;I wonder has he other figures&mdash;a subsidy of about £500,000.  I think that is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that figure is correct, but the Minister for Finance said that he expects to save £260,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not all go to the millers.  About 30,000 acres, roughly, go to farmers' own households.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Even taking <Col N="498" /> that 30,000 acres out, it does not materially reduce the figure.  It does not bring it down to £260,000.  I do not think the Minister can do that even with the aid of the rather fallible Minister for Finance.  I remember mentioning on a previous occasion what the ultimate cost of this would be to the tax-payer in that instance; now it practically means an increase in the price of bread, because that is what it comes to.  The Minister expected 800,000 acres but he mentioned now that the bounty would reach about £1,500,000.  I think it would have been a great deal more than that.  I think that on the same calculation of 800,000 acres it would be closer to £2,000,000. However, as I say, these are purely speculative figures.  The Minister assumes, tentatively at all events, that the same rate of increase can be kept on.  Is that likely?  The Minister assumes, therefore, that in five or six years the taxpayer&mdash;that is, the consumer or the person who eats bread under the new system&mdash;would have to pay all that.  What he bases the rapid increase on, especially over a period of six years, is not clear to me.  I think the Minister is overlooking the very important fact that, naturally the amount of additional land suitable for wheat is bound to diminish.  After you have reached a certain peak point, the rate of increase will obviously decrease. Leaving that aside, however, I think there is a much more important objection to the Minister's estimate of the number of years in which he hoped to be able to provide wheat for this country from this country, and that is that he is inducing people to grow wheat at present, by means of the bounty system, by paying for wheat a great deal more than its economic value.  He has done that deliberately.  In that way, he has induced a number of farmers, against their better judgment, to grow wheat.  He has made it, for the moment, economic for them to do so, and he has made it economic for them to do so by the help that he has given whether by way of subsidy under the system that is passing away or by means of putting it on to the consumer as the Minister now acknowledges his purpose is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="499" /> The Minister will remember, however, that more than once in this House he has acknowledged&mdash;although the point has been put up to him again and again without eliciting an answer, since he went back on that acknowledgment &mdash;that the success of his wheat policy will depend on a proper rotation of crops.  He ought to know that, although he may induce farmers to continue to grow wheat for a couple of years, merely because there is a bounty paid on them, unless it is economic for them to go in for a proper rotation of crops, they are destroying the land, and therefore, it is impossible to consider the Minister's Estimate and this Bill and the powers he now asks, without bearing in mind that his policy has fundamentally changed since he first introduced this cereals policy. At that time, the House will remember, he acknowledged that you must have a proper rotation of crops; that an increase in the cereals meant an increase in the root crops; and he acknowledged, equally, that an increase in root crops meant an increase in cattle.  Now he has deliberately departed from that policy.  The Government&mdash;and he is responsible for their agricultural policy &mdash;have deliberately taken measures to see that that cattle policy cannot be continued.  They have made it uneconomic and they have gone in, as the Minister knows, and as the House will remember, for a deliberate policy of destroying the cattle, of destroying the calves, the future source of the cattle. I have never heard the Minister even attempting to deal with the various challenges that were thrown up to him, namely, that an increased wheat policy must mean an increased cattle policy and before the House permits him to tax, and to tax very heavily, the staple article of diet of the country, namely, the bread of the people, they should have a much clearer statement from the Minister than he has deigned to give the House on that particular point up to the present.</P>
    <P>If you pay enough money, either by means of bounties or by exacting it from the eaters of bread, you will undoubtedly get people to sacrifice the future to the present.  Speaking on a <Col N="500" /> similar matter a couple of weeks ago, I instanced the case of a farmer who acknowledged that he was going to grow wheat this year and grow it next year on the same land, grow it the year after on the same land and grow it the year after that on the same land. He was asked why he was doing that and he gave what seemed to him to be the very solid reason, that, as a result of the policy of the Government, it paid because he got a bounty, and the other kind of agriculture for which he had gone in did not pay.  It was pointed out to him, and he acknowledged the force of the argument, that it meant that he was reducing his land to a desert by that particular conduct. He said he knew that quite well, but what else was he to do?  He was paid to do that and he was penalised, if he did not do it, if he kept to the old policy.  In a double way, therefore, the Minister proposes further to force this policy on the country.  He is going to tax, and tax very seriously, the bread of the people to subsidise wheat growing.  After all, that is what it means, and he is going to make unprofitable the other type of farming, for which people have gone in up to the present and the success of which is really connected with the success of his own policy, looked at over a period of years, as he acknowledged himself on more than one occasion in this House.  He is going to compel the people positively, by giving bounties and making the consumer pay, to go in for this type of farming and to make any other type of farming unprofitable.</P>
    <P>What is he doing?  This tax has been put on bread, on the most necessary article of food for every person in the country.  You may dispute whether the exact amount of money that must be put on to the eaters of bread this year is £350,000 or £400,000, but on it must go.  The Minister may say that the change is not a very great matter because if it did not come out of the bread it would have to come out of taxes anyhow, but surely there is a tremendous difference in the articles you select for your taxation.  There might be an outcry, and there has, I <Col N="501" /> understand, been an outcry, against certain recent taxes imposed by the Government on tea, sugar and tobacco, and it may possibly have come to the notice of one or two members of the Government Party.  But suppose the Minister for Finance had proposed to put a tax on bread, what would have been the reactions to that proposal? Let Deputies ask themselves what they think would have been the answer of the country to that proposal.  Yet is that not what the present Bill proposes to do?</P>
    <P>The Minister may say: &ldquo;We have exhausted all the other sources of income and&rdquo;&mdash;as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance would put it&mdash;&ldquo;why should not the labourer pay?&rdquo;  But, putting a tax on bread certainly passes anything the Government has attempted up to the present. I will admit that in their finances, they have reached a certain stage at which they have to tax the very necessaries of life.  But the people could not have expected that they would put a proposal before this House, in cold blood, to tax bread.  That is what it means.  The Minister some weeks ago said: &ldquo;We are proposing in the new Bill that is coming along shortly, to shift that subsidy from the taxpayer to the consumer.&rdquo;  Leave out the words &ldquo;taxpayer&rdquo; and &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; and let us ask ourselves what it means.  The consumer is the person who eats the bread, and you are putting a tax on bread.  It has one great advantage, I will admit, from the point of view of the Government, in that you conceal it to a certain extent.</P>
    <P>I am not denying that this Bill has certain advantages.  I can well understand that the farmer is anxious to get his money as quickly as he can, especially at the present time, and possibly, although the Minister said that there were other reasons besides the reason of anxiety to get money, the experience of the Minister as to the different prices he fixes for the middle of January and the middle of December will bear him out in that. I am not at all anxious to deprive the Minister of any advantage which he can suggest that this Bill has for the <Col N="502" /> farmer in that respect, but I am certain that it has still greater advantage for the Government, and it is by no means an isolated example of their policy.  It is but one further example of the very objectionable system of taxation in which they have indulged for the last couple of years&mdash;that system of what I venture to call concealed taxation.  Not merely is it indirect taxation, but it is taxation which need not be mentioned in the ordinary Budget, or need not be mentioned when the Minister for Finance is introducing his Budget statement.  That was bad enough when you were dealing with articles like butter, or even sugar, but when you come to deal with bread it is much more objectionable.  It is taxing the people's bread and not telling them you are doing it, or at least concealing from them as much as possible the fact that you are doing it. From the point of view of national control over finance, this method in which the Government has been indulging more and more as years have gone on is highly objectionable.  But they have reached the limit, as far as taxation of that objectionable character is concerned, when they propose to deal with the most necessary article of diet in this particular way.</P>
    <P>There may be differences of view as to the effect which the promise of this Bill has already had on the price of flour in this country.  The Minister will remember that, when he was defending certain clauses in his Dairy Stabilisation Bill, he said the fact that the Bill was coming had already affected prices. He took that as a credit.  It has been pointed out from this side of the House that already this Bill has affected prices, and that the price of flour has gone up.  It has gone up in the last couple of months in this country, in anticipation of this Bill.  If Deputies have any doubt about it let them look at&mdash;shall I call them&mdash;the very evasive answers which were given by the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to the questions put to him not merely by Deputy Dillon, but even the lamb-like Deputy Davin.  After all, even if he is a grown-up lamb, nobody can accuse <Col N="503" /> Deputy Davin of a desire to hurt or damage the Government in any way. It is very remarkable indeed if he was satisfied with the replies which he got as to the effect of the cereals policy on the prices of flour and bread.  I commend those replies, given in the month of May and the month of June by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to the attention of Deputies.  Let each Deputy ask himself whether the Minister for Industry and Commerce was really giving a straight answer.  The price of flour has gone up.  The price of household flour has gone up from 27/- in February, to 28/- in March, 30/6 in April, and 33/- in May.  Those are quotations given to a Dublin retail merchant. Those figures relate to household flour; I am not speaking of bakers' flour, the price of which is much higher.  Has the Minister considered what this means in the way of taxation on bread?  The price of bread has already gone up, and the bakers have made it perfectly clear that any price which they have put on was not only called for, but more than called for by the increase in the price of flour.  Let the Minister read the reason given by his friends the millers.  It will be found that some of the reasons given were connected with the policy of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister is asking for this power to tax the bread of the people, because he claims that his policy is a success. The success which he claims for his policy is the increase in the acreage under wheat.  If you pay high enough, undoubtedly you can get the people to grow anything.  Has that increased acreage under wheat led to an increase in agricultural employment?  Have the two things increased <i>pari passu</i>? There has been an increase in the acreage under wheat for a number of years, and there has been a decrease in the number of people employed as agricultural labourers.  That does not suggest that power should now be given to the Minister under this Bill to tax the people's bread because he can get people to grow wheat, and because he can compel them to go out of cattle.  In Leinster, between the years 1931 and <Col N="504" /> 1933, there was a decrease of several thousands in the number of agricultural labourers.  The figure was 5,000 odd in Leinster; 4,000 in Munster; and in Connacht practically 1,100.  In all those areas there has been an increase in the amount of wheat grown.  It is not that where wheat was grown the number of agricultural labourers increased, and that in counties where it was not grown the number decreased.  On the contrary, in counties like, say, Wexford, which the Minister represents, you had a fairly considerable increase in wheat considering the size of the county, and a diminution of the number of agricultural labourers.  The same applies to practically every other county.  I, therefore, suggest that before the House gives to the Minister this power of covertly taxing the people's bread a little more justification of his policy is required than the number of acres which he had induced people to put under wheat.  We have no idea of the cost involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister&mdash;this is a matter of detail, but perhaps I might as well mention it here as it occurs to me&mdash;spoke of compelling the millers to provide certain accommodation in the way of storage and certain facilities for drying. They are to be compelled to do that. That cost, I presume, must also be passed on to the consumer, or does the Minister suggest that the millers will, philanthropically, bear it?  Has the Minister any idea as to what that is going to cost?  It will be an increasing cost if the policy of the Minister of an increased acreage under wheat year after year is to be taken into account. The Minister was, I admit, rather naive when he was dealing with the matter of storage and drying facilities and he confessed to a gamble&mdash;I can hardly call it anything better&mdash;that he brought off.  I have seen statements about the weather in the newspapers&mdash;whether it is always wise to follow these statements or not is another matter&mdash;but only for a day ahead.  The Minister confesses that if there had been a bad harvest, a wet year, as could easily have happened, owing to the fact that there was not in the country proper drying <Col N="505" /> or storage accommodation, all those who had gone in for wheat growing in the last couple of years would have been ruined.  It was a gamble on the weather and I admit it came off.  It is now confessed that it was a mere gamble.  The Minister acknowledged that the Opposition pointed out that fact to him.  I hold when you are dealing with important matters of this kind, and especially with what was to be the sheet anchor in the Government agricultural policy, a gamble is not quite enough.  A little foresight on the part of the Minister would have seen that proper storage accommodation and drying facilities were available before he entered on this policy.  He acted without taking that obvious precaution.  He was like a person who thought of taking money from the till, putting it on a horse, and hoping that he would be able to do more than pay it back.  It was a gamble in that way.  It came off, but we know what happens to people when the gamble does not come off.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of other points of interest, but I presume the Minister can deal with them more fully in Committee. There is going to be a minimum price fixed for wheat.  I notice the minimum price is to differ according to the quality of the wheat.  The Minister will probably say: &ldquo;Obviously so.&rdquo;  What is obvious about it?  You are deliberately doing an uneconomic thing in order to induce people to grow wheat, in order to induce this country to grow sufficient wheat for its inhabitants, irrespective of what it is going to cost.  It may be £1,500,000 or £2,500,000, but you are going to do it and it will be uneconomic.  Why discriminate against the unfortunate person who has bad land for wheat growing.  His intention is as good as the intention of anybody else, but his wheat may not be as good.  It is his misfortune if he has bad land.  It would be uneconomic to pay him the whole price, but the whole thing is uneconomic from start to finish.</P>
    <P>There is, as I have said, a minimum price.  Where is the guarantee that there will not be evasion?  I have heard of minimum prices being fixed for cattle and I have heard of minimum <Col N="506" /> prices not being paid.  There are many ways in which the unfortunate farmer can, in certain circumstances, be safely cheated out of his minimum price.  If you catch the miller you could deal with him, but if he is an astute person&mdash;and there is nothing in this Bill or in the recent policy of the Minister to suggest that the millers are not astute&mdash;there is nothing to prevent him not paying the minimum price and still getting away with it.  How evasion is going to be avoided unless you have a large number of officials, which, apparently, the Minister does not contemplate, I find it hard to understand.  The Minister mentioned a diminution of officials that he anticipated under this Bill.  What he indicated was that, in future, work that might be done by the Department will now be done by the millers.  Of course, that will cost them something and they will put on the price either to the farmer or to the consumer.  It may be a better way of doing the work, but you do not get rid of the cost of it by putting it from one set of people on to another set of people.  Possibly in Committee the Minister will explain what is the precise procedure under Section 13.  Certain methods will be decided on by the Minister as being the proper methods to determine the quality of wheat and no other methods can be used.  I think that is the ultimate purpose of the section and that is to be carried out by the millers. Am I not right in that, too?</P>

      <P>Under the regulations, and those methods are to be applied by the millers.  Who is to supervise the millers?  Who will check the miller as to the verdict he passes on the quality of the wheat?  Will it be the ordinary farmer, who is not accustomed to this sort of thing?  I am not saying that the Minister cannot make this matter clear, but I do hope he will clarify the situation when he is replying.  Can the ordinary farmer coming with his wheat be left in no doubt as to the quality of it or will he have to rely on the word of the miller or the miller's helpers?  If <Col N="507" /> not, how will it be supervised?  It may be the Minister may get rid of some officials, but it seems to me that he is likely to get a number of other officials on.  It is admitted that the one advantage of the Bill, in the intention of the Minister, is that it enables the farmer to get the full price immediately, the difference between what I might call the world price and the special price for Saorstát Eireann.  He has not made it quite clear that when putting the tax on to the consumer, the tax on bread, whether that could not be done under the subsidy system.</P>

      <P>That is what I was anxious to be clear about.  I could not see why it could not be done under the bounty system.  I think I have dealt with the principal points that I wanted to make.  Generally speaking, I think this is one more instance of the very objectionable practice that the Government&mdash;I was going to say slipped into, but they do not slip into objectionable practices; they go deliberately into them; they slip into good things occasionally, they blunder into good things.  But the objectionable practice they have adopted is this method of concealed taxation.  I protested against it before from the point of view of parliamentary government, from the point of view of the control over the finances of the country, which is really one of the most important things that a parliament can exercise &mdash;one of the most important functions of a parliament.  From that point of view the system is most objectionable. Practically speaking, it means that a certain portion of the Budget becomes permanent&mdash;that there is not a yearly discussion.  This present Bill is a <Col N="508" /> further example of that.  On that account I am opposed to it and I am opposed to it particularly on account of the article that is being taxed in this particular way.</P>
      <P>If wheat is to be subsidised I think it is better that it should be subsidised out of the general taxes of the country that everybody has to pay.  There may be some chance then that the richer people may have to pay more than the poorer people.  That would be better than that it should be paid out of the very bread of the people.  The Minister may try to get over that particular point.  For that is what is meant by saying that it takes the tax off the tax-payer and puts it on to the consumer, to use his own phrase of a couple of weeks ago.  On these two grounds I am opposed to this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan's speech was extremely interesting.  I should like very much to understand his point of view as fully as possible. As far as I could understand him, Deputy O'Sullivan wants every type of agricultural produce in this country to be sold at a surplus price.  Butter is to be sold at a surplus price; corn is to be sold at a surplus price and similarly with cattle and bacon.  Nothing is to be sold above the surplus price, no matter how small the surplus price may be.  Anything above the surplus price the Deputy calls a tax.  I think it is altogether a misnomer to call it a tax.  If a thing is produced in Japan more cheaply than in Ireland or rather if it can be landed here more cheaply than we can produce it, the Deputy says that anything above the price at which it can be landed here is a charge on the consumer and is therefore a tax. That is a very extraordinary doctrine. It looks as if all our debates are to proceed in circles because no sooner have we finished on this discussion of national price versus world price than we start the same thing all over again. It is doubtful if there is anything we produce that could not be obtained more cheaply from some other country. If we are to allow that idea to dominate us I wonder where it will lead us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take another side of the question: If we allow ourselves to be dependent <Col N="509" /> entirely for these things that are now subjected to a &ldquo;secret&rdquo; tax I wonder what the future may hold for us.  There have been several conferences in the past few years designed to raise the price of wheat.  If the farmers in Canada or the Argentine were capable of doing it and if they could agree amongst themselves to do it, there is no doubt whatever that we would not be getting wheat at the price at which we are getting it.  Yet because that uneconomic price for wheat is raised by State action here we are told that that is putting on a secret tax on the people.  When Deputy O'Sullivan says we are taxing the people's bread what does that mean after all If one-third of the farmers of the country are growing wheat they will be producing bread for themselves and they will have no objection to the tax on &ldquo;the people's bread.&rdquo;  There will be another one-third at least if present circumstances continue as normal, who will always have such means that the small tax that is represented by this difference in price between the national price and the world price would not concern them; so that we cannot say that to them the difference in price is a serious matter.  Then there remains say one-third at the very most who are, generally speaking, living at a rather low standard and to whom any tax is a burden.  Does Deputy O'Sullivan contemplate that we are going to continue that system indefinitely?  Does he contemplate that you will always have that class of people living on the border-line of starvation?  Has he no hope that this country will be able to evolve such a system as will enable these people to bargain their labour so that they will be able to pay whatever is an economic price for the goods they buy, and that they will not be dependent upon far-off countries in the world to enable them to eke out a living?  It seems to me that there is no system in Deputy O'Sullivan's proposals or in his philosophy.  I think that on the Butter Bill the Deputy took rather a different attitude.  He rather advocated what he is only advocating as a last resort in this Bill that the difference between the economic price and the world price should be made up out of general <Col N="510" /> taxation.  He was forced to do that, of course, because otherwise he would have proposed that the dairy industry should be allowed to collapse.  There is only one thing standing between collapse for the dairy industry and its continuance and that is the system of levies and bounties and if Deputy O'Sullivan and is Party were back in power to-morrow they would have to face that position.</P>

      <P>The title of this Bill shows that it is an amending Bill. That being so, the policy of the main Act may only be discussed in so far as it is affected by the amending Bill.  The policy of wheat growing may not be discussed, much less the whole agricultural policy of the Government.  The agricultural policy will arise on other Estimates.  The Deputy is purporting to reply to the previous speaker who devoted most of his speech to criticising the Minister for putting the burden on the consumer rather than giving a bounty.</P>

      <P>I am sorry, Sir.  I had no intention of doing so and any remarks I made were merely combating the ideas that Deputy O'Sullivan put forward in stating his objection to this Bill.  I submit, Sir, that the amendment proposed in this Bill for collecting the subsidies on wheat growing is less expensive than what heretofore prevailed and I am rather surprised it was not thought of when the original Bill was framed..  There are office and other expenses involved in collecting the tax.  I do not know why it does not commend itself to Deputy O'Sullivan on that account.  It is as direct a way of raising money as any tax and must be much less expensive to the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was one point the Minister did not make clear, when he said it was going to compel the millers to buy certain quantities of wheat each month. I would like to know does that only refer to certain months.  I presume it does not refer to each month of the 12 months; that it refers only to four or five months of the year.  During these months he will compel the purchase of certain quantities of wheat that will <Col N="511" /> involve 80 per cent. of the produce within that period.  That will suit the farmers and will not inconvenience the millers.  In my opinion, the provisions of this Bill will be very helpful and will assist greatly in the growing of wheat in the country.  I am glad to support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SydneyBMinch" hpid="Mr. Minch Mr. Minch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>The attitude that I propose to take on this Bill would be probably more in support than in criticism of it.  I listened to my friend and colleague, Deputy O'Sullivan, with great interest.  There is no doubt that he fired some good shots at the Bill and made bull's-eyes.  He got his target well.  As a matter of fact, I thought I saw some feathers flying out of the Bill. This question raises a wide issue and there may be strong reason for opposition to the Bill on the lines it takes. But I would like to support the Bill purely from the farmers' point of view. Amongst the agricultural community a wheat-growing scheme, irrespective of how the bounty is administered or the subsidy granted, has been welcomed by grain-growers, and has been a source of revenue in grain-growing areas.  It seems to me that the new system to be adopted by this amending Act of the Cereals Bill, which the Minister is introducing, is the outcome of experience gained under the original Act.  It is primarily to help the grower more than any other interest.  I believe that the farmer will be far more benefited by receiving in full a settlement for his deliveries of wheat than having to wait for a considerable time for the different bounties in the year, before January and after January.  I believe that the purchasing of wheat under this new scheme will give a wider margin to the farmer and that the question of bushel weight will be to his advantage.  I believe every farmer can go into the buyer, whether the miller or those acting on behalf of the miller, and see there for himself the register of the bushel weight of his wheat, and he will, accordingly, be paid for that weight.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SydneyBMinch" hpid="Mr. Minch Mr. Minch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that a fairly standardised bushel is being adopted, and that with the wider scope for payment under the bushel weight system there can be very little objection by the farmer that he is not receiving full value.  There must be objections to every Bill and I presume objections can be also urged against this Bill.</P>
      <P>The first question that Deputy O'Sullivan referred to was the question of storage.  I do not believe that even with a double acreage this year as against last year, the storage in the country as it exists to-day will be inadequate to meet the deliveries that will be made.  The only danger which may exist to wheat-growing is the question of the weather.  No country can possibly find legislation that will defeat that.  We all realise that a wet summer would seriously interfere with the harvesting of wheat and would be most harmful.  But the same can be said, to a large extent, of any crops.  I believe that wheat-growing in this country is a very helpful crop and a help towards agricultural prosperity generally in these very hard times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that it will in some way compensate for the serious loss which the agricultural community are at present undergoing.  I am doubtful, though, as to how far wheat-growing is responsible for increased tillage or how far wheat has been substituted for oats and barley and is responsible for a diminution in the acreage under these crops.  It is very difficult to assess its value from the point of view of an increase in labour.  It certainly does help to give employment in transport. I think that it would be fairly safe to say that about 100,000 tons of wheat were carried by rail, canal or lorry and that this year the amount will probably be doubled.  The complaints which are emanating from those who are interested in wheat, either from the point of view of growing it or converting it into flour, have reference to the huge expense which they will be called upon to meet by reason of the withdrawal of the bounty by the Government, with the result that they become responsible for the full payment <Col N="513" /> on purchases of wheat.  At the same time they become liable for extra storage.  They have to take up 80 per cent. of the crop inside three months, a fact which renders it necessary for them to look for new storage or rent new storage.  If they cannot finance that, I believe that they are empowered to go to the Minister for Agriculture and to seek through him a loan from the Minister for Finance.  If any information is correct the terms on which this loan is granted are out of all proportion to their capacity to pay.</P>
    <P>The millers in this country are divided into different classes from a financial standpoint.  Some of them can spend any amount, and others are fairly equipped with funds to carry on ordinary business.  There is a third class who will find it extremely difficult to find all the money to pay for such big quantities of native wheat for next year.  If they seek financial assistance, the terms make it almost impossible for them to avail of it.  I am informed, whether it is true or not, that they have to give first of all the security of the new buildings which they may erect, as well as their own personal security, and guarantee to repay the loan within five years at the rate of 5 per cent.  If that is so, it completely prevents them from seeking the loan from the Department of Finance.  Yet they will undoubtedly have to raise extra capital to finance the implementation of this Bill.</P>
    <P>As I shall have probably 15 amendments to put forward at a later stage of the Bill, either in my own name or in that of some other Deputy, I do not intend to refer to the Bill at any greater length to-night.  I just desire to say that in my opinion the Minister will require to take very strict steps to control the seed supply.  Even in this year, dealers have been none too sure, although they have certainly acted in good faith, as to whether they were selling winter wheat or spring wheat.  I believe that we have some cases in which winter wheat has been sold as spring wheat.  It will be probably Christmas Eve before the unfortunate farmers will be in a position to cut it.  I do not believe that that <Col N="514" /> has happened on a large scale.  As a matter of fact, the information I have is very limited, but yet it shows the grave necessity there is for the Department of Agriculture to establish a strict control of seed wheat and to see that those who deal in it will be compelled, as they are in the case of other seeds, to comply with strict conditions which will ensure that no inferior seed will go out and also that the brand or type of seed, which is sown, proves true to its name.  There has been a very wide margin between the prices at which seed wheat has been sold this year.  It seems to those who are in the trade that wheat must have been brought into the country at some extraordinarily low price and with a very flimsy guarantee as to its purity, its freedom from contamination, and that its germination was at least 99 per cent.  As the Government have held forth so much encouragement to wheat growers in advertisements, and as the agricultural community have responded by doubling the acreage as compared with last year, the Government should take steps to safeguard growers.  A great number of our farmers have lost touch with wheat growing, hence their knowledge of different classes of wheat is very immature.  New growers can be bamboozled and fooled into buying seed of questionable quality and are not in a position to contradict the promises given.  Later, when the crop proves a failure, they have no reasonable way of getting compensation.</P>
    <P>I believe that the scheme visualised in this amending Bill will work satisfactorily, and that the farming community will be able to obtain their seed on credit.  That will be of enormous help to them during a period when they find it extremely difficult to pay down cash.  The increase in the acreage under wheat will, I believe, present difficulties from the point of view of storage even though silos, etc., are being provided. I think it will be found difficult to handle the wheat crop. Farmers under this scheme will now be able to get a complete settlement for their wheat when they deliver it. That, I think, will prove to be of <Col N="515" /> great benefit to them.  Deputy O'Sullivan's criticism of the Bill did reveal a certain lop-sided economy, but, speaking from the point of view of the grower and the miller, it is in my opinion not only desirable but expedient that in these days we should grow as much wheat as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Our main objection to this Bill is, as Deputy O'Sullivan has pointed out, that the burden in connection with wheat growing is being transferred from the Government to the consumer.  Deputy Moore said he was surprised that that easy practice was not adopted when the original measure was going through. The Deputy need not be surprised, because at that particular period the Government was an out-and-out poor man's Government.  I have a certain amount of sympathy with the Minister for Agriculture who has been driven into the present position by the Minister for Finance.  I have no doubt that if he were left to himself he would not have introduced this amending Bill but would have allowed things to go on as they have been, with the bounty being paid out of the Central Fund and consumers spared from the imposition that it is now proposed to put on them.  We know from experience that the price of bread has already been advanced by a ½d. in the City of Dublin, while in the City of Limerick it has gone up by 1d.  It is impossible to tell at the moment what further advance will be made in the price of bread when this amending legislation is put into operation.</P>
      <P>There are a few points in connection with this Bill that I want to deal with.  The Minister said that the millers would be more or less compelled to take all the wheat they require in the early part of the year.  He said that they might be asked to pay for 30 per cent. of their requirements in one month or even 60 per cent., but if I am right in my reading of the Bill it is quite possible that they may be asked to pay for 100 per cent.  Section 9 provides that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="516" /> ... for such cereal year a percentage (in this section referred to as the purchase percentage) fixed by such order shall be purchased and taken into store in such cereal year by holders of milling licences before the end of each month, specified in such order, in such cereal year, and such percentage may, in respect of any one month in such cereal year, be fixed at 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in the month of September the Minister may, quite reasonably, under the provisions of this measure tell a particular miller that he has to take 100 per cent. of his quota during that month.  From the point of view of finance that may create a very great difficulty indeed for a small miller.  There are very few millers who would be able to buy in advance, for cash, 100 per cent. of their requirements.  We had a good deal of argument when the original measure was going through on the question that there was no definition of what &ldquo;millable wheat&rdquo; is.  No attempt has been made to settle the question in this Bill.  There is a reference in it to millable wheat and home-grown wheat.  The millers are going to be compelled to buy home-grown wheat.  The Bill does not say that they are to be compelled to take only millable wheat.  I presume they will be asked to take all the wheat a farmer offers them.  From the farmer's point of view that is satisfactory, but it will necessarily have severe reactions on the price of flour hereafter.  As Deputy Minch has pointed out, if there is a wet season there is certain to be a considerable amount of indifferent wheat offered. If millers are to be compelled to take that, then, inevitably, it will add to the price of flour because some of that wheat will have to be discarded.</P>
    <P>The past two or three seasons have been very favourable for the growing of wheat, and yet, I understand, some millers were compelled to use some of the wheat they bought for admixture purposes.  If that has been the case during two favourable seasons, what is going to be the position suppose you have a wet season and a tremendously increased <Col N="517" /> supply of what?  A good amount of it will almost certainly not be millable. If the millers are compelled to purchase it they will not be able to use it in an admixture because the market for wheat for that purpose has reached saturation point.  I think we should have a clear-cut definition of what millable wheat is. We have been told that, when this measure comes to be operated, there will be a mechanical apparatus for the weighing of wheat.  I do not think it will be found an absolutely infallible method for testing the qualities of the wheat.</P>
    <P>What we really object to in this Bill is the reversal of the Government policy in regard to the payment of the subsidy.  If the price of bread becomes dearer than what it is, then it will be beyond the power of many poor people to buy bread at all.  It is almost certain that the price of bread will be dearer as a result of this Bill.  It is possible that the millers will have to take greatly increased supplies of wheat.  If much of that wheat proves to be of an inferior quality, then the method they are almost certain to adopt to recoup themselves for the losses occasioned by having to do so is to pass on the amount of their losses to the consumer in some way or other.  It is almost impossible to predict what the resultant increase in price of flour will be when this amending Bill becomes law.  As Deputy Minch said, subsidies are necessary to encourage people to produce an uneconomic crop.  If the Government are determined to proceed on that line, the necessary money should be provided out of central funds and not raised from the people who can least afford to pay.  No purpose would be served by dealing with the Bill in detail now.  It can be examined section by section in Committee.  We oppose the Bill on the ground that this huge burden ought not to be passed on to the already overburdened consumer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFinlay" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>I come from an agricultural area and I grow a good deal of wheat.  Deputy Corry said the week before last that he would like to hear <Col N="518" /> Deputy Finlay speak about farming. I do not know where he got his information that Deputy Finlay was a farmer.  At all events, I am a farmer and I till a big percentage of my land. I grew wheat long before the growing of that crop was recommended by the Minister.  During ten or 15 years I grew it successfully, and I grew it unsuccessfully owing to the inclement weather.  I have had to plough up crops of wheat and sow barley in their stead.  The Minister for Agriculture mentioned that we had been very fortunate as regards climatic conditions during the past couple of years.  He is correct in that.  During the last couple of years, farmers were very fortunate in that respect.  If we have an inclement season&mdash;which, I hope, we shall not&mdash;and if a small farmer has two acres or ten acres of wheat, he may not be able to sell all his wheat at once.  If he sells only 40 per cent. of it, what is he going to do with the other 60 per cent?  We know that farmers, when they thresh their barley, put it into stacks and leave it in the haggard, covered with winnowing sheets.  It is left there, perhaps, a week or a fortnight before going to the maltster.  If the farmer can only get an open market for 40 per cent. of his wheat, what is to become of the other 60 per cent?  He has no loft or barn in which to store that wheat for a month, two months, or three months. As I mentioned to the Minister by way of interjection, the farmer wants to sell his crop immediately.  Ninety per cent. of farmers want to get the money for their crop as soon as it is ready for the market, and any man who is tilling his land has plenty of calls on that money.  It will be very hard on the small farmer, who has very little storage accommodation, if he has to retain 60 per cent. of his wheat crop until November or December.  It is not, of course, necessary that he should keep it longer than that, but, as the months go on, he will get a larger price.  Very few farmers are in a position to do that.  They did not do that up to the present because finance did not permit them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The man who wants to go into farming <Col N="519" /> at the present time requires to serve his time.  I hear a lot of people talk in this House about farming. Judging by my experience, they know nothing about farming.  I have been working a farm of 100 acres, 40 per cent. of which is in tillage.  I do not claim to be an expert farmer, and I do not think that more than three farmers would make that claim in my area.  Yet, I hear members come in here and advocate the adoption of certain methods in farming.  As a member of the farming community, I have listened to them with disgust. But we have to tolerate all this sort of stuff week after week.  I compliment Deputy Corry on the remarks he makes with regard to farming, because anything in his mind comes out just as if you opened the window of a house in which there was a smoking chimney. That is all the meaning Deputy Corry's remarks have.</P>
    <P>Deputy Minch made a suggestion with regard to seed wheat.  In that he is quite right.  We have in my area&mdash; Leix&mdash;a very bad acreage of wheat. We have had a lot of wheat ploughed up and white oats or barley put down instead.  We have a lot of wheat which should have been ploughed up because it is giving no crop.  What is there is just dirt.  The people had to seed this crop at a cost of 25/- to 50/-. If they had put down oats again, it would have cost them 30/- additional. In all the cost would have been £3/10/- or £4 to them.  I am not blaming any exporter or retailer or seed merchant, but one thing that should be looked after by the Department is the distribution of seed.  As Deputy Minch mentioned, in many areas in my part of the country winter wheat was sold for spring wheat.  Wheat in my own area, sown for spring, did not ripen, and was never cut.  These are the facts.  I am not here to talk about things I read in the paper.  I am speaking of what I have seen.  What I should like to stress is that if the farmer is not able to sell his wheat after it is thrashed and get his money, it will be a great hardship on him.  When a small farmer thrashes his corn, he wants the money. <Col N="520" /> The corn is stacked in the haggard and there is no loft or other accommodation. If he has to wait for payment until he delivers his wheat in two or three instalments, he might as well have no wheat at all.  The money would mean nothing to him if he were to be paid at intervals of weeks.</P>
    <P>Another thing about this Bill is that under it the Minister will own the wheat crop.  Farmers will have no claim to their crops.  The Minister will take full charge and will pay the merchant for seed that was obtained on credit.  If there are pounds, shillings or pence left the Minister will have the pleasure of distributing them to the farmers.  It would be like the beet question, where the crop does not belong to the farmers.  The Government owns the crop and will own the land so that farmers will be only working it.  I am sorry that that is the position because farmers always got a decent living out of the land.  Now they are being reduced to the position of working slaves for the State.  I would not agree with the Minister in his statement that a series of crops could be grown on the same land.  The Minister comes from a good agricultural county, Wexford.  Leix and Wexford claim to be two of the best counties in the Free State for agriculture.</P>

      <P>Leix held its own with Kilkenny last year.  The Deputy never sowed any wheat or tilled any land. He would rather be going around telling the people how to till the land. The Minister said that a rotation of crops could be got off the land.  I agree that lea land could be tilled and that a crop of wheat could be got out of it. I should like to see the second crop of wheat grown on that land.  It would be no good to the farmer.  I do not believe that the cattle trade is gone for ever.  Without farm-yard manure there is no use bothering to sow wheat, beet or any other crop.  It would be a fool's policy to do so, or to expect a good crop of wheat from artificial manure.  I have 30 years' experience of the practical working of a tillage <Col N="521" /> farm.  If I did not serve my time to farming in these 30 years then I must be a dud.</P>

      <P>You are responsible for this contribution.  The House will be able to judge for itself whether it is an advantage for me to intervene or not.  I may inform Deputy Finlay that I am a farmer and that I grow wheat, beet and other crops.  The Deputy mentioned two acres.  I grow seven times that amount.  I had not to plough any land for wheat this year, yet my wheat is as good as any that I had in recent years.  It is quite a good crop.  This is not the first year I grew wheat.  I venture to say that I till as much land as Deputy Finlay. I was reared on a farm in a district where alternative methods of farming was the rule.  The people there always tilled more than the average percentage. I happen to be one of those farmers who carry on mixed farming. I grow both oats, barley and wheat.  I know the conditions that obtain in the neighbourhood since I was a boy.  With regard to cereals generally, before the admixture scheme was put into operation by the present Government, I know that we had to sell our first-grade barley from 13/- and second-grade from 10/- to 11/- a barrel, and sometimes had to keep it for months before being able to dispose of it.  I know, and so does Deputy Finlay, from experience what it was to stand in queues outside the premises of the maltsters in the midlands and in the south of Ireland waiting to get them for God's sake to look at samples. Perhaps after waiting all day farmers would be told to come the next day, and then would not be able to make a sale.  The usual practice of the maltsters or distributors for Guinness was to take delivery and to fix up the price afterwards.  Otherwise, the barley would have to be stored or kept in the haggards.  I do not know what attitude Deputy Finlay takes in this question.  Is he against the admixture <Col N="522" /> scheme?  Does he contend that prices are not better now than before that scheme was put into operation, both for barley and oats?</P>

      <P>Not for years.  I know that I got practically 100 per cent. more than I got before the Government came into office.  There is no use in the Deputy making a display of vulgarity.  We know that the world price of wheat is uneconomic.  We know that the subsidies the Government gave encouraged wheat growing, and that subsidies were absolutely essential if the acreage of wheat was to be increased.  The Minister is going to ensure that if the farmers thresh their crop 40 per cent. of it will be taken off their hands.  I am in close touch with some farmers in Kilkenny who could not dispose of their wheat for several months after threshing, while their more favoured neighbours were able to do so.  I think it is fair to have the grain taken off their hands and otherwise to let those who can provide storage hold it over.  The Government's policy has encouraged grain growing, and it is a policy which meets with the approval of every agriculturist.  I have no doubt that the country realises that, and so does Deputy Finlay.</P>

      <P>You are guaranteed 23/6.  The climate is not worse here since Fianna Fáil came into office.  In my opinion, it is a good deal better. Some people say that we have had de Valera weather.  At any rate, it has been all to the good.  I presume the climate here is not much worse than it was when this country produced 700,000 acres of wheat and did an export trade.  It certainly cannot be worse than the climate in Sweden.  The present policy has been accepted despite all the tosh and propaganda <Col N="523" /> to create an inferiority complex, and despite the policy of defeatism that has been preached for years.  The present policy has put working farmers on their legs.  I say that unhesitatingly and I defy contradiction.  That is the belief amongst working farmers, and I believe this cereal policy will receive the unanimous support of the House.</P>

      <P>The principal objection I have to the Bill is the withdrawal of the bounty by the Government which I think will have a serious effect on the price of flour.  The present price is round about 36/8 per 20 stone.  One can visualise, when this Bill is in operation during the next cereal year, the price being considerably increased. Deputy Gibbons may say that that is all to the good; that it is a good thing for farmers to get a good price for wheat.  I suppose it is.  I do not want to expound my agricultural experience, as other Deputies have done, but I say that this is a very serious problem, and that I would prefer the situation as it was before this Bill was introduced, because I believe that there would be a better chance of a farmer getting a price.  I believe that the miller will now be very particular about the quality of wheat when he is paying 23/6 per 20 stone for it.  Heretofore, when he was paying 16/- or 17/-, he might be a little more lenient as regards his classification of the crop, but when he has to pay 23/6 I am afraid that we will want to have first quality grade wheat in order to get that price.  Naturally, we will all be hoping to get it; I know that I will be hoping to get it, but I suppose we will have to take our chance in connection with that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is just another objection that I have, and that is where the Minister <Col N="524" /> takes possession, so to speak, of the wheat crop in order to pay for the seed which the farmer got from the merchant. I object altogether to legislation of that kind or to the Minister being put in that position, no matter for what purpose.  I think it is a very bad headline for a Government to take, and it puts a farmer into a very unreal position, so to speak.  The Minister said he would take possession of the crop in order to see that a merchant got paid.  I think that legislation along these lines is very injurious, and I do not care what the circumstances were or are, or will be in the future, I think it is not right to take that line.</P>

      <P>How, then, is the merchant to be guaranteed his payment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>Has he not the farmer to whom he sold the seed?  Has he not the same way of getting paid that he has in one hundred and one other things?  The Minister does not guarantee payment for every commodity as between the merchant and the farmer. If the farmer buys cereals or anything else from the merchant, the Minister does not guarantee payment.  Why should the Minister, in this case, take over the crop for the sake of seeing that the merchant gets paid for his wheat seed, no matter what the legislation was in connection with the present cereal year?  These, as I say, are the objections I have to this measure.  I think it will have a very serious effect on the people who can least afford it. Surely, the Minister will agree that the price of flour at the present time, which is around about 37/6 or 36/8 per 20 stones, is very high.  I make the suggestion that, no matter what Deputy Minch might say&mdash;I suppose Deputy Minch might have other interests than those of the farmers in this connection; we are not all the same, and he might be both a miller and a farmer&mdash;the millers are getting too much out of this <Col N="525" /> whole legislation.  Rightly or wrongly, I have an idea that the millers are get ting too much out of it.  I believe that they are, because I believe that the price of flour is unreasonably high at the present time.  I have calculated the price of it and I think there is no justification whatever for the price of flour at the present time.  Certainly, Government legislation in this country at the present time is tending to make people who are in protected positions rich at the expense of every section in the community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no fault to find with this Bill except that, perhaps, it does not go far enough.  Certainly, I find fault with it in not being thorough enough.  In October, 1928, I wrote as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Department of Agriculture should be requested to instruct the committees of agriculture to endeavour to treble the wheat crop. There will be no difficulty in obtaining this increase if the Government at once pass legislation providing that, from and after the 1st November following, all flour sold in this country must contain at least 15 per cent. of home-grown wheat.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I wrote that seven years ago, in 1928, and I am glad to see that the Government to-day is adopting, substantially, that policy.  I did not hear any argument advanced that would bring any conviction to me against the policy of the Government in abandoning the bounty system and introducing the percentage system.  Of course, on the Budget, we could find an objection to that, and I raised an objection to that; or rather, not an objection, but I pointed out that with no reduction in taxation the amount that went to bounties before should be there from the produce of the taxation for other purposes, and that the Minister for Finance was gaining that.  While, however, that was and could be raised in its proper place, I do not see how it can be advanced against the Minister for Agriculture or against an agricultural policy, but especially against the Minister for Agriculture, who has no control over that financial end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="526" /> It has been stated by speakers that we are asked to grow a crop that is uneconomic.  I held to the principles of wheat growing, as I have just read them out, since 1928 and before that time.  I had some doubts of the wisdom of rushing into wheat growing, for two reasons.  One reason was the very cheap price at which we were getting wheat; and I thought that, in the circumstances perhaps, we could wait until the world wheat market found an economic level and that we could take advantage of buying foreign wheat at a price that no country in the world can produce it at.  We can buy wheat at the present time, and for the last couple of years, at a price below the cost of production in any country in the world.  For that reason, I thought it would be good business for us to take advantage of buying that dumped surplus of wheat that was available.  However, as I mentioned before, a change has come over the situation because of the danger of another big war, and I was afraid, that in such an event, we would not have bread in this country. Accordingly, that has changed my opinion with regard to that aspect of it.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned here that we are proposing to grow wheat and that we cannot sell it at an economic price, and that an artificial price is being put on it.  I put this to the House, and I think I can challenge contradiction on it, that in no wheat-growing country in the world to-day is wheat sold locally as cheaply as we can buy it on the international market.  We can buy best Manitoba wheat at 13/- or 14/- a barrel.  I do not think you can buy Canadian wheat at that price and I do not think the Canadian consumer can buy it.  Australian wheat for home consumption is kept at an economical level so as to help the wheat growers. When we are considering the price at which we can import foreign wheat here, let us bear in mind that we are not considering a product which is put on the market here at an economic price.  It is a dumped product, a surplus in wheat growing countries. About 20 wheat-growing countries have been coming together for the last three <Col N="527" /> or four years with a view to agreement as to limitation of the area under wheat in the respective countries, but they are like the nations which meet in Geneva and talk about peace and disarmament. While talking about disarmament, they are arming up to the hilt at home, and these large wheat-growing countries, while talking about reducing the area under wheat, are growing as much as ever and, perhaps, more.  Now, by some juggling, the price of wheat is going up, and the juggling is being carried out by these countries, so that it is not fair to consider the wheat position from the point of view of what we can buy foreign wheat at now.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the question which I should have liked the Minister to develop.  I am not satisfied that we are plunging into wheat growing on a large scale in an intelligent manner.  The question of seed wheat has been raised by a couple of speakers.  It was stated first, I think, by Deputy Minch, and his disclosures were seconded by Deputy Finlay, that in some parts of the country, spring wheat had been sold for winter wheat and <i>vice versa.</i>  Surely, if, in this age of advanced agriculture, anything like that happens, or if there is a possibility of the like of that happening, it shows that we are not ready for the pushing wheat-growing policy which the Government is taking on.  Deputy Gibbons said that they could grow wheat in Sweden, and we should be able to grow it here.  Deputy Gibbons will understand that I do not mean any affront to him when I say that platitudes of that kind will lead us nowhere. Wheat can be grown in every country and every soil in the world, but to get wheat to grow as a commercial proposition, in every country in the world in which it has been introduced by man, the strain suitable for that soil and climate had to be bred, and we have not got such a strain in this country. I should be glad if the Minister were able to contradict that statement when he is replying.  I want him to understand that I am not making it as an argument against wheat growing.  I always favoured it and, in the new <Col N="528" /> circumstances which have arisen this year, I favour a quickening of the pace for reasons I have already given.</P>
    <P>In Canada, in Australia, and in California wheat growing was a failure until the proper strain was bred.  I understand that the latest strain bred in Canada, which has put a large area of the northern regions under wheat&mdash; the Marcus strain&mdash;has been introduced here, and I should like to hear from the Minister what success has attended that strain.  I should also like to know what success has attended the Red Stettin strain.  That was sorted and graded out from the old wheat that was brought up by the Albert College from Tipperary about 12 or 14 years ago.  It was supposed to be the descendant of a great Tipperary wheat of 70 or 80 years previously, but when examined here, this good sample was found to contain 65 different strains of wheat.  It was all supposed to be Red Stettin.  The Minister knows all about the strain bred from that and crossed with other strains.  Great hopes were entertained in regard to its growing properties here, and I should like to hear the Minister on that when he is replying.</P>
    <P>I should also like to hear the Minister dealing with what was a difficulty of the Department a few years ago in regard to the extensive growing of wheat.  Experts there feared the extensive development of wheat growing, in the then absence of a suitable strain, because they could not stand over any wheat except the softer varieties, and these were far more liable to disease than hard wheats. They feared that the extensive growth of these wheats, before a good strain would be discovered or bred, might impregnate the land with disease and render it unsuitable for extensive wheat growing, when we would have bred a good strain by some fortunate chance.  I should like to know if the Minister is quite clear that he is running no danger in what I might call this promiscuous wheat growing which is going on at present.  It was mentioned that seed wheat has been imported here and that proper track was not kept as to which season it <Col N="529" /> belonged to.  I quite realise that the Minister, who is only three years in the Department, cannot control circumstances that must work themselves out over a far greater number of years, but I think it is a mistake to have to import any seed wheat here.  The plant breeding section of the Department should be able to look after that and to provide the strains.  We can grow the seed here once we have the strain.  We all know that any strain of any crop introduced into this country has almost invariably been better in the second or third year, when it has become acclimatised to the soil and climate, than in the first year, so that the Department should breed the strain as quickly as they can.  Until they have the proper strain bred they should select the areas to produce seed wheat, keep a proper watch over it, and sell nothing but the best and purest of the largest germinating quality.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given us here a second schedule which gives prices.  I think we have now reached a period of development in wheat growing when something more than a slap-dash system like this should be adopted.  I should like to see before next seeding &mdash;if it cannot be done in this Bill, or if the Minister is not prepared to do it&mdash;a supplementary Bill introduced which would give encouragement to the cultivation of hard wheat.  We all know that the easiest wheat to grow is what is known as soft wheat.  The hard wheats take a long time in the ground, and are delicate growers in their early stages.  The crop is a precarious one, because in the early stages, when the growth is delicate, weeds overcome the crop, and many of them have to be ploughed out.  Also, on the whole, they do not give a good yield. Quite obviously, with that record behind the hard wheats, and the growers paid on a quantity basis, they will grow what will give them the greatest yield, regardless of quality or requirements.  It is in the hands of the Minister, and in nobody else's hands, to ensure that a start should be made to provide our requirements in the harder wheats.  They are the only wheats suitable for producing loaf bread.  The softer ones are suitable <Col N="530" /> for home-made soda cakes, and of course there is also a certain percentage of them used to make flour for bakers purposes.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware also that experiments carried out in the strains known in this country nine years ago were highly successful.  The wheats we are growing in every county in the Free State are all good marketing samples, some of them equal to the best Manitoba wheat.  The growing of those wheats, and the selling of them at 27/- or 24/- as the case may be, according to the time of the year and according to the bushel weight, is not as good a proposition for those hard wheats as for the soft ones.  It would be well if the Minister, from the data in his own Department, would work out what would be comparative prices.  Taking the price for soft wheat as a basis, he could work out what would be an equitable price for the harder wheats. I wonder whether two years is a long enough period in which to guarantee the price for wheat?  I think the period should be increased, because there is just this danger of a trick in it: once the farmer is committed to providing 7,000 or 8,000 acres of land for wheat, there may be a loosening of the props that keep up that price, and he may be left with that amount of extra broken land on his hands.  In the ordinary agricultural economy, an increase of 7,000 or 8,000 acres of tillage to provide a wheat crop, would mean setting in motion the breaking of about 3,000,000 or 4,000,000 acres in order to keep up the rotation.  It has been mentioned here that we must grow this crop in rotation.  We must, and this wheat scheme will meet its Waterloo if agriculture is not put in a position to give that stimulation in the rotation which is absolutely essential in every old country that has been cultivated for centuries.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the cattle side of it, or into the economic war side of it.  We had a good deal of that on a recent occasion on the Finance Bill and other things, and I expect we will have it again on the Minister's Estimate.  On the question of growing wheat from lea, Deputy <Col N="531" /> Finlay mentioned that it would not be much good the second year.  I quite agree that it would not be worth growing the second year.  I do not think it is an advisable method of farming to grow it in lea at all, either the first year or the second year, but last year I saw quite good third year wheat on lea.  However, it was exceptionally good land.  But I do not think it is good farming.  As regards taking away value, there is no difference, in my opinion, between growing an exhaustive crop on land many years in succession, and exhausting the fertility of that land&mdash;fertility which has been built up by perhaps generations of good farming&mdash;and going in and robbing a bank.  It is up to the Minister for Agriculture not alone to see that the best crops, nationally, are grown, but to see that the land is handled in the best husbandlike fashion.  I am sure that neither he nor any other man in this country can get up and defend the robbing of the fertility of land in order to produce a crop for a year or two.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was speaking I was not quite clear as to the position with regard to the monthly percentage that the miller should take.  Is there any maximum limit to what the miller can take per month?  Can he take his whole yearly percentage in one month if he can get it?  If, say, he has to take 10 per cent. in a particular month, does that mean both the maximum and the minimum of what he can take, or does it just mean the minimum, and could he, if he wanted to, take 50 per cent. of his entire amount in that month?  When wheat growing develops here I am quite sure that there will be large farmers going in for extensive wheat growing, or there will be co-operative societies which will purchase the new harvesting machine.  I do not think any more than one has been introduced into this country, and I think its work last year was highly successful.  With the aid of a drier it was able to deal with the headlands&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go into the details of this.  I just want to point out that with the aid of this harvester, and a drier when it was raining, it was possible to cut lodged corn with practically no waste.  It was then rushed out to the drier, and the farmer got the first milling price for it.  As a matter of fact I saw that harvester in operation myself.  It is because of the necessity for having an open market when corn is ripe, and when perhaps harvesters of this kind would be brought into play, that I think the Minister should fix some date earlier than 1st September in case the wheat ripened before then.  There should be a ready market and an open market for wheat, because if it were to be harvested by those machines it would mean that it would be threshed, dried and packed and, if he were a large grower, he would have more on his hands than any normal storage could accommodate and there should be an outlet for it. If an earlier date than the 1st September for the beginning of the cereal year were considered advisable there should, at least, be some elasticity about it.  Perhaps the Minister could devise some elastic machinery to deal with an early harvest, especially where a large area would be concerned.  I am emphasising the large grower, because he would be most likely to have these harvesting machines which would thresh and clean the wheat and it would be then ready for drying and storage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the objections raised by Deputy Curran and Deputy Finlay were to the Minister taking control of the crop.  The meaning I gathered from his statement was not apparently the <Col N="533" /> meaning that those Deputies gathered. It appears to me that a system has grown up since the bounty system was introduced under which merchants could supply seed wheat to growers and the Minister held himself responsible to pay them for that wheat out of the bounty.  If that is so, I think the Minister would be justified in taking some steps when there is a change in the bounty system for this year; that is, when this new crop is being marketed, the Minister will hold any money in the shape of a bounty that he could pay for that, because the merchants probably gave the seed on the understanding that the Minister would pay.  I hold there is a moral obligation on the Minister to see that those merchants are paid.</P>
    <P>On the whole, I think this is a good Bill so far as it goes.  The trouble is it does not go far enough and it is not thorough enough.  We want to get down to the laboratory and produce the breed of wheat suitable for this country in order to make the country a successful wheat-producing country.  It is time we got down to definite action and we should have less of the political wheat-growing.  What we really want is more of the scientific wheat-growing and less of the political and the sooner we have that, the better.</P>

      <P>There was very little criticism of this Bill except the criticism that the cost of the subsidy for wheat will be passed on to the consumer rather than to the taxpayer.  It would be hard to imagine the Opposition taking any other view, seeing that they are prepared to appeal to the people on a question of this kind.  We must put up with that sort of opposition as long as it is here.  I would have very much more respect for Deputies opposite if they would suggest any fairer form of taxation than passing this on to the consumer.  That would be a little bit too much to expect from the Opposition we have.</P>

It would be easy for any intelligent Deputy to calculate that.  It will be 20 per cent., roughly, this year, of Irish wheat; that is, one-fifth of the total wheat that goes into the mill.  It will mean about 7/- on that fifth, so that on a barrel of wheat it will mean only one-fifth of 7/-.  When that is brought down to flour it works out at something less than a halfpenny per 4 lb. loaf.  We had a little talk about the proper rotation of crops.  Some Deputies tried to give the impression that if we lose the British market we will have no more live stock in this country.  I do not want to dwell on that, because it does not arise on the Bill, but the fact is that the greater part of our live stock will be found, on investigation, to be consumed in this country and not exported at all.  We do not lose all our root crops even if we do lose the British market.  The potato crop will remain as it is and the beet crop is increasing.  I think the farmyard manure complex has got a hold on some of the Deputies opposite and it prevents them from clear thinking. There is plenty of room for more wheat in this country and we are going to grow it.  We are increasing the crop. If you take a country like France or Germany they do not export any live stock or live-stock products at all and they grow all their own grain and you never hear public representatives there talking about farmyard manure.  They have got over that difficulty and I think Deputies opposite should study conditions there to see how it was done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Talking about the price of bread, we had an Economic Committee in 1928-1929. Three of the present Ministers were on that Economic Committee, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the President and myself.  At that time we were discussing the growing of wheat and we could have grown it <Col N="535" /> here at 30/- a barrel without any subsidy because that was the price of imported wheat.  If we grow all our own wheat here at 23/6, bread will not be as high as it was then, so that the poor will be paying less for bread that they were paying in 1928-1929. Of course the poor people then had not the unemployment assistance and widows' and orphans' pensions and other things that they have now. They can buy bread now and they could not buy it at that time.</P>

      <P>The Deputy did not see them at that time because they could not come out.  It is ridiculous to say they were not as poor then.  It was held by the then Government that farmers would not grow wheat at 30/- a barrel.  Deputy O'Sullivan, who made a very famous speech on one occasion against the growing of wheat, tells us to-day that the farmer is growing four crops in succession at 23/6 a barrel because it pays him.  That is a most extraordinary change-over for the Opposition from their 1928-29 attitude.  I did not expect our policy would carry such conviction as it has carried to the Opposition in a few short years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a different matter. I was asked by Deputy O'Sullivan what would be the extra cost of storage and drying.  There is something in that point.  If the millers are compelled to provide storage and drying they will charge a little more for the flour on account of the extra cost and that will be passed on to the bread and on to the consumer.  Deputy Minch says there is sufficient storage accommodation in the country.  There probably is, but if we pass this Bill we will at least compel the flour millers to look for that accommodation and engage it before the harvest comes along.  That is all we require for this year, anyhow. I do not think there will be any building necessary at all for this year. <Col N="536" /> I was trying to find out what the storage costs would be.  At the present time as far as I can get figures I believe that the drying would be about 6d. per barrel and the storage somewhere about 1½d. per barrel per month. It is small in any case.</P>

      <P>What about the handling costs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only speaking now about drying and storage.  Drying, if it does not take place by mechanical process, will take place over a period. A certain amount of moisture goes out of the wheat.  As to the handling costs, I think the handling would be about 6d. a barrel.  I have not got very firm figures on these matters, but the figures will settle down as time goes on.  We have no great experience of what the cost will be and what the agents and buyers will charge the millers for buying, storing, drying, and so on.  These costs are not going to be very heavy at all events.  Deputy O'Sullivan made a point against me that I said we had to thank Providence for the harvest being so good for the last couple of years.  If we had wet harvests we would have had trouble.  We had quite sufficient storage last year, but we might have some trouble if we had a wet harvest this year with an increased acreage under wheat.  But if the increase in the acreage goes on we will meet with trouble in a few years.</P>
      <P>As to the question of the minimum price to be paid, we are fixing a price under penalties.  Apart from the minimum price, we say to the miller: &ldquo;You must take a certain amount of wheat this month.&rdquo;  We fix that amount.  We make them take the whole amount that is allotted.  We estimate that there will be 20,000 barrels, or whatever it may be, on offer by the farmers, and we fix the amount for that month accordingly. The miller must go out and look for it, and the farmer has as good bargaining power as the miller.  He can hold out for the proper price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>He may pay more for good quality wheat.  Now we come to the bushelling regulations under Section 13.  We want to make regulations that would make this system of bushelling as fool-proof as it possibly can be made, so that it would be difficult for a merchant if he wants to do so to defraud the farmer.  I think we will be able to make it difficult for any merchant or dealer to defraud the farmer.</P>
      <P>We can compel the millers under this Bill to take a certain percentage of wheat during any month or every month.  It is not a matter of going on for one, two or three months and then stopping. We can go on through the whole year if necessary, according to the amount to be marketed by the farmers.  The intention is to take the wheat from the farmers.  If the farmers hold the wheat until January, February or March to get the higher prices then a certain percentage will be held over. We will get the full percentage absorbed in that way eventually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain Deputies mentioned the matter of seed wheat.  As far as I know there were only two places where winter wheat was sold as spring wheat. It did not do well.  It grew only in a poor way and was a serious loss to the farmers.  Deputy Belton showed that he had given the question of seed a good deal of consideration.  He said we were only two years working.  That is true.  As the scheme stands it pays the farmer more or less to import wheat.  He is able to sell his own wheat and he is able to buy clean seed. The seed he buys is usually imported. We will have to give very much more consideration to this matter than has been given.  I agree in that matter with Deputy Belton.  As the Deputy knows, we have had a great deal of experimental work carried out in the growing of suitable varieties in the Albert College and on other farms. Even where a variety has been proved suitable it takes a number of years to get a sufficiency of seed grown.  The <Col N="538" /> scientific people are doing as much as they possibly can to produce good varieties.  In the meantime, we are getting good crops and we are producing good wheat.  I do not think our varieties are bad at all.  There is no reason why we should not improve the varieties and get strains of wheat more suitable to the soil and climate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a note of that.  I was dealing with this question of winter wheat being given out as spring wheat.  It only occurred in two places&mdash;two individual merchants.  It was two lots of wheat, but it may have meant 600 acres or 700 acres of wheat altogether.  Naturally for the farmers concerned it is a very serious thing.  It is a thing about which we will have to be careful in the future.  I do not think it is true that millable wheat was put into the maize mixture.  They would not be allowed to do that.  I sold wheat myself under this scheme as millable wheat and small wheat at the same time.  For the maize meal mixture the small wheat may be all right. Possibly that is what happened in the case Deputy Bennett had in mind. If the miller bought millable wheat as part of his flour mixture it would be illegal to put it into maize mixture. Millable wheat is defined in the regulations if any Deputy wants to look it up.  Deputy Finlay is wrong in his interpretation of the 40 per cent.  There is no such thing as saying that we will take only 40 per cent. from the grower. The amount will be based upon the amount of wheat the farmer has to offer.  If the farmer has the wheat to offer we would take 100 per cent. from him.  If there are only 40 per cent. of the farmers offering wheat we would take it from them but that does not mean that we would take only 40 per cent. of that wheat.</P>

      <P>There is nothing to prevent him.  I think Deputy Curran is <Col N="539" /> unfair in suggesting that we should not carry out with the merchant the undertaking he entered into with the Minister. The merchant was asked to undertake his scheme and to give out the seed.  The merchant gave out the seed and the farmer authorised the Minister to pay the merchants out of what was due to them in the way of bounty. Under this Bill the bounty goes, and instead of that I am taking a lien on the crop.  I am not doing anything more on the farmer than was done the other way about. Under that scheme, if the bounty was not sufficient to pay the merchant the merchant could go against the farmer in other ways.  We had about 25,000 growers this year, but it is only a small part of the farmers we are dealing with under this scheme.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has a bad outlook on these matters.  Deputy Belton asked about the varieties of wheat&mdash; Marquis and Red Stettin.  I was not concerned so much with the strong wheat as with the softer because about two-thirds of our wheat goes into household flour and that requires a soft wheat.  Last year we tried Marquis wheat in a few places and the results appear to be very good.  As soon as the results can be given in a scientific way I shall be very glad to let Deputies have them.  I think Red Stettin is not so promising and would never turn out as well as Marquis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a note on that. The advantage about Marquis is that it is a strong variety.  I think <Col N="540" /> it is an advantage to the farmer to get his land sown in the autumn. You will have a cleaner crop.  If Marquis turns out as good as it seems it will be a great advantage. Deputies raised the point that soft wheats were liable to disease.  Well with regard to the point that we should give more encouragement to strong wheats over soft wheats&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy has already said, the miller is permitted to pay more than the minimum price.  Some imported strong wheats are dearer than soft wheats.  Therefore, if the miller is giving the minimum price for soft wheats he may of his own volition give a better price for hard wheats.  Apart from that, the matter will have to have consideration in the near future.  We were not concerned about hard wheat before, but if our acreage goes up another 200,000 we may have to consider it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we could even do it in this Bill, and I will look into that. Deputy Belton thinks that two years is not enough.  The reason why two years was adopted was to give the farmers an opportunity of bringing in wheat in rotation.  I think good wheat is grown on lea land.  I have seen it in my own place and as a second crop it appears to be better if the land is properly manured.  Of course, farmers may not have the particular kind of land.  Some farmers do not approve of sowing in lea land.  We say to them &ldquo;break your land now; sow a crop of oats and next year, sow wheat.&rdquo;  I tell Deputy Belton that is the guarantee from the Fianna Fáil Government and they will be in for many years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I intended, in introducing the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce to open my remarks by giving a general review of the work the Department has done, the work it is doing and the work which it proposes to do in the coming year and then only to a minor degree, and, later, deal with the various matters which are mentioned in the Estimate.  As, however, I would prefer that the general account of the work of the Department, which I contemplate, should not be interrupted by the adjournment, I shall reverse the order of my remarks and deal first with the matters set out on the face of the Estimate. Sub-head A provides for the salaries, wages and allowances of officers of the Department.  It will be noted that there is an increase contemplated in this year under the sub-head.  That increase arises from a number of causes.  There was an additional Assistant Secretary appointed last year and a reorganisation in the Transport and Marine Branch was carried out which made it necessary to restore a second post of superintending officer which had been left unoccupied in the previous year, and also to add one junior executive.  In the Trade and Industries Branch there has been a fairly substantial increase in the staff arising out of increased activities under recent legislation.  In that connection I might particularly mention the Control of Imports Act and the Industrial Alcohol Act, both of which involved an additional staff, particularly in the Executive grade and higher grades.  There has also been an increase necessitated in the Finance and Establishment Branch, and in the Statistics Branch arising out of the preparatory work in connection with the census of population which it is proposed to take in 1936.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="543" /> I think most Deputies are familiar with the day to day work of the various sections of the Department, and it is not necessary to deal with this in detail.  Under sub-head A comes provision for the Trade Boards which are established under the Trade Board Acts.  There are 14 Trade Boards established in the Saorstát at the present time.  Two new Boards were established during the past year, one for the packing trade and the other for the rope and twine industry. Notice has been given of the intention to establish Trade Boards for certain other industries in the future.  During the last year the rates fixed by a number of these Trade Boards were reviewed.  New rates were recommended by nine of the Boards and brought into operation during the year.  Under that sub-head also comes the work of the Department arising out of the Apprenticeship Act, 1931. During 1934 preliminary investigations were conducted in connection with the designation of trades under that Act and the following trades were under review&mdash;furniture, hair-dressing, brush and broom industry, waterproof industries, electrical trades, painting and decorating.  Apprenticeship Committees have been established for the hairdressing and furniture trades in Dublin and the designation of the furniture trade in the rest of the Saorstát is under consideration.  It is anticipated that during the present year at least half a dozen Apprenticeship Committees will be functioning.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary to say anything arising out of sub-head B. It provides for the travelling expenses of the staff of the Department, and includes, when necessary, the expenses of members of Trade Boards, Apprenticeship Committees, Industrial Courts and members of the Mining Board. Sub-head E provides for the fees to certifying surgeons appointed under the Factory and Workshops Act and sub-head F for the fees and expenses of medical referees under the Workmen's Compensation Acts.  Sub-head G provides for subscriptions to international organisations of one kind or <Col N="544" /> another and the details can be found in the notes attached to the Estimates.</P>
    <P>Sub-head I provides for mineral exploration.  At the end of 1932 the Executive Council decided to arrange for the exploration of the Arigna and Slieveanierin mineral areas.  It was first intended that the exploration should be carried out by geo-physical methods but later on it was considered better to carry it out by the direct method of bore-holes.  Accordingly, a contract was entered into with Associated Contractors (Ireland) Limited, a firm which represents a group of influential French engineering concerns, to carry out explorations and to furnish a complete report of the area.  The contract stipulates that local labour is to be employed and that local materials will be utilised as far as possible.  It is estimated that the cost of the work arising in the present financial year will be £10,000.  It is not yet possible to say what the results of the investigation are likely to be.</P>
    <P>The matter of the exploration of the Slieveardagh coalfield in County Tipperary with a view to its development has also been under consideration. Recently a report was made by a firm of eminent consulting engineers who are experts in the matter of coal-mining development, and this firm recommended that as an experiment a sum of £14,000 be expended on bore-holes and introducing adits.  It is intended to proceed with these operations at the earliest possible date.  The necessary provision is made in sub-head I.</P>
    <P>Sub-head J deals with the production of industrial alcohol.  It is hoped to have the five alcohol distilleries in production in time to utilise the produce of the coming crop.  There have been certain unavoidable delays in completing the plans of these distilleries.  I think most of the difficulties have now been overcome, and the work is being pushed ahead as rapidly as possible.  I do not anticipate that the distilleries will be completed earlier than the month of October and if difficulties should arise it might be the month of November in some cases.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="545" /> Sub-heads K 1, 2 and 3 deal with the Prices Commission established under the Control of Prices Act.  During the past financial year the Commission held 37 meetings, 15 of which were held in public.  Their investigations, which were pushed ahead during the year, may be divided into two classes: (1) Those that were partially completed during the previous year; and (2) the new investigations which the Commission undertook in the year just concluded. Particulars of the investigations under (1) have already been given to the Dáil on, I think, more than one occasion.  The only matter arising out of these investigations left uncompleted was the submission of the report on the prices charged for bread throughout the Saorstát.  That report has now been submitted by the Commission and is under examination in the Department.  A number of investigations, which were commenced during last year, included: (1) An investigation into the prices charged for bodies on certain classes of mechanically propelled vehicles by persons manufacturing such goods in the Saorstát; (2) an investigation into the wholesale prices charged for certain classes of filleted fish in the county borough and County Dublin; and (3) an investigation into the wholesale and retail prices charged for fresh fish in the City and County of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Commission was mainly engaged during the year upon a public enquiry for the purposes of Section 17 of the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932, into the cost of all materials and appliances used in the building of houses.  That investigation, which is a very wide one, covered a very large number of industries and a great variety of commodities.  It has occupied a great deal of the time of the Commission.  The Commission have completed part of their investigation and are now proceeding with the rest of it.  The Commission have informed me that in accordance with the powers conferred upon them by Section 41 (3) of the Control of Prices Act, they have decided to hold an investigation into the prices charged for fertilisers by persons manufacturing such commodities in the Saorstát, and they hope to <Col N="546" /> commence that inquiry at an early date.  The Controller of Prices, whose functions are somewhat different from those of the Commission, received a large number of complaints during the year from members of the public which he investigated.  Those complaints affected a number of commodities in common use, such as tea, vegetables, sugar, coal, wearing apparel, etc.</P>
    <P>Sub-head L deals with the Turf Development Board.  The work of the Board during the past financial year was very largely experimental and was directed towards investigating the most satisfactory method of undertaking the development of turf production in the Saorstát.  It is true that they have been operating a scheme for the encouragement and formation of peat production societies on a co-operative basis, and have been assisting these societies to market their turf.  That scheme has more or less worked satisfactorily, but there are still a number of matters in respect of which the general position as regards turf can be improved.  During this year we hope, definitely, to put the whole turf scheme on a national footing.  The money which is now being asked is only by way of an instalment in connection with the general scheme which will be submitted to the Dáil at a later date. During last year it was estimated that some 200,000 tons of turf were cut by the co-operative turf societies, the number of which is now 156.  The greater part of that production of turf was disposed of locally by the societies and more of it through the marketing organisation of the Turf Board.  There is, however, still a quantity of turf on the hands of the societies which it has not been found possible to market.  It is the intention to advance money on certain conditions to societies which still have turf on their hands, the money to be advanced against the security of the turf.  It is further intended to encourage the cutting of turf on a very extensive scale during the present season.  Steps will be taken to secure a market for producers, and certain legislative proposals to that end will be brought before the Dáil in due course.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="547" /> It has been found difficult to maintain the quality and regularity of supplies in face of the bad weather experienced in the winter and autumn. Difficulties in maintaining the quality of the supply were further increased by the attitude of some producers, whose desire for a quick profit sometimes persuaded them to put wet turf into the sacks.  It is the intention to eliminate the difficulties experienced in transporting the turf by the establishment, in certain suitable areas, of ricking spaces or compounds, where the turf can be stacked under proper supervision, and to establish sheds where it may be stacked and stored in sacks against the weather.  These sheds and compounds will be erected only for such co-operative societies as conform to certain conditions as regards numbers and the price, quantity and quality of the turf produced.  It is also proposed to enlarge the Turf Development Board and to extend its functions.  As Deputies are aware, a delegation from the Board has been sent to the Continent for the purpose of studying what is being done in other countries in connection with turf development, particularly in relation to its mechanical winning and use for electric power.  It is proposed also to provide funds for the Turf Development Board to enable it to acquire and work the Turraun plant, now owned by the Leinster Carbonising Company, on an experimental scale.  If the experiment proves successful, steps will be taken to extend the operations at Turraun and to establishing similar plants in suitable localities, relating the production of such plants to the requirements of the localities.</P>
    <P>It has to be borne in mind by Deputies that the turf scheme, in addition to being a medium for increasing the wealth of the country and giving employment, is, by its nature, an experiment in social organisation; and it is hoped, in any future development, to maintain the co-operative character of the scheme and ensure that all the benefits reach the turf producers who, in general, represent the very poorest class of the community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="548" /> The next sub-head in the Estimate relates to the Industrial Research Council.  The report of the Industrial Research Council was laid before the Dáil recently and I think Deputies are aware of the work it is doing and the various investigations which it has in progress at the present time.  I do not think that anything I could say would add to the information of Deputies upon that matter.  The investigations, if I may remind Deputies, cover the more extensive use of the Portacloy clay deposits and the utilisation of the residual sand for glass making, the extraction of industrial waxes from peat, the industrial possibilities of seaweed as a raw material for cellulose, the design of turf-burning apparatus, the best form of milk-powder for bread-making, and also certain investigations into foundry sands and clays.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note that the provision made last year for the payment of certain subsidies in respect of coal carried upon Irish steamers in certain quantities into the smaller ports was terminated when the circumstances which called for that subsidy came to an end with the coal-cattle arrangement with Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The work of the statistics branch was increased very considerably during the year in consequence of certain investigations which were undertaken &mdash;particularly, investigations undertaken on behalf of the Board of Works, which sought information which would enable it to plan its public works programme upon a better basis than was possible in the past, a basis which would have very close regard to the employment needs of particular areas at particular times of the year.  To that end, a voluntary census of unemployed was carried out and the information obtained in that way was prepared in convenient form and is now being utilised by the Board of Works in planning the public works programme for this year.  Furthermore, Deputies will have noticed this month a change in the method of compilation of the trade and shipping statistics.  In future, these statistics will indicate the inward movement of <Col N="549" /> goods by countries of origin instead of by countries of consignment, as in the past.  It is, in a way, more important to know the source of the goods that arrive here than the country of consignment, particularly in these days when trade relations with other countries are very largely based upon quantitative trade treaties. The change, coming into operation, as it does, on 1st April, may create temporary difficulties in relation to certain figures for this year, in so far as the figures for the first quarter will be prepared upon a different basis from the figures for the other three quarters.  The change will not, of course, affect the figures for total trade or the figures in relation to specified classes of goods.  The change will only affect the figures concerning the total importation of goods of all kinds from named countries.  It is proposed next year to undertake a census of population similar to that which was undertaken in 1926.  The necessary arrangements to that end are being put in hand now and certain increases of staff in that section of the Department have been sanctioned, so that everything will be ready to enable the census to be taken and the information ascertained to be made available as early as possible.</P>
    <P>Under the control of Imports Act, 20 Quota Orders have been made to date and, in addition, certain amending Orders of which the Dáil is aware have also been made.  The making of these Orders and the fulfilment of the statutory obligations that fall upon the Department after they are made have imposed a very considerable volume of additional work on the Trade and Industries Branch and is mainly responsible for the increase of staff indicated in the Estimates.  In addition, work under the other Acts recently passed has shown no sign of abating.  Under the Control of Manufactures Act, there were a number of applications for licences, all of which had to be considered in detail.  The total number of applications made, so far, under that Act is 112.  Of these, 49 were granted and 34 were refused, or withdrawn when it was indicated <Col N="550" /> that they were likely to be refused. Twenty-nine are still under consideration. Under the Mines and Minerals Act, there was also a considerable amount of work done.  I am referring to this item at the close because I shall continue to deal with it to-morrow, when I hope to be able to dispose finally of the insinuations and innuendoes which Deputy McGilligan has made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusAloysiusBourke" hpid="Mr. S. Bourke Mr. S. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice this evening that I would raise this matter on the adjournment, because of the very inadequate answer I received to what I regard as a very important question, important from the point of view of the individual concerned, Mr. Swann, who has lost heavily as a result of this transaction, as well as the people associated with him; important from the point of view of the town of Tipperary, which has been shamefully let down in the whole business, and important from the point of view of the country as a whole, because it is bound to suffer in a loss of confidence in the business capacity of the Irish people, as a repercussion of this unfortunate transaction.  The individual prominently concerned, Mr. Swann, is a businessman in this city, a man of enterprise and initiative, who has made a success of a business which might have been paralleled with that which he proposed to establish in Tipperary.  Being a man of imagination as well as a businessman, Mr. Swann saw the possibility of helping to implement the programme of the Government in building up industry by establishing a factory in the town of Tipperary for the manufacture of springs for motor cars and other vehicles.  Having gone into the matter fully, as a practical man, he realised that he could not make a success of the business unless a tariff was imposed by the Government and, in conjunction with his solicitor, Mr. Joseph Dixon, they called on the Department of Industry and Commerce. After several conferences they arrived at the conclusion that if Mr. Swann was in a position to turn out sufficient articles of this kind to satisfy the market, the implication was that a tariff would be imposed.  Fortified with that information Mr. Swann went to Tipperary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was intimated to him that it was Government policy to decentralise industry, as far as possible, and not <Col N="553" /> to have it all concentrated in Dublin. Tipperary having been decided upon, Mr. Swann got into touch with a local solicitor.  Articles and Memorandum of Association were drafted, share capital sufficient to carry on the enterprise was raised, a site was selected in the ruined military barracks, and negotiations were entered into with the Office of Public Works and practically concluded for the purchase of the site. Negotiations were also entered into with the Great Southern Railways to have a siding put in in order to facilitate the working of the factory. An eminent architect was brought down from Dublin to draft plans. Legal costs, and a considerable amount of money were expended and a good deal of time was lost by Mr. Swann and his colleagues in trying to launch this company.  When they had reached the stage at which this work was almost completed they were informed by the Department of Industry and Commerce that another company&mdash;it is at present an English firm, although it may sail under other colours later on&mdash;was going to get the licence and, accordingly, they found it impossible to proceed any further with the scheme.  As regards the town of Tipperary, the people were certainly very pleased at the thought of having a factory there, because, unlike most of the Fianna Fáil factories, it was going to be a real factory, not one that would employ a number of little boys and girls at very small wages.  This was to be a factory which was going to pay good wages and to train the people employed in it.  Any man who could gain experience in such a factory, after a few years would be capable of taking up a position in similar firms in any part of the world.  For various reasons, that I do not wish to go into now, Tipperary is a town that suffered certainly as much as any town in Ireland during the Black and Tan régime.  It suffered even still more as a result of the attentions of certain gentlemen with whose activities the Minister is probably more familiar than I am.  The military barracks in the town which was, perhaps, the finest in Ireland, was burned; Cleeves' <Col N="554" /> factory, which was unique of its kind, was also burned, and the business of the town was almost completely ruined. In these circumstances, the people of Tipperary felt that as a result of their sacrifices they should have some claim on any native Government established here.  Even apart from that, leaving whatever claim they had on that score out of consideration, on the grounds of ordinary justice, a town that had suffered so much was entitled to some consideration.  Unfortunately, Tipperary never received any consideration but was left there to mourn in its ashes, a kind of cinderella of the towns of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">

      <P>That situation remained until a fairy godmother in the shape of Deputy Briscoe came along, who induced a Prince Charming to offer to build a palace there in the shape of the Galtee Steel and Iron Works, Limited.  Unfortunately, there were two jealous sisters in the shape of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who, apparently, has no confidence in the business capacity of the Irish people, and the Minister for Agriculture, who was anxious to get a Wexford hoof, whether it would fit or not, into the silver slipper.  Certainly Tipperary has been deprived of the factory and Mr. Swann and his companions have lost their cash.  I will quote some correspondence which will show more clearly than anything I could say what exactly occurred.  Mr. Swann went ahead in the full confidence that a tariff was going to be imposed, and proceeded to launch his company.</P>

      <P>I will read the correspondence. Mr. Dixon received a telephone <Col N="555" /> message intimating to him that a licence was going to be given to the firm of Brockhouse and Company, Limited.  On the 7th of May the following letter was written to Mr. Swann by the Department of Industry and Commerce:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to confirm the information conveyed to your solicitors on the 5th ultimo by the undersigned that the Minister has signified his approval of the issue of a new manufacture licence to a Saorstát company which is to be incorporated by Messrs. J. Brockhouse and Company, Limited, and others for the manufacture of springs for motor and horse-drawn vehicles.</P>
      <P Just="Right">Mise le meas.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Mr. Dixon, having received that intimation, wrote, on the 9th of May, to Mr. Briscoe, who had interested himself in starting this company.  That letter was as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;My dear Bob,</P>
      <P Just="Center">Re: Galtee Steel and Iron Works, Ltd.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am very disappointed that the interview you had arranged for today is not to take place.  At some inconvenience to myself I had altered arrangements so that I could meet you.  That I do not mind so very much, but it seems to me a matter of vital importance to the Company that something should be done immediately with a view either to preventing the issue of the licence to Brockhouse and Co. Ltd., or to limiting them in such a way that they can be of no harm whatever to us.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I gather you are crossing tonight, and will not be back until Monday.  I do not think a delay like this is likely to be of any benefit to us.  If you cannot attend personally to it perhaps you would be good enough to get in touch with the proper parties and explain the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;As you know, the suggestion for a tariff on springs came first of all from Mr. Swann.  In point of fact <Col N="556" /> with you, Mr. Swann and myself attended at the offices of the Ministry in Lord Edward Street, when it was first mooted.  It does seem perfectly absurd that an Englishman or rather an English firm could be entitled to use the benefit of our common efforts to our own exclusion.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As you know, our Company was formed with purely Irish capital and purely for the benefit of Irish nationals.  I think if you insisted on this sufficiently, with the Minister responsible, he would probably alter his views.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have accepted every suggestion you made in respect of the location of the factory, etc., and I must ask you now to insist that as a result of that our position is not going to be prejudiced.</P>
    <P Just="Right">Yours faithfully.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, at the same time that Mr. Dixon wrote that letter, he also wrote a letter to the Minister himself.  The letter to the Minister is rather long, but it gives the whole position and, for that reason, I intend to read it.  I shall not read any more, although I had intended to do so.  The letter to the Minister, which was also dated the 9th of May, reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister for Industry and Commerce,</P>
    <P>Government Buildings,</P>
    <P>Dublin.</P>
    <P>A Chara,</P>
    <P Just="Center">Re: Galtee Steel and Iron Works, Ltd.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am acting for the proposed Company.  To give you an indication of the present position perhaps it might be as well if I told you the history connected with its formation.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Some 12 months ago Mr. John P. Swann of the Dublin Spring and Sheet Metal Works of this city, for whom I have been acting for many years, approached me with reference to the formation of this company, to manufacture springs for motors and other vehicles.  For a number of years previous to this Mr. Swann had been carrying on this business himself. We interviewed Mr. Robert <Col N="557" /> Briscoe, T.D., and with him had some further conversations with your representatives at Lord Edward Street, before whom we placed our proposition.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Our proposition roughly was that a tariff should be imposed on imported springs or the parts thereof.  Some considerable time was spent over this.  Ultimately some of your representatives at Lord Edward Street intimated to Mr. Swann and myself that if we could satisfy you that we were in a position to deal with the demand, then a tariff would be imposed.  The actual amount of the tariff was specified.  May I here add that I myself suggested to your representatives in Lord Edward Street that we should not like to ask to have a tariff imposed unless we were in a position to deal with the demand.  You may take it that the pros and cons of the matter were fully discussed between your representatives and ourselves.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Having got the intimation as to the imposition of a tariff I again got into communication with Mr. Briscoe. He intimated to me that the policy of the Government rather was that factories should be established in what may be called country districts. He suggested to me that Tipperary was an available place and referred me to Mr. Dan Breen and Mr. James F. D'Arcy, solicitor, of Tipperary.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As a result of conversations in which Mr. Swann, Mr. Briscoe, Mr. Breen, Mr. D'Arcy and myself had part, it was agreed to promote a company to be called the &lsquo;Galtee Steel and Iron Works, Ltd.,&rsquo; with headquarters at Tipperary, to carry out this project.  It is but right to say that I myself had communications and, indeed, an interview with Mr. Brockhouse, one of the firm of Messrs. J. Brockhouse and Co., Ltd., to see if they were interested in this project.  I was concerned with them only because of what assistance they might be in an advisory capacity. They have now approached your Department behind my back&mdash;having had the advantage of our activities.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To my amazement, I was <Col N="558" /> informed that Messrs. Brockhouse proposed to start in this country a company to deal with the very objects which we had in view.  Again, I was amazed to be informed by telephone that it was proposed that a licence should be given by you to Messrs. Brockhouse for the manufacturing of springs for motors and horse-drawn vehicles.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;May I suggest that it does seem strange, that my client (an Irish national) and others (all Irish nationals) having got themselves together to establish a company for this purpose, having brought before your representatives the possibility of it, and having convinced your representatives that the demand could be met with by manufacturers here in this country, should now have to face possible opposition from Englishmen or, at all events, an English firm.  I am now officially informed in writing that this firm may operate here under a licence from you.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Although I have got that official information, I can scarcely assume it to be correct.  I do think, if I may say so, that before a licence should be given to non-Irish nationals at least the opportunity should be given to Irish nationals of showing whether or not they were capable of dealing with the requirements of the country for the supply to which it is now proposed to give non-Irish nationals a licence.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the interviews which Mr. Swann and myself have had with your representatives in Lord Edward Street, we have always affirmed that we did not desire a tariff to be imposed on the commodities until we were in a position to supply the demand.  Now it seems to be that, having first mooted this project and then having gone to considerable expense both in time and money to achieve our objects, we are faced with the possibility of a licence being granted to non-Irish nationals, even before the tariff is imposed.  I do think it might be well if an opportunity of discussing this with you were given to us.  Accordingly, I <Col N="559" /> await the favour of your early reply.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I may say that that letter was never properly answered.  I have several other letters here but, in order to give the Minister an opportunity of replying, I am not going to quote them. All I say is that, if the Minister has made up his mind to knock this Irish company on the head, he should at least make some effort to compensate Mr. Swann, who has been at very considerable expense over the whole matter, and that, secondly, he should make some effort to see that whatever company is allowed to carry on, whether it be an English firm or not, should start in Tipperary, the place where it was originally intended that the factory should be situated.</P>

      <P>First of all, I should say that as regards the general question of the development of industry in the town of Tipperary, I have every sympathy with the claims of the citizens there, and I think they are aware of the fact, and that they have intimate knowledge of the efforts made by the Department of Industry and Commerce to get persons, intending to engage in industry in this country, to locate their proposed factories in that town.  These efforts were not always successful.  One particular project for that town is developing although slowly.  However, I think I can say that that particular project has now reached the stage where it is likely to be proceeded with. In any event, anything that the Department of Industry and Commerce can do to assist in the development of plans for industry there, will be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the particular project to which Deputy Bourke is referring is concerned, there is no reason whatever why it should not be proceeded with, and, really, that is all there is to say on the matter.  Deputy Bourke mentioned, quite correctly, that Mr. Swann was informed that, if he reorganised his business in such a way as to enable him to produce these springs in a competent way by up-to-date methods and in adequate <Col N="560" /> quantities to supply the home market at prices comparable with the prices prevailing for the imported article, I would be prepared to recommend an extension of the existing duty to cover the unassembled parts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not room in this country for more than one factory in this connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no suggestion to the Department of a monopoly. There was not any suggestion from Mr. Swann, at that time, that he was looking for a monopoly.  It was not mentioned.  There was no question whatever raised upon that point.  So far as we are concerned, Mr. Swann came to the Department with a proposal to engage in the manufacture of these laminated springs, and he was told that, in certain circumstances, a tariff would be imposed.  Mr. Swann said that he was satisfied.  He expressed himself as quite satisfied with that on 9th February of this year and stated that he would go ahead with the preparation of his proposals. There was no suggestion raised by him at that time that he wanted to prevent anyone else coming into the industry and that no licence under the Control of Manufactures Act was to be issued in respect of these commodities. So far as we are concerned, the undertaking that was given to Mr. Swann in February last stands, and if he wants to proceed on the conditions enunciated then, he can do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may say that it is always necessary for the Department to be careful when people come with proposals for the establishment of new industries, where there is any doubt in our minds as to their ability to operate these industries successfully.  I am not saying that these doubts existed in relation to Mr. Swann, but there was on him an obligation to show that he had got the financial resources and technical competence to run that industry successfully.  He was engaged in the manufacture of laminated springs on a very limited scale in Dublin, and, at various times from 1932 onwards, he has made application for a tariff upon <Col N="561" /> the parts of those springs.  That application has been refused.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The business, however, was a very small scale business in relation to the market he was proposing to supply and the question which that raised for us then was whether he had experience of manufacturing these goods by mass production methods and the financial backing and technical skill to make the industry a success.  Because we had reason to question whether the imposition of the tariff would result in the development of the industry on proper lines, it was not granted.  The application was made on many occasions in 1933 and 1934.  In January of this year, he was informed, as has been stated by the Deputy, that if he satisfied the Department that he was in a position to reorganise his business so as to enable him to produce springs by up-to-date methods, in adequate quantities and at a price comparable with the prevailing price of imported springs, I would be prepared to recommend an extension of the tariff.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>He has not yet produced proposals.  So far as I am aware, no proposals have yet been produced to us, nor at that time was there any question of the industry being established in Tipperary.  The first thing I heard about the industry being established in Tipperary was when I read it in the newspapers, and that was after an announcement had already appeared in the newspapers that the other firm was about to establish a factory in Wexford.  We have got to be careful in these matters, because it is not unknown for people to put forward proposals in the hope that they will get a tariff imposed, not with any serious intention of developing the industry in question, but in the hope that they will be in a position to strike a deal with whatever larger and more experienced company comes in to undertake manufacture.  We have <Col N="562" /> always to make sure that that danger does not exist.  I am not saying that it exists in this case, but we have to be certain that it does not arise, and that is why we told Mr. Swann that before we were prepared to consider the question of the tariff, we wanted him to produce evidence of his ability to establish this industry on a proper basis, and of the financial backing for his proposals.  That was on 9th February.  We heard nothing more from Mr. Swann until 5th April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>You should have given him a chance.  He had the money and was incorporating a company, but you came down on him like a ton of bricks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so, but he kept the information to himself until 5th April, when he came to the Department and verbally informed the officers whom he met of his general intention to form a company with certain capital, and to establish works in Tipperary; but the information which would enable us to judge whether he was carrying out the conditions which were mentioned to him in January as necessary for the imposition of a tariff has not yet been adequately supplied at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the factory definitely gone to Wexford?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There is no monopoly for Wexford either.  Any company that wishes can engage in the production of these goods and Mr. Swann can engage also, if he so desires.  I merely want to make it clear, in case there would be any suggestion of a breach of faith on the part of the Department, that no undertaking was given to, no understanding come to with, and no promise made to Mr. Swann, that he would in any way get a monopoly of the business and that any other person would be restricted from engaging in it.  The only undertaking that was given to him was that if he satisfied the Department in respect of his ability to establish the industry on a proper basis, we were prepared to consider an extension of the duty upon laminated springs to <Col N="563" /> cover the parts of those springs.  In the meantime, on 18th February to be exact, an approach was made by another group, which was associated with the British firm to which the Deputy has referred.  That firm put forward proposals for the manufacture of a variety of products, including these laminated springs, all of which had been previously imported; and it was after full consideration of their proposals that they were approved and the promoters informed that, subject to various conditions, including the formation of a Saorstát company in due course, they would be given a licence under the Control of Manufactures Act to undertake the business of manufacturing these various articles, including springs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any advantage given to Irish nationals in regard to the formation of companies of this kind as against outsiders?  In the ordinary way, an English firm is bound always to be able to get in before an Irish firm.  The Irish firm generally has not the capital and it takes them some time to get started.  Unless you give some advantage to a native firm, there is not much chance of starting Irish industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why the Control of Manufactures Act was passed; but the position is that, once a decision has been made to issue a licence to a company that requires a licence under that Act, it comes in on the same conditions, with the same privileges and subject to the same obligations as a company which does not require a licence.  On the general question, the only thing I have to say is that there is no reason why Mr. Swann should not proceed with his proposal.  So far as the Department is concerned, we have no objection.  We would much prefer to see other manufacturers engaging in the production of these goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister what was the urgency of granting the licence to the English <Col N="564" /> firm, in view of the fact that steps were being taken by an Irish firm to start the industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say that the proposals of the other firm in question are of a much wider scope than the proposals put forward by Mr. Swann. Their proposal is to manufacture a fairly considerable range of commodities previously imported, including these springs.  In fact, their project is of much larger scope, as I understand it, than was contemplated in the other case, but in any event, we are under no obligation whatever to anybody not to consider any proposal of that kind that came before us on its merits.  This proposal was considered on its merits, and on its merits it was decided to encourage the promoters to proceed with it.  If Mr. Swann is not prepared to go ahead with this project in County Tipperary, I hope somebody else will, but if nobody else will, the Department will endeavour to induce some other industrialists to establish some other industry there, and if the situation is such that it would be desirable in the national interests that no Control of Manufactures Act licence in respect of the commodities to be manufactured should be issued, it will not be issued.  After all, the number of such licences issued is remarkably few, having regard to the number of new projects which are either established or in contemplation.  There are a number of industries in respect of which all the firms engaged in them are Saorstát firms, and in any event the majority of the firms to whom licences have been issued have, in due course, become Saorstát firms&mdash;as much Saorstát firms as, perhaps, this firm in Tipperary would have been, because, according to Deputy Bourke's statement, they were in negotiation with Messrs. Brockhouse before they put forward their plans.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that Messrs. Brockhouse would come in on their project merely as technical <Col N="565" /> advisers.  However, that may be so. It may be that their company would have been above criticism in that respect.  The main point we considered was that the other proposition was a better one in the national interests.  It was a larger proposition and much more likely to yield employment here, <Col N="566" /> and the undertaking to issue a licence in respect of that did not involve in any way a breach of any undertaking given to or any understanding with Mr. Swann.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state why the unemployment insurance benefit payable to John McCallion, Ballindrait, County Donegal, ceased on the 8th April in view of the fact that he became eligible for benefit on the 9th January and had over 500 stamps to his credit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. John McCallion, Ballindrait, made a claim to unemployment insurance benefit on the 1st September, 1934, payment on which was allowed by the insurance officer for 156 days, the maximum number of days' benefit payable to a claimant in any one benefit year, i.e., the period of 12 months immediately following the date of his claim.  Payment of any benefit for which Mr. McCallion qualified up to and including the 20th March, 1935, was duly made to him. It then transpired that he had received payment of increased benefit in respect of a dependant for a number of days to which he was not entitled.  Certain inquiries had to be made into the matter, and pending their completion payment of benefit was suspended. Arrears of benefit which accrued in respect of the period of suspension were, however, paid to him on the 26th April, less the amount irregularly received by him.  This payment exhausted the six months' benefit and Mr. McCallion will not be entitled to further payment before the 1st September, 1935.</P>

      <P>Mr. Denis McCarry, Tubberkeen, Dungloe, made a claim to unemployment insurance benefit, which was disallowed by the insurance officer on the grounds that the claimant was not unemployed.  On the 14th May, Mr. McCarry appealed against the disallowance to the Court of Referees which, after due consideration of all the facts of the case and having heard what the claimant had to say in support of his appeal, recommended that the claim should be disallowed but gave him leave to appeal to the umpire.  The insurance officer agreed with the court's recommendation.</P>
