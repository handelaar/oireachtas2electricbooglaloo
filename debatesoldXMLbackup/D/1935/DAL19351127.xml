      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state whether he has addressed a letter to the West Cork Board of Health indicating that a number of houses are required in some of the non-municipal towns in West Cork for persons at present residing in unhealthy dwelling-houses, and if he will state the places and the number of houses so required, and if he will state the particular section or sections of the Housing Act, 1932/34 under which it is proposed to give financial State assistance towards the provision of these houses.</P>

      <P>The reply to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  According to a recent survey made by the county medical officer of health and the engineer to the West Cork Board of Health as to the housing requirements of non-municipal towns in the county health area with a population of not less than 250 it was ascertained that 178 houses distributed as follows were required:&mdash;</P>

Most of the occupants of these houses come within the definition of the term &ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo; and par. <Col N="1370" /> (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 6 of the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932, enables me to make a contribution not exceeding 60 per cent. of the annual loan charges incurred by a local authority in respect of money borrowed by them for the provision under the Labourers Acts, 1883 to 1931, of cottages or other housing accommodation for agricultural labourers.</P>

      <P>A resolution was received from the Clare County Council on the 13th instant asking for a grant of £3,000 for road work for the relief of unemployment at Christmas, towards which the county council would contribute a like amount, the latter amount to be raised in the rates for the year 1936/37.  The proposal is not one to obtain a grant from the Road Fund but from the Relief Vote.  It will not be possible to make such a grant (from the Vote) for road works.  Steps are, however, being taken to make a grant out of the £30,000 available for road relief work for all road authorities.  It is likely that grants amounting in all to £1,000, covering both the county and the urban districts in the council, will be notified shortly.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that any confusion has been caused by the provisions of Section 16 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1927.  Members of the licensed trade are familiar with that section and know that area exemption orders cannot be granted in respect of any part of a county borough.  I have no power to grant additional facilities to licensed premises for special occasions and no amendment of the law on the subject is at present in contemplation.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>The answer to the first part of both questions contains a number of figures and notes and will be circulated with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>As to the second part, the matter of placing the temporary officers on a permanent basis is one of considerable difficulty in view of the provisions of the Civil Service Regulation Acts, but I am in consultation with the Minister for Finance as to whether anything can be done in the way of affording to the temporary clerks an opportunity of competing for permanent posts as employment clerks.</P>
      <P>Following is the portion of the answer referred to:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Temporary clerks in employment exchanges are appointed on a casual basis, subject to a week's notice in writing on either side.  The appointments carry no right to pension, gratuity or allowance on their termination. The minimum number of hours per week temporary clerks are required to work is 44.</P>
      <P>The rates of remuneration of temporary clerks in employment exchanges are as follows:&mdash;</P>

      <P>I propose to take the Deputy's two questions together.  On the 31st March, 1935, ten licensed manufacturers of tobacco were qualified to receive rebate under Section 20, sub-section (3), of the Finance Act, 1932 and Section 18 of the Finance Act, 1934.  The aggregate amount of rebate allowed up to the 31st March, 1935, was £218,051 17s. 7d.  The amount of rebate paid to individual firms or companies is not available in the Revenue accounts and statistics, and the special preparation of this information would involve an expenditure of time and labour which would not be justified.</P>

      <P>Names and location of the licensed manufacturers of tobacco qualified to receive rebate under Section 20, sub-section (3) of the Finance Act, 1932, and Section 18 of the Finance Act, 1934, the date from which they are so qualified and the amount of the authorised capital or capital invested.</P>

      <P>Following the consideration of the recommendations of the investigator who held the public inquiry in respect of objections received to the River Robe proposed drainage scheme, the Commissioners of Public Works decided to have the proposal re-examined by their engineer.</P>
      <P>As a result, it was found necessary to make certain substantial alterations in the scheme, particulars of which are to-day being transmitted to the Mayo County Council.  A copy of the letter being issued to the council will be sent to the Deputy and to the other Deputies for the constituency as soon as that letter has been issued to the county council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The action which the Government contemplates in introducing this Bill has no precedent since the foundation of this State, and it is further evidence of the mentality that is spreading throughout the Government Party at the present time.  We had a case a couple of days ago in which it was our duty to draw attention to the fact that the Minister for Industry and Commerce had set himself up as judge, jury and jailer of an individual citizen through what was, in our submission, a gross misuse of the Revenue Commissioners. To-day we have a proposal from the Minister for Finance, not only to supplant the courts, but to defy the courts and deliberately to set them aside and render nugatory proceedings which are at present engaging the attention of the courts.  We have the Minister for Finance, under the protection of this House, doing something which, I have no hesitation in saying, would involve any private citizen in proceedings for contempt of court and imprisonment until he had purged that contempt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The history of the matter is shortly this.  The local authorities in different <Col N="1389" /> parts of the country came to the conclusion that the attempt of the Government to withhold parts of the Agricultural grant wherewith to recoup the Land Bond Fund or the Guarantee Fund was illegal.  They took that view on grounds which I will shortly elaborate.  In defence of that view they started proceedings in the courts to get a declaration that such conduct was illegal.  After the proceedings had been brought within the jurisdiction of the courts, and proceedings are well under way, the Government intervened to say whatever the legal rights of the local authorities are at this moment, they would take such legislative steps as may be necessary to rob them of these rights and render the legal proceedings nugatory.  There is no precedent for that in the legislation of this country, and it is something against which we propose vehemently to protest.</P>
    <P>On the merits, this Bill is designed to facilitate the Government in collecting from the local authorities and the rates such sums of money as they themselves are unable to collect from the land annuities.  While the land annuities did constitute payments in respect of principal and interest on the purchase price of the farms, the system whereby the Guarantee Fund was recouped was unobjectionable; but since the land annuities have been turned into revenue, as they have been by the Land Act of 1933, there is no defence for the Government requiring the local authorities to collect revenue for the Central Exchequer, and that is what this amounts to.</P>
    <P>When this matter came before the local authorities last year and the rates were being struck, every council in the country protested against this; every council on which there was a Fianna Fáil majority and a Fianna Fáil chairman pointed out that the thing was wholly inequitable and they protested against it emphatically. One council of which I have personal experience, which has a Fianna Fáil majority and a Fianna Fáil chairman, refused to make any provision to meet the deficit that will arise from the deductions that were made by the <Col N="1390" /> Government last year and which they intend to make under the Bill they are introducing now; with the result that when the rates were struck last year there was a sum of over £500,000 unprovided in respect of such deduction as the Minister intended to make in this Bill when he came to introduce it.  At the end of this year we may look forward to a sum, at least as great, and to that must be added £100,000 which the Minister for Finance deducted from the Agricultural Grant in the Estimate he introduced some days ago.  So if this Bill passes, at the end of the financial year, we shall have a deficit of £1,100,000 for which no provision of any kind is made.</P>
    <P>The consequences of this Bill will be two-fold: First, a precedent will be set up, in this State, which lays it down that any persons going into court to assert their rights against the Government, will have these rights taken away from them by <i>ad hoc</i> legislation introduced while the case is going on. That is a disastrous and shocking precedent to establish.  The second consequence will be that the local authorities are going to be turned into a revenue collecting system for the Central Government; and if they fail to achieve the purpose the Government has in mind, in getting in revenue for the Government, they will be allowed to go into bankruptey, with disastrous results to the social services of the country.  These are quite adequate grounds upon which to urge the House to the immediate rejection of the Bill, and accordingly we oppose its introduction.</P>

      <P>I am not clear as to the procedure which Deputy Dillon proposes to follow in this connection. I did say that if Deputies would be good enough to raise, on the Second Stage, any points on which they might require further information, no doubt the Ministers affected by the Bills would be available in the House. There were really only two matters mentioned during the Second Reading that were of such importance as to call for comment.  One of those related to the Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act which it is proposed to renew by the Bill, and the other is the Central Purchasing Act.  I think Deputy Dillon and Deputy Davin, as I said on the last occasion, spoke at some length, but, I must say, with relevance which I could not appreciate, on the Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act. As I ventured to remark on that occasion, it appeared to me that their criticisms cancelled each other out. The other matter which was referred to was the Central Purchasing Act, and I do not think that there was any really important matter raised there beyond a request for some indication as to the Government's intentions in regard to that measure.  As has already been indicated in the memoranda which have been circulated to Deputies, dealing with the enactments which are covered by this Bill, it is the intention of the Government to introduce a permanent measure at an early date, upon which no doubt the House will have an opportunity of expressing its views for and against the merits of the central purchasing arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>At column 1146, Volume 59, No. 4, of the Official Debates, the Minister for Finance spoke as follows on the Second Stage of this Bill:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Memoranda explanatory of the enactments which are being continued have already been circulated <Col N="1394" /> to Deputies for their information, and if Deputies will be good enough on this Stage to raise any matters in relation to these expiring enactments which they think it advisable to raise, their points could possibly be dealt with at greater length on the Committee Stage by the Ministers who are more intimately concerned than I am with the operation of these measures.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is an avowal by the Minister for Finance that he knows nothing about expiring laws.  He invites Deputies to mention the points which they wish to have dealt with, and indicates that he will ask his colleagues to answer those points on the Committee Stage. Now we have come to the Committee Stage.  In he pops again; mildly protests that he knows nothing whatever about the Bill, murmurs a few platitudes and sits down again.  If the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, who is here in the House at this moment, intends to reply to the points raised, there seems to be no reason why he should not proceed to do so.  Deputy Davin raised points on the last day.  Deputy Davin ran out of the House a few minutes ago in order to avoid voting in a division.  All his colleagues ran out of the House with him, but he has run back again, and he is here.  I thought he would have the decency to pretend that he had gone home, or had been called away for an urgent appointment.  He has not.  He has nakedly come back. He says publicly: &ldquo;I was afraid of my life to vote against de Valera in the last division, but here I am; I have come back again.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I repeat to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health that I want to know whether he would consider waiving the proviso about inconvenience in the Rent <Col N="1395" /> Restrictions Act in regard to housing in rural areas, with a view to increasing the number of houses which will be speculatively built for the purpose of renting to tenants, as opposed to houses speculatively built for the purpose of selling to owners.  Deputy Moore on the last occasion could not understand how I differentiated between speculative building in urban areas and in rural areas.  It is, of course, perfectly simple to anybody who knows the conditions obtaining in the two places.  In cities like Dublin, and elsewhere, speculative builders build with a view to selling their houses to the persons who will occupy them.  Deputy Corish has now returned from the committee room, and he will endorse what I say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the speculative builder is not building for setting.  I invite the Minister's attention to that problem.  I also raised the question of the central purchasing business and I asked the Minister to give his view whether the central purchasing scheme had achieved the purpose that it was set on foot to achieve.  Secondly, I asked him to make this the occasion of explaining authoritatively what were the Department's regulations in respect to minor purchases which obviously could not be done through the official contractors.  I believe that Deputy Davin will raise the points again that he raised on the Second Stage, and I am sure that both he and I will appreciate it if the Minister will intervene <Col N="1396" /> and take this opportunity to explain the questions which were asked.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon did not explain at the outset why so many of his own colleagues absented themselves from the House on the last occasion, or what was the reason they have been pairing with Fianna Fáil Deputies so as to bring the attendance in this House down to half its normal size.  Perhaps he will take advantage of a Committee Stage of this kind to give an explanation, to which the country, I am sure, is anxiously looking forward.  Deputy Dillon, who has played the part of the obstructionist in this House for some time past, had the courage, I admit, on the Second Stage of the Bill to advocate the total abolition of the existing rent restrictions regardless of the hardships that such a recommendation would bring to the majority of tenants in the cities and towns of this country.  I am glad the Minister for Justice has come back to the House, because I think the Minister for Justice is the only Minister who can tell us what is the present position of the Government regarding the proposal made by Deputy Dillon and their attitude towards it, and also to what extent the Ministry propose to carry out the promises made on their behalf in the election of 1932.  I understand these promises were made by the President in his speech in the constituency represented by the Minister for Justice.  I am sure the promises made by the President in 1932 were not made without previous consultation with the Minister for Justice.  Surely it is reasonable to expect that the Minister for Justice and his colleagues in the Executive Council would have made up their minds as to how far they are prepared to go to carry out the promises made at that particular period and which referred to the hardships imposed on the town tenants in connection with certain sections of the Rent Restrictions and Mortgage Act. I am not sure whether the Minister has had time to look into these matters since they were raised, but I am sure he will make it quite clear to obstructionist Deputy Dillon, who is always anxious to introduce something <Col N="1397" /> which has nothing to do with the matter under discussion, that they are not going to remove the existing restrictions, simple as they are, and that he will also give some indication to the House and to the people who are anxious to hear from him on matters of this kind, what the intentions of the Government are in regard to the existing grievances of town tenants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon has alleged that the Rent Restrictions Act has prevented speculative builders operating.  I cannot see how this Act was likely to contribute in any way towards preventing speculative builders carrying out schemes, because under the Rent Restrictions Act any house that was built after April, 1919, was excluded from the provisions of that Act.  I think it has not been found in practice so far, at least it has not been brought to our notice, that it has in any way interfered with speculative builders.  There is in the Act a guarantee that any house erected after a certain date in 1919 would not be subject to the restrictions imposed and it has not been brought to our notice that the operations of such builders have been prejudiced as Deputy Dillon has stated.  Deputy Davin raised a number of matters on this Bill.  One was the Donnelly case. I am aware of the decision in the Donnelly case.  That has been examined by us and if we were not satisfied that there were only very few cases of that nature something would have been done to remedy that position. The courts have interpreted the law in that case in a manner which was not our interpretation of it, and if we were satisfied that there would be any number of cases affected by that decision we certainly would have taken steps to remedy it.  However, it is a matter that is being inquired into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking here on the last day Deputy Davin commented on what he considered the rather ridiculous procedure adopted by me in trying to get some solution of the town tenants' grievances.  He talked about the unreasonable <Col N="1398" /> attitude I had taken up in asking the organisation to go through the country and get particulars of different cases.  I have had several interviews with the various organisations of the town tenants and I must say that the organisations themselves never regarded as ridiculous and unreasonable the request that they should come forward with certain proposals, and that they should be able to substantiate them by examples.  I have got various proposals.  Some of them may seem ridiculous proposals, but whatever proposals I have got have been examined and have been very fully discussed with various deputations of the organisation.  The difficulties have been explained, and I think they have been understood. Here is an organisation set up to represent the town tenants of the whole country.  They say that there are certain grievances existing throughout the country with regard to town tenants.  Surely it is only reasonable that I, who have to come here to the House with any proposal that is going to contribute towards a solution of these grievances, should be able to substantiate the case for it before the House by examples of typical cases.  I did not ask them to do anything elaborate.  I merely asked them could they not put before me definite or typical examples of their grievances.  I said that as soon as these examples were submitted they would be examined and action taken.  Whether or not it was ridiculous to ask them does not matter, because they have supplied such examples, and though they are far from satisfactory, they have been examined and I promise that there will be a pronouncement in a very short time as to the action that is going to be taken on them.  It is not unreasonable to ask people who say that certain grievances exist to substantiate their case, and the organisation themselves did not consider it unreasonable.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon asked if the Minister is satisfied with the operations of the Central Purchasing Act which has been in operation, I think, almost since Saorstát Eireann was established.  We are quite satisfied with the working of that Act.  We <Col N="1400" /> think that it has in two particular ways been of considerable benefit to the country, as a whole, and to local authorities.  It has contributed to the establishment here of industries that, were it not for the opportunities offered by the combined purchasing scheme, might not be established. Some of these industries are in a good way of business, employing a considerable number of hands, and doing well for themselves and for the local authorities that they exist to supply chiefly.</P>
      <P>We are also satisfied that the operations of the Act have saved the local authorities a very considerable amount of money.  It would be difficult to get anything like an exact figure. Probably after long examination and analysis of the prices paid, taking different times and circumstances into consideration, the prices paid 15 and 16 years ago for certain commodities by local authorities and the prices paid over the period of the last five years or so, we might be able to get some kind of estimate.  But I am told by the Department that many thousands of pounds have been saved and that that has not resulted in the goods supplied being of any less value.  The goods supplied have been equally good products and in many cases of better materials than were supplied under the old system.  That I am sure of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon raised on the last day another point about the difficulties local authorities had to encounter with regard to what he termed, I think, minor purchases.  I think Deputy Dillon referred to small things like screws, nuts, and bolts required for engines, water works, etc.  So far as these things are concerned, no difficulty has ever been put before me since I became Minister.  I have never heard of any difficulty having arisen with regard to these small matters. If the Deputy is aware of any cases where there were difficulties raised by the combined purchasing department, or the Department of Local Government as a whole, as the result of purchases of that kind having been made locally at a higher price than these goods could be bought from the <Col N="1401" /> contractors, whoever they are, I would be glad to hear of them.  My view is, and I think it is the view taken by those in charge of the combined purchasing section, that in matters of that kind, where an urgent necessity arises, and they have to buy locally for immediate purposes, there is no question raised as to the price.  It is only where they can provide for stocks by looking forward that their stocks and the prices paid are examined, and if any question arises with regard to purchasing locally at a price higher than they could have purchased from the contractors, then there is a liability to surcharge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's observations.  The net difficulty about minor purchases is that when you pay, say, 6d. for a certain small quantity of screws, the Local Government auditor may surcharge&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because you did not get that small quantity at the contract price.  I quite recognise that the Department is reasonable and subsequently remit the surcharges, but where there is no established rule what actually happens is that there is a long correspondence about each detail.  It would be simple enough to pay 2d.&mdash;I would not mind that&mdash;in order to get the screws quickly and submit to the surcharge, but it is the persecution of having to write about ten letters and having the merchant lying out of his money, which is no more than 6d. or 1/-, waiting for the secretary to the board of health or the secretary to the county council to pass the bill for payment, which gives rise to trouble. Perhaps the Minister will look into that and see if some general ruling could be given to remove the necessity for that unnecessary correspondence.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his opening statement indicated that this Bill was brought forward for the purpose, as far as it was possible, of implementing the recommendations of a commission of inquiry set up to deal with this matter some years ago.  But the Minister has not in fact in the Bill made provision for all these recommendations.  From what I know, I do not think that this Bill is likely to be received with any great enthusiasm by the representatives of the tenants of labourers' cottages, because I think the majority have sufficient intelligence to make them <Col N="1403" /> realise that it is likely to bring greater benefits to the ratepayers than to the existing tenants of cottages who will come under the terms of the Bill.</P>
      <P>There is a recommendation signed by four of the members of the commission stating that in their opinion the rents should be reduced by 50 per cent., and I think the Minister should make it quite clear to local authorities that any scheme likely to secure his approval should contain a provision carrying out that particular recommendation. I am not going to argue the question with the Minister as to whether the position of the tenant farmers who got the benefits of the 1933 Land Acts is comparable in any way with the position of the cottage tenants.  But it is quite clear to me that, in some areas at any rate, the 25 per cent. reduction indicated by the Minister, when taken with the cost of repairs, is not going in reality to bring any reduction to the tenants of these cottages during the annuity period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also another very serious point which should engage attention, if it has not already engaged the attention of the Minister, and that is, to what extent is the sum retained, with other amounts, representing local loans&mdash;£600,000, I think, is the total sum&mdash;to go to the benefit of existing cottage tenants under the terms of this Bill?  Four years have already expired since these local loans payments were withheld from the British, and up to the present none of the benefits of the amount so withheld has in any way reached the pockets of the cottage tenants, nor has it been set aside even for improving the conditions of these cottages or maintaining them in a decent state of repair.  I understand that under the terms of this Bill and under the section which compels the local authorities to put the cottages into a proper state of repair before the scheme comes into operation, a very large sum of money, a very large expenditure, will in many counties fall on the boards of health. I suggest that would be unfair, and I hope the Minister will give this proposal more consideration and that he will say that the sums withheld and used for other purposes by the Government <Col N="1404" /> should be set aside to subsidise the activities of the local authorities in helping to put these cottages into a proper state of repair.  The moneys withheld from the British have been set aside for the purpose of reducing rents and annuities by 50 per cent., and to that extent the money has found its way into the pockets of the tenant farmers of the country.  But the sum of £20,000 or £30,000 annually withheld during the past four years, and which had previously gone to the British Debt Commissioners, has been used for some purpose other than that of reducing the rents of cottages or in keeping them in proper repair.  The sum withheld in the four years would reach a figure of between £80,000 and £100,000 now.  I suggest to the Minister that that money be now made available to the boards of health for the purpose of putting the cottages into proper repair.</P>
    <P>There is one other point to which I want to allude.  The Minister did not indicate the type of scheme which he would regard as a model scheme and one which under the terms of this Bill he would sanction.  I think the Minister and his Departmental officers will find themselves faced with a good deal of trouble and worry if he does not lay down in black and white the type of scheme which he would regard as acceptable to him and which would be acceptable to the boards of health&mdash; the type of scheme which he would sanction coming from the boards of health.  The Minister, I suggest, should now lay down definitely to the boards of health a model scheme and say that under that scheme they must furnish him with the necessary data for having it put into operation at an early date. If the Minister does not do that now he is going to have different types of schemes coming from the boards of health&mdash;which will occasion a considerable amount of work in his own Department.  The sums of money withheld from the British should be set aside now to subsidise the local authorities in putting the cottages now in many cases in a bad state of repair into a proper state of repair before they are handed over under the terms of the Bill to the tenant.</P>

      <P>It is very interesting to listen to Deputy Davin, with whom, incidentally, I am in entire agreement in advocating that the sums of money withheld from the British should be applied towards the restoration of the cottages and putting them into a good state of repair.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  The matter has been disposed of, but it is interesting certainly.  I entirely agree with Deputy Davin that if anybody is making money out of the labourers' cottages it is the Government, and they are making money out of the other matter also&mdash;the withholding of the annuities.  It ought to be their duty to apply this money in some way towards these cottages.  We have had complaints from the local authorities all over the country that they are losing money over the cottages.  We have had complaints from the tenants that they are not able to pay their rents.  But there is one party making money out of the transaction.  That party is the Government.  The amounts of the loans which were obtained years ago through the instrumentality of the British Government are not being paid back to the original lenders.  These loans are <Col N="1406" /> now used as revenue by the Government. Even though they are being used as revenue, the people of this country are paying them in another way notwithstanding that they are not being paid direct to the British.  But nothing is being done for the cottiers. I would like to say at the outset that anything that we on this side of the House can do to make the labourers the owners of their own cottages, we are quite prepared to do.  We are quite prepared to co-operate with the Minister in that matter.  Personally the Government has my sympathy in endeavouring to hammer out some sort of scheme that would be acceptable.  It is a very difficult matter, and so I have always regarded it.  I was interested in this problem as a member of the General Council of County Councils many years ago.  I was interested in it at that time when schemes were put forward.  I do not agree with the scheme in the Bill before the House.  I do not regard it as anything like an acceptable Bill or a Bill that can be operated successfully.  Although there has been a general clamour by the tenants of these cottages for ownership, that clamour was always accompanied by the feeling that it would mean a reduction in rents or a reduction at least in the annual or weekly outlay on the cottages.  The Bill as drafted and the proposed scheme which the Minister has read out do not propose any such reduction.  As a matter of fact it will mean an increase in charges to the labourers.  Take my own County of Roscommon.  I went to the trouble last evening of getting the figures, and they are illuminating. They are entirely in accord with the figures given by General Mulcahy the other evening with regard to the whole of the Free State.  They do not in any way show that under the operations of this Bill there would be a lessening of the burdens on the cottiers.  In fact, as Deputy Davin said, whatever lessening of the burden there is would be on the ratepayers.  I do not know exactly whether that was the intention of the drafters of the Bill.  I am sure it was not the intention of those who used this proposed Bill two years ago as an election cry throughout the country.  They did not <Col N="1407" /> say that it would mean a reduction of the burden on the ratepayers; they said it would mean a reduction of the burden on the cottiers.</P>
      <P>In Roscommon there are 567 cottages. The rental is £1,804, and, on the basis suggested by the Minister, a reduction of 25 per cent. would mean £451.  That would bring the rental down to £1,353. Take the 567 cottages and I think the minimum we could allow, even though some of them would be very well constructed, would come to 30/- per annum for repairs.  The repairs at that rate would come to £850.  Add that amount to the reduced rental of £1,353, instead of the £1,804, and that would bring the outgoings of the labourers to £2,203. On the board of health side would be a loan repayment of £2,268.  The 25 per cent. reduction put to the board of health side would mean £451.  Insurance, collection and engineering would mean £350, and that would bring it to £3,069 as against the board of health previous outlay of £3,468.  That is really typical, so far as I can see, of the whole country.</P>
      <P>The scheme which is outlined by the Minister does not appear to confer benefits on anyone.  The benefit it confers on local authorities is very doubtful.  If this Bill is put into operation, and if local authorities in their present state of congestion of business have to draft schemes, varying types of schemes, that will entail a lot of time and expense, to my mind a lot of unnecessary expense.  I think, first of all, that the Preamble of the Bill is entirely wrong.  It sets out that it is an Act to make provision for the purchase by the tenants of cottages and plots.  As a matter of fact it does not make any provision. It enables other people to make provision, but of itself it makes no provision. There is no use in boosting this measure as one which will leave over 42,000 people in the position of becoming owners of their cottages at great advantage to themselves.  I am sure, even though we have a very wide definition of a labourer, that 50 per cent. of the occupants of labourers' cottages will not be able to purchase their dwellings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a minority report which <Col N="1408" /> deals in one paragraph with a return of the tenants in the cottages in one collection district in County Dublin. It states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The occupations of the tenants are as follows: 24 railway workers, 8 factory and mill workers, 3 engine drivers and boiler men, 2 cow-keepers (dairymen), 5 general labourers, 1 building labourer, 1 rent collector, 1 pensioner, 1 county council employee, 1 market gardener, 1 in the Army, and 1 whose employment is not stated.  It will be seen that except for the market gardener there are now no land workers at all in the cottages in this particular district.  Classifying these 49 tenants according to the weekly family income, the result is as follows:&mdash;Under £1 a week, none; £1 to £2, 5; £2 to £3, 23; £3 to £4, 7; £4 to £5, 6; £5 to £6, 1; £6 to £7, 3; £7 to £8, 1.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>How many of those people would be eligible to purchase their cottages? There is no use pretending that we are passing legislation which is going to be advantageous to over 42,000 people.  I am afraid that it is not going to be advantageous to anybody. Apart from its general effect upon cottiers, I will not say that the Bill has been loosely drafted, but to my mind it does not bear the imprint of something that is workable or that has been drafted with the care a measure of its sort deserves.  The boards of health will have to draft schemes.  As Deputy Davin pointed out, there is no reason why some central authority, let it be the Local Government Department or the Land Commission preferably, should not take over this business. You will have under the present proposals boards of health drafting schemes perhaps very loosely.  According to the Bill, they have to advertise the schemes twice and they have to have copies lying about for everybody to inspect.  After that the Minister will examine them and, if he makes any alternations, they have to be advertised again, and again finally advertised.</P>
    <P>The question arises, how many of the tenants will purchase their cottages? What are we really offering <Col N="1409" /> the tenants?  In my opinion we are not offering them any reduction.  They will not have the right to sell their cottages, which is quite proper, until the period of repayment is over.  That period will possibly be anything from 25 to 50 years.  The position of the tenant will be that he has not the right to sell or dispose of the cottage in any way until the repayment period is finished.  He cannot mortgage it.  He is obliged to undertake the cost of repairing it.  Where does the advantage arise as compared with his present position?  He is paying a weekly rent and he cannot be removed while he does that.  The cottage is his and the board of health is responsible for repairs.  He can comple them to carry out the repairs.  Unless we can confer some definite benefit upon the cottiers there is no use in putting any purchase scheme, such as is proposed, through.</P>
    <P>I feel that this Bill is going to go the way of other Bills, such as the Slaughter of Animals Bill, the Bill affecting minimum prices, and so on. They all went by the board.  We had levies on various things and they went by the board, too.  As regards repairs, this Bill says that the local authorities will be obliged to carry out repairs.  What will the repairs consist of?  Will it mean inside as well as outside work?  Recently we had a case&mdash;fortunately there are not very many of them&mdash;where a labourer refused to pay his rent and said his house was not in repair.  He was asked for details of the disrepair and he requested that an inspector should go to see the house.  The inspector went sooner than the occupant of the cottage expected and he found the man smashing up the floors with a pick.</P>

      <P>In Roscommon.  Fortunately there is not very much of that, but if it is laid down in a Bill that the board of health will be responsible for repairs, there should be some safeguards provided.  There ought to be set out the types of repairs for which they would be held responsible.  Now we have a section <Col N="1410" /> here dealing with the consolidation of holdings, that is where the Land Commission will have the right to consolidate holdings.  I think the thing was framed badly and ought to be considered in another light altogether. In 1927 legal provision was made, whereby the Land Commission could consolidate holdings under a section of the Act, and give compensation to the board of health for the houses.  I think that was fair.  In Roscommon were many cases of that kind and we endeavoured to get compensation for the owners&mdash;the board of health. It would enable us to build cottages in Roscommon, but we were estopped by some red tape or other.  It was only equitable that the board of health should be compensated for these houses.  We have, in our locality, the Land Commission dividing land and it costs £240 to put up a house. We have a provision, under Section 27, whereby the Land Commission can carry out the consolidation order for all holdings.  There is a very roundabout kind of procedure under this consolidation order.  The Land Commission can consolidate the cottage plot with the holding on the land they have given.  Then instead of paying in bulk, in some shape or form, to the board of health, some sum of money for the cottages built, they undertake an equation of the annuity, so that we have the Land Commission continuing to pay to the board of health the yearly sum that the cottier would pay.  I do not think that is a good arrangement between Government Departments.  I think when the Land Commission comes in the board of health should get some kind of compensation that would help to build other cottages.  Here we have a round-about method of a consolidating order, and then the Land Commission take responsibility for paying to the board of health the rent for the period the tenant should pay it.  I do not think that is a good business, and I appeal to the Minister to look into it and try to have it altered.  My own view is if we want a satisfactory basis for the sale of labourers' cottages we would have to get a valuation upon each cottage as it stands at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1411" /> The Minister spoke of an equated loan period.  I am in agreement with the Minister on that.  I think any other method such as that suggested by the majority report would be manifestly unfair.  We have cottages in Roscommon the loan on which is paid off completely. We have others built for over 20, 25 or 30 years.  Some of them I know, that were built by good contractors, are much better value than the new cottages.  In addition to that we have the question of locality.  We have some cottages near towns, some out on the hillsides and some on poor land, and it is not fair to put the same valuation upon each, because that is what it means.  As a matter of fact, when the first scheme, under the 1932 Act, was being operated, the board of health built cottages on vacant sites and some of them were in out-of-the-way places. It was difficult to get tenants for these. One of these is on our hands and has been advertised &ldquo;umpteen&rdquo; times, and we cannot get a tenant.  That shows that locality means a whole lot, and that a cottage in one part of a county is of much more value than in another. If some scheme could be devised whereby the whole lot of the cottages would be deemed the basis of an estate of the board of health and valued separately by a valuer then you would know where you are.  There would be equity as far as one tenant and another are concerned.</P>
    <P>In endeavouring to make a scheme the Minister has my sympathy.  It is a very difficult problem, but I do not think that this Bill is going to meet the circumstances of the case at all.  I believe we have this because the Minister and his Party are endeavouring to redeem their pledges.  This is an alleged redemption of an election promise, and the Minister gives the baby to somebody else to carry.  The whole scheme is going to be vexatious and costly to the boards of health.  It is going to cost no end of worry, and we will not get anything in the end. Tenants will be free to purchase or not, and without any relation to the locality the weekly outgoings of the cottiers will be increased rather than decreased. Their responsibilities will be increased <Col N="1412" /> and the accuring benefits are very hard to find.  There may be some people who perhaps take the view that they want to be owners of their own cottages.  We are all anxious to help them in that. The majority of the cottiers, if they see that they have got to pay more for the rather doubtful privilege of being declared the owners at the end of 30 or 35 years of their cottages, so that their sons or grandsons will have the right to sell the cottages at the end of that period, will not take advantage of this Bill at all.  The fact that the boards of health themselves have to frame these schemes and submit them for sanction, and that they have to be looked into here in Dublin, and resubmitted back for alteration, will very likely mean very prolonged delay.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt about that. Between those delays and the expenditure involved in advertising schemes which are not sanctioned at all, and in readvertising them, I do not think that the boards of health bill of costs is going to be lessened.  I do not really see that any benefit is going to accrue to anybody as a result of this Bill.  We should like certainly to support any Bill which confers a benefit on the cottiers, or on the working people of this country.  Personally, I do not think this Bill is going to do it, and I should like if the Minister would really consider the weakness of the Bill, which lies in the fact that you are going to have boards of health all over the country adopting various types of schemes.  The Minister himself, and his Party, ought to put their backs into this thing and, if they are going to have a scheme that will be acceptable to the tenants, let us have it from headquarters; let us see what it is.  The Minister gives us an outline of a scheme which, if you bring it down to figures, is not conferring any benefit whatever on anybody.  The benefits of the provisions of the Bill are pretty hard to find.  If the Minister can show us anything which is going to confer benefits on the cottiers we are quite prepared to help him with this Bill, by way of amendments or otherwise, but, on the whole, I am afraid that the Bill is going to do no good to anybody.  It will merely put expenses on the boards <Col N="1413" /> of health, and nobody is going to benefit by its provisions in the end.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I approach consideration of this Bill from the standpoint as to whether it is in the interests of the cottage tenants or not.  My approach to the problem leads me to believe that any proposal which creates stability of ownership for agricultural labourers on reasonable terms is something which is in the interests of agricultural labourers.  To the extent, therefore, that this Bill will provide stability of ownership of labourers' cottages for agricultural labourers, I am in favour of it, subject of course to reservations as to the terms upon which the cottages are to be sold to those labourers.  I think the transfer of ownership of those cottages to the agricultural labourers&mdash;especially in the circumstances existing in this country with the deep ingrained tendency towards tenant proprietorship&mdash;has much to commend it from an economic and from a social point of view.  I think the transfer of ownership to the tenants will do much to endow the tenants with a greater element of independence and economic stability than they enjoy to-day.  I am one of those people who believe that the erection of labourers' cottages throughout the country under the Labourers Acts, and the inauguration of the scheme of direct labour on the roads, have done much more than any other pieces of legislation to endow the agricultural worker with the manhood and the dignity which, in the economic sphere, he formerly did not possess.  The erection of labourers' cottages got him away from the dreadful evil of the tied house, with all that it meant to the agricultural labourer if he happened to lose his employment with a particular farmer or rancher. The scheme of direct labour on the roads helped to give him an alternative source of livelihood, which was then denied to him by conspiracy on the part of ranchers to deprive him even of that livelihood, if he appeared to distinguish himself as a person who sought better conditions for himself or his fellow workmen.  I think that the transfer of ownership to the agricultural labourers will help forward that tendency and that movement.  To that extent I think <Col N="1414" /> a Bill designed to enable that transfer to take place is something which has much to commend it to those who are anxious to promote the development of that dignity and that manhood amongst the agricultural labourers of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy on the last day delivered himself of a speech the philosophy of which I found considerable difficulty in discerning.  Portions of the speech seemed to suggest that the agricultural labourers were being swindled. Another portion seemed to suggest that the ratepayers were being swindled, while yet another portion appeared to suggest that the taxpayers were being asked to bear a crippling burden. Another portion seemed to suggest that the whole scheme was devised in order to put new burdens on the backs of the agricultural labourers, though the Deputy indicated in the course of the speech that he had some considerable doubt as to whether the scheme of purchase would ever materialise through the machinery of this Bill.  I am not so much concerned in this matter from the point of view of the burden which, according to Deputy Mulcahy, will be put upon the ratepayers or the taxpayers. I look at the claims of agricultural labourers from this special standpoint, that in this community, and in most other communities throughout the world, the agricultural labourers as a class are wretchedly treated from the standpoint of wages, and wretchedly treated from the standpoint of conditions under which they must toil. Invariably their standard of living is the lowest in the community, although probably they perform the most essential service for the community, namely, providing food on which the community may sustain itself.  There is, and must always be, in this country, and I think in other countries where agriculture plays a predominant part in the communal life of the nation, special recognition of the claims of agricultural labourers.  I think it is not unreasonable that we should carry that claim to such an extent as to demand for them from the State or from the community a special right to whatever it is possible for the State or the community to give them, having regard to the <Col N="1415" /> onerous conditions of toil which are imposed upon them.</P>
    <P>In any approach to this Bill we must give careful consideration to the question as to whether it is possible for the agricultural labourers to become owners of their cottages, without the imposition through the machinery of this Bill of burdens which are too heavy for their backs to bear.  Deputy Mulcahy pointed out on the last occasion on which this Bill was discussed that there was an enormous reduction in the rates of wages paid to agricultural labourers.  I perfectly agree with Deputy Mulcahy that there has been an unprecedented reduction of agricultural wages, especially during the past few years.  I do not want here to apportion responsibility for the cause of that reduction in wages, but I think Deputy Mulcahy's Party and Deputy Mulcahy's mentality are not wholly free from blame in the matter, nor do I think that the Executive Council are wholly free from blame in the matter because of their apparent reluctance to devise machinery which would ensure that the agricultural labourer could register a vote for a new Government, without being compelled to pay for registering his vote in a particular way through his own pocket and through the stomachs of his own children.  The fact remains that agricultural wages have been substantially reduced in recent years, and we get a picture of the economic evil which flows from that by looking at the arrears of rent which have accrued in respect of labourers' cottages.  I think the figure a few years ago was in the vicinity of £33,000; I think that the figure for this year is something in the vicinity of £53,000; so that looking at the rents of labourers' cottages from the standpoint of their reasonableness or otherwise, we find that the arrears of rents in respect of those cottages are growing rapidly. In my opinion it is not sheer cupidity on the part of the tenants which is responsible for the increase in the arrears.  The true explanation probably lies in the fact that agricultural labourers, on their present low rates of wages, are finding it extremely difficult to pay the existing rents of labourers' <Col N="1416" /> cottages.  When we consider this Bill we have got to ask ourselves whether the tenant is capable of continuing to assume the present burden in respect of rents.</P>
    <P>I am afraid in existing circumstances, so long as agricultural labourers are so badly remunerated, that it is impossible to expect the agricultural labourer to meet the burden of rents on the present scale.  If the Executive Council want this Bill to work on the basis of the agricultural labourer accepting his existing liabilities as rents for a liability as owner, I think they must do something to ensure that the agricultural labourer will be put in an economic position, through his wages and other social conditions, that will enable him to assume burdens of that kind.  We talk in this House frequently about our anxiety to safeguard the agricultural industry.  All Parties vie with each other in an effort to claim that they, and they only, are the sole custodians of the agricultural interests in this country, but I think it should be the task of every Party in the House to endeavour to do something to rescue the agricultural labourer, especially in rural areas far removed from towns, from the wretched conditions of living in which many of them are endeavouring to exist to-day. It is extraordinary that a country such as this which often vaunts its Christianity should permit to continue an exploitation of agricultural labourers that I doubt has any parallel in Europe to-day.</P>
    <P>According to the Minister, the local authorities will be required to adopt as far as possible a model scheme with certain adjustments which would be made in respect to peculiarities in the matter of purchases and in the matter of loan periods.  I notice that the Minister indicates that the tenants will be required to pay a terminable annuity of 75 per cent. of their existing rents for an assumed period of 65 years less the age of the cottage.  At the end of the period over which the annuity will be spread the tenant will become the owner of the cottage.  Until such time as the annuities are paid the tenants will be liable for the repair of the cottages, and henceforward they <Col N="1417" /> will also be liable for repairs to the cottages.  So that what the Bill is going to do, according to the Minister's scheme, is to give the tenants a reduction of 25 per cent. in their existing rents during the period of the terminable annuity, and in return each tenant shall be responsible for the repair of the cottage.  I think that portion of the finances of this Bill is unsound.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is possible for the tenants to assume, and meet with anything like reasonable regularity, the liabilities which will devolve on them if they are required to pay 75 per cent. of their existing rents and to meet the whole burden of repairs in future.  It may be said that the cottages will be put in repair by the board of health before they are sold to the tenants. We have got to remember that some of the cottages are 40 years old.  Some are even 50 years old, I think, and the cost of repairing cottages from 40 to 50 years old will be an increasing one. The greater the cost, the greater the responsibility that will devolve upon the tenants.  I think the Minister is making a fatal mistake in expecting that tenants who are now paying a weekly rent can continue to pay 75 per cent. of that rent in future and assume, completely unlaided, the responsibility for the repairs of the cottage.  It may be done by certain types of tenants, but I think it is untrue to say, and fallacious to assume, that agricultural labourers generally can continue to pay a rent of 75 per cent. of the existing rent and at the same time bear the whole burden of repairs to the cottage. We have been shown by the Minister in statistics that the present rents are not sufficiently low to prevent arrears to the extent of £53,000 arising in respect to labourers' cottages.  If we are going simply to transfer the same liability to the tenants under this purchase Bill, I venture to say that the arrears will continue to increase in many instances and that you will not, particularly by a purchase scheme, arrest the problem of increasing arrears, which in my opinion is due to the economic position in which many tenants of labourers' cottages find themselves.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that <Col N="1418" /> it has been shown by the arrears of rents that in many instances the existing rents are a burden on the tenants.  It may be, of course, argued by the Minister and by those who may dispute that contention that the tenant is only paying a fraction of the normal economic cost in rent for his house.  I can see that at once, but we have got to remember that the agricultural labourer has never received an adequate return in the form of money for the service he renders to the community.  At all times there must be a special recognition of the fact that the agricultural labourer is quite unable to pay the economic rent of any house.  It is little use to tell the agricultural labourer that he is getting his rent 25 or 20 per cent. lower than the economic cost of the house would justify, if he is not able to pay that proportion of the economic cost of the house.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that the 75 per cent. annuity fixed in the Bill will impose on the tenants a burden which will prove too onerous for them and will only create new problems which will have to be faced by some other Executive Council at some future date, in the form of a demand for reduced annuities or, what I fear, a clamour for the unrestricted sale of the cottages before the annuities are terminated. If because of their inability to discharge their existing liabilities there is a demand for free sale before the annuity had been paid, I think a very serious evil would arise.  The Minister should, I think, at this stage, before it is too late, consent to a much more substantial reduction in the present rent as a condition of purchasing the cottages.  The Minister has urged against the plea for fixing the annuity on the basis of 50 per cent. of the present rent that there is no comparison between the position of the general farmers in this country in respect to the reductions which they have secured and the position of agricultural labourers.  I suggest to the Minister also that there is no comparison in the economic stability of the two classes. After all, the tenant farmers, especially those who have been tenant farmers <Col N="1419" /> for a period, have much more stability, a much better financial standing, and in general their financial credit in the community is proportionately considerably above that of agricultural labourers.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, unfair to make a mere percentage comparison between agricultural labourers and tenant farmers, because their positions are entirely different.  One man, at all events, is in the position that he has a secure homestead, and, possibly, some capital accumulated, as a result of operating on his land.  In the case of the agricultural labourer, he is usually a penniless man, separated from the county home only by his ability to secure an occasional day's or week's work.  Comparison, therefore, between tenant farmers, who have secured a 50 per cent. reduction in their annuities, and agricultural labourers is a comparison not devised in the interest either of equity or of the agricultural labourers.  I suggest to the Minister that that is an unfair comparison to make.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will indicate in his reply that that figure of 75 per cent. of the existing rents, which apparently has been determined for the model scheme to be passed over to local authorities, was a percentage fixed in a rather arbitrary manner and that, on reconsideration, he recognises that the burden is one which it is not possible for agricultural labourers to bear.  I think, however, that the idea of the transfer of ownership to the tenants is good nationally and economically, and is good from the point of view of the stability which it will confer upon the tenants.  But the transfer ought not to be made on conditions which are too onerous for the tenants, and I think the imposition of an annuity of 75 per cent. of the present rent, plus liability for repairs, is a burden which the tenants of labourers' cottages are not likely to be able to bear except at the price of sacrificing very many necessaries of life.</P>

      <P>I cannot join in the Minister's appreciation of the work of the commission except with regard to <Col N="1420" /> one member of it, and that is the man who signs the minority report, Mr. John Collins, who, I would say, is the only man who has exhibited any honesty in dealing with this question. We can consider this apart from politics, although it is very hard to do it having regard to the history of the matter.  Looking at the facts, they are very simple.  You will be shocked, Sir, to know that many things can be brought into relevancy here; for example, the economic war, Queen Victoria, King Edward, all are in order on this question.  Queen Victoria was not a very popular queen in this country.  Nevertheless, she did more by signing the first Labourers' Act than the Minister proposes to do in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a question you will probably have to put to Mr. Berridale Keith or some other authority on that subject.  I am not an authority on constitutional law.  Very grave consideration was apparently given some 53 years ago to the needs of agricultural labourers in this country, and the rents then fixed for cottages had relation to the wages that the labourers earned at that time. Whatever may be said about their capacity to pay 1/2 or 1/3 per week in 1883, and whatever criticism may be offered about the wages they then had, nobody will contest the fact that the wage an agricultural labourer had in 1883 was capable of purchasing probably double the quantity of goods which the same money would be capable of purchasing to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the measure then of the beneficence, if you might so call it, of the British House of Commons was such that it was to consider the needs of the labourers of that period in that particular setting, our problem here to-day would appear to be very much easier.  The Minister asked the commission to report on it.  Two members of that commission have already received their rewards.  One is on the Bench and the other is a lay commissioner of the Land Commission. Neither of them has added much to <Col N="1421" /> the solution of the problem.  The only person who appears to have addressed himself with any sincerity and any business aptitude to the solution of the question is the signatory of the minority report.</P>
    <P>Some criticism has been directed towards the cost that has fallen upon local authorities over a period of years for the administration of the Labourers Acts.  The sum is somewhere about £60,000 annually in respect of the deficit in connection with loan charges, and £84,000 under other headings; approximately, in all, £140,000.  Naturally, financiers and others direct themselves to seeing what can be deducted from that particular outgoing.  We had a measure introduced this evening which this year will take from the pockets of the ratepayers a sum of £700,000, and there was no great outcry against its introduction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as that particular measure is concerned, its imposition on the ratepayers will render them less able to meet whatever deficiencies arise in connection with the administration of the Labourers Acts. Every mounting cost that falls upon local authorities makes them still less able to meet that.  The cottagers themselves will probably find that 1d., 2d. or 3d. a week will have to be met by them in respect of that particular item.  The commission had a hard task which it avoided, and the Minister had a problem to solve which I am afraid he has avoided.  It is left now to the boards of health to find a solution to this question.  But the boards of health are not even allowed a free hand.  When, some 53 years ago, a start was made in providing labourers' cottages for people in this country there was, first of all, the absolute need for the provision of these cottages. Does that need exist to-day? Obviously it does.  The major responsibility that would fall upon the Minister in that connection would be to ensure that in five, ten or fifteen years time those cottages will be still there available for use by people engaged in agricultural labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1422" /> The system put forward in the Bill for dealing with the repairs of these cottages is bad on its face and impossible of carrying out.  Apparently, that fact, at any rate, was present to the mind of the signatory to the minority report.  How is it possible for a man receiving anything from 7/- to 20/- per week to repair his cottage?  Let us assume that he is met with a leaking chimney, slates off, doors to be repaired, or something of that sort; that he would only have to meet a cost of £3 once every three years.  But he may be faced with a big expenditure at a given moment.  A man with a wage of £1 a week may be faced with a bill for £3 any moment.  How can he possibly meet that charge&mdash; that is to face up and pay a ridiculous expenditure to put the cottage in repair?  Having regard to the income the person has it is a hardship to find he is going to be saddled with the responsibility of keeping the cottage repaired.  From the figures mentioned in the report, the costs are not prohibitive.  The cost of repairs to similar dwellings in the City of Dublin was greater in 1914 than the cost that is submitted here in respect of one of these cottages. At any rate, whatever way it is taken it is approximately £1 5s. per cottage per year.  If it could be arranged that the man were to pay 6d. a week and that he would thus relieve himself of the burden of paying £1 5s. or £1 6s. a year it would be a good bargain.  According to what we heard as to the finance of this scheme that would mean that he would have to pay 3d. a week more than he is paying at present. That is not fair to this particular class which, according to the report &mdash;examining it up and down&mdash;had no spokesman and had no person on its behalf capable of putting forward its case.  It is not because of that that an unfairness or an injustice should be done to them.  Looking at the question on the larger issue that this particular provision of some 42,000 cottages had to be undertaken by providing the money at easier rates of interest than are ever likely to be had again, it is a dangerous policy to run the risk of allowing <Col N="1423" /> the deterioration of these cottages to take place and finding ourselves in five, ten, or 15 years time faced with an outlay for reconstruction or reconditioning that would far exceed any cost such as would be shouldered by the local authority in bearing the burden at the present moment.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister ought seriously to consider leaving on the local authorities still the responsibilities of bearing the cost of repairing those cottages.  They are a national asset. They are a national necessity and we are not solving the question by simply putting upon the shoulders of those least able to bear it the cost of keeping these cottages in repair. Remember while the report seems to exhibit a certain delicacy in the matter of the present system&mdash;going so far in one particular case as to say that the present system of repairing cottages, with the inspection that takes place and the invasion of those houses on the part of the officials of the local authorities, is demoralising &mdash;we have here a policy which at the same time makes provision for the inspection of the houses by an inspector, who if satisfied that the cottage has not been properly repaired serves notice on the occupier and the occupier having got notice can refer the matter to the Minister and if the Minister is satisfied that repairs must be effected, then, on another notice being served on the occupier and not being attended to by him, the local authority comes along, does the work and serves notice on the occupier or the owner or purchaser of the cottage for the amount of the bill.  If the bill is not met the local authority can go into court and get possession of the cottage, because under a subsequent section it transpires that the non-fulfilment of that condition is non-fulfilment of a statutory condition.</P>
    <P>Now these labourers who number 42,000 throughout the country, or their fathers or grandfathers, have been witnesses of a great revolution in the occupation and ownership of land, and they know that about the first claim that was made in respect <Col N="1424" /> of a person owning land was fair rent, fixity of tenure and free sale. These three things were not accomplished without some expenditure of money.  The State's contribution towards that particular operation&mdash; using the State now in the sense of the present State and its predecessor &mdash;was approximately £1,000,000 a year.  It has been operated by either the State or its predecessor.  This cost appears to us to be colossal. This is only about one-eighth of that sum.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons for the extension of the Labourers Acts activities during the last thirty years was this transfer of ownership from the landlord to the tenant.  By reason of that transfer and by borrowing very large sums of money this was achieved.  This money had to be secured and one of the securities for the repayment of it was to ensure that a labour market would be there. One of the things adopted for the purpose of having a labour market there was further to extend the building of cottages.  It certainly is a monument to those who took part in the Irish national movement immediately before our time.  The work that was done in getting labourers' cottages built in that period of 40 or 50 years was a great achievement. It is our duty now to ensure that these cottages are going to be maintained for the class for whom they were intended.  They will not be maintained for that class unless the local authority undertakes the duty which it has undertaken since the first cottages were built; and that is the primary responsibility for keeping them in repair.  The rates under that particular heading are not in a worse position now than in the past.</P>
    <P>The solution of this question ought not be with a view to having the responsibility on the rates reduced. That is conferring a benefit on those who are not parties to this transaction. The parties to this transaction are the labourers in occupation of the cottages and the Government.  The Government's solution ought not be to make it still more difficult for the labourers to live in this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1425" /> I have before me the Report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Sale of the Cottages and Plots, and, taking this report as it was written, during the last few years, Mr. Collins points out, after giving details of the wages paid in the various counties: &ldquo;The inference from this and other evidence of similar tenor is that wages have fallen since the original figures were compiled last year.&rdquo;  The report is dated April, 1933.  Under these circumstances is it not manifestly unjust to place any further burden upon the occupiers of cottages and then to label that burden with terms of purchase? Having dealt with that aspect, let us look at the finance of it.  According to this report, the annuities in respect of these cottages falling to be paid to the Irish Land Commission in respect of loans advanced for the purposes of Labourers Acts were £123,546.  The sum to be paid annually in respect of that is £123,546.  The second item on page 15 of the report is the payment to Commissioners of Public Works, £112,340.  If I am not very much mistaken, both of these items are in dispute.  The Government, which is collecting that money from the local authorities, is not discharging it. Further on in the same page the receipts were, 36 per cent. of Irish Land Commission annuities, £44,388, and an Exchequer contribution of approximately £30,000, the total of the two being £73,500.  That amount was a liability of this State up to 1932, and from the year 1932 this State has escaped that particular liability.  Up to 1932, while the State got from the local authorities the two sums I have already mentioned of £123,000 and £112,000, they got only transitory possession, not permanent possession. They simply entered into control of it for a while and passed it on to the person who claimed to have lent it. That item is in dispute, but it falls now regularly into the Treasury and is an advantage.</P>
    <P>We talk about making tenants pay an annuity towards amortising a debt, but there is no debt to amortise.  That fact escaped the attention of the Commission that the Minister thanked for their labours.  The only contribution they could offer in connection with the <Col N="1426" /> whole business is at least to give them what the farmers have got.  This much might be said in respect of the farmers' side of it, that of the £4,000,000 collected to discharge annuities at least £1,200,000 had to be earmarked for payment of the bond interest under the 1923 Act.  But there is no bond interest in respect of those two sums, so what we are invited to do here is to pass a scheme which will ensure that the labourers will contribute, not towards the payment of a debt, because it is not owed, but to the revenue of the State, three-quarters of £230,000.  So far as the Ministry are concerned, they have escaped a liability of £73,000 and they enter into possession of £230,000. I want to do them justice&mdash;I am not quite right.  They have escaped a liability of £73,000, and, while they would have had to discharge £267,000, they are escaping that.</P>
    <P>The problem left for us is to see how everybody can get something out of this.  The Government is going to get whatever is to be got in respect of the payment of the annuity; the local authorities are to be relieved of the cost of keeping the cottages in repair, and the tenant can have what is left after those two items have been discharged. It is not fair; it is not what they offered to them; it is not what they were led to expect they were going to get.  It is particularly unfair, having regard to this, that when the promises were made to them that they were to become owners of their cottages they had not got to contribute so much in taxation as they had to contribute in the last two or three years. Tea, sugar, flour, practically every item going into the house of a labourer is taxed.  Assuming for the moment that he requires to mend a window-sill or repair a roof, he will pay 5/- a ton on any cement he has to buy.  He did not have to pay that two or three years ago.</P>

      <P>Practically every item in respect of the repair of his cottage is going to cost the labourer more&mdash; and that to a man whose wages have fallen during the last two or three <Col N="1427" /> years.  It is not a Bill of which the Government should be proud.  It is a Bill which, at any rate in so far as responsibility for repairs is concerned, ought to be amended.  If the conditions as they now exist are going to last, very good, postpone consideration of this measure.  I am quite certain, from the views that have been expressed by Deputies, that sooner or later there will be a purchase scheme in respect of those cottages.  We are satisfied that they ought to be in possession of them, but we are equally satisfied that they ought not to be put in possession of them at a cost which will make possession much more expensive to them than what they have had during the last 20, 30 or 50 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Like all Deputies who have spoken in connection with this measure, I have very considerable misgivings about its value.  When the Commission deliberated on this question I submitted certain views for consideration.  Nothing that I have heard since then, and nothing that this Bill contains, enables me to alter the views I expressed then.  Stripped of a whole lot of generalities, the main facts as they appear from the Bill are that the tenant gets a reduction of 3d. or 4d. in the week and in return he has to bear the cost of repairs.  To my mind that is a very bad bargain for the tenant.  At the present time new houses are being erected by local authorities on the basis of the provision of a sum of 30/- a year for repairs.  I think that is a reasonable estimate.  When one remembers that a large number of labourers' cottages were built 30 or 40 years ago, I think one can easily realise that the amount necessitated by repairs will be considerably higher than 30/-.  One has also to take into account the fact that hundreds of cottages were very badly built and that there was a whole lot of mismanagement and corruption associated with their erection, as we in Cork County have very good reason to know.  Over a period of years they were very badly repaired, if the word repair could be properly used at all. At the present time there are houses that do not lend themselves to repair at a reasonable figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1428" /> I cannot see that the labourers who occupy the cottages are likely to get any benefit out of the proposed bargain.  I doubt very much if the knowledge that at some period in the future they are going to own their houses, or that members of their families are going to own the houses, will be any adequate compensation for the burdens they will have to bear as a result of this scheme.  The agitation for the sale of labourers' cottages goes back for some years.  If I mistake not it arose, in the first instance, from certain boards of health.  And it arose because they did not disguise the reason for the demand, which was that the cottage represented a growing liability on the boards of health, and that they were anxious to get rid of that liability.  I am afraid the position now is, that, to a very considerable extent, the liability is going to be transferred to the tenants.  I agree that a large number of tenants in this country believed that it was possible to work out a scheme of purchase that would be of advantage to them.  I doubt very much if any of them will regard schemes that may be outlined by the boards of health as a result of this measure as conferring the advantage they wanted.  It is no exaggeration to say that at the present time labourers in labourers' cottages pay, in rent and rates, a sum that approximates very closely to what is paid in rent and rates by the occupier of a 20 acre farm.  I have gone into the figures in Cork, and I find that that is a reasonably accurate statement.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that the approach to this question should be along lines of having the present rents halved, in the same way as the annuities were halved, for the tenants, and that as small tenant owners have been relieved of responsibility for rates the labourers should also be relieved. After having made such changes, I would leave the cottages in the hands of the board of health and I would persuade the tenants&mdash;and I do not think they would require much persuasion&mdash; that they would then have got a reasonable bargain, and a better effort to level up things, than they could possibly get under this scheme.  My hope is that the bulk of the labourers through the country will not avail of <Col N="1429" /> this measure.  I certainly hope many of them will examine into the position very carefully, and cautiously, before they commit themselves to the acceptance of the scheme.</P>
    <P>In saying that, I do not want to throw doubts, in any way, upon what I know is the desire of the Minister and his Department to assist the labourers. It was a very difficult situation to handle.  I agree there is something to be said in favour of the natural and very proper point of view that people are desirous of owning their houses.</P>
    <P>The circumstances under which the Labourers Acts originally were initiated reflect, as has already been stated, great credit upon the older generation of our representatives.  They were, as a result of their efforts, enabled to give to this country a very valuable property and social asset in the labourers' cottages erected.  I think it is our duty very jealously to guard the interests of the people who tenant these cottages at the present time, and to make sure that in dealing with the matter in this way we do not take action that might very easily give us, in a short period of years, again a problem not perhaps so difficult as that we are dealing with to-day but still one of very considerable dimensions.  The tenants in many cases will not be able to bear the cost of repairs under this Bill.  Assuming a serious gale or storm, and that abnormal damage was done to the cottages, very few tenants could bear the expense of effecting the necessary repairs.  While the boards of health have power to come in and to do the work at the tenants' expense, it seems to me very unlikely that even with legal pressure the tenants can be expected to meet such expenses themselves.  I think it right that this point of view, not shared by many cottage tenants. and not shared by members of my own Party, in many parts of the country, should be expressed; because I feel whatever views we have should be advanced honestly, having regard to the fact that all sections of people are interested in the welfare of the labourers of the country.  Whatever measures are proposed in regard to their position ought to have the examination of all Parties and ought to <Col N="1430" /> receive the co-operation of all Parties in this House.</P>
    <P>I trust the Minister, within the limits of the scheme in this Bill, will examine into the points raised and see whether it is not possible, within the scheme, to make, at least, some changes that will ease the burden that will fall on the tenants if they avail of this scheme. We should proceed very cautiously before giving the imprimatur of this House to a measure that instead of easing the difficulty of the labourers at present might add very considerably to them in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to admit that there are not very considerable advantages in the proposals of the Bill itself.  It is, from a sentimental point of view, the desire of labourers to become the owners of their own homes. That has not arisen in any recent period but has extended back for years. I am not prepared to admit that an agricultural labourer, given a fair and square deal, has not as much patriotism and intelligence in the care and upkeep of his home and carrying out the necessary repairs as is to be found displayed in the homes of farmers or any other section of the community.  I can say, from knowledge of my own district, that 99 per cent. of the cottiers in that district have been clamouring for 25 years for a cottage purchase scheme. I do not think they will be very enthusiastic at the particular proposals in this Bill.  The point has been stressed by several speakers that provision for repairs is not adequate.  The sum of 25 per cent. is the amount set aside which should mean that about 15/- is being set aside for repairs.  Any good landlord or public authority would set down £2 in urban, and 30/- in rural districts as against the repair of property which he has erected.  It has been pointed out that these are not new cottages but rather that they are very old cottages.  Some of us are afraid that the repairs will not be finally carried out by the tenants.  We cannot forget that they have not been carried out in many counties for years past. The Local Government Department have shown great laxity in allowing boards of health to permit cottages to get into disrepair.  I am glad to see <Col N="1431" /> in this Bill there are powers to secure that the new tenants will be inspected, to see that repairs are carried out, and that if they are not done adequately in the opinion of the inspectors the occupiers will be compelled to do them properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We regret that the board did not take action of that kind long before now, and the problem of repairs would not be as glaring as it is at the moment.  I can speak of a couple of counties, and the condition of the houses there is deplorable.  One of the things which are worrying me about the manner in which this Bill will operate is that the full weight of responsibility in preparing their scheme is cast on the boards of health.  We know that some of those boards of health have been unable to raise the wind to do the necessary repairs to keep the rain from coming in.  Some of the roofs have the rain pouring through for the past two or three years, and nobody from the local authorities has come to repair them.  Where are they going to get the money to put the houses into a proper and reasonably habitable condition to conform with the scheme of the Minister?  The central authority hands over to the local authorities the complete doing of something which I believe should be on a national basis. The cottage tenants have a right to expect that a measure which has been so long sought for would get not alone the benediction of the Government, but the active co-operation of the Government, and of the central funds as far as necessary in making the scheme a success, and giving them something which would be a real boon.  I have a great fear that so much is vested in the local authorities that you will have a piecemeal sort of cottage purchase; that there will be lack of finance there; that some people will have a reasonably decent scheme carried through, while in other places the Act will not apply at all.  We will not know exactly where we are if there is not something like definite co-operation from headquarters. It was suggested by Deputy Norton that a model scheme should be set down by the Minister for the guidance of local authorities.  I think something <Col N="1432" /> of that kind should be done, because otherwise madcap schemes will be produced, and this thing will hang on for years before cottage purchase is an accomplished fact.</P>
    <P>Many speakers have stressed the claim of cottage tenants to participate in the 50 per cent. remission.  On the passage of the Land Bill through this House, I drew attention to that matter on behalf of the cottage tenants.  The Minister for Defence&mdash;who was in charge of the Bill&mdash;and the Attorney-General stated that it was an inappropriate time to discuss that question, and that it could be much more usefully discussed when the Labourers Bill was being introduced.  I regret to see that the 50 per cent. remission has not been given effect to in this Bill.  I think a strong case can be made for it. The matter has been argued from every side of the House, and I do not want to again belabour the point.  In view of the fact that they are taking over responsibility for the repairs, in view of the fact that their moneys are being retained in the same suspense account as the land annuities, and in view of the fact that the farmers, who are alleged to be in the front-line trenches in the economic war, got the 50 per cent. remission, I think we can reasonably urge that it should be given to the agricultural labourers, who are in the second-line trenches and are not very far behind.  In view of the long period which has elapsed since it was given to the farmers, I think nobody can say that the labourers are not entitled to have this 50 per cent. remission given to them.  If that is given to them it will be a message of goodwill from the Government, and I believe that the labourers will respond to any action of that kind.  It will be found that they are as competent and patriotic in regard to keeping their homes as any other section of the community.  I have no fear that there will be any abuses on the part of the labourers on having their homes transferred to them. I welcome the principle of this Bill, and I hope the Minister will take the necessary steps to make it sufficiently attractive to warrant the long fight which has been waged by the labourers for this right to own their own homes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>One can understand the rather weak-kneed support&mdash;if I can call it support&mdash;which the Labour Party has offered to this Bill.  Of course they do not for a moment believe that it is a purchase Bill.  They do not believe for a moment that it is anything at all like what the cottage tenants of this country were led to expect by the promises of the present Government.  Not one of them believes for a moment that it is going to confer any benefit whatever upon the cottage tenants of the country.  They do not believe that it is going to confer ownership on the tenants of the cottages, because there is nothing in the Bill which confers complete ownership upon those tenants at any period; it would be only nominal ownership.  I venture to suggest to the House that at the end of 35 years there will be left in the country very few of the cottages which are 30 years built.  Very few of them will be left standing, or fit to be occupied by human beings, if this impossible section of putting the onus for repairs upon the tenants is going to be insisted upon.  I suggest that there is no member of the Labour Party who would dream of accepting that particular measure on behalf of the tenants from any other Government but the present Government.  I want to suggest further that if that particular measure were put forward by any Government other than the present Government, and in present circumstances, as a measure to meet the claims of the cottage tenants of this country, it would be denounced very roundly, and very properly denounced, by the members of the Labour Party. The average rent of cottages in this country is 1/2 per week.  What have the tenants been offered?  A very bad bargain, I think Deputy Murphy very properly described it&mdash;a reduction of 3½d. per week over a period of 35 years, or 25 years where the cottages are 40 years built.  They are taking on a liability which may amount, quite possibly, to £5 in a year.  They are taking on a liability which is bound to be an increasing one.  Remember, those repairs are not to be carried out when the tenant himself thinks that it is necessary to have his house repaired, or to the extent which he thinks is <Col N="1434" /> necessary; those repairs will have to be carried out at the command of the engineer to the county board of health, and as often as he requires them to be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If cottages which are 40 years built&mdash;many of them built under the circumstances described by Deputy Murphy&mdash;are to be kept in proper repair, the cost of repairs will, I submit, amount to considerably more than the rent itself.  We heard a good deal of talk about the arrears of cottage rents, and it is a serious matter when you consider that the arrears average nearly 22 weeks per cottage.  In other words, of the 43,000 cottages in the country the rent of every cottage is nearly 22 weeks in arrear.  There is a reason for it.  Deputy Norton did not face up to the reason.  The Deputy said it was an indication of the low wages which the occupiers of labourers' cottages were getting.  It is, and it is an indication of the fact that many thousands of them are getting no wages at all, because they have no work.  The Deputy said, and quite properly said, that the Government should take steps to put the industry in a position to pay good wages.  I am glad he put it that way.  I am glad he said that the industry itself should be put in a position to pay wages which will enable the tenants to meet their existing rents, and to bear the new burdens to be placed on them by this Bill.  The Deputy could have gone further, and stated that as a result of the activities of this present Government, very often helped by himself, even during the last 12 months, burdens have been placed upon the cottage tenants of this country, in common with all other workers, amounting to three times the rents of their cottages per week.  Is the Deputy aware of the fact&mdash;I am sure he is&mdash;that cottage tenants in common with others are compelled to pay 8d. more per stone for flour than 12 months ago? The Deputy can make up his own mind as to the number of stones of flour required by the average-sized family in the week and the number <Col N="1435" /> of extra eightpences that have to be paid.  Out of his greatly reduced wages the cottager has to pay 4d. per lb. more for his butter, while the price of tea, sugar, tobacco and everything else has increased accordingly. Whatever his wages were worth 12 months ago&mdash;8/-, 10/- or 12/- &mdash; they are worth considerably less to-day.  He is in a much worse position to-day than he was 12 months ago.</P>
    <P>If I could get any support for the proposition I would suggest that the Bill should be withdrawn to give the Minister another opportunity of framing a Bill, of facing up to his responsibility and of putting a scheme in the Bill which is not in this Bill. There is nothing here but a frame. There is nothing inside it.  The Bill does not tell us the amount of the purchase money or the number of years over which it is spread.  We got that from the Minister's speech. The Dáil is supposed to be legislating a scheme for the purchase of cottages but it is doing nothing of the sort. It is going to give the Minister and his officials power to frame a scheme and to give it the force of law.  The work which should be done in this House is being delegated to the Minister and his officials.  Unfortunately I was not present in the House when the Minister introduced the Bill on the Second Stage but I read his speech very carefully.  I cannot see in that speech, or from any other point of view, any sound reason why we should have 27 different schemes&mdash; as many schemes as there are boards of health.  It seems to be ridiculous that the Government should treat the matter in that manner.  If this is to be the end of the claim of cottage tenants to be made owners of their own homes, they would be considerably better off with a reduction in their present rents, provided they got some guarantee of continuity of tenure.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the details on this stage.  We can do that on the Committee Stage but let me take this one point.  The boards of health are supposed to hand over <Col N="1436" /> the cottage in good repair and in fair sanitary condition.  I take it that the tenants in every case, in the 43,000 cases, will apply to the boards of health for certain repairs to be carried out before the cottages are handed over.  If the board of health refuses to carry out such repairs, the tenant may appeal to the Minister and the Minister will investigate the complaint.  Has anybody in this House any idea of how long that is going to defer the handing over of the cottages?  Does not everybody know that every tenant before his cottage leaves the hands of the board of health, will see as far as he can, that as much money as he can squeeze out of the board of health through their engineer will be spent on the cottage?  Does not every member of the House, especially those who are members of public bodies, know quite well that there will be thousands of appeals to the Minister.  And we know how repidly inspections are made, investigations carried out and reports made to the Minister.  It seems to me that some of the houses will be without roofs or windows before the Local Government Department has completely finished dealing with the appeals.</P>
    <P>The question of repairs has been aggravated.  We have some idea of what it costs boards of health to repair cottages.  We must remember that the materials which may be required for these repairs have increased in cost, very substantially increased, owing to the activities of the Government.  I do not think I would be exaggerating if I said that the materials required for house building or house repairs cost 40 per cent. more to-day than they cost two years ago.  We know that glass, putty, down-pipes, everything from the roof to the foundation, was taxed particularly in the last Budget.  We know that a tax of 5/- per ton has been put on cement.  That is not a protective tariff.  It is a purely revenue duty.  It is at this period that we are told the Government are conferring a benefit on the tenants.  I do not believe that the Minister himself is satisfied, because <Col N="1437" /> he has personal experience of the matter, that the repairs will not cost the tenants considerably more than the 3½d. per week handed back out of the rent.  The Minister knows as well as any member of the House that they will cost considerably more.  He knows particularly that as the houses get older, it will cost all the more to keep them watertight.</P>
    <P>This Bill in my opinion is merely an attempt to fool the cottagers of this country.  Apparently at the moment they have nobody speaking with authority on their behalf to make their case.  They were not always so.  It is a pity that the voices which were available for them, which were raised before and which forced the Government to set up the Commission, are not as free to-day to point out to the cottage tenants the type of Bill this is.  It is the poorest attempt at legislation that I have ever seen in this House or that anybody else has ever seen and I hope that if the Minister is going to persist with the Bill, as he apparently is, he will be in a more generous frame of mind when the Bill is going through Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as Deputy Morrissey's remarks are concerned, I have no hesitation in telling the cottage tenants that in my view the acceptance of this Bill will place them in a far worse position than they have been in up to now.  It is a great pity, in my opinion, that the Minister instead of presenting an empty shell, as this Bill is, to the House, did not put forward some kind of scheme as a model which county boards of health could act upon.  The present position is unsatisfactory inasmuch as boards of health have themselves to formulate schemes in their respective areas. This must necessarily mean a good deal of delay because I think it will be admitted that you may expect that different county boards of health will present different schemes.  The result will be chaos in the Local Government Department.  The Minister will find it very difficult to arrive at a decision as to which scheme is the best one.  In a matter of this <Col N="1438" /> kind where house building is financed nationally, as cottages have been, one would have expected that the Minister would have himself made a contribution to the solution of this great problem.  I think we may say that the desire of cottagers in the country to acquire possession of their own cottages is very commendable but I think that the cottagers themselves expected to get a great deal more than is contained in this Bill.  I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that, in my opinion, the man who purchases under this Bill will be infinitely worse off than he is at present.</P>
      <P>If we take the rent of a cottage as being 1/- per week, 25 per cent. reduction will bring it down to 9d. per week.  A great number of cottages, by reason of the fact that they have not been repaired as they should have been in recent years, are in a wretched state of repair.  Even though it is mandatory upon boards of health to put these cottages into a state of repair before they are handed over to the tenants, it will not be very long before the older cottages require repairs again and, after that, annual repairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In their calculation, in order to arrive at a rent for recently built houses, the Department accepted a figure of 1 per cent. as being the amount that should be put into a scheme to carry out repairs.  That 1 per cent. goes into the scheme and is related to new cottages or houses. We may assume that a labourer's cottage, even the oldest of them, would be worth about £100 to-day.  If that be the accepted figure and we take that at 1 per cent., it means that at least £1 would be required for the repair of a cottage every year.  The reduction in rent, if we take the rent at 1/- per week, will be 13/- per year. So that, even at the lowest calculation, a tenant will at least be at a loss of 7/- a year.  I suggest to the Minister in all seriousness that that is going to make the tenant infinitely worse off than he is under present conditions. I suggest, as Deputy Cosgrave has suggested, that somebody should be <Col N="1439" /> made liable for the repairs other than the tenants.</P>
    <P>The Government at present are collecting annuities on foot of loans advanced for the building of labourers' cottages in the years gone by.  The tenant farmer has been relieved to the extent of 50 per cent. of his annuity and I cannot see why the agricultural labourer, who is in a worse position than the farmer, no matter what anybody may say, should not be at least entitled to the same facilities as the farmer.  I think the Minister ought to approach it from that point of view. If the purchase scheme is put into operation, the Minister will still receive the same amount of money on foot of loans from the local authorities that he is now receiving.  Any deficiency will have to be made up by the local authorities.  Here, again, I submit to the Minister that the local authorities are already burdened with taxation in endeavouring to do certain things which are necessary in their areas, such as sanitation, the provision of waterworks and things of that kind.  Then, on the houses which they are at present erecting, they pay a subsidy, along with the subsidy they receive from the Government, in order to let the houses at less than their economic value and at a rent which they consider the tenants are able to pay.</P>
    <P>In view of all these things, I think it would be a very wise thing for the Minister to make available a certain amount of the money which he is collecting and which is not being paid at present to the people on the other side.  A certain amount of that money should be made available, at any rate, in order that the cottages might be kept in a decent state of repair.  I also suggest to the Minister that, at least, the amount which the tenant will be called upon to pay should be 50 per cent. of the present rent.  Under existing circumstances, I think that that is all they can afford to pay.  I believe that if the county boards of health were to submit a scheme of that kind would be acceptable to the tenants.  As far as I know, the tenants are very desirous of becoming the owners of their own dwellings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1440" /> The repairs to cottages, for the purposes of the purchase scheme, will present a problem of considerable magnitude to county boards of health.  They will have to find a great deal of money in the very near future to enable them to carry out the necessary repairs.  There, again, the local ratepayers will be mulcted.  I suggest that that is very unfair, in view of the fact that moneys are being collected from tenants of the cottages by the county boards of health and forwarded to the Government, and that these moneys are not at present sent where they were intended in the first instance.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be amenable to reason in these matters when the different sections are being considered in Committee; that he will take into consideration the points put before him and endeavour to send the Bill out of this House in a form more acceptable to the tenants than it is at present.  I have consulted a great number of cottage tenants since this Bill was printed, and I may say that, even though they are desirous of taking over the cottages, they are not at all enamoured of the Minister's scheme.  As far as I can, I will advocate that it will not be taken advantage of as it stands at present.</P>

      <P>There has been a good deal of discussion about this measure, a number of the speakers entering into detail.  Some of the Deputies who spoke were honest and above-board and some of them were not.  Some of the discussion was straightforwardly playing Party politics and some of it rather insidiously playing Party politics.  But I think the most dishonest statement that was made in the debate was that by Deputy Mulcahy, who in opening his speech described this scheme as a Fianna Fáil swindle.  I think the word &ldquo;dishonest&rdquo; is right there, because I take it for granted that Deputy Mulcahy knows the meaning of the word &ldquo;swindle&rdquo; when he uses it.  I think he knows the meaning of the word.  If he does not know the meaning of the word there is an excuse for him.  If he does know it, then I would say that that statement was pure malice and purely <Col N="1441" /> dishonest, because whatever may be said about the scheme there is nothing dishonest about it.  There is nothing in it that has not been above-board.  If there is any attempt to hide anything it would certainly have been brought out in this House.  The Bill sets forth the conditions under which this House is asked to pass a measure to enable the tenants of cottages to become the eventual owners of their cottages and plots.  The details are given of all the figures connected with the Labourers Acts, the cost of erecting the cottages and the proposals as to how these cottages generally are to be offered to the tenants for purchase.  All these are set forth, and the scheme is outlined in detail.</P>
      <P>The Bill is in the main the putting into operation of the recommendations that were sent to the Government from the Commission of Inquiry into the Cottages and Plots.  That is the Commission that was set up a couple of years ago to consider the question of the advisability of a scheme of this kind.  I say, therefore, that the term &ldquo;swindle&rdquo; applied by Deputy Mulcahy to the scheme is either dishonest or malicious, and he can have his choice of the two.  Deputy Morrissey did not use the same sort of language.  He probably knows the meaning of the word &ldquo;swindle&rdquo; better than Deputy Mulcahy does, or else he is not so malicious.  But he did use the expression that this was an attempt to fool the tenants.  That is all right if the tenants are liable to be fooled. But all sides here, including Deputy Morrissey, realise that the tenants are as wide awake as any other class here. They know the value of a £ and a penny.</P>

      <P>Perhaps not as well as Deputy Morrissey.  I am not quite as close to them, but I think I know their mentality, and I do not think they are likely to be fooled by any measure that would be discussed as fully as this is to be discussed here. It will be discussed at the various <Col N="1442" /> public boards and it will be debated at great length before it is adopted.  But the labourers are not likely to be fooled, whatever else may happen with regard to the operations of this Bill when it becomes an Act.  I think in principle it is a right and proper thing to bring in a Bill like this for the cottage tenant householders of this country, the occupiers of the cottages and plots of land.  It is a right and proper thing that they should be offered on the best terms that we can afford an opportunity to become the owners of their own houses.  The philosophy underlying that is one that this House should adopt.  It is good Christian and Catholic philosophy, and it has the strongest possible recommendation from the highest Catholic authority behind it.  The more householders we have in the country, the more widely property is owned, as Deputy Norton said this evening, the more stability we will have in the country.</P>
      <P>That is the philosophy I had in mind when first I asked the Commission to report, and that was the philosophy I had later on when bringing this Bill before the House.  A Bill of the kind is bound to get a good deal of criticism, especially in these times.  It is good policy to play up to the agricultural labourer.  It is very good politics, and I was amazed to hear the crocodile tears of Deputy Morrissey about the agricultural labourers.  However, I was glad to hear the Deputy's voice. We have not seen his burly form nor heard his voice now in the House for some time.  It is a good job to hear his voice, even though we do hear the crocodile tears too.</P>

      <P>That is something more difficult, I admit, but one could hear them falling and hopping off the benches.  This Bill is not a perfect one.  It would be a hardy Minister who would allege it is.  Even I, and I have <Col N="1443" /> a fairly tough political skin, would not claim perfection for any measure that I would bring in here&mdash;I would not claim that it could not be amended. Several Deputies, including Deputy Brennan, speaking on this Bill to-day, admitted that any Bill of this kind is bound to be a very difficult Bill to formulate.  That is true.  I found it very difficult to get this Bill put into shape, such shape as would meet all the conditions and as would fulfil as nearly as possible all the requirements first of the cottage tenants, secondly meet with the recommendations of the Majority Report of the Commission, and in the third place bear in mind the financial condition of the local authorities who will have to operate the Act afterwards.  All these things have to be taken into account and put one with another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we have got a good Bill.  Not all of the speeches that were made, and I say it with all due respect to the Chair, were quite relevant.  The discussion rambled quite a good deal. Deputy Cosgrave tried to make Queen Victoria and some historical as well as some living persons relevant under the Bill.  But I think nobody rambled as much as Deputy Mulcahy.  He made the most rambling and incoherent statements.  He did not examine the Bill as critically as some of his colleagues.  I suppose he was put in charge of it and tried to make the best case he could.  He went into the question of housing in general.  I wondered what he was at on the question of housing and the cost of housing.  He talked a great deal about it, and one inferred from his statements that he had not the courage to say that we were spending too much on housing. But one could gather that that is what he wished to say.  If there is anything on which we could spend money to advantage&mdash;I would almost say that we could not spend too much money on it &mdash;it is housing.  Of course, we must bear in mind our resources and try to get value for the money.  But in this House and out of it I have heard all classes of the community, people representing every shade of political opinion, advocate that we should spend more and more on housing.  I find generally <Col N="1444" /> that the view of the great importance of housing is held by those associated in any measure of social reform.  They would be of the same mind as I am myself, namely, knowing the housing position as it is that we could not spend too much money on solving the problem. I would like sometime if Deputy Mulcahy would take the opportunity of giving us the benefit a little more coherently and definitely of his views on housing.  I would like him to speak as to whether we are spending too much money in proportion to our resources in an endeavour to solve the housing problem.  We will have another housing Bill before this House ere long, and I would like to hear his views then. I readily admit that the agricultural worker is in a bad condition from the point of view of his income these times. I would say he has never been anything else.  The agricultural worker has always been badly paid.  I have come across agricultural workers, married men with families&mdash;I admit it is a good while ago&mdash;who were paid 4/- a week.  To-day married men with families are paid, in some parts of the country, as low as 9/- or 10/- a week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>As low as 6/- a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate it is generally admitted that the agricultural worker is in a bad way and poorly paid.  Of course, he has advantages that the town worker has not got.  One cannot compare exactly his wage with the wage of the town worker.  They are generally poorly paid, and they have to bring up their families on very little income.  Despite that, I think everybody who takes any interest in the matter knows that there is a yearning among these people to be the owners of their homesteads and their plots.  That yearning is there, and it is not in the lifetime of this Government or of the Government that preceded it that the agitation started among cottage holders for the right to purchase their holdings.  The question arises then, what are the terms on which the tenants are being offered an opportunity to become the owners of their houses and plots?  I think our terms are reasonable, all things considered. Deputy Cosgrave, if I understood him aright, said that on the Commission <Col N="1445" /> that sat to consider this matter, the cottage tenants had no representatives. They had at least two nominated by their own organisation.  As far as I am aware, they were people very well able to put their case and make a good claim for the tenants.  The majority report, the provisions of which are mainly the basis of our Bill, was signed by these two representatives of the cottage tenants.</P>
      <P>The average rental of a cottage is 1/2, and the new annuity, 75 per cent., would be 10½d.  I think a fair figure towards the cost of repairs could be reckoned at 5½d. a week.  That would make the annuity for the purchase of the house, plus the cost of repairs, 1/4 a week.  Therefore, the tenants of all these cottages will get the right to be the complete owners in fee-simple of their houses and lands at the end of a stated period for an additional 1½d. or 2d. a week, and that is not an unreasonable sum to ask.  There is this much to be borne in mind with regard to repairs.  These repairs were carried out by the board of health up to now, and, of course, it is more costly for such a body to get the repairs carried out than it would be for the tenants, who would probably do their own repairs. The repairs might be better done and more cheaply done by the tenants themselves than they could be by such a body as the board of health.  We know, as a matter of fact, that in many cases boards of health for years have done little or nothing in the way of repairs, and I think it is quite probable that the tenants themselves, in the vast majority of cases, would keep their houses in a much better state of repair than they have been kept in the past by some boards of health&mdash;not all of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An effort has been made to compare what was done for the tenant farmers of the country in the way of getting a 50 per cent. reduction of their annuities and what is proposed for the holders of labourers' cottages under this Bill.  One really cannot make a comparison; no proper comparison can be made.  The farmer had to pay the full charges by way of annuity for his holding.  The tenant of a cottage and plot has not paid anything more than 20 per cent. The Government of the day and the <Col N="1446" /> local authorities between them have paid the difference, so there is not a case that is comparable for doing the same thing for the cottage tenant as was done for the tenant farmer buying out his land.  Since the Labourers Acts were passed, the State and the local authority have between them borne roughly 80 per cent. of the cost all the time.  That has not been the position in regard to farmers and, therefore, the cottage tenant, the agricultural worker, where he got a cottage and plot, has been getting much better value from the State than has the tenant farmer.  Of course, the condition of the agricultural workers had to be taken into account when these plots and cottages were being given to them and when the rent was being fixed. They could not have paid very much more.  Indeed, some of them found it difficult to pay even so much.  You cannot make demand in equity that the State do for the tenant of a labourer's cottage the same as was done for the farmer merely by reason of the fact that these moneys have been withheld from Great Britain.</P>
    <P>Much play was made by several Deputies, including Deputies Cosgrave and Corish, about this money being withheld and put into the pockets of the Government of the day.  Several times the phrase was used that the Government was reaping a profit.  In that connection there is this much to be borne in mind, that there are many thousands of labourers, agricultural workers, who are living in hovels and who have been living in them for many years.  For them this Government is endeavouring to get proper housing accommodation.  While we are retaining certain moneys that used to be sent out of this country, we are doing more to bring the housing problem within reasonable sight of ending.  We did more in the last three years or so than was ever even contemplated by the last Government during any of the ten years of its existence.  If we are holding on to that or other moneys, the moneys are being well spent, at any rate so far as housing is concerned.</P>
    <P>I would like to say in reply to Deputy Morrissey that there is no compulsion about this scheme, except that the local authority must prepare the scheme. <Col N="1447" /> The tenant in no case is obliged to purchase his holding.  He can, if he thinks the terms are good, that it is a good bargain, purchase when a scheme has been adopted by a local authority with the sanction of the Minister.  In such circumstances the tenant can become a purchaser.  If he thinks it is not a good bargain he can let it alone.  I know there are two opinions on this question as to whether it is wise for holders of labourers' cottages and plots to become the purchasers.  I know that in every part of the House there are divisions upon that matter.  There are some people who hold that tenants would be much better off by remaining as they are, paying to the local authorities, who in turn have to look after the repair of the house.  They have general security of tenure so long as they pay their rent, and the rents they pay are very moderate.  But that does not get over the fact that there is no part of the country in which there are not organisations doing propaganda work, calling upon tenants to become the owners of their cottages and plots.  I have seen many comments upon this Bill.  I have seen from one or two of them that they are not completely satisfied with the terms that we are giving. Still, they are prepared to accept them and put them into operation so far as they are concerned.  Of course, they make a fight and try to get better terms.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything more I need say.  I do not think the difficulties that some Deputies have in mind with regard to the formation of schemes will arise.  The outline of the scheme is in the Bill.  Details can be filled in and the officials of the Department will be at their disposal at all times and will be glad to advise and assist local authorities in the formulation of schemes.  If they are in any difficulty they can consult the Department in advance on the formulation of these schemes and in getting sanction for them.  I hope the scheme in the Bill, when it passes, will operate without difficulty, and that many tenants will, under it, become the owners of their own holdings.  In Dublin, which I know pretty well, I am aware that many of <Col N="1448" /> the ordinary tenants of small holdings would be glad to have the opportunity of becoming owners of their own little houses in 25 or 30 years, and would be very happy if they could do so.  Public utility societies in existence now putting up schemes, large or small, in Dublin, are overwhelmed by numbers of people asking for opportunities of becoming tenant proprietors under these schemes, even though they do have to pay a great deal more than the ordinary rent under these schemes. Many tenants under local authorities and boards of health would be very happy to pay more than the ordinary rent so that they would be able, in 30 or 35 years time, to realise that they would be proprietors in fee of their own houses.  There was one matter I was troubled about and that was to see that these cottages, subject to the purchase scheme, would remain in the hands of agricultural workers.  That was an important aspect of the matter and I think that we have safeguarded it.  I would be glad if all members of the House were as interested in holding these purchases for agricultural workers as I am; and if there is any amendment they could suggest to make that matter more secure I would be glad to have their assistance.</P>

      <P>The Minister said the Bill could be amended.  There are two points in which a large number of people suggest that amendments are desirable.  The Minister informs us now that the scheme implies an approximate twopence a week increase in the rents of the tenants.  He said nothing at all on the various remarks made on the cost of repairs to local authorities.  The details of the interim report indicated that local authorities could be relieved of £50,000 and tenants of £32,000.  The presentation of the scheme in the Bill and the Minister's statement indicated that the tenants are to bear £17,000 or £18,000 additional cost.  The Minister has not addressed himself to the cost of the minimum repairs of the house.  No Deputy can put in an amendment that could deal with this rather radical point.  I ask the Minister now if he will put in amendments that will deal with these points.</P>

      <P>I put some matters to the Minister on the last occasion purely as a layman.  I had the good fortune of not becoming a lawyer, something for which one has to be grateful, and therefore, speaking as a layman, I think the whole practice of appeals as retrials is objectionable.  I cannot take quite seriously the assurance given by the Attorney-General that, in a country where there is no need of anything of the kind, it is not putting a premium to a certain extent, at all events, on perjury.  I remember when the original Courts of Justice Bill, or some similar Bill, was under consideration, my own personal view on the question of perjury was this&mdash;it was a purely personal view&mdash;that it was so prevalent that it would be better to avoid the scandal of perjury, to do away with the taking of an oath altogether.  Making the penalties very serious would do instead.  It seems to me&mdash;and from what I have heard this is borne out&mdash;that very often the preliminary hearing is only regarded as a trial run.  Each side tries to find out what is the case of the other side, and then fixes its evidence afterwards.  You are really helping and perpetuating that particular system.  I have been assured by practitioners that very often even they are unaware of their client's case until they have heard their client and the other side examined in court.  Why extend&mdash;as you are doing under this Bill, in practice at all events&mdash;the scope of those appeals?  I may say that the original Courts of Justice Bill did contemplate&mdash;I think the Attorney-General made that point, by way of interruption at all events&mdash;appeals on matters of fact, but again I have been assured that in practice it did not <Col N="1450" /> work out that way, and that you had appeals mainly on matters of law. Here again, when you have appeals you have not what might act as a check on the repreparation of the case by either side; you have not the shorthand note of the original evidence.  I think if you are going to have appeals it is better to have that check, so that you will obviate certainly one of the objections to them.  I understand the case of the Government is that the people are accustomed to this particular objectionable form of procedure, but why encourage it if, in itself, it is wrong?  A judge ought to be able to decide at least on a question of fact. On that question one man as a judge is as good as anyone else.  It is not necessarily the best-trained lawyer who will be the best judge of fact.  In the most serious of cases, that is, the criminal cases where a death penalty is involved, we leave it to men unversed in the law to judge the question of fact.  Why, then, is it necessary to have a retrial by way of appeal from any law court to another on a question of fact?  It does not seem to me that the practice is sound.  The fact that it was in existence in this country has led to confusion.  Now that we are recasting the administration of the courts there is no reason why we should perpetuate that particular evil.  I would once more ask the Minister not merely to consider the suggestion made on the last day to limit those appeals to some extent, but also to reconsider, between now and the next stage, this whole question of appeal.  Why has it grown up in this country?  Has it led to good results in this country?  Those are points which I ask the Minister to consider on this matter.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with, and I do not think anybody would be impressed by the argument that appeals gave this unlimited opportunity for what is called mending the <Col N="1451" /> hand, and that consequently they gave people an additional opportunity for committing perjury.  I am sure that advocates and judges who have had experience would say that where there is a rehearing on appeal the advocate will be keen enough to see any mending of the hand which may be attempted.  He will be instructed, I am sure, by a solicitor and by his clients as to what those people swore in the court below, and an opportunity will be given him to check that.  I have never heard that the old system of appeal gave anything like what might be described as this unlimited opportunity for perjury or mending of the hand, although there may have been, and I believe there were, cases of that sort.  I would, however, put it to Deputies opposite or any Deputy in the House that a greater wrong might be committed by not having an appeal.  Take a case in a very small country district where there is a disagreement between neighbours about some matter or other and it is brought to court.  Invariably your client, when he is instructing you, can give you a fairly good line as to what he thinks is going to be the opposition's case. He knows the witnesses who have been subpoenaed from the district. He has a very shrewd idea as to what those witnesses are going to swear, and you can get some idea, at any rate&mdash;even if it is not a very good idea &mdash;as to the case that is going to be made by the opposite side.  I have come across cases&mdash;very few&mdash;where what I consider to be a great injustice was done by the knowledge which was in those persons' hands as to the case that was to be prepared, and they made a case to upset that.  On the overwhelming amount of evidence which they produced they got away with it.  There was a case where some unfortunate person was wronged or was deprived of his rights, and if there were no appeal there would be no opportunity of remedying that. There you had the success of both perjury and wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The courts took a narrow view on the construction of Section 61 of the Act of 1924, and after that ruling there was practically only an appeal on law, <Col N="1452" /> and the question of fact was ruled out.</P>
    <P>I have known cases where the High Court judges expressed the opinion that they were very sorry they were precluded from going into the facts of the case, because they would come to a very different decision. I would say that from that point of view an appeal in some cases at any rate is very useful. The perjurer will be prevented from getting away with it, and there will be an opportunity of putting up additional evidence.  In regard to the shorthand note, while I agree that it would be an additional check there is this much to be said against it.  If you were to have both the shorthand notes and a rehearing it would take the judges an unlimited time to get through their work. They would have to be continually referring to the notes and referring to the evidence, while at the same time hearing the witnesses. In that way it would take an extremely long time to get through their business, and I do not think it would be workable.  I agree that on the part of the people who have been intimately concerned in the matter, not only in their own interests but in the interests of the public, the overwhelming amount of the evidence we have seen and the indications we have got recommended that this course be adopted, and that we go back to the old system.</P>

The point raised by the Minister was that the judges could never get through their work if this system existed, but the overwhelming view of the people who gave evidence is that they could get through it; they recommended the system.  A lot of time is lost in cross-examining a <Col N="1453" /> man to find out what he had said. Surely it is much easier to say: &ldquo;It is written here in the shorthand notes that you swore so-and-so on such a date&rdquo;?  That would boil down to five minutes what might easily be half-an-hour's cross-examination. I presume that idea influenced the overwhelming body of opinion which the Minister both stands behind and rejects in this manner. He will also recognise that his argument about appeals goes much further than this Bill goes.  I have not the slightest doubt that the Supreme Court would sometimes like to have a rehearing of the case coming up to it from the High Court, and that exactly the same opinion might be expressed by members of the Supreme Court about the hearing of facts in the High Court as was expressed by the High Court in regard to the Circuit Court.  It is inevitable that you will have disagreement between individuals as regards facts and that means that if you are to satisfy the Minister you must have no limit to the appeals you can make.  The mere fact that there are differences of opinion regarding the facts is no reason why a certain decision should not be final.  It is quite obvious that the Minister is not convinced of the force of his own arguments, otherwise he would have extended the appeal system much further than is allowed under this Bill.  I can see only one ground for allowing an appeal on a question of fact and that is the necessity which sometimes arises for some kind of check on a possibly cantankerous judge so as to keep him in order.  It has not any other value.  That is, there may be a certain man whose judgment of facts may be coloured by his own whims and unless he knows that there is an appeal from them he may run riot.  If the Minister's argument is sound it must apply all round but it does not apply all round.  I have come to the conclusion that the Minister is not convinced, but the old habit is there and he is keeping it up for no other reason.  I think it is a mistake that he is keeping it <Col N="1454" /> on.  It is perpetuating a bad habit. The Minister says that there will always be perjury.  I admit that there will, but you are tending to increase the force of a natural tendency by what you are doing.</P>

      <P>I see no reason whatever why there should not be an appeal on a question of fact, but there is only one way by which you can prevent a litigant making a new case and possibly committing perjury. That is by having an official note of the evidence given in the court below.  The business of an appeal judge is to see that justice is done between the litigants and even if the consultation of these notes imposes some extra trouble on him, that is his business.</P>

      <P>I do not know that a judgment would be improved by the fact that the judge's attention had been called to a particular note. He would much prefer to hear the whole case made in the court below. I think that certainly would take a considerable amount of time.

      <P>Does the Minister not realise that in the Courts of Appeal <Col N="1455" /> under the old system, counsel appearing on one side or the other frequently had to rely on the local Press report, in cases in which a litigant had definitely and blatantly changed his case? Does he not know that it is a well-established fact that while counsel may cross-examine upon the report of the case in the local paper, at the same time that report had no official standing? When a witness brazened it out, as they generally did, counsel could not do anything except to say: &ldquo;Did you not say such and such a thing in the court below?  I have the report here in the local paper.  Is that not what you said?&rdquo; I am perfectly satisfied that in many cases witnesses got a going-over for the second trial.  I have personal cognisance of one case in which a litigant said that they would go on a new line altogether at the new trial.  If the notes of the official shorthand writer are there the judge can become officially cognisant of the evidence tendered in the court below. While I can see Deputy O'Sullivan's point that it is not necessary for the judge to go through the whole notes, they are there as a preventive.  Unless the witness knows that there is an official record of his previous evidence to which the judge can have access, you will have, undoubtedly, that spate of perjury that occurred in the past and that I regret may also happen in future.  We have taken many steps to improve the morals of the country generally, and I think this is one of the instances in which it is the bounden duty of the Government to take steps to prevent such occurrences.  I join with those Deputies who have stressed the point that the official stenographers' notes should be retained for the purpose of preventing, if for no other purpose, the introduction of perjured evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to go again into the question of the merits of the old system as compared with the proposed system.  It is quite obvious that this system, as it is in the Bill, is going to operate.  Litigants will have had an opportunity of seeing the kind of justice they got under the present system and, when this operates, they <Col N="1456" /> will see how they fare under the new system.  It is only in that way that the people of this country are going to learn.  They are not willing to learn from argument; they are only capable of learning from experience.  I entirely agree with Deputies O'Sullivan and MacEoin that if this system is going to be worked properly and if there is to be any check upon the rather wholesale perjury that does exist in courts in this country, the shorthand notes in the Circuit Courts should be retained.  I do not say for a moment that these notes should be used freely on appeals. I entirely disagree with the Minister when he says that the judges of the High Court going down on circuit would freely read the shorthand note of each case and that that being their mental attitude, they would, of necessity, have to take up a considerable amount of time in reading the transcript of the shorthand notes of cases before they came on.  I believe that the mental attitude of judges is entirely the contrary.  They do not read the transcript of the shorthand note of cases before they come into court at the present time and they certainly would not do it where they would be rehearing the case on facts again.  The old judges of Assize, as Deputies who remember the system know, were entirely disinterested in what happened in the court below.  They were there to retry the case and what happened in the court below was no concern of theirs.  They were rehearing it and they were going to decide on the facts before them irrespective of what happened in the court below.  That is the general experience of everybody who had experience of the old judges of Assize.  That will be the mental attitude of judges under the new system. They will not care what happened in the court below.  It was pointed out here on the last occasion by Deputy Lavery, I think, certainly by some one of experience, that when you put in the old days in cross-examination the question &ldquo;Did you not say so-and-so in the County Court; did you not swear such a thing in the court below?&rdquo; the judge of Assize did not take the slightest notice of cross-examination of that kind.  It was common form on both <Col N="1457" /> sides, and it was recognised that that sort of thing was practised by advocates.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to go into the merits of this matter, but I do think that if this new system is to be worked properly, that if there is to be a check on perjury and on litigants changing their hands&mdash;mending their case between the hearing in the Circuit Court and the hearing before the judge of Assize&mdash; there ought to be an official shorthand writer who will take the evidence in the Circuit Court so that it can be referred to if there is any question of a changing of hand or of perjury.  No additional time will be wasted by referring to that evidence.  The mere fact that there is such a check in existence will tend, I believe, to stop this changing of hands and the committing of perjury before the judge of Assize.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one point of detail on the section on which I would like to have the Minister's views.  Under sub-section (3) there is a provision that the judge of Assize may state a case for the opinion of the Supreme Court.  I notice that that power to state a case for the Supreme Court, as the sub-section stands at the moment, is left entirely in the discretion of the judge of Assize.  If he should think proper, he may state a case for the decision of the Supreme Court.  The Minister may perhaps have heard of the observation of a well-known judge in this country who, when he was asked to state a case, said that he would do nothing of the sort: that it was the sign of a weak judge to state a case. Well, now, that attitude may possibly not be shared by the present judiciary, but at the same time it is one, I think, the Minister should give some attention to: as to whether or not it should not be obligatory on the judge of Assize, in a serious case, to state a case for the opinion of the Supreme Court unless he is of opinion, and so certifies, that there is no serious question of law involved and that the application is frivolous.  I do not like leaving the matter entirely in the discretion of the judge of Assize.  There is the danger of a judge making up his mind and taking a strong view of a case and of the law.  Everyone knows that at Assizes in the past it was not possible <Col N="1458" /> adequately to deal with very serious legal issues, and it will not be possible either under the proposed system.  Consequently, I think the Minister ought to give some consideration to the question as to whether or not it should not be mandatory on High Court judges, in serious cases, to state a case for the decision of the Supreme Court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to what the Deputy has said on that last point, I agree to some extent with him, as I had a very bitter experience myself. The position then was that you had to apply immediately for leave to appeal. Counsel in the case thought it better to leave it over for a while, to have a chat with the judge and get leave to appeal. He did not get leave, and it was a very bitter experience for me.  I certainly would be inclined to meet the Deputy in some way on that on the next stage of the Bill.</P>
      <P>There was one point that I omitted to mention when making my argument before, and that was the costs of the stenographer's notes.  As Deputies know, the main costs at the present time arise from the stenographer's notes.  Evidence was given before the Committee on that, but the Committee seem to have overlooked that particular matter.  Evidence was given as to the costs incurred in these appeals by way of rehearing on the notes.  The costs were mainly due to the notes.  What I suggest would happen, if you retain the stenographer and the taking of the notes, is that in every case that is being appealed the solicitors engaged will brief the stenographer's notes to counsel, and we will be back again to the old position and trouble as to costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think that it would be an exceedingly good thing to get the notes briefed to counsel going to the Assizes?  By doing that, the Minister will be ensuring that counsel have proper briefs in these cases.  They will be in a position to present their cases properly to the court.  The cost of the shorthand notes could be graded down and in any event it would fall on the litigants.  So far as the cost to the State is concerned, an official shorthand writer could be employed whole-time in the County Registrar's office.  That would mean <Col N="1459" /> very little additional cost to the State. What we had in view was that there would be one copy available for the judge and that it would be produced by the county registrar if and when required, or if there was any question of perjury or of the changing of evidence during the hearing of appeals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat again what I stated before.  The Committee took the view that the present system was too costly, and their main consideration, in recommending a new system, was to get a cheaper one.  They started off with that idea that seems to have implanted itself in their minds.  That may be seen from the questions put by them to witnesses very early in their proceedings.  Then there came a succession of witnesses, one of whom, Judge Devitt, said that the old system was a breeding ground for perjury and that the new system would breed more perjury.  He was the first, I think, who spoke very explicity on that.  Mr. Henry Murphy also gave evidence on this.  He started off by saying that he did not believe that amongst orderly living people there was any more inclination to perjury in this country than there was in any other.  He went on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A lot of our people are not as bad as they are painted, but it is a terrible temptation to hang this before a man.  He goes home from the court in the first instance a beaten man, and he sees the victor lighting a bonfire and that eats into him and he thinks that he will have another run for his money by way of a rehearing.  The poor fellow will spend his last pound upon it even though his case is hopeless.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Chief Justice, in giving evidence, used very much the same phrase.  He said that it was an obvious temptation and would breed perjury.  I am nearly sure, although I have not looked up the reference, that the President of the High Court said the same thing.  So impressed were the Committee with that evidence that, having in the forefront of their thoughts the idea of economy, and being really out against the stenographer's notes in the beginning, <Col N="1460" /> in the end they brought in a recommendation that the notes should be retained.  They state in their Report:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Committee heard a good deal of evidence on this question, and are of opinion that the official stenographer should be retained. This does not mean that his note should form part of the record in the Circuit Court, or that it should necessarily be briefed for counsel, or be transcribed, but it should be available, and any party to the action should be entitled to a transcript on payment therefore of the prescribed fees.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>You had that remarkable thing: that the Committee opened strongly in favour of economy, but they do gain the impression, although it is weakened towards the end, that the main field in which economy is possible is in regard to the notes, and yet the other current is started in their minds by all the evidence that was given before them in regard to perjury.  In the end I think they brought in two contrary sorts of suggestions: a report in favour of economy, a going back to a system which they think is going to be more economical and reporting in favour of the retention of the notes. There is no doubt that certain members of the Committee started off prejudiced against the system that holds at the moment, and were inclined to go back to the old system.  If not favourable to the impressive argument of economy, the saving of expense, even these people were swayed by the evidence given with regard to perjury. On the last occasion I referred to the suggestion made at the end of the evidence by the Chief Justice.  He suggested that the witness should not be sworn at all at the beginning, and that the impressive matter of imposing the oath should be retained, until such time as it would seem to the judge or counsel that a statement of considerable moment in the case, or one that was questioned very much, was being made.  At that point the man was sworn in order to have his attention directed to the particular statement that was about to be made, or that possibly had been <Col N="1461" /> made, and he was then faced up to that with the oath he had just sworn.</P>
    <P>I understand that a good number of people not merely approved of that suggestion of the Chief Justice but added to it the weight of their experience. I have certainly heard it said by practitioners that there was a peculiar mentality in this country which could only be met by not having the oath imposed; that where you press the oath it has this effect, that they only lie just sufficient to win the case and that there is a great deal to be got out; whereas, if they are not sworn, there will be more lying, but it will be so blatant that they will be caught.  I thought I heard the Attorney-General express that view. I certainly heard that view expressed by people who practise mainly in the west of Ireland.  I included the Attorney-General when I said I heard a number of people supporting the view of the Chief Justice, that you retain the solemnity of the oath until some critical statement is sworn to, or when a witness is answering a particular statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chief Justice suggested that it would have a restraining effect.  I do not know.  I heard other people, who have experience of witnesses and to whose opinion I would give credence, approve of this idea. Whether perjury is more rife in this country than in another country, or whether we are just as infirm with regard to that matter, and no more infirm than other people, there is no doubt there was an amazing amount of evidence which apparently impressed the Committee, that this was an undesirable thing, that it was tempting <Col N="1462" /> these people into perjury, and that the only way to block the temptation, and to make weight against that temptation, to some extent, was by having the note somewhere around, not necessarily in the brief to counsel, or available so that the judge could call for it. I understand the argument has been made that that would mean that the judge would have to go into the cases and have to read them, and that that would be an imposition on his time, and so on.  There are cases in which depositions are taken, and certainly whether the judge reads them or not, they are not referred to in court until there is some blatant misstatement of what was previously said.  Then it is the usual course to have the depositions and to ask a man about them and if his signature was on them.  Whether a witness has to be questioned, and whether the note is brought forward or not, there is that deterrent in the background. There is the record of his having said something.  Some evidence was given before the Committee that perjury would be always caught out. The answer given to that by, I think, the President of the High Court, was that perjury to be feared did not mean a complete misstatement of what was said on the first trial, but that the man who trimmed, who tied up little tangles and little hang-overs, who knew how to improve a new statement, and how far he could go, having that knowledge was able to warp a statement a little bit so as to get into line with the new case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another defect, not on that subject, but one that is, undoubtedly, going to prevail in the future. That is a scheme of not putting forward the best case.  I am not now referring to people who made the case and who went back on it, changed and warped it a bit, and perjured themselves in the process. There is a rather better method of using it as a trial run, by withdrawing an important witness, and then making the real case on the rehearing. Although that is not as disgraceful a practice as perjured evidence, that trial need not be made too easy.  The appeal ought to be a real appeal.  If a bad judgment on the case is presented in the first instance, you are certainly opening the door to the other method, <Col N="1463" /> of availing of the appeal.  The real case need not be presented the first time.  There is no prohibition with regard to the bringing forward of extra witnesses, and it will be possible still to get out of a man important pivotal things when it is known that the real hearing is on the second occasion.</P>

      <P>It always puzzles me why people who have not, perhaps, an intimate knowledge of the people, or who have not been concerned closely with them in their litigation, should be so ready to make the charge that the ordinary people are so ready to commit perjury.  Deputy Costello stated this evening that there was wholesale perjury in the courts. I know that that view is shared by a great many people, and that Deputy O'Sullivan seems to think there is a good deal of perjury there&mdash;I suppose in County Kerry.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is a reserved sin in the counties I speak of, or that even the fact that it is a reserved sin justifies the charge that was made here against the people. I want to give my own views about it. I say that when one hears so many responsible people expressing the view that there is wholesale perjury, I hesitate to challenge its correctness. It may possibly be that people who are so ready to make that charge have means of judging the truth or untruth of the stories told in the courts, or that they have a better instinct as to what is the truth than I have.  I had experience as a solicitor for five years, I acted as a judge in the old Sinn Féin Courts for a couple of years, and I have experience at the Bar, and I consider the charge against the people, that there is a general tendency towards perjury in law cases, unjustified. Undoubtedly certain people that one gets to know&mdash;particularly in an area where they are confirmed litigants&mdash; are prepared to commit perjury in court, if they can.  The ordinary country man is not inclined to commit perjury in civil cases.  Where criminal courts are concerned I agree that in defence of a prisoner, guilty, perhaps, <Col N="1464" /> of a crime, his alibi witnesses are prepared to go a long way in order to escape punishment.  Civil cases that went on appeal from the old County Court to the Assizes, in my judgment, and from my practical experience, are not characterised by the frequent perjury that has been treated by some of the speakers here as being almost a common feature of them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Costello said that appeal judges paid no attention to counsel who asked a man what he swore in the court below.  If witnesses were so prone to change their stories before the Assize court, it is an extraordinary thing that steps were not taken in the interest of justice to introduce some means of checking their evidence by stenographers' notes or otherwise.  If perjury were so frequent and stories were changed in that way, it is extraordinary that some steps were not taken to rectify the position.  Deputy Costello has said that no attention was paid to that charge when made by counsel.  I have known of witnesses who improved their story between one court and another, but that applied only to the odd case in my experience. Deputy McGilligan referred, over and over again, to the Committee's judgment as showing that they were so impressed by the case made for preventing this &ldquo;mending of the hand&rdquo; and this perjury that they suggested that the stenographers' notes should be retained even though the system was to be changed.  It strikes me that the real reason why the Joint Committee were anxious to preserve the stenographers' notes was in the interests of the stenographers employed at present.  They felt that, if there was a big change, all these men would be thrown out of work.  When I was before the Committee, that was the feeling I had when asked these questions about stenographers' notes.  Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy McGilligan referred, over and over again, to the Committee's report on this point. May I refer to paragraph 23 of the report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The principal objection made by some witnesses to an appeal by <Col N="1465" /> way of rehearing was that the hearing in the Circuit Court would, in many cases, be in the nature of a direction of proofs and that, on the rehearing on appeal, litigants would `mend their hand,' to the great encouragement of perjury.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Various reasons may be advanced.  What I am dealing with at the moment is the charge which runs through the speeches of several Deputies on the opposite side, that the old system was a breeding ground for perjury. That is a charge which it is easy to make, difficult to meet but not so easy to substantiate.  I agree thoroughly with what Mr. Henry Murphy said that there is no greater tendency to commit perjury amongst the ordinary people of this country than there is amongst the ordinary people of any other country.  I do not think that it is proper that Deputies should make this charge without having experience to guide them.  I do not think that Deputy McGilligan can claim to have experience of the ways of country people in the courts and their methods of making up their cases.  It is easy to see that if a plaintiff or defendant has a serious case to make, he is not going to carry that case on his own uncorroborated testimony.  Yet, the suggestion is that he mends his hand between one court and another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1466" /> Do Deputies not realise that the litigant would have to drill all his witnesses to do the same thing in order to succeed?  Unless we are prepared to accept the contention that a litigant is not alone prepared to change his own hand and to commit perjury, but is able to induce the whole body of witnesses to do the same thing, it is difficult to see how the suggestion of Deputies opposite, that success is so frequently achieved in this way, can be believed.  In my evidence I was asked a question about stenographers' notes, and I agreed that it would be useful to have stenographers' notes, but I objected to the note being available in the way the Committee reported.  It seems to me that if you have a stenographer's notes available, it will become common form for counsel to say: &ldquo;Brief me a copy of the stenographer's notes.&rdquo;  That would become the normal thing and that would add considerably to the cost.  If the only purpose to be served by the note is to check the evidence of a witness, my suggestion was&mdash;I think somebody has made it from the opposite benches&mdash; that stenographers' notes should be available, to be called for by the judge if required for the purpose of testing a witness's evidence, or if some important turn in the case made it desirable to have the notes produced.  I doubt, however, if it is justifiable to retain the stenographer's notes for that purpose only.  It will be expensive to the State and to the litigants who, as part of the brief to solicitor or counsel, will have to include these notes.</P>
    <P>If the notes are to be available only to the judge, the sole point made in favour of that procedure is that it will be a deterrent against perjury.  I do not really think that perjury is the widespread evil that Deputies opposite seem to believe it is.  I may be wrong. Everybody in Kerry may be a perjurer. I am speaking of Mayo and Galway and the counties with which I am familiar.  I have known people without inside knowledge who were prepared to accept that allegation when made by people who pretended to know.  I speak merely as one who had inside knowledge of the working of the system and of the ways of litigants, and I am not at all impressed&mdash;neither, <Col N="1467" /> apparently, was the Committee&mdash;with the charge that a return to the old system will encourage perjury on a large scale.  I do not know whether it is possible to meet the suggestion that the stenographer's notes should be retained for the purpose mentioned in my evidence and which I have just discussed.  The Minister may consider that there is something to be said for that contention.  On the whole, I think it would be unjustifiable to incur all that expense and add to the expense of litigation on the grounds suggested by Deputies opposite.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that the Attorney-General is a very simple man. Notwithstanding his experience in Mayo and Galway and as a Dáil judge, I think it must be recognised that litigants in general in this country are a little bit prone to what we call perjury, but what possibly they do not conceive to be perjury and merely regard as lies. The Attorney-General accused Deputy McGilligan of lack of experience in this matter.  Perhaps he will admit that I have a little experience of the County Court and Assize Court.  On one occasion, going into the County Court, I happened to meet a person for whom I was appearing in a slander action. I asked him whether he had or had not used the words the plaintiff complained of.  &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I have two witnesses here to swear I did not.&rdquo; The Attorney-General will not take that as a typical instance of the sort of thing that happened in the county to which I am referring.  Does the Attorney-General know that one district justice habitually keeps a crucifix in front of him for the purpose of endeavouring to stop perjury, and that another district justice here in the City of Dublin conceives it his duty, whether rightly or wrongly, to administer an oath two or three times to the same witness?  I am not concerned with emphasising the fact, which we believe to be a fact, that perjury is rife in this country in civil cases.  The Attorney-General says that it is rife in criminal cases.  In my experience, there is much more perjury in connection with civil cases in this country than in connection with criminal cases: that people regard <Col N="1468" /> them as more important and are prepared to go to greater lengths to win their cases in civil actions than in criminal cases.</P>
      <P>Again, may I refer a point of detail to the Minister in connection with sub-section (3), coupled with the following Section 42.  In reading it over, it struck me that there might be difficulties in regard to the construction of the section.  It would appear to me, at all events, that a rather cumbersome procedure is laid down, on the construction of Section 42.  Under the scheme of the Act, as it stands at the moment, a High Court judge has power to state a case for the opinion of the Supreme Court and he has to reserve his determination of the question until after the Supreme Court gives its decision.  My recollection of the old practice of cases stated from Assize judges to the then Court of Appeal is that the case was stated by the Assize judge and he said: &ldquo;If the determination of the matter by the Supreme Court is in such-and-such a way, then my decision will be so-and-so; but if the determination is not in such-and-such a way, then so-and so.&rdquo; But the case ended when it went into the Court of Appeal.  Here, however, the procedure would appear to be that the Supreme Court would express its opinion on a certain point submitted to it and then the case would be referred back to the judge of Assize, who may have to sit specially to hear the case or who may not hear the case until six months after it is determined by the Supreme Court.  I think that the Minister ought to give a little consideration to that point with a view to seeing if it was intended that such a cumbersome procedure should be enshrined in the Bill.</P>

      <P>When speaking the last time on this matter of perjury I thought I had precluded myself&mdash;at any rate in the judgment of anybody who had ears to listen to me and <Col N="1469" /> understanding enough to comprehend what I was saying&mdash;from being taken to mean that I was relying entirely on my own experience in this matter. I pointed out that I was not relying on my own experience, and I repeated here <i>ad nauseam</i> that I was founding my opinion on the experience of other people.  If there are any allegations about perjury in this country, they have been made by a big, and a very big, number of responsible people, and by folk who appeared before a committee to give evidence on this very matter and who did not scruple to put themselves on record, in the presence of stenographers taking down their evidence, as to what they thought about this matter of perjury.  The Attorney-General can read as much as he likes of paragraph 23.  The fact juts out that the committee were impressed by the arguments in favour of economy and further impressed with the question of expenses and by the fact that the expenses were mainly incurred by reason of the notes.  Yet they reported in favour of keeping the notes.  Why?  They said that they were not impressed by a certain objection&mdash;you have got to read that in its context&mdash;about the number of people who gave evidence about mending their hand.  At any rate, whether they were impressed or not, there is one thing that cannot be denied: that, being impressed with the arguments in favour of economy, they went back to what was described as an extravagance, and voted in favour of keeping the notes.  Why did they do that?  The only attempt to answer that has been the Attorney-General's statement that it was in order to keep the stenographers in their jobs.  Let us assume that that is the only argument, and let us weigh up the mentality of that committee and go through the evidence and find out how many people spoke about the possibility of the stenographers losing their jobs.  I do not think it will be found.  Apparently, that aspect was forgotten.  It was not put before the committee and I do not see that there is any question and answer, or any series of questions and answers given, which would enable anybody to hang the fact that they reported in favour <Col N="1470" /> of the notes on their desire to keep the stenographers in their jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it was not for that reason, why did they do it?  It is very easily seen. There was one member of that Committee&mdash;then a member of this House&mdash; and I have always expressed my admiration for the way he ran it.  I refer to Mr. Jasper Wolfe.  He was against the present system and in favour of the old system.  He was the man who asked the Attorney-General relevant questions about the old system as opposed to what was proposed in the new system, and when he first came up against a really important witness on the matter of perjury he then proceeded to shift his ground.  That was when the Chief Justice was under examination.  The Chief Justice, surely, is a responsible man, and the Chief Justice's phrase, as used at the top of page 317, was: &ldquo;We all know that these cases on being reheard at Assizes were hardly recognisable.&rdquo; If there is any allegation being made, it is not mine.  That was the allegation made by a responsible person, speaking in a responsible way on that matter as the Chief Justice of the whole courts of this country, who came to give evidence on that matter before a Committee that had been set up to pass judgment on the old system.  The Chief Justice said: &ldquo;We all know that these cases on being reheard at Assizes were hardly recognisable.&rdquo;  The Chief Justice's evidence was very strong on that matter of perjury.  He uses a phrase about the breeding ground of perjury. Mr. Wolfe put a question to him: &ldquo;You said that the old system was rather an invitation to perjury.&rdquo;  The answer of the Chief Justice was: &ldquo;Yes, that is the old appeal system.&rdquo;  A little later, Mr. Wolfe suggested that the way to kill perjury was by an amendment of the old system: that is to say, to have the old system, plus the stenographer's notes.  That was the way the Committee was run thereafter, and it was run on the recurrence to the old system, plus the notes, in order to meet the objections put up about perjury. Witness after witness talked about perjury, and they were people who were as tender-minded about the people of this country as the Attorney-General is, <Col N="1471" /> but they were called in there solemnly to give their opinions in a representative way on this matter and they gave it without any truckling to a public opinion which recognises perjury as being present but is afraid to say so.</P>
    <P>Circuit Judge Devitt was another man who spoke very openly about perjury. He had had considerable experience both as a practitioner and as a judge at this time, and he told a story that on one occasion, when on circuit, he was up near the judges of Assize at dinner, and the conversation that went on between two High Court judges was an argument as to which county produced the best perjurers.  He said that that made a terrific impression on his mind and that he had never forgotten it.  It had remained constant with him.  It may be said that these circuit judges, or judges of Assize in those times, were people who were out of touch with the people or who might have looked down upon the people of this country.  I make a present of that argument for what it is worth.  Deputy Costello has quoted a story told to him, and in the last week&mdash;since this matter was debated&mdash;a member of the Bar, who was previously a solicitor, told me of an instance where two men came into his office on one occasion to discuss a case.  He proceeded to take down notes from them of their evidence in the case, and when they had finished he told them: &ldquo;You cannot win on that,&rdquo; and their answer to him was: &ldquo;Oh, we are only telling you that, but that is not what we are going to tell in court.&rdquo;  Then there was a glorious case.  Those men had their minds quite clear that, on the facts as they presented them to their solicitor, the man they were going to instruct, they could not win, but they did let him know that the actual occurrence was so and so and then warned him: &ldquo;But that is not the case to be presented; this is it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think it would be wrong to found on an isolated instance like that, and I am only stating that here because it is a story which has been suggested to me as marking a frequent occurrence, not so openly stated, but when I get people like the Chief Justice, a couple of <Col N="1472" /> Circuit Court judges, a few solicitors through the country and some commercial men saying that they believe that, whatever may be the first attitude of the people of the country towards perjury, when you give them a chance of winning a victory where previously they have been defeated, the temptation is going to be too strong.  All that was ever presented to the Committee by way of evidence was that it was a very serious temptation to put before people, and I suggest again that it is the only explanation of why the Committee abandoned their original strong view about economy and reported in favour of the keeping of the extravagance of the notes.  The only way in which you can reason their change of attitude on that is that they were in fact impressed by the arguments put forward about perjury.  Now we are going to go back to it without taking any care.</P>
    <P>Has there been even any consideration given to a further point?  The objection is the cost of the stenographers to litigants at the moment. Suppose the Committee's suggestion were adopted that the stenographer must be kept at his post, the note will be taken and will always be available for the judge but would only be available to a party on his paying for it.  Has there been any consideration given to what cost that is going to impose on the State, and, secondly, how far is that going to tend against the so-called economy in the new system?  In other words, how often will it occur that parties will request the notes and, therefore, incur the expense of getting them?  I suggest that there is a great deal to be said for simply having the note in the background and that the mere fact that it is there, to be called for, will often preclude the necessity of incurring the expenditure on getting it, but apparently that has not been considered at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I spend the greater part of my life amongst country people and I have no hesitation in saying that what Deputy Costello says is perfectly true.  Our people in rural Ireland do not attach the <Col N="1473" /> same significance to the word &ldquo;perjury&rdquo; that lawyers and the people who examine the question closely do.  A great many of our people do not conceive it to be seriously wrong to put, as they think it, the best face they can on their case.  Examples could be multiplied endlessly without proving much, but I remember a respectable man saying in my presence to a friend who asked him if he thought it prudent for him to go on with his litigation, that there was no need to be apprehensive as he had so and so as a witness and he was the best man who ever put lip to leather.  He did not think it anything remarkable that this man was coming into court to swear what was necessary.  I remember another man telling me that he was going to court on behalf of a friend to testify that he was present when a certain warranty was given and I said to him, &ldquo;You were in my company at that time,&rdquo; and he replied, &ldquo;Isn't the man my neighbour?&rdquo; He simply felt that he had an obligation to weigh in, to lend force and weight to what he believed to be true although he knew he was committing perjury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put it to the Attorney-General, who has had long experience as a solicitor, if he has ever heard a trespass case in the County Court, or a licensing case in the District Court, in which he did not hear what he believed to be perjury.  I do not think I have ever heard a prosecution by the Guards of a publican in which I have not heard perjury.  I cannot imagine that, if the Attorney-General will examine his recollection, he will remember many cases in which a publican came forward and freely told the truth of what was actually passing when the Guards came to his door.  The same could be said of a variety of cases. I do not believe, as a result of those facts, that our people are an abandoned or a degenerate lot who would commit perjury, as we understand it, with very small reason, but I do believe that the full significance of solemn perjury is not present to the minds of our people.  Men who <Col N="1474" /> would not dream of committing perjury outside a law court consider themselves perfectly free to do so when it is in the course of legal proceedings.</P>
    <P>The House has committed itself to the appeal system on assize and that appeal system, I suggest, will work far better if there is a note in existence of what passed in the court below.  I would be inclined to stand for a note available only to the Assize judge because I think there is some force in the suggestion that if the note is available to counsel on either side, on application, it will become a routine matter that they will ask for it.  Not only will counsel ask for it, but litigants, who, as we all know, in the country get wildly excited when they become involved with their neighbours in litigation, will feel that failure to supply their counsel with the note of the proceedings might jeopardise their chances of success in the superior court, so that you will have each side anxious to get the note and piling up costs, whereas if the note is available to neither side, it will be open to counsel to warn litigants that they are under an obligation, not only a moral obligation but an obligation of prudence, to adhere most strictly to the truth when in the witness box, because if they attempt to prevaricate or mend their hands in respect of the evidence they gave in the court below, the judge has before him all they said.</P>
    <P>They can further point out that it is impossible to go over it because the note is not available to litigants and because the only person who will have it is the judge, and, therefore, the only safe advice they can be given is, &ldquo;Stick to the truth, and, if you do, there is no danger of your being caught out; depart by a hair's breadth from the truth and the judge has a note of all you said &mdash;and you cannot check up on it&mdash;and you are certain to be tripped; if you stick to the facts as they occurred you will reproduce what you said in the court below and there is no danger of your being exposed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I cannot imagine that that will involve the State in any very material <Col N="1475" /> expense, but I do say in this connection that I consider one of the things for which the State ought to be prepared to face expenditure is the proper administration of justice.  It is the most valuable asset we can have all through the country, and money saved by skimping on the due and proper administration of justice is the worst form of economy we could go in for.  I put it to the Attorney-General that the arguments which have been advanced for the existence of the note have remained unanswered, and I suggest that he should press the Minister for Justice, and I press the Minister myself, to accept an amendment which would provide that the note of the proceedings in the court below would be available to the superior judge but would not be available to counsel on either side.</P>

      <P>I do not want to prolong the debate, but I should like to say in reply to what Deputy Dillon has just said that I admit there is no answer to the case he makes for having the stenographer's note available to the judge in the Court of Appeal, except the one of expense. That, I am afraid, is a matter which must be considered by the Minister, and I suppose if that could be got over the point would be met.  I agree with him that it would be desirable to have the note there, and there seems to be such a strong volume of opinion against me on this question of perjury that I do not want to suggest that my opinion should be taken against that of others.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Attorney-General will realise as a result of the debate that it is not a question as to whether naturally the people of this country are more inclined to this particular fault or not, but whether the legislation of the country is putting unnecessary temptation in their way.  I wonder does the Attorney-General, with his experience in all sorts of courts, legal and semilegal, as a solicitor, a barrister, senior counsel and Attorney-General, know the attitude of the ordinary man towards a court?  I thoroughly agree with Deputy Dillon.  I had an argument with a man whose theology was <Col N="1476" /> very strong.  He said that people were guilty of perjury and gave me a case. He said: &ldquo;Take the ordinary case in the old days of fixing a fair rent.&rdquo; The Attorney-General is familiar with that matter.  Everybody knows how many cows a farm can take.  There is grass for ten cows.  The tenant swore the farm had only grass for six cows. The landlord's agent swore that it had grass for 14 cows.  Was not that the ordinary practice?  Everybody who knew the farm knew that it had grass for ten cows.  This clergyman told me &mdash;it was not in the County Kerry, I can assure the Attorney-General&mdash;that that was downright perjury.  I said that it was nothing of the kind so far as the mentality of the man was concerned. He regarded the whole thing as a question of bargaining, and that is the way the landlord's agent regarded it. The man knew well that if he admitted it had grass for ten cows he was giving away a lot of his case&mdash;that the judge would split the difference.  He approached the whole thing in the bargaining spirit, not with the intention of committing perjury.</P>
      <P>I mentioned before that when the original Courts of Justice Bill was before the Dáil I had a private opinion in favour of the abolishing of the oath, because it added the additional crime of perjury to giving false evidence and cheating a neighbour.  I see that is borne out by the Chief Justice.  His considered view before the Committee was: &ldquo;I think the oath has so far been debased that it has lost all meaning, and that, having been debased and lost all meaning, it is wrong to continue to use it.&rdquo;  I think in a way I would almost prefer not to have an oath&mdash;not on the ground of objection to having the oath, but owing to the way in which you have the additional sin of perjury put on to the ordinary question of cheating and giving false evidence. I ask the Attorney-General to realise that we as a legislative body are putting this extra temptation into people's way.</P>

On page 76, the end of paragraph 27 runs &ldquo;This does not mean that his note should form part of the record in the Circuit Court, or that it should necessarily be briefed for counsel, but it should be available for the judge, and for cross-examination by counsel of a witness whose evidence on the rehearing differs from that which he gave in the Circuit Court.&rdquo; On page 93 we see how the present paragraph came in.  An amendment was proposed by Senator Comyn to delete all words after the word &ldquo;available&rdquo; and substitute therefore the words &ldquo;and any party to the action should be entitled to a transcript on payment therefore of the prescribed fees&rdquo;.  Apparently the chairman's draft report made it quite clear that it should be available for the judge and then it looks as if some little bit of fuddling took place.  I should say the Committee meant to have it available for the judge.</P>

      <P>In view of the arguments put forward I would be inclined to see if that could be met in some way.  I can see a difficulty, however, for a solicitor in briefing counsel.  He will not have the notes of evidence given in the Circuit Court to have counsel fully prepared for any case he has to meet.  The counsel would have <Col N="1478" /> to have a very good idea of the evidence in the notes on both sides.  I think that in practice it would be very difficult to have counsel fully briefed as to all the facts.  The most we could do in the old county court days, as well as briefing the evidence as best we could, was to try and get a cutting from a local paper of the evidence given.  We had no shorthand note. That would be very incomplete as against the note the judge will have of the evidence.  Between now and the Report Stage I shall try and consult the Incorporated Law Society and the Bar Council and see what are their views on the matter.</P>

      <P>I understand from reading the evidence that those who urged that this was an extravagance urged it on the ground that solicitors took not merely the easy, but the safe course of briefing the whole thing once it was paid for.  In the new circumstances, where it is a matter in future of counsel directing proofs and saying: &ldquo;I want such and such evidence&rdquo; he will be faced with the fact that he is definitely by his direction putting new expense on his client.  If the phraseology of that could be run on such a fashion as to make that stand out, in other words, that ordinarily the thing would not be available for counsel, but always be in the background for the judge, and if a litigant, through his solicitor or counsel, called for it, he is definitely going to pay for it, you might stop the habit of briefing everything.</P>

There is a note at the foot of the Estimate which states: &ldquo;Legislation will be introduced to give effect to the Government's proposals for the development of commercial air transport.&rdquo; As, however, certain minor expenses may be incurred in that connection this token Vote is being taken with a view to securing the approval of the Dáil.  The second sub-head provides that a sum of £3,490 be voted, being the cost of wireless installation and wireless equipment for the guidance of aircraft, including the provision for maintenance and running charges, etc., in connection with the installation.</P>
    <P>I informed the Dáil last week, however, that I proposed to take advantage of the introduction of this Supplementary Estimate to give an indication of the Government's plans in connection with air transport and to inform the House in regard to the negotiations which have taken place and the arrangements which had been made with the object of initiating the operation of commercial air transport services in the Saorstát.  A scheme has been under consideration for some time past for the establishment of a national air transport company in the Saorstát and I hope to be in a position at an early date to introduce legislation dealing with this national company and with the scheme of its operation.  It is intended that the national company will finance or hold interests in air transport operating companies, operating between the Saorstát and other countries.  The national company may also engage in or hold interests in other activities bearing on air navigation.  In view, however, of the desirability of establishing at the earliest possible date air transport services between the Saorstát and Great Britain it has been <Col N="1481" /> decided, pending the formation of the national company, to which I referred, to establish a Saorstát company which will subsequently be one of the subsidiaries of the national company, for the operation of cross-Channel services.  In connection with these services and, in fact, with any other services to be established later, it is highly desirable, with a view to economy in operation and for other reasons, to endeavour as far as possible to restrict competition.  At the same time it must be recognised that no one country can hope to reserve to its own nationals the whole of the air transport between its own territory and that of another country. Consequently, in connection with the proposed cross-Channel services a large number of proposals submitted from time to time by British air transport operators for the establishment of air services with the Saorstát were seriously examined, and certain discussions took place with the authors of some of these proposals in order to determine how far satisfactory arrangements could be made for more or less joint working by two companies, of which one would be British and the other Irish.  An arrangement of this nature had almost reached completion some months back when, owing to unforeseen circumstances, it was not found possible to conclude the negotiations.  An arrangement with Olley Air Services, Limited, of London, has now, however, reached a stage at which the authority of the Dáil is necessary to enable commitments to be entered into in advance of the full scheme to be dealt with by contemplated legislation.  Preliminary steps have been taken for the establishment of a Saorstát cross-Channel air transport company, the directors of which have been nominated by the Government and the terms of a provisional agreement for joint working arrangements, including provision for the pooling of receipts and a joint committee of management, have been agreed to between these directors of the Saorstát company and Olley Air Services, Limited.  The joint committee of management will have equal representation from both companies. The chairman will alternately <Col N="1482" /> be chosen from the Saorstát company's representatives and from the British company's representatives year after year.  But as at the outset of the service the experience will come from the British side, and as many technical questions will arise, it is proposed for the first three years that the chairman will be appointed by the British company.  It will be open at the same time to the Saorstát to have any services they desire operated in addition to those jointly operated with the advantages of the joint organisation.</P>
    <P>The agreement contains adequate safeguards for both companies, and on the whole embodies arrangements which would be to their mutual advantage. It is intended that the cross-Channel services shall be operated strictly on commercial lines, and, consequently, it is proposed that the first services to be established will be between Dublin and Liverpool and Dublin and Bristol, connecting with the fast express trains serving those ports.  It is very probable that after a little time it will be found practicable to establish a through service between Dublin and London and perhaps Cork and London.  Arrangements in connection with the proposed services are now in a forward stage, and it is hoped when approval for the Supplementary Estimate is obtained the companies will be in a position to commence operations early next year.  I may say it would be possible to have the services commence at an earlier date, but it is desired that they should not begin until all the equipment considered desirable for their safe and regular operation is completed, including a wireless installation, for which this Supplementary Estimate is being taken.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the Saorstát cross-Channel operating company will be financed by the national Saorstát company to be established under the proposed legislation.  Liabilities, however, will commence to accrue to the Saorstát company as soon as the operation of the services has commenced, and these liabilities will be met by borrowing, but it is anticipated the total liability for the first year of operation will not exceed £20,000. <Col N="1483" /> During the remainder of this financial year the amount of the liability which will arise will not be appreciable, and no immediate financial provision is, therefore, necessary so far as the cross-Channel company is concerned. The amount provided under sub-head D is merely the token sum of £10.  It is anticipated the several Saorstát groups who have proposed services will have every opportunity of supporting the national company when established, and their participation will be welcomed.</P>
    <P>At the inception of the services, and pending other arrangements, it is proposed that the services shall for the present operate in the Saorstát from Baldonnel Aerodrome, and it is necessary, not only in connection with these services, but in view of developments and for aviation generally, that a properly-equipped wireless installation should be provided for the assistance of pilots in flight and for communication with other aerodromes.  It is accordingly proposed to set up this wireless installation at once in the immediate neighbourhood of Baldonnel and provision is included in the Supplementary Estimate for the expenditure in connection therewith of a sum of £3,490 for the remainder of the financial year.  The capital cost of the equipment and its erection is estimated at £3,050, the cost of the staff at £350, and maintenance and incidentals at £90.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 59:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 16, Section 42, line 36, after the word &ldquo;appealable&rdquo; to add the words &ldquo;provided, however, that the judges of the High Court or of the High Court on circuit shall, if an application on that behalf is made by any party to any matter pending before them, submit by way of case stated for the judgment of the Supreme Court any question of law arising on the hearing of an appeal.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, it does not often happen, but, at the same time it does occur, that important question of law arise, and in such circumstances it is desirable <Col N="1486" /> that if people wish to have a case reviewed by the supreme tribunal on a question of law bearing on the case that opportunity should be available. Sub-section (3) of the last section might have some bearing on the matter.  But in that sub-section it is not mandatory on the judge to grant the application. I am trying to make it mandatory if there is an application made by any of the parties.  I am using the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; instead of the word &ldquo;may.&rdquo; I think it is very important, where a question of law arises, that it should be decided by the supreme tribunal.  I ask the Minister to accept this amendment because a great number of people have suggested that it is eminently desirable to have such an amendment in the section.</P>

      <P>The argument is that the High Court on circuit, having its eye on the clock, the railway timetable and the expenses, may, in certain circumstances, not fully deal with a thing, and I think it should be open to one of the parties to insist that a case should be stated in the matter.  I admit there is something in the contention that somebody might make a frivolous appeal, but I do not think, with the expenses involved, that any counsel would be so anxious, or so unwise, as to insist on having a case stated without sound reason.</P>

      <P>On the section. New duties are being imposed on the registrars.  Is there any intention of meeting the complaints which some, at any rate, of those registrars make with regard not so much to emoluments while they are in service, as with regard to pensions and such matters?  The matter will vary with regard to the individual, but the point can be made in a great many cases just as it was made in the case of the Master, that owing to certain qualifications being regarded as essential the people who go in for those posts go in at a fairly advanced stage of life, and that they cannot, therefore, qualify for anything like the full pension which, on paper, may be secured by them.  There has been a suggestion put up&mdash;I think it has already been submitted to the Minister&mdash;that, where professional qualifications are demanded, the years which have to be spent in such professional occupation should be counted in.  They are counted in as part of a man's training and qualifications, and they ought to count, possibly in some reduced form, towards the remuneration of his period of years in service, so as to enable him to get a somewhat higher fraction of the pension.  I do not think the cost is likely to be considerable, and court fees are going to be raised.</P>

I really cannot believe that the Minister for Justice is going seriously to consider what orders are to be given to the judges' servants, as to whether they are to bring in his lunch at midday or some other hour, as to what is to be done about calling him in the morning, bringing him his shaving water, and so forth.  Surely judges on circuit might be allowed to determine for themselves the duties to be performed by their servants?  Later on I have put in a phrase to the effect that the terms and conditions governing the service of those servants&mdash;that is, the <Col N="1491" /> terms upon which they are to be payable, their pension rights, if any, and their emoluments&mdash;are, of course, to be determined by the Minister for Justice with the sanction of the Minister for Finance.  Is it not pushing this regimentation very far to say that the judges' servants are to get directions in relation to their more or less menial duties from the Minister for Justice?  In addition to that point I am urging another, and that is that the Minister's functions should be limited to settling the terms and conditions of service, and that the judges should be given the right to appoint the individual.  That goes a step further from the first point which I urged.  They are two distinct points.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy to a considerable extent that those judges should be able to tell their servants what they are to do, and it is not our desire to interfere with the judges in any way with regard to that particular matter.  The trouble which arises is that those servants are regarded as civil servants, and they are subject to Civil Service regulations. That is how the difficulty has arisen. If the Deputy leaves it to the Report Stage I will try to get that particular matter adjusted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a different point.  The first point is that once a man is appointed the judge will be allowed to direct him as to his duties. I am urging another point too; those servants will be in somewhat close and intimate relation with the judges, and if they are not going to be exceedingly well paid&mdash;if it is not a post which will be, as it were, fought for amongst those people&mdash;would it not also be a proper thing to allow the judges to appoint those men who will be travelling around the country with them, and so forth?  I think a judge should be given the right to get his own nominee.  There used to be far too much patronage in the possession of judges; there is absolutely none now. I am judging this only from the angle of convenience.  A judge may find his life made quite unpleasant by the fact that there has been forced on him some servant who is objectionable to him <Col N="1492" /> personally.  There is not a great deal of patronage involved in giving to people who are in such a very high position the right to appoint their own body of servants.</P>

I am aware of one particular case where the judge was very glad that he had not the making of the appointment..</P>

      <P>It is applied to over 12,000 people in the public service.  It has been applied, as the Deputy has said, to the auxiliary postmen, and there is a very sound reason for it. People who are paid out of public funds are public servants.  If they are not employed either in the police or in the defence forces, then they must come under the remaining category, that of civil servants.  I think the objections which the Deputy has raised are very largely without any substance.  I am perfectly certain that no Minister for Justice who wished to preserve normal relations with the judiciary would endeavour to force upon a judge an individual as that judge's personal servant who would not be acceptable to the judge.  I am also perfectly certain that if&mdash;whether or not he was appointed with the consent of the judge&mdash;the person was found to be unsuitable and unfitted for his office, the Minister would have no compunction whatsoever in removing him from that office on the making of the necessary representations to him by the judge.  I think that, in practice, it will be found that the points which the Deputy has raised have no substance in them whatever.</P>

      <P>Presuming always good relations between the Ministry and the judges, you might make no regulations.  If you presume that, you do not want regulations at all.  All regulations, in relation to sport, cards and everything else, are made against the bad condition&mdash;against the emergency condition.  Supposing there was a Minister who did not like a particular judge and he wanted to harry him, is there not an obvious way of doing it in this manner?  It is unthinkable perhaps, but remember there is a colleague of mine who has been guarded and who objected strongly to the individuals who were guarding him.  Were they taken away?  He even gave reasons arising from their obscene language as to why they should be removed from him.  Were they taken away?  That is the fact.  I do not say that there is a possibility of judges being persecuted round the place by unsuitable people, say drunken people, who are forced on them, but contrast <Col N="1494" /> it with the great principle that is at stake.  Say there are eight civil servants of this type.  Let us say they are not civil servants.</P>

I do not see any principle at stake in allowing the judge to say, &ldquo;I want so and so.&rdquo;  I am not going to press these amendments, however, as the Minister has said that the judges would be consulted.  That is satisfactory as far as it goes.  But there is the possibility of a Minister being in office who would not consult the judge's convenience and it is not desirable to have anybody possessed of these powers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>My interpretation of the amendment is that whenever a vacancy arises the senior assistant justice should be appointed.  The objection I have to that in the first instance is that we are making special provision for the assistant justices under another section in the Bill, giving them increased salaries and so on.  In addition it may happen that a vacancy may arise in a particular district and that the senior assistant justice would not be suitable for that district for the reason that he would have associations with the district.</P>

      <P>Could not that be met by an exchange?  Otherwise, I think there is a good deal to be said for the point that the man who has been assistant justice and who has shown his merits in service, should get the vacancy.  They should be appointed in rotation in accordance with seniority. There will be other people taken on to take the place of the assistant justices and they in their turn will get their chance.  There has been one <Col N="1498" /> sound argument urged against the amendment, that you might have a district falling vacant and that the individual who was senior assistant justice was from that area and that it was undesirable to have him appointed there.  That could be met by an exchange of districts.</P>

The result will be that persons acting as temporary district justices will have the right to the vacancy and that a person who has not experience will not be accepted just for political reasons and put into the position over the man who has, perhaps, given good service.</P>
      <P>Now, I agree that it may appear from experience that a person who has been appointed an assistant district justice would not be a good man to be appointed a full-time district justice. That might appear from the way he has carried on during his period as an assistant district justice.  I think that the Minister ought to accept the principle that, if the men appointed assistant district justices prove themselves to be competent, capable and fairminded, they should get the preference where a vacancy arises for a full time district justice.</P>

      <P>In page 19, before Section 50, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 72 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the substitution of the words &ldquo;A justice of the District Court shall be entitled to hold office until he reaches the age of 70 years, unless it is proven satisfactorily to the Minister for Justice that he is unfit to continue to hold office by reason of his physical or mental health&rdquo; for all the words before the proviso now contained in the said Section 72.</P>
      <P>Cardinal Manning said at one time that a person who could not say what he had to say in ten minutes would never say it.  Bearing that in mind, my remarks will be short, succinct and, I hope, to the point.  The reason I have brought forward this amendment is that, as everybody knows, some of our greatest judges have been at the top of their form at the age of 70.  I consider it a great waste of money and great expense to the Exchequer to be dismissing men at the comparatively early age of 65 to enable them to play golf or poker in the evenings.  I understand that the justices in the cities of Dublin and Cork need not retire until they reach the age of 70.  These justices have a great deal of work to do.  On the average, I should say that they have more to do in a month than a rural justice has to do in six months. They operate in stuffy courthouses and have very little time for recreation, whereas the justices who preside in the country courts live a full-bodied, open-air life, and I am sure that at the age of 65, if the ordinary rules of hygiene apply, they ought to be in a much better condition than the justices in either Cork or Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see no reason why men who are perfectly competent and perfectly able to do their work should be pensioned off at the age of 65, thereby putting extra on this overtaxed country, and <Col N="1501" /> at a time when they are prepared, willing and efficient to carry on the work entrusted to them.  I think this is a very reasonable amendment.  It ought to commend itself to any reasonable person.  I cannot see any objection to it, and I hope and trust that it will be accepted by the Minister and by the learned Attorney-General.  I know that the volume of public opinion is in favour of it.  I feel that it is a desirable thing to do.  I hope that there will be no division on it, and that it will be cheerfully and gladly accepted by the Government.  I cannot see any reasonable objection whatsoever to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment.  Right at the beginning of the District Court section, I should like to say this that there is the tendency always&mdash;it was observable in the 1924 Act and in the discussions that took place when that measure was going through&mdash;to sort of demean and discredit the District Court.  It is true that the district justices have to deal with matters of relatively minor importance, but in the discussion that we had here on an earlier section about the removal of a certain jurisdiction from the Chief Justice, there was brought into it the note that there was a good deal of humanity required in regard to, say, the treatment of minors and lunatics: that the whole matter had to be set on a different footing from the ordinary matters coming before the Supreme Court and the High Courts.  I would like to say this about the District Court that it does make some approach to the requirements of common humanity.  It does that more definitely than any of the other courts.  The justice dealt out there has to be somewhat more ready, and, in the process, becomes somewhat rough and ready.  I use that phrase without meaning to cast any discredit on the capacity of these district justices.  The district justices are actually more in touch with a bigger percentage of the common humanity of the country than any of the other courts.  The other courts are on a higher level and raised somewhat above the ordinary level of the people. There is required a little bit more of that essential humanity that I have <Col N="1502" /> spoken of in dealing with the matters that come before these District Courts.</P>
      <P>I fail to see why there should be any distinction made with regard to retirements as between district justices as a class and the other judges, and I cannot see why district justices in the metropolitan area should be put on one age limit when it comes to retiring, while others, who will be living healthier lives and having better conditions all round, should be told that they are likely to fail to be capable of carrying out their duties a couple of years earlier.  I intend to speak more fully on this at another stage, and on the whole matter of the District Courts.  I think that will make a good jumping off ground for a discussion on the District Courts and on the unfair distinction which is made with regard to retirements. I will move very definitely on that, as I am strongly in favour of Deputy Burke's amendment, and will ask for a division later.</P>

      <P>This motion, asking the House to set up a committee to investigate the incidence of British penal tariffs, was intended to put that case and no other.  What we <Col N="1503" /> asked for has been hidden in a maze of irrelevancies by the speakers who set out to handle the agricultural policy by giving their opinions on it and so on.  Very little attention was given to the request in the motion. Whether the growing of wheat, the growing of beet, and other phases of the Government's agricultural policy is sound or unsound we did not contemplate a discussion on these lines. I do not think that remarks which I consider to be irrelevant, and which clouded the issue, call for a reply. At another time I will give my opinion on the agricultural policy, not now.  I made a case of substantial accuracy in my previous remarks.  That is all that is required on this motion.  I hold that I made a substantially accurate case when I pointed out that agriculture was losing £6,000,000 a year through the operation of these tariffs.  I did not ask the Government to accept that case.  They did not even put up a speaker with any knowledge to refute it.  Perhaps that might be the most eloquent criticism of the Government's action.  Our case is made at every cross roads and at every meeting house regardless of the auspices under which these meetings are called.  I do not care whether they are held under the auspices of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, or Labour.  Nobody dissents from the case we are making.  It will be good reading for opponents of the Government, and bad reading for their supporters, if they do not accept this motion, particularly when the Government put up no spokesman to deal with this question in an intelligent way.  The case we made was that agriculture is losing about £6,000,000 a year owing to these tariffs and we merely asked that a committee should be set up to investigate that position.  That is a very reasonable request.  If it is not granted it shows that the Government is afraid of something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government told us many times during the economic war that they were looking around the world for markets.  That same Government, <Col N="1504" /> when offered a present of a market, turned it down and prevented farmers availing of it.  In the last year Yugo-Slavia sent 141,213 live cattle to Italy.  First quality fat heifers and bullocks can be purchased in the Dublin cattle market at 21/- and 22/- per cwt. live weight; second quality fat heifers and bullocks can be purchased from 17/- to 18/- per cwt. live weight.  Fat bulls and cows which are not, I suppose, fit for Roscrea factory can be purchased from 15/- to 16/- per cwt. live weight. The average weight per beast would be about 11 cwt. live weight, or 550 kilos.  The cost of transport per beast to the Port of Naples, including freight, loading and unloading, on the basis of a full boat load of 250 or 300 fat cattle would be £4 per head and allowing £2 for feeding and insurance, the total cost per head would be £6.  On the basis that first quality fat heifers and bullocks weigh 550 kilos live weight they would be delivered at an Italian port for about £18.  Second quality heifers and bullocks could be delivered at £16 and bulls and cows about £15 per head.  These calculations are only estimated, however, in order to show what the probable cost would work out at in the transaction.  It would be necessary to allow wastage of 10 per cent., live weight, due to the sea journey, so that 550 kilos would amount on arrival at an Italian port to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We find a Minister who represents an agricultural constituency and who did not get up to speak to this motion, interjecting &ldquo;Hear, hear.&rdquo; The Minister knows nothing about this country except what the four walls of a house present to him.  When we have the country run by people of that kind, we cannot expect anything else but to have various burdens falling on the wrong shoulders.  The case has been presented fairly and squarely to the House.  If this committee is set up, it will be presented to the committee. It is because the Government know that such a case can be presented and cannot be refuted that they will not agree to this motion.  Deputy Corry said that any committee that would be set up could be got to report any way the Government wanted it to report.  I do not believe that the Government or any political Party could get a committee, set up under the machinery provided here, to report in any way except on the evidence before them.  The country would be looking on and would judge their actions.  I hope the country will judge the actions of the Government and of the Opposition on this motion.  Those members of the Opposition who have spoken have spoken against the motion, notwithstanding that they adopted at their last Ard-Fheis a resolution similar to this motion.  I read the resolution when I was winding up the other day, and I am not going to refer to it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We did not go into the question of the economic war.  We did not want that introduced.  The duties are there and are levied on our goods when they go over.  Our stuff when it goes across is sold at the market price ruling there. The amount of the tariffs is taken out of the return to the exporter so that it comes directly out of the exporter's pocket.  He sends it down the line.  In buying stock for export, he has to bear <Col N="1507" /> in mind that he has to pay £6 per head tariff for certain beef and he buys accordingly.  There is no question of that being distributed amongst any other section of the community.  It comes out of the income of the agricultural producers.  Our request is simply to have that transaction inquired into by a committee set up by this House. If political Parties vote against that <Col N="1508" /> request, it is for the country to take notice of their action.  If the country is satisfied with the action of political Parties in opposing that request, I think Deputy Kent, Deputy MacDermot, I and other supporters of this motion will be able to bear the brunt of the struggle as well as those who are opposing our motion.  We shall see who will squeal first.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that the Department of Agriculture should run several farms in each county under the direction and supervision of its agricultural instructors, independent of all other activities, on which decent wages would be paid, accounts kept and audited, balance sheets published <Col N="1509" /> with appropriate explanations of costings, profits, etc., for the purpose of demonstrating to farmers in a practical way how to make their industry pay.</P>
    <P>This motion, being of a non-contentious and non-Party character, I hope it will be considered by every section of the House in the spirit in which it is set down.  Briefly, what the motion contemplates is an extension of the scope of agricultural demonstration, as we know it at present, into a comprehensive scheme of demonstration by farms, embracing the whole field of demonstration plots, a scheme which will systematise and apply to practical farming the lessons hitherto conveyed only in a piecemeal and incomplete form, and, with particular regard to the keeping of accounts for the purpose of demonstrating in terms of £ s. d., the value of the lessons taught, and also the particular system best suited to particular types of farms and the variations of the system desirable on different qualities of land.  The farms are to be operated by the officers of the Department in the county.</P>
    <P>The real test, of course, of the success or failure of these farms will be the profits realised at the end of the season as disclosed by the balance sheet.  It is necessary that these farms should be run independent of other activities, such as experiment, research, or the keeping and training of students, so that they get a fair chance.  There is one feature about this scheme and it is, I think, unique in this respect.  It is, I think, the first motion introduced since Dáil Eireann was established which proposed a scheme which is to be self-supporting. This scheme is intended to be self-supporting and to stand on its own legs.  If it is not, it is not to be set up at all.  Therefore, I hope it will have the unanimous support of the Fianna Fáil Party, who claim to stand for self-sufficiency.  This is going to give self-sufficiency a chance in practice. These farms are to be self-supporting and are to differ from other farms run by the Department in that respect.  The farms that are run by the Department have included in their activities, as we know, various other branches, such as research and experiment, and it is therefore impossible for them to give a fair trial to the wisdom of the lessons being taught by the agricultural instructors throughout the country.  So long as they are not able to demonstrate and carry into practice the lessons they are teaching to the farmers and to show that they are profitable, farmers will not follow the advice given.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that the first <Col N="1510" /> requisite for a teacher is to secure the confidence of his pupils.  The teacher who is teaching children must impress his pupils with the belief that he is competent to teach, and, when it comes to a question of teaching people who are grown up, he requires to a greater extent so to impress these people.  In addition, these grown-up pupils, the farmers, have methods of their own.  Naturally, they are conservative, and they will not throw away their present methods until they are taught that the methods they are to substitute are better than the methods they at present work on. Therefore, before these agricultural instructors can secure the confidence of those farmers and induce them to unlearn what they have learned in the school of practice, it will be necessary for them to show that the proposed methods are likely to pay them and that the adoption of these methods mean not merely that they will produce more and a better quality of agricultural produce, but that it will pay them to do so.</P>
    <P>It must be a matter of business. Any man who goes into business naturally looks to whether he is going to get a living or not and whether it is going to give him a return for his expenditure, his labour and his interest.  The farmer is not any different from any other class.  He has to get a living and he wants to get the best living possible.  If a farmer is convinced that it is going to pay him to adopt a certain method in the practice of his industry, if he is convinced that it will pay him a profit or increase the profit he already has, very little force will be required to induce him to adopt that system.</P>
    <P>The two main functions of the Department of Agriculture are research and education.  So far as research is concerned, I am quite sure that the Department's farms, as they are run at present, are quite sufficient for that purpose and, therefore, it will be unnecessary for these farms to carry out any research work; but so far as education is concerned, as I said before, the people to be educated must have confidence and they must realise that the men who are to teach them <Col N="1511" /> are competent to make a profit out of farming themselves.  They must show that they are better able to run these farms than the farmers in the country. Another requisite for the successful teaching of farmers is the systematising of the arrangement for demonstration plots and its reduction to a comprehensive scheme under which all necessary branches will be included in the one farm.  If you teach piecemeal certain things through a demonstration plot, the instructor may be able to prove that a certain manure, or a certain mixture of manure, will produce better crops of oats or turnips or potatoes; he may also teach that a certain mixture of grain will get better results in the feeding of pigs.  He may demonstrate that a certain ration will get better results in feeding cattle and producing milk, etc.  But when these things are learned piecemeal, the average farmer is not in any position to piece them all together and work out a system of agriculture from the scrappy information thus conveyed.</P>
    <P>If there are difficulties, and I admit there will be little difficulties in putting this into practice, the difficulties should be taken up by the men competent to do so, namely, the instructors in agriculture, and not by men who are incompetent, some of whom are uneducated, who have not time to study these things, who have, perhaps, a prejudice in favour of their own system, and are not, perhaps, disposed to change the system unless it is reduced to such a practical form that they can see for themselves the whole thing put into operation and see the results.  Everybody is looking for results at present in every walk of life. Naturally the farmers want to see results&mdash;what is to be got out of it. They want to see if the methods recommended by the Department's instructors are better than those they have been operating themselves.</P>
    <P>The Department has been operating for the last 30 or 40 years&mdash;I do not know exactly for how long.  At any rate, it has not advanced one step.  It has shown nothing through these demonstrations that was not shown 30 years ago.  Any branch of industry, <Col N="1512" /> or any undertaking that does not go forward, must be going backwards. There is no such thing as standing still in this world.  Since the Department is not advancing, not making any progress in any direction, it must be going back.  I hardly know of one farmer who bothers his head writing for a leaflet because there is hardly anything new in the leaflets.  I have been living in a district for 25 years and an agricultural instructor was only once invited to that district for a lecture since I went there, and I was responsible for having him invited.  The suggestion never came from anybody else. If that is the attitude of the farmers everybody can see that there is something required to make the Department officers more popular, and to bring their instructions more into favour with the farmers.  That is what they are for.</P>
    <P>We must remember that practically £1,000,000 is voted by this House for the running of that Department, and it is most desirable that it should be turned to the best account, and that the best results should be secured by the officers of the Department.  They are men in whom I have great confidence if they get a chance.  They are quite competent to teach.  I believe they could do great service to the country.  But there is only one way to teach, and that is the practical way; and the practical way is the way I suggest.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go into the details of the scheme.  I may not be competent to do that, and it is not necessary at this stage.  The Department have officers who are quite competent to go into this and devise a suitable scheme.  If they want any assistance Deputy O'Donovan, whose name is also to this motion, will be glad to give any assistance.  He is much more competent than I am to deal with the subject.  He understands the subject and I am sure if he is called upon he will assist in working out the details.  I do not believe there will be any difficulty about them.  Where there is a will there is a way.  If the will is there there will be no trouble in getting over any difficulties which may present themselves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1513" /> I only propose to give a rough idea of the object in view.  The object is really to show, when the accounts are made up at the end of the farming year, that there is a profit to be got out of these farms, and that by adopting the methods recommended and carried out on these farms other farms can increase their profits.  The real object, in other words, is to show that there is money in farming, that there is money in doing things in an up-to-date manner.  If it is shown that there is gold in the farms as well as in Wicklow, you will have farmers going from one end of the county to the other to see how it is to be got out.  Possibly, you will have Deputies and Senators, who were never on a farm before, taking up farming with the best intentions. I have no doubt that they will be able to satisfy any impartial committee that they are actuated with the best and the most patriotic motives and are out to give employment.  There is no question that no member of the Fianna Fáil Party will want to stump the country telling the farmers from political platforms to do such-and-such a thing, to grow this and that.  There is no necessity.  It is a humiliating thing for the Minister to be lecturing farmers who will not attend his meetings because they have no confidence in him.  On the other hand, his subordinates, who are competent and command the respect and confidence of farmers, could do the work.</P>
    <P>The Department's officers in every county will be only too delighted to carry out this work, although it will impose a good deal of extra labour on them, if the Minister treats them generously. I suggest he should do so by giving them a decent percentage of the profits of the farms.  I would not be stingy with them.  They will put their hearts into their work and go into the work in earnest.  Then the remainder of the profits can go to the Department and help to pay its expenses Not only will these officers have an inducement to work, and to show by their methods, and by the practical operation of these farms, that their teaching is sound, but they can, at the same time, prove that the Minister's teaching is sound, that the Minister's schemes, which he recommends <Col N="1514" /> to the country, are all that is to be desired.  The people will believe them when they will doubt the Minister. Besides, it will be much more dignified for the Minister to let these competent men do their own work and save himself all the unnecessary trouble to which he puts himself.  One thing I must say of the Minister and the members on the Front Bench is that they are not lazy and that they certainly work hard.  The Minister has shown that he is prepared to adopt any number of schemes and to take on plenty of work.  This scheme will not, I think, increase his work; if it does it will be worth more than the increased work imposed upon him.  It will increase the work of his subordinate officials, but they will be only too glad because it will increase their remuneration. For that reason, I hope the Minister will accept this scheme wholeheartedly and give it a fair chance.</P>
    <P>I suppose a number of difficulties will arise in the minds of some people in this connection.  I have heard people ask how the land is to be got. They have asked me, &ldquo;Do you favour taking over the land from the people?&rdquo; No, I do not, nor do I favour, as a practice, the Government taking up farming.  I believe that private companies or private individuals can conduct any business better than a Government Department can.  It is only for the purpose of demonstration that I would like to see the Department take up these farms and run them.  It is possible for farmers through the country to run one, two or three farms in normal times and make a profit on the running.  That being the case, there is no reason why trained experts could not run them, pay a decent wage, preserve decent conditions of employment, and show a profit.  They should be quite competent to do it.  If the average farmer is able to make a small profit after paying all his bills, then it is quite reasonable to assume that these experts should be able to make a very much increased profit and to set a headline for the farmers through the country, to the benefit of the neighbouring farmers and the community at large.</P>
    <P>There are many ways in which the <Col N="1515" /> Department could acquire land.  They might buy it in the open market by public auction or by private negotiations. They could take it on lease. They could take land from men having derelict farms.  Such men would give the Department a lease of the farms for a number of years and would also be glad themselves to be employed.  Some of them are competent workmen who, through lack of capital or for some other reason, are not themselves able to make good.  It would be open to the Department to choose any of these courses which would not interfere with the right of any individual.  In short, I do not think there would be any difficulty at all about securing the land.</P>
    <P>Then as to the class of farm that would be most suitable, as regards size and quality in each county, I suggest it would be the average for that particular county.  For instance, in Cavan, the average farm would be from 20 to 40 acres.  In another county, it might be a much larger-sized farm and so on.  By taking the average farm in size and quality, it would give a fair test and a fair outline of how that class of farm should be run.  Its working would be followed with the keenest interest by every farmer in the country.  The people would go there and they would see how the thing was being done.  It would be of course necessary that accounts should be kept and that the farm accounts and the farm itself should be open at certain times for inspection by all interested. In this way I submit that a great benefit could be conferred upon the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty that might arise would be the provision of capital. To some people that appears a very big difficulty, but I do not see anything insurmountable at all there. We have the Agricultural Credit Corporation which lends money to farmers, the money being repaid over a number of years.  I am quite sure they would offer the same facilities to the Department because the chances of repayment are more certain <Col N="1516" /> from the Department than from some farmers to whom they lend.  I am sure they could lend money on the same terms as they lend it to the farmers&mdash;6 per cent., plus the cost of drawing up the agreement, plus 2/- or something like that for keeping the accounts.  That would work out at something less than 6½ per cent.&mdash; the same terms as those at which the farmer borrows money.</P>
    <P>When the Department buy the land, buy the stock, and machinery and erect buildings, they could get the money from the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  It is necessary that these experts should be put on equal terms with the farmers before the profit they show at the end of the year can be compared with the profit made by the farmers.  The first item of course to come out of the profits of these farms would be the 6½ per cent. or whatever figure it would work out at for the interest on the capital sum invested in the land. machinery, stock, buildings, and so on.  There might be a sum set aside for depreciation, but I think in this case there will be no depreciation. I expect that the land would be improved and that the buildings would show an improvement too.  For that reason that item might be left out.  There should be something set aside for insurance, repairs, tariffs, and wages.  I am not sure whether the tariffs should come before wages or the wages before tariffs.  I propose to put the wages before tariffs because the tariffs are only a temporary thing&mdash;at least we hope so.  As soon as there is a change of Government there will be a change of policy and tariffs will disappear.  The second item would be rates and annuities. Rates are also to disappear as soon as there is a change of Government for agricultural land will be derated so that these two items will be taken off, and we will not have to provide for tariffs or rates.</P>

      <P>The importance of the thing about these accounts is that they should be left open at all times, or at all reasonable times, for inspection by the public.  The farms should be open for inspection so that people may go there and learn what is being done. The farmers would be glad to see how things would be done by an expert and how the best results can be achieved in every branch of farming.  Sometimes farmers do not take an interest in lectures.  When these lectures are applied in practice, when they see the theory translated into practice, it would be a different matter.  When theories are put into practice, the results are worth studying. Without any experiments or anything like that, they are confined to one thing.  Make them a commercial proposition and let them endeavour, the same as any average farmer does, to secure the greatest profit they possibly can.  That should be the object of these farms, to secure the greatest profit and keep the farms in the best possible condition, buildings and so on, and be in a position to meet the liabilities, the interest to the Credit Corporation, pay the rate renewals, overhead charges, wages and show a <Col N="1518" /> profit.  That would be the real acid test of the success of these farms.</P>
      <P>About a year ago I asked the Minister if he intended to take over average farms in different counties and run them under the supervision of Departmental experts.  In the course of correspondence I had with the Minister he promised he would give it careful consideration. In his reply he said he had given careful consideration to the suggestion that the State should acquire and run farms in various parts of the country for demonstration purposes, but he was convinced that the adoption of the suggestion was undesirable.  He said the forms which were already conducted by the Department were sufficient for educational and experimental purposes.  I quite agree they are sufficient for experimental purposes, but surely they are not sufficient for educational purposes? So long as the farmers are not prepared to follow the instructions and the headlines set on those farms, it is impossible for them to learn anything.  There is an agricultural farm in County Cavan, but I never heard of farmers going to see how things were done there, because they say they learn nothing from them.  The same may be said of other counties, such as Galway. The reason is that these farms are run at a loss.</P>
      <P>The Dáil votes good money for the upkeep of these farms every year, and so long as this money is being given for the running of these farms there can be no practical lesson learned from them.  Farmers who want to lose money might go to learn something there, but no farmer wants to lose money except young gentlemen who want to adopt farming as a hobby. Such a man might use up-to-date methods and not care whether he gained or lost on the transaction.  The average farmer wants to make a little money and he has to be sure that the new system is one that will enable him to make money.  So long as farmers find that the farms kept by the Department are being run at a loss, they become more or less suspicious that if they adopt the same measures it would lead to the same results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the education the Minister <Col N="1519" /> referred to is concerned, these farms are no use for educational purposes. But the farms recommended in this motion would have an educational effect, and I feel sure the methods practised on such farms would be adopted widely.  Every farmer is looking for results and he is not going to accept things on hearsay.  He is not going to take the word of an instructor or anyone else who says that if he does so-and so he will be better off.  The farmer wants practical proof, and I think he is quite right.  Another objection may be that the Department's officers are too busy.  They will be busy at something that will be very useful if they are engaged on this work.  There are many people in the country as busy as the Department's officials, people engaged at one activity or another, and they can find time to run a couple of farms, and some of them do it at a considerable profit.  For instance, Deputy Belton is a busy man.  He attends Dáil Eireann and many meetings, and I believe he has one of the best run farms in Ireland.  He can find time to do that, and there is no reason why agricultural experts should not make themselves similarly active.  They have motor cars and they can move from one farm to another.  They can direct operations and advise the man in charge how to do certain things, how to manage this field, how to deal with cattle, how to feed pigs, how to arrange manuring and do all the other kinds of work that are carried out on a farm.  They should teach them especially how to keep accounts.  They will have no trouble getting competent workmen well able to carry out their instructions.</P>
    <P>All the apparent difficulties will disappear like snow before the summer's sun as soon as the Minister puts a workable scheme into practice and directs his officers to enter into the thing in an earnest fashion.  I know some of the Department's officers who are doing work that could be done by any menial clerk.  I think it is a terrible waste to have competent, valuable men losing time on work that could be done by a clerk at 30/- a week.  They should instead turn their services to better account from the <Col N="1520" /> point of view of agriculture.  Some of the things they teach are not calculated to impress farmers with their wisdom or the success of their methods.  I will give you one example: I referred to it here before.  It is a thing the Department has been trying to broadcast.  The Department has gone to considerable expense in order to spread the information to the farming community and perhaps the oftener it is brought before the country the better.  I went to the Spring Show in May, 1934, and I called to the Department's section. There was a demonstration given there and I propose to refer to it briefly.  Two lots of cattle were exhibited in the Department's section. They were fed on the following daily ration:&mdash;7 lb. hay, 28 lb. silage and 2 lb. crushed oats.  The daily gain in live-weight was ¾ lb. for one lot and 1 lb. for the other lot.  The Department set out to demonstrate that fact and for what purpose?  Was it to encourage the production of cattle or to discourage it?</P>

What I want on those farms is practical proof that the theory which is recommended to the farmer by the experts who are paid good salaries under the Department is capable of being put into practice.  I want them to show that they themselves can do what they want others to do.  I want them to show that they can make a profit on it, and to point out to the farmers that they can make a living by carrying out those lessons which they teach.  According to the experiment which I referred to as one example it would be impossible to pay wages; it would be impossible to pay annuities, rent, rates or any of those things.  By that example I was going to prove that the crushed oats, the hay and the silage would go for nothing, <Col N="1526" /> and that they would be 4d. at a loss after paying insurance and paying a man to attend to the cattle.  That is the whole thing I wanted to prove. Does anyone expect that farmers who went to that Dublin show and saw those things proved are going to adopt those practices?  I think that the time is ripe for the Department to adopt a new method.  If they were conducting those farms, as is suggested in this motion, that experiment would never be put into practice, because it would mean a dead loss of 7 cwt. of hay, 28 cwt. of silage and 2 cwt. of crushed oats, as well as 4d. over and above.</P>

      <P>I have the figures here, and I will quote them for the House, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle.  I am referring to a demonstration given by the Department at the Spring Show, 1934.  Two lots of cattle were exhibited in the Department's section.  They were fed on the following daily ration: 7 lb. of hay, 28 lb. of silage and 2 lb. of crushed oats.  The daily gain in live weight was ¾ lb. for one lot and 1 lb. daily for the other lot.  For 112 days the gain in live weight would be ¾ cwt. and 1 cwt. respectively.  The average price at that time was less than £1 per cwt. for live cattle; that meant 15/- in the case of one lot and £1 in the case of the other lot to pay for 112 days' food.  Suppose a farm to feed 48 cattle; land, buildings, machinery and stock costing £1,000, borrowed from the Credit Corporation at 6 per cent. per annum.</P>

      <P>That would mean £60 per annum to meet the interest on the Credit Corporation loan, and that would be the first thing necessary for any honest farmer to do.  He would have to find £60 per annum, and the proportion of that for the 112 days would be roughly £20.  Apportioning the £20, it would be 8/4 on each of the <Col N="1527" /> 48 animals, to provide the money to pay the Credit Corporation like an honest man.  He would then have to pay a man 4/- per day to attend those cattle; that is 1d. per beast for the 112 days, which would work out at 9/4. Insurance to cover each beast for the same period would amount to 2/8. That would work out at £1 0s. 4d., which would be 4d. of a loss on the best lot and 5/4 on the other.  That is what the Department were showing at the agricultural show at Ballsbridge.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Acquisition of County Limerick Farm.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>To-day I asked the Minister for Lands the following question:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Lands if he will state on what grounds the Land Commission are acquiring the lands of Carrigkettle, Kilteely, County Limerick (Record No. 7706) from Mr. O'Carroll, Kilteely, County Limerick; if he is aware that the net resumption price to Mr. O'Carroll is less than one-fourth of the price paid by him for the farm in 1924, and that Mr. O'Carroll has three sons and two daughters some of whom he intended to settle on these lands.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister in his reply stated:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The lands of Carrigkettle are being acquired from Mr. Richard <Col N="1528" /> O'Carroll by the Land Commission for the purpose of relieving congestion. The price of these lands was, in default of agreement, fixed by the Appeal Tribunal.  Mr. O'Carroll's circumstances were fully considered at the hearing by the Land Commission of his objection to the acquisition of the lands.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In a supplementary question I asked: &ldquo;Is the Parliamentary Secretary satisfied that there is congestion in this particular district of East Limerick?&rdquo; and he said &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  I asked him further: &ldquo;Is the Parliamentary Secretary satisfied that Mr. O'Carroll farms his land in a proper manner and gives adequate employment?&rdquo; The Parliamentary Secretary did not deign to answer that, but he again reiterated that this is non-residential land which was required for the immediate relief of congestion in that area.  Then I asked the Parliamentary Secretary if he was satisfied that it was because of political reasons that this farm was taken from Mr. O'Carroll.  The Parliamentary Secretary was rather horrified at that suggestion.  I am loath to attribute political motives to the Parliamentary Secretary, but it seems to me that is the only conceivable reason for the action of the Land Commission and the Ministry which advised it on this particular matter.  Here is a man owning a fairly comfortably sized farm with a family of five.  During the régime of the late Government, in order to provide, as a man is entitled to provide, for some of his children, he purchased this extra farm in the open market for a sum of £3,030.  The Ministry, through the Land Commission, aequired that farm, and the net sum Mr. O'Carroll is to be paid for the farm amounts only to £718.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will, perhaps, make an attempt to justify the action taken in this matter, but I hope that he will give some other reason than.  If there is any district in which you might say there is least congestion in Ireland, it is East Limerick.  I do not say there are not poor people in East Limerick or that there are not people who want land in East Limerick, but nobody could describe East Limerick as one of the congested districts of this country. <Col N="1529" /> Above all, if there was congestion in East Limerick, nobody could say that seizing 38 acres is going to make any inroads on that congestion.  If that is the only reason the Parliamentary Secretary can give, then I am justified in assuming that there were politics behind this action.  We were time and again assured during the passage of the Land Bill through the House that there would be little interference with the ordinary farmer, and the Government even gave an undertaking during these debates that they would not take land from any man who held it for the purpose of providing for his sons. When we raised the question, as several of us did, that the farmer's title to his land was endangered by the Bill, we were met by repeated assertions of many Ministers that there was no danger.  I could quote numerous statements of that kind, but perhaps one will suffice.  The Minister in charge of the Bill, the Minister for Defence (Mr. Aiken), is reported in Volume 49, col. 1370-71, as saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I endeavoured to put in black and white the policy of the Government and the policy which the Land Commission would carry out under the direction of the Government. Fianna Fáil and the Government are as anxious as Deputies in any part of the House could be to relieve the minds of people who might be disturbed by talk of disturbance.  We have in Section 36 a declaration of policy that will hold good permanently. We set out that so long as a man is providing adequate employment&mdash;taking the situation of the whole country into consideration&mdash;or is producing á sufficient amount of food supplies&mdash;again taking the situation in the country into consideration&mdash;that man shall not be disturbed in the use of his land.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If there was any value to be set on the Minister's assurances, then we had it defined here that a man who worked his land properly, who grew a sufficient amount of food on his land, and who gave an adequate amount of employment on his land, no matter whether the farm was big or small, was to be secured in possession.  We have here the position that the Parliamentary <Col N="1530" /> Secretary does not deny that this man was using his land to the best advantage and was employing adequate labour.  On this holding of 38 Irish acres, this man has a dairy farm.  He has 20 cows, and, in addition, 12 or 13 dry stock.  He had sufficient tillage on the land to provide for the cattle.  If he is not farming well, under the conditions which obtain in County Limerick, then no other farmer there is farming well.  The Minister cannot justify the action of the Land Commission on the ground that he is not farming well or that he is not giving adequate employment.  This is the real answer as to the security of title of any man on his own land, be he a large farmer or a small farmer in this country.</P>
    <P>The second point that arises on this matter is the value of the land acquired from a man.  I said that there was little title to the land, but what is the value of whatever little possessive right a man has to-day.  We were assured time and again during the discussions on the Land Bill that people would get an adequate price for their land.  We attempted at several periods during the discussion to drag out of the Minister what that adequate compensation would be.  I could quote again several instances, but a couple will suffice.  According to column 1340 volume 49, Deputy Haslett asked:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Will the standard price be the price that the Land Commission can give so that the allottees will be able to pay or will it be the average price of land in the district purchased in the open market?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence, Mr. Aiken, who was in charge of the Bill, replied:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As the Deputy seems anxious, I might mention that land taken under this section (28) will be taken over at market value.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again, according to column 141, volume 49, Mr. Finlay asked:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;What price will the Commissioners pay for land they take over?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Dr. Ryan, the Minister for Agriculture, in reply, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The market value.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Was not that a clear and implied promise by two Ministers to this House <Col N="1531" /> that if land was taken, that if they broke the farmer's title to his land and took his land that they would compensate him fully for it and give him the fair market value of it.  Here we have the case of this unfortunate man going into the open market and investing practically his life's savings&mdash;perhaps more than his life's savings&mdash;of £3,030 for this farm of land, and then the Government direct the Land Commission to acquire the land and pay him the niggardly sum of £718 for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that any elaboration of this act of the Government's is needless, and that I have sufficiently demonstrated to Deputies what has been done to this man.  If ever there was an instance of a promise given in this House to Deputies being broken, it was in this case.  If ever there was an injustice perpetrated it was in this case.  I hope that when the Parliamentary Secretary comes to reply, that he will give the House some other reason for what has been done in this case than that of congestion in this county.  If there is congestion, then 38 Irish acres or 59 statute acres are not going to make any big hole in that congestion.  It must be some other reason that actuated the Ministry in taking the action they did.  When the Land Act of 1933 was going through the Dáil, I made a speech on the Second Reading of the measure.  I ventured to describe it as &ldquo;an eviction-cum-plunder Bill,&rdquo; and I added that the famous three F's for which generations of Irish farmers fought under their Parliamentary leaders, the old Irish Party, were now being substituted by another set of F's.  I said that the sum and substance of that Bill was that the Minister and the Land Commission were being given powers under it to fleece, filch and forfeit.  Can the Parliamentary Secretary say now that I was wrong in what I then stated?  At least the farmers of the country know now where they stand as to the security of their title and as to the market value of the land that is going to be compulsorily acquired from them.</P>

      <P>The principal accusation in Deputy Bennett's remarks is one of political discrimination against a certain follower of his.  He went on to elaborate his case and say that this man was victimised because of his political affiliations.  This is a man who, in addition to the land which has been acquired from him, possesses another extensive farm of 103 acres with a total valuation of £122.  In addition, he possesses a business premises in the adjoining village.  Let me take the question of the labour employed.  Mr. O'Carroll stated in his evidence that the farm was worked for dairying and for some eight to ten heifers, and said 30 dairy cows were on it; that he employed one man in addition to his wife and family.  That was the extent of the employment which was given by this gentleman.</P>

      <P>On the question of congestion, if there is no land to be acquired except in the congested areas, how is the Land Commission to deal with the problem of congestion?  The arguments put forward by Deputy Bennett, on behalf of extensive farmers in the County Limerick, might easily be used on behalf of similar farmers in the County Meath and other counties where it is hoped, as well as in the County Limerick, to place congests on the land.  In the immediate vicinity of that holding which has been acquired, there were four cottiers, five smallholders, five landless young men, farmers' sons, and four farmers with holdings the valuation of which range from £4 to £10.</P>

      <P>Now I come to the groundless accusations of political victimisation.  As the Deputy is well aware, under sub-section (1) of Section 6, paragraph (a) of the Land Act of 1933, the question of &ldquo;The determination of the persons from whom land is to be acquired or resumed&rdquo; is an excepted matter.  Now, perhaps Deputy Bennett may have been misinformed, but this gentleman, I am afraid, is not as staunch a supporter of Deputy Bennett as the Deputy was led to believe.</P>

      <P>The Deputy can take that as a fact.  That disposes of the argument of political victimisation.  I think it reflects credit on the Deputies who so intervened, particularly when taken by way of contrast to the action pursued by Deputy Bennett who seeks to make political capital by making mean accusations of a kind which he knows cannot be sustained.</P>
