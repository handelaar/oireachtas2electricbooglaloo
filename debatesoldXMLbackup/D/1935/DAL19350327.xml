      <P>There are only two cases in the Supreme Court in which judgment is pending for more than 12 months, namely, the Governors, Erasmus Smith Schools v. the Attorney-General and others, and the Philadelphia Storage Battery Company v. the Controller af Commercial and Industrial Property and another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that the law relating to the conditions of employment in wholesale and retail shops is antiquated and for the most part obsolete; whether there are any legal restrictions on the number of hours during which adult shop workers may be employed, and whether in fact many such persons are working continually for 70 and more hours per week; and whether in these circumstances it is his intention to introduce proposals for legislation at an early date for the purpose of regulating the hours of work of shop assistants, to provide for a weekly half-holiday for all shop-workers, and to establish machinery, in consultation with the trade unions concerned, for the regulation of minimum wages for commercial employees generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) (for Minister for Industry and Commerce)</NameTxt>
      <P>Representations have been made to me that the law relating to the conditions of employment in wholesale and retail shops is antiquated and in part obsolete.  There are no legal restrictions on the number of hours during which adult shop workers may be employed save in the case of one trade, but my attention has not been drawn to any case in which persons are working continuously for 70 and more hours per week.</P>
      <P>As regards the last part of the question, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a question addressed to me on the 28th February last, in which I indicated that consideration is being given to the introduction of proposals for legislation to control and regulate the hours and conditions of employment of shop assistants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes (for Tadhg O Murchadha)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that Garret Boland, Cooleregan, Mitchelstown, County Cork, was requested by letter to report personally at the Employment Exchange at Fermoy on <Col N="1469" /> Tuesday, March 12th, in connection with his application for unemployment assistance; whether it is a fact that due to unsatisfactory postal arrangements the notification did not reach Mr. Boland until late on the evening of March 12th, and that he actually reported on the morning of March 13th, but was informed that benefit could not be paid to him on the ground that he failed to report on the date named in the notification from the Employment Exchange; whether he is aware that Mr. Boland resides over 12 miles from the Exchange, and that he has travelled that distance on seven occasions, but without being able to obtain payment of the benefit to which he is entitled, and if he will state why the benefit due in this case was not paid, and under what regulations Mr. Boland is required to travel a distance of 12 miles to prove his title to benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts of this case are as follows: It became necessary to settle certain questions which arose on an application for unemployment assistance made by Garrett Boland at the branch employment office, Fermoy, in order that payment of assistance might be made to him.  To this end the branch manager wrote to Mr. Boland on two occasions for certain information but to neither communication did Mr. Boland reply, and the branch manager then suggested to him that it might be more satisfactory for him to call at the branch office to furnish the required information in person. Mr. Boland did so, and in consequence his claim was cleared for payment, which was made to him as soon as practicable.  Mr. Boland is not required to attend at the branch office, Fermoy, to claim or to receive payment of unemployment assistance and he did so on the occasion in question, presumably because he preferred to do so rather than furnish the information required by post.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <P>Payment of unemployment assistance on claims lodged by James Creegan and Patrick Murray has been suspended pending inquiries into the circumstances of their cases. Until these inquiries are completed it will not be possible to resume payment of assistance to either applicant. The investigation is proceeding with all possible speed.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether any of the directors of the Industrial Trust Company of Ireland, Limited, now in liquidation, visited the United States of America at any time for the purpose of canvassing American investors to subscribe for shares in the company; if so, who were the directors in question; whether he can state if these visits to America were undertaken with the cognisance and consent of the then Government, and whether he is prepared to make available the reports <Col N="1471" /> submitted to the company by the directors in question on the result of their canvass.</P>

      <P>Prior to the formation of the Industrial Trust Company of Ireland, Limited, Senator Douglas and Mr. Smith Gordon&mdash;who subsequently became directors of the Industrial Trust Company of Ireland&mdash;visited the United States of America and while there canvassed prominent American businessmen to ascertain what support would be forthcoming for a company floated with Government assistance to promote industrial development in the Irish Free State. These visits may be said to have taken place with the cognisance and the consent of the Government of the day in the sense that the Government was aware of the visits and raised no objection to the inquiries which were being made; the visits were not, however, made primarily for the purpose of securing support for the flotation of a trust company and were not made on the suggestion of the Government.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Thomas and Bernard Keenan, of Clonalig, Crossmaglen, County Armagh, were fined £100 each at Dundalk District Court on 19th September last, under Section 186 of the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, for being knowingly concerned in a fraudulent attempt at evasion of payment of duty on fowl imported into Saorstát Eireann on 10th September. The penalties were subsequently mitigated by the Revenue Commissioners to £2 10s. 0d. in each case, and these amounts have been duly recovered.  It is not in the public interest to disclose the grounds on which the power to mitigate Customs penalties has been exercised, nor to disclose any particulars as to whether or not information was received by the Revenue Commissioners in any particular case.  The Commissioners' powers as to payment of rewards are based upon Section 32 of the Inland Revenue Regulation Act, 1890, the Excise Transfer Order, 1909, paragraph 23, the Revenue Commissioners Order, 1923, and the Customs and Excise (Adaptation of Enactments) Order, 1924.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he can state the area under tobacco cultivation in 1934 and the area which it is anticipated will be cultivated in 1935; whether it is a fact that in many instances the produce of an acre of tobacco of the 1934 crop has yielded to the producer not more than £7, and that in rare cases only was the yield more than £15 per acre; whether he is in a position to state the cost of labour, seeds, manure and marketing involved in the growing, curing and marketing of an acre of tobacco, and whether he can indicate that the method of calculating the price payable to persons engaged in tobacco cultivation will be revised so as to obtain a reasonable recompense for the labour expended and the outlay incurred in tobacco production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The area under tobacco cultivation by licensed tobacco growers in 1934 was, approximately, 1,050 acres. Licences to grow tobacco in 1935, to the extent of some 1,350 acres, have been recommended by me to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will not be possible to ascertain the actual return to the growers from tobacco of the 1934 crop until the crop has been rehandled, bonded and finally valued.  Any sums already paid to growers are merely advances on account based on the preliminary <Col N="1474" /> valuation of each grower's crop when received by the rehandler.</P>
    <P>The cost of growing, curing and marketing an acre of tobacco averages about £25.  I am satisfied that the present method of determining the price payable to persons engaged in tobacco cultivation will provide a reasonable recompense to any grower who carries out the growing and curing of his tobacco in a proper manner.</P>

    <P>The object of this scheme is to enable national teachers who become secondary teachers to get credit for their service as primary teachers by transferring to the Secondary Teachers' Superannuation Fund amounts corresponding to the premiums which formerly they were entitled to transfer from the National Teachers' Pension Fund to the Secondary Teachers' Pension Fund.  On account of the fact that last year an end was put to the contributions as such from the national teachers to their pensions, there are now no contributions and this scheme gives power to teachers who had been national teachers but who become secondary teachers to ask the Minister for Finance to transfer to the Secondary Teachers' Superannuation Fund proportions of their salaries from the 31st March, 1934, equivalent to their former pension contribution, that is to say, 4 per cent.  In other words, the object of the scheme is to make certain adjustments consequent on the fact that there are now no pension contributions as such chargeable to national teachers. The scheme deals only with this single matter of adjustment necessary to enable national teachers who become secondary teachers to get credit for their services as national teachers.  The adjustments necessary are mentioned in paragraph 5 of this scheme chiefly.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister a question?  Is it right to assume that if a change had not taken place last year as to the contributions from the national teachers to the Pension Fund, those proposed changes <Col N="1481" /> now would put the national teachers who would become secondary teachers in exactly the same position as before?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I think that is substantially the case.  There may be minor matters.  For example, the operation of the scheme has taken into account that rather hypothetical circumstance in which the teacher might have left the service, or the teacher might have left the service twice and re-entered as a secondary teacher.  It is in order to cover these exceptional circumstances that the scheme is framed as it is.  I think Deputy Thrift has summarised the position.  The national teachers will be in exactly the same position as they were before the new superannuation scheme was introduced.</P>

      <P>Will this scheme have any effect on the junior assistant mistresses who until recently had no pensionable rights?  I understand that they have now pensionable rights.  In the event of their taking up secondary teaching will the entire period of their service as junior assistant mistresses count, or will that period which elapsed between the time when they were made pensionable and the end of their period as junior assistant mistresses be the only time that will be taken into consideration?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The position of junior assistant mistresses is regulated under the national teachers' superannuation scheme published last year.  If junior assistant mistresses have already transferred to the secondary branch and are teaching as secondary teachers, their cases are covered.  In my opinion, it is extremely unlikely that junior assistant mistresses would be qualified to become secondary teachers.  One has to be registered and to have put in a certain number of years' service as a secondary teacher before one can become registered.  I should be greatly surprised if there are cases of junior assistant mistresses who are able to transfer without improving their qualifications very considerably. I shall look into the matter.  I think the case is extremely unlikely <Col N="1482" /> to occur on account of the lack of qualifications of junior assistant mistresses.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is a bar, I think there is a special problem that might be assisted by a transfer from national teaching to secondary teaching. The Minister, I think, is aware that primary teachers only get any kind of systematic training through the medium of Irish, and that some systematic steps have been arranged for the training of primary teachers now, so that the primary school programme can be thoroughly taught in future through the medium of Irish. On the secondary side, there is a lamentable absence of any provision at all of that kind.  The material for the secondary schools teaching, I take it, comes from the University where they go through the usual University course, taking Irish as a subject, but arrangements for the training of the teaching material for secondary schools to teach through the medium of Irish do not exist at all, so that if the present scheme was going to be an inducement to a certain number of national school teachers to transfer, I think it would materially assist in improving the position with regard to teaching through the medium of Irish in the secondary schools.  If, as Deputy Thrift suggests, the effect is going to be the reverse, I think it is unfortunate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that under the original scheme of 1929 special provision was made in Clause 16 in relation to former national teachers who subsequently became secondary teachers, and the sole object of the changes in the scheme I am now proposing to the House is to <Col N="1483" /> adapt these provisions to the new circumstances, in which pension contributions are no longer payable as such. With regard to the other point which Deputy Mulcahy raised, I do not think it is quite relevant to the matter on hands.  I do not think this will be an inducement to national teachers to become secondary teachers.  It is an entirely different class of work and most national teachers would, I think, prefer to remain in the branch of the profession for which they have been trained and of which they have experience.</P>
      <P>The matter of the provision of persons competent to teach through Irish in the secondary schools is, I think, a matter which does not belong to my province.  It concerns the Universities, in the first instance, and, in the second instance, in relation to registered secondary teachers, it concerns the Registration Council.  I think the Registration Council have had their attention called to the matter by representatives of the Department of Education, and as regards the Universities the Deputy might be able to persuade them to improve their courses in such a way that Irish will at least be placed on the same basis as modern continental languages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rowlette asked me to move these amendments. They deal with the question of extra-territorial authority on the part of a medical officer of health, and it is one of those questions to which attention has been directed by the medical officer of health for Cork.  It was, I think, referred to last night at a meeting in University College and a strong representation was made in favour of the proposal embodied in the amendment. It is one of those cases in which the medical officer of the sanitary district may get a communication from outsiders regarding matters within his jurisdiction.  Generally, in connection with those matters one need not expect the major attention of a medical officer of health to representations made outside his district; the most that one could expect would be that his operations would be directed to such representations after he had done his own work.  This matter is sufficiently serious to merit the closest co-operation between the two and, in my own view it ought, by reason of co-operation between the two medical officers, to be effective, depending absolutely upon, let us say, the medical officer of health in Dublin visiting a dairy in Wicklow, in Meath, in Louth or in Kildare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1486" /> It is not an easy proposition to expect the medical officer of a sanitary district in those cases to operate immediately after getting a communication from the medical officer of health in Dublin seeking activity on the part of the local medical officer in respect of something which concerns a body outside his own immediate neighbourhood. It must get second place. With active co-operation between the medical officer of a sanitary district in which the dairy is situated and the medical officer of the district in which the milk is sold, fewer communications will fall to be made and it might be expected that, if this Bill be worked energetically and cordially, those diseases which can be exterminated will be exterminated within a short period and then only ordinary normal inspection will be called for.  The main use of this Bill will depend entirely upon that active co-operation of the various officials of local authorities which will make for its success and, in the beginning, it is quite possible that more than the usual amount of work will fall to be done.</P>
    <P>In that case it appears to be a mistake to limit the jurisdiction of the medical officer of health in the district in which milk is sold from outlying districts. It seems a pity to limit his jurisdiction to the area of the place of which he is medical officer.  It is rather a pity Deputy Rowlette cannot be here, but these are amendments which normally, having regard to the views expressed by the medical officer of health of Cork, I would have put down myself.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Cosgrave has explained, these amendments are intended to give powers of extra-territorial inspection to the medical officer of an urban district in case of an outbreak of infections disease in such district, attributable to milk from a dairy outside the district.  A good deal more could have been said in favour of this amendment when the original Bill was before the House.  Perhaps within the terms of that Bill a convincing case could have been made for incorporating such an amendment in the legislation. But the registration of dairymen and <Col N="1487" /> all purveyors of milk considerably alters the position.  There appears to be no necessity for taking this power, seeing that every urban district will be subject to the supervision of the county medical officer of health as medical superintendent officer of health of the district, and the county medical officer of health will be in charge also of the rural areas in the county.  In the case of a county borough it will be possible for the medical superintendent officer of health to rely on the county medical officer of health of the outside district to conduct any examinations that may be necessary.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the amendment must have been based on the assumption that the dispensary doctor would be the medical officer of health.  His jurisdiction as the medical officer of the sanitary authority would be confined to his own dispensary district, but in Section 7 the expression &ldquo;the medical officer&rdquo; means (a) when used in relation to a sanitary district which is a county borough, the medical superintendent officer of health for such county borough or the person for the time being acting as such medical superintendent officer of health, and (b) when used in relation to any other sanitary district, the county medical officer of health who acts for such district, or the person for the time being acting as such county medical officer of health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I stated previously in relation to the administration of this Bill when it becomes an Act, we hope shortly to have county medical officers of health in all the counties.  Steps are being taken by the local authorities in all the outstanding counties but one to have these appointments made, and necessary pressure is being put on the one county that has not of its own accord taken action in the matter, to secure uniformity in relation to these appointments. In the light of the fact that the county medical officer of health will be medical officer of the sanitary district and that he will be the officer administering the Act for both the urban and rural authorities, it seems to me that the necessity for this amendment cannot very well be established. <Col N="1488" /> Apart from the fact that the dairyman will be registered with the sanitary authority in the district in which he has his dairy, he will also have to be registered if he purveys milk in a sanitary district outside the district in which his dairy is situated, so that in any event he will come under the direct supervision of the county medical officer of health.  If he does not purvey milk in his own district he will come under the direct control of two sanitary authorities and their medical officer of health.</P>
    <P>Apart from these aspects of the case, I doubt very much if the extra-territorial powers of inspection that Deputy Cosgrave has in mind would secure the better co-operation to which he has referred.  It would appear to me that if the county medical officer of health of one county were to go into a neighbouring county and, perhaps, adopt a critical attitude as to the manner in which the medical officer of health in that county was discharging his duties, instead of securing that closer co-operation we could very well secure a certain amount of friction.  The Bill provides that where a medical officer of health has reason to suspect that disease is attributable to milk that is produced in a sanitary district outside his area, he will request the county medical officer of health of that district to examine the dairy and take such steps as may be necessary to establish definitely whether such milk is responsible for the outbreak of infectious disease.</P>
    <P>I think that under the scheme as set out in Section 38, and in the light of the principle of registration that has now been incorporated in the Bill, we have a better machine, a machine that will work more smoothly and with much less liability of friction between neighbouring county medical officers of health than we would have if we adopted powers of extra-territorial inspection.  Consequently, I feel that it would be unwise to accept this amendment and I will have to ask the House to reject it.</P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment No. 19:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before section 40 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  any milk, which is kept by a dairyman for the purposes of being sold, becomes infected with a disease to which this Part of this Act applies, and</P>
      <P>(b)  any person who is employed by such dairyman for the purposes of his business as a dairyman, while such milk was so kept by such dairyman, either knew or had reasonable grounds for suspecting that such milk had become so infected, and</P>
      <P>(c)  such person fails or neglects to inform such dairyman forthwith of such knowledge or grounds of suspicion,</P>
      <P>such person shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof, in the case of a first offence under this section, to a fine not exceeding five pounds, and in the case of a second or any subsequent offence to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds or to imprisonment for any term not exceeding six months or to both such fine and imprisonment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this new section, to be inserted before Section 40, is to secure that a dairyman's employee will inform him of any case in which the milk becomes infected with disease within that employee's knowledge.  An amendment similar to this was tabled <Col N="1490" /> by Deputy Cosgrave when the Bill was originally before the House and I had intended incorporating the principle in the new draft, but it came to be overlooked.  To meet the case made by Deputy Cosgrave on that occasion, this amendment is now being inserted.  I think it will be a definite improvement of the Bill.</P>

The phraseology &ldquo;within 14 days after ceasing to be so infected,&rdquo; appears to me to be rather dangerous, inasmuch as it would be very difficult to establish when the 14 days should begin and end or when a man should be deemed to have ceased to be so infected.  It is a matter of drafting for all practical purposes, and these three amendments have been put down with a view to being specific and getting away from the complications that might arise from differences of opinion as to when a person ceased to be infected.</P>

      <P>On Section 50.  There seems to be no payment for any samples taken.  The Parliamentary Secretary probably knows that in the case of contracts there are sometimes penal provisions in respect of the non-delivery of a given quantity, and even though the amount might be small it could be sometimes held that a lesser quantity than the given quantity would lay a person open to the penal provision.  Take a case in which there is a rush, such as the Horse Show or some time like that, if a series of samples were to be taken, it might produce a difficult situation, and I presume that if they are not going to pay for the sample some discretion will be exercised so as not to take an unusual number of samples.  For instance, an individual might have a sample taken in his own sanitary district.  Another could be taken at the railroad, and again on arrival in Dublin.  That would be three sets of samples in the one case.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will look into that.</P>

However, I shall look into the matter.</P>

      <P>Speaking on this section, perhaps it will save the time of the House to raise the general question of the procedure to be followed in preparing samples for examination. Doubtless, cases have been brought to the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary from England where extraordinary discrepancies arose between the results of tests carried out by different pathologists on samples of milk which had been divided into two or three parts, and it was suggested in some technical papers that these discrepancies arose from the fact that one examiner took particularly vigorous measures to mix his sample before submitting it to a microscopic examination, whereas another examiner did not take such precautions. I suggest, therefore, in view of the fact that court proceedings are likely to ensue on these tests being made, that the Minister should lay down some minimum procedure through which a man would have to swear in court that he had gone before his evidence would be acceptable as having made a test.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">

I recognise that I am making a case to the Parliamentary Secretary which is not so much germane to his Department as it is to the Department of Justice or somebody concerned with the individual liberty of the citizen.  I put it to him that if he had heard Lord Hugh Cecil last night speaking on liberty he would sympathise with the point of view which I put before him now, that we are sometimes induced to take very drastic and Draconian measures in order to improve something, and to find that by interfering with liberty we are doing far more harm than if we had contented ourselves with a more modest and moderate precaution.</P>

      <P>Section 2 reads:</P>
      <P>Every local authority shall provide in the functional area of such authority such pounds as the county registrar shall, with the approval of the Minister, direct either generally or in any particular case, and every local authority shall maintain in accordance with this Act every pound provided by them under this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears from the Bill that, under certain circumstances, the county registrar can serve a ukase on the local authority that they must either establish a pound or carry out such repairs as he may think necessary on the pound and levy the expenses for doing that on the county.  I can see no valid reason why a local authority should be constrained to embark on an expenditure of this kind if the county registrar happens to think it necessary. It seems to me that if the Minister feels that the country is in such a condition that the pound accommodation must be widely increased, the Minister who is responsible for the Money Resolution should provide means of doing it. The Minister would not contend that it is action on the part of the local authorities that makes this multiplicity of pounds necessary.  I have been living in this country for 30 years, and I have no recollection of any pound being used in the whole time I was living in the country, except, perhaps occasionally to confine a stray donkey or an abandoned goat.  We are all perfectly well aware that the sudden emergency which has arisen in connection with the pound accommodation at present available is that practically every farmer is going to be introduced to that luxurious accommodation.  It is not enough for the Minister to take steps which will bring the stock of every hard-working farmer into the pounds but he would add insult to injury and ask the people whose property he is going to drive into the pounds to provide, out of the rates levied off their own land, the wherewithal to build them.  There are prudent limits to which any responsible man will go in exasperating the public, but really I think it is going beyond the beyonds if you not only persecute <Col N="1497" /> people but ask them to pay you for persecuting them.  I suggest to the Minister that this section should either be dropped or that he should indicate his intention on the Report Stage of putting down an amendment to make any charge for repairing those pounds or establishing them a charge on the Central Fund or on the Supply Services. In doing that, I ask him to remember that it was not open to me to put down such an amendment, because, I think I am right in saying, that it would have been ruled out of order as imposing a charge upon the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>It was stated on the Second Stage of the Bill&mdash;and this section goes really to the root of that&mdash;that the position under the Summary Jurisdiction Act, 1851, was that three justices of the peace formerly, and latterly a district justice, could requisition the county council to provide such pounds as were considered necessary.  The sole purpose of this section is to regularise that position.  There was a limit of £10 imposed under the 1851 Act which was altogether inadequate.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon is entirely wrong in his assumption that the section is intended to deal with an abnormal number of seizures or anything like that.  As was pointed out already, this Bill was drafted in 1928 when that position could not be said to exist, and it was drafted purely and simply to regularise and bring up to date what was regarded as an antiquated position. As the Deputy knows, £10 is absolutely inadequate now to maintain a pound in any place, and there are a number of counties where no pound exists. With regard to any abnormal position that may arise, under Section 9 (2) of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1926, you can impound seized cattle anywhere.  There is nothing revolutionary in this section, because as the law stood a district justice could requisition the local authority at any time.  The only point is that the local authority were limited to an expenditure of £10, which the Deputy knows might be all right in 1851, but certainly would not be applicable to-day.</P>

      <P>The county councils find themselves at this moment facing the making up of their estimates for next year.  One after another the secretary reads out to the county council the amounts of money which the Minister for Local Government is withholding from them in respect of annuities which people have not been able to pay.  In many cases the secretaries have to inform their councils that they do not know how much money they are getting, and find it impossible to discover from the Minister for Local Government what money they are going to get from grants which the Minister propagands to the country that he is going to pay.  You have various counties pointing out the many ways in which actions of the present Government are increasing the expenses to them of the general administration and the running of their institutions.  The Secretary of the North Tipperary County Council pointed out the other day that the coalcattle pact alone was going to cost North Tipperary £260 or £270 more in respect of coal.  Even if the Bill is as harmless as the Minister says, it is an extraordinary thing that we were able to get on in this country with the pounds we had, and with the machinery we had until now.

      <P>If the Minister is acting as innocently as he now pretends <Col N="1499" /> to the House why did we adjourn the Dáil for months last year; why did we meet for a day now and two days again, if this Bill was drafted six years ago and was ready to be stuck into a spare half-hour here?  The Minister is introducing this Bill now when the financial position of local bodies is a very difficult one; when many of the counties controlled by his own partisans are writing up to tell him they cannot carry on next year, and indicating ways in which they should be relieved of certain financial burdens.  But what the Minister does not deny and cannot deny is that he is handing over power to a certain person, who in many counties is the sheriff carrying out seizures for inability to pay rates or land annuities, to say: &ldquo;I want a pound here, there and elsewhere.&rdquo; He is giving him power practically to set them up and send the bill to the county council if they are not set up.  If the Bill is as innocent as the Minister says, then he has sufficient difficulties already without increasing his difficulties and the misunderstandings about himself and his policy throughout the country.  He could afford to wait for this Bill for another year.  In the meantime the local authorities manned by the people who are suffering under the present circumstances cannot but read his Bill as being what it is on the face of it&mdash;a handing over to the sheriff of power to require those pounds and send the bill to the local authorities.</P>

      <P>Is there any meaning in sub-section (3)?  Are county councils going to auction pounds? What is the sense of taking power to sell pounds?  It seems positively ridiculous that anybody would go to auction a pound.  What for?  Who is going to buy it?  A pound has already been provided.  Why give authority to the county registrar to make a selection of pounds?  If there is such a place as a pound, let it be repaired, but it is ridiculous to think that a new pound will be erected somewhere at the instigation of the county registrar, who will forthwith issue a certificate that the county council may dispose of <Col N="1500" /> the other pound.  For what purpose? A suggestion of that kind is positively ridiculous.  If a new pound is ordered by the county registrar the other is presumably useless.  Whatever is invested in it has gone by the board.  Nobody is going to buy it.  Can anybody imagine what purpose it would be used for?</P>

      <P>The Minister retaliated to Deputy Mulcahy by saying: &ldquo;Why did you draft the Bill in 1928?&rdquo; to which Deputy Mulcahy very aptly replied: &ldquo;Why did you lock it in your bosom since 1932?&rdquo; The answer to both questions is perfectly simple, because I can quite imagine that county registrars are persons who, in their own narrow ambit, are constantly pressing on the central Government to evolve legislation of this kind, and the Government, having in some spare moment drafted a Bill of this kind, says: &ldquo;Pounds are not required at the present time; there is no considerable volume of seizures going on and there is no immediate prospect of them.  We have knocked along with what we have since the Land League days, and there is no urgent necessity for pounds.  We are not going to hold up the business of the legislature now to make provision for them.&rdquo;  Now, the Minister produces the Bill, and everybody knows why.  It is because he and his colleagues have created a situation in this country in which the back yard of every Civic Guard barracks in the country is being turned into a pound. As time goes on he knows perfectly well that if they pursue their present policy there will not be room in the back yards of the Civic Guard barracks for the cattle they will have to seize in order to raise the charges they are trying to levy on the farmers of this country, at the same time as they are making it impossible for the farmers to sell their live stock. They are perfectly well aware that, unless they trot out their &ldquo;John Brown&rdquo; and sell the cattle to him for one-fifth of the normal value, providing him with licences to ship them to the much despised British market and there sell them at a comfortable profit, they cannot get, from men who are <Col N="1501" /> unable to pay, public charges which those men are willing and anxious to pay if they had the means wherewith to pay them.  It is as well that the Fianna Fáil Party should realise that the reason why the Minister has drawn this Bill from the pigeon-hole at the present time is largely because Fianna Fáil has stood in the country for a policy which is bringing ruin and bankruptcy on the greater part of the community.  Those pounds are going to be made the scene of the ruin and the bankruptcy of the best elements in this country.</P>

Quite apart from the glaring injustice to the people, it is bad for the country as a whole, and in my opinion it is an intolerable abuse not only to beggar the people but to ask the people to pay out of their land for the rostrum upon which their bankruptcy is to be shown before the world.</P>

      <P>All I want to say is this.  Deputy Dillon may refer to Deputy Mulcahy's apt reply, but if we want to have any special legislation brought in we must see the necessity for it before we employ draftsmen and officials to have that particular measure drafted.  It is only when the necessity arises that we do so.  I would assume, at any rate, that any responsible Executive Council would ask their officials or their draftsmen to prepare such a measure.  I do not suggest that when Deputy Mulcahy's Government in 1928 gave instructions to have this Bill drafted that there was any abnormal <Col N="1502" /> position in the country with regard to seizures of cattle.  I do not suggest that for a moment; but I do suggest that the reason for giving instructions to prepare this legislation in 1928 is the same reason that exists now.  I do suggest that it was necessary to have that measure brought up to date.  To say that these pounds are required to deal with special seizures is moonshine. We have several places which were never regarded as pounds and which are not now regarded as pounds, but they have been used as pounds.  We have set up in Cork and elsewhere places that were not pounds and we have turned them into pounds.  Deputies know that position.  Marsh's Yard in Cork was not a pound.  The military barracks in Fermoy was not a pound. The powers are there and they were left there by the previous Government &mdash;by the legislation which the previous Government enacted.</P>

      <P>No.  The Deputy is trying to twist this into a political matter; that this is a measure which has been brought in absolutely to deal with the situation that he alleges is in the country.  I am not suggesting that any abnormal position existed in the country when the Deputy's Government gave instructions to have this Bill drafted as it is there.  Not one line has been changed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that not one line has been changed.  Not only has one line been changed in the measure but the whole fabric has been changed.  When this Bill was drafted a pound meant a place where a seized animal might be brought or where the <Col N="1503" /> property of a person might be taken in order to realise it for the purpose of the recovery of a debt due by a citizen or for the purpose of the recovery of any judgment of the courts in the country.  But a pound to-day means a place to which a farmer's cattle can be brought on the certificate of the Land Commission without any right vesting in the farmer whatever to go to the court, make his case and ask them to give him that protection that was long established for his behalf.  That is, to put a stay on the execution of a judgment or to give him time to pay. But you have the case to-day in which anybody can have his property seized and brought to the pound and sold at bankrupt prices without any reference whatever to the man's capacity to pay the debt.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I do not wish to push it further but I think I am <Col N="1504" /> entitled to meet the case when the Minister says that not one line of the Bill has been altered.  My point is that the word &ldquo;pounds&rdquo; has altered in its purpose since the Bill was first drafted and we have rightly protested against the multiplication of pounds in this country&mdash;pounds that are to be used for selling farmers' cattle.  Farmers had the right in 1928 when the Minister says this Bill was drafted to go into court and make a case as to their inability or capacity to pay.  They had then the ordinary safeguards of the law provided for them.  I doubt very much whether the local authorities or anybody else would have any objection to co-operate with the Government in the due administration of the law.  But it is because these pounds are now to be used as part of a general system of bringing to the people a denial of their constitutional rights&mdash;that is, to avail of the courts in the ordinary way&mdash;that we consider a grave injustice is being done by making further demands on the ratepayers who are to be mulcted in order to pay for these pounds.</P>

      <P>Here, again, the sheriff is given power to control, manage and incur expenses in connection with the upkeep and the maintenance of all the pounds he wants and to send the bill to the local authority. That is, again, putting power into the hands of a person who is in a most objectionable position at the present time to incur expenses for objectionable purposes and to send the bill to the local authority, which will have the money collected from the unfortunate farmers, bringing the whole vicious circle round again to have another crack at the farmers and further to deplete the money in their pockets.

      <P>If the Deputy's Party had not introduced a Bill and passed it into law which amalgamated the positions of county registrar and sub-sheriff, when the position of sub-sheriff became vacant, there would be no question of the sheriff and the registrar being the one person in certain counties now, nor would the words &ldquo;county registrar&rdquo; mean &ldquo;sheriff,&rdquo; at the same time.  There is a number of counties still in which the two positions are separate and there is no suggestion in the Bill itself that the sub-sheriff should be the proper person.  It is the county registrar.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>So that the Minister's attitude is: &ldquo;Yes, the sheriff who is carrying on this work will have pounds wherever he wants them; he will maintain them and control them and incur expenses in connection with them; he will send a bill to the local authorities which will, if they are able, get the money from the farmers; and if not, will go through another circle of sheriffs, farmers, cattle and pounds.&rdquo;  But in doing that, he says: &ldquo;You must not blame me for that; there were people here in 1929 who got this Bill drafted and we found it and, after all, what could we do when we found it?&rdquo;  In the meantime the people of the country have to pay up and the farmers have to suffer.</P>

      <P>This section provides, as was pointed out in dealing with Section 5, that the person who may be appointed by the sheriff to look after the pound which he selects shall be paid certain fees and certain remuneration.  The bill for this will be sent to the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We spoke, on the Second Stage, of the position with regard to the pound in Mullingar, where the pound has been kept inside the military barracks.  The Minister will not say that the Westmeath County Council is not a county council after his own heart. Nevertheless, at the last meeting of the County Council the Chairman, Deputy Kennedy, said: &ldquo;The rate position in County Westmeath is bad because of the withholding of the Agricultural Grant and the County Council have decided that they will not give an increased rate.  Before 12 months are out, if there is not a change in the outlook, the County Council will not be able to maintain the county services.&rdquo;  I should like to ask the Minister how many pounds will be required in Deputy Kennedy's constituency.  I should also like to hear what Deputy Kennedy has to say with regard to the Minister's proposal to allow the sheriff in Westmeath to <Col N="1511" /> select his pounds and the staff of men to man them and send the bill to the County Council, whose financial plight Deputy Kennedy paints so seriously.</P>

      <P>In the county which the Deputy quotes we had an example of another person with £2,000 in bank or otherwise who would not pay. People like that will have to be provided for with regard to pounds.  If there is a campaign such as that in that county, whether the county council like it or not, it has to be dealt with.  Whether pounds will be necessary or not to solve that situation I do not know.  Under the powers we have at present we are in a position to deal with any situation like that quite effectively. We have the military barracks there.  If there is any delay in collecting the annuities that delay can be remedied by the Departments concerned, who can have the matter speeded up.</P>

      <P>We had recently in Mullingar a case in which an action was taken against the sheriff by a person for some alleged wrongful action of his in connection with the sale of cattle.  It was dressed up as a first-class cause with senior counsel engaged and a full day's trial before a jury of County Westmeath farmers. This gentleman claimed damages for alleged wrongful action on the part of the sheriff.  It turned out in the course of the evidence that this man owed a certain small sum for annuities&mdash;I think about £14.  He refused to pay and his cattle were seized.  He claimed that there was not an open sale, and when he came into court to give evidence he admitted in cross-examination that he had, I think, £250 on current account in the bank and £2,000 invested in securities.  Notwithstanding that, he felt that he should join in the campaign which was encouraged by certain persons against the payment of land annuities.  But what I said to Deputy Mulcahy and what <Col N="1513" /> Deputy Cosgrave took me up on was, that if the Administration find it necessary to seize the cattle of people who are in a position of that kind it is necessary to have very strong provisions to enable pounds to be provided. Such a state of things should not exist and would not exist if Deputies opposite and those responsible for encouraging gentlemen of that type acted in what I should imagine is the normal way in which a constitutional Opposition should act.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave suggests that if a man has money in a bank and has securities it ought not to be necessary to rely upon this particular type of machinery to realise a debt of £14. He possibly does not know of the difficulties of dealing with a man who has money in stocks and shares or on deposit in the bank unless you can take the course of making him a bankrupt and in that way enforcing your claim against him.  One would have thought that the ordinary procedure which is available to debtors to recover a debt by putting the decree in the hands of the sheriff would be the normal way in which legal debts are recovered. That is the method of procedure which any Deputy who has responsibility for seeing that the laws are allowed to function would welcome.  It is the easiest way in the long run and it is the cheapest.  It is recognised by all persons who know anything about the difficulties that can be created in the recovery of debts that it is the particular type of machinery which should not be put out of gear.  It is the machinery which Deputies opposite for the last couple of years have determined to put out of gear and which their opposition here is directed further to bring into discredit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very well to talk about conditions in the country, to enlarge upon the difficulties of the farmer, and to have a full-dress debate here upon a Bill which, as the Minister pointed out, was actually drafted by themselves. Of course, the political purpose behind it is quite clear.  It is quite observable and quite understandable by us here.  We may smile at it, but, at the same time, I think <Col N="1514" /> Deputies ought to realise that the attitude adopted towards this Bill and the proceedings here are intended for wider consumption.  While Deputies may say that they are not encouraging people not to pay land annuities, and not encouraging people to obstruct the enforcement of court orders or warrants, I suggest to Deputies that that is not at all in keeping with the attitude which they have taken on this Bill, both on the Second Stage and on this Stage.</P>
    <P>The example I have given is a perfect example of how an atmosphere can be created in which people who are well able to pay will not do so.  The man in this particular instance did not even allege inability to pay.  He merely said that he thought because everybody else was refusing to pay he also should refuse.  If that does not bring a blush of shame to the Deputies opposite, and make them realise how dishonest this particular campaign is, nothing else will.  I think the discussion on the Committee Stage of this Bill is not intended to be helpful.  It is not intended to improve this Bill.  It is merely intended to further increase the ardour of those who are prepared to obstruct the sheriff in doing his work.</P>

      <P>It is certainly open to a great many interpretations.  That is, perhaps, the most amusing of all the interpretations which could be placed upon it.  The Deputy has great experience of the courts.  He mentioned the word &ldquo;honesty.&rdquo;  I presume that according to that interpretation one of the two parties going into court is dishonest. It is a very loose method of <Col N="1515" /> expression, and I do not believe the Attorney-General intended it.  There is a party to this transaction, which is the State.  It lays down its own regulations.  It makes its own laws.  It has gone even a step further than that. It has told the courts: &ldquo;We will have nothing to do with you at all.&rdquo;  It says to one man: &ldquo;You have got to pay £x for land annuities,&rdquo; to another, &ldquo;You have got to pay £x 1s.,&rdquo; and so on, without ever entering into any consideration as to whether or not the man is able to pay. For years that Party&mdash;the Attorney-General was not a brilliant light in it at the time I am dealing with&mdash;complained that the farming community was in a bad situation, and could not possibly pay its way.  In fact, I read here the other night a speech from the leader of that Party, in which he said that one of the heaviest of the outgoings of the farmer in the way of overhead charges was his rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not, Sir.  I am trying to elucidate what the Attorney-General means when he says &ldquo;if we were in normal times.&rdquo;  It is the business of a Government to keep us in normal times.  It so happens that people were allowed to believe they were in bad times four years ago. That man with his £2,000 in bank believes that story.  I expect he is fully convinced of it.  The situation created by that sort of an opposition is that that type of man is now taking his stand with his brethren who are not in a position to pay.  Assuming for the moment that he is a dishonest man, is that the reason he should be robbed?  And he was robbed.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I know.  I quite understand all about that, but the facts of the case, notwithstanding, are that the man was robbed.  How was he robbed?  His cattle were put up <Col N="1516" /> for sale, and a bid would not be taken.  The man was told he was late. It is no justification for the Administration to say &ldquo;Because he is a dishonest man, we will make him pay.&rdquo; You have no right to do it.  You have to be just.  In this particular case you were not just.  Even though he had £2,000 in bank&mdash;I do not know his name or anything about him other than that he was a farmer&mdash;the Administration had no right to precipitate that situation.  If they wanted to do their business properly they should have gone to the courts and got a decree against him.  The Attorney-General must be well aware that although this Bill was on the stocks&mdash;we were incorrectly told by a Minister here some time ago that it was drawn up by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney&mdash;it was never introduced.  It never passed the Executive Council. If it had, it would have been introduced. That was to deal with a situation which required a just administrative amendment; this is a situation in which we are to have innumerable pounds.  If the Attorney-General realised how much the fact that they cannot sell their cattle means to the people who are called upon by the sheriffs to pay their annuities he would have an entirely different view-point.  It so happens that the Ministry has not been hit, and the back benchers of that Party can get out of their troubles through their influence with Ministers, but there are cases of people who have been very hard-hit, and the multiplication of pounds is not going to ease the situation for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make only one or two observations arising out of the point made by the Attorney-General in connection with the Mullingar case.  I happened to have some thing to do with the Mullingar case, and I know all about it up to a certain point.  I do not propose to discuss the merits or demerits of the case, or its result or the reasons for its result.  Deputy Cosgrave pointed out originally in his opening remarks that it would have been far better for the Administration to have sought to <Col N="1517" /> attach that sum of £2,000, which the plaintiff in that action is supposed to have had in bank, rather than to have seized his cattle and sold them at an under value, as they were admitted during the course of the evidence at that trial to have been sold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Attorney-General states in answer to that observation by Deputy Cosgrave that this procedure of seizure by the sheriff is the normal method and the proper method employed in connection with the recovery of debts generally, including the recovery of debts due to the State or to a Department of State.  That may be so if the method adopted in this case and other similar cases was the normal method. It was not the normal method and because it was not the normal method the Administration were unable to discover or did not discover that this £2,000 was in the bank.  If the normal method had been adopted&mdash;the normal method being to recover this sum of £15, or whatever was due to the Land Commission, by an action&mdash;the plaintiff in this Mullingar action, this defaulting annuitant, could have been brought before a District Court under the Enforcement of Court Orders Act for examination as to his means.  Under that Act, he would have had to lodge in court a statement of his assets, and in the course of the lodgment of that statement of assets it would have transpired that this £2,000 was there.  By adopting the machinery provided under the Land Act of 1933, the Administration were unable to discover <Col N="1518" /> or did not discover the existence of this fund which was available, and out of which their debt could have been paid.  What they did was to use the punitive machinery under the Land Act of 1933 against the man, not for the purpose of getting payment of their debt, but for the purpose of punishing the defaulting annuitant for not having paid his debt.</P>
    <P>I suggest that that is a matter which is a proper cause for complaint. Whether this opposition is normal or abnormal we are entitled to draw attention to the fact that the procedure under the Act of 1933 is not being used merely for the purpose of recovering annuities from defaulting annuitants but for the purpose of punishing annuitants who did not pay, irrespective of whether they can pay or not. That is what happened in the Mullingar case, and what was the cause of complaint in that case was that if the Administration are playing a certain game, which they are entitled to play according to the law as it stands at the moment, they ought to play the game according to the rules.  In that particular case they did not play the game according to the rules.</P>

If Deputy Smith is going to take part in this march against the farmers, I should like him to try to help us, in a way in which neither the Minister nor the Attorney-General has helped us, and tell us what expense is going to come to the Cavan County Council as a result of the provisions of Section 7 and what the Cavan County Council are going to do to meet it.</P>
      <P>Section 7 provides that when the sheriff has secured his necessary pounds, he shall have power to carry out such repairs and other work as may be necessary and when the local authority fails or neglects to provide a sufficient supply of any substance or thing required for the due and proper use of any pound, the county registrar may supply them and the sheriff shall then have power to proceed against the local authority for the recovery of the amount so spent by him as a civil debt.

      <P>I have been elected to the Dáil as a farmer and, as a farmer, I should like to make a few remarks. The position into which the present Government has launched the farming community to-day is very hard and very unjust.  As a matter of fact, the farmers always paid their way and will pay their way, but what purpose these pounds are required for I cannot see. Owing to the administration of the present Government we have lost our markets for our cattle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Let us be clear on what we are discussing. There is a marginal note to this section which will clearly indicate to any Deputy what we are discussing.  It says &ldquo;Repair of pounds on default of local authority&rdquo;, that is, where a local authority defaults in regard to the repair of a pound and what provision will be made for that repair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>Are they for the farmers themselves or for the cattle?  It looks as if they are for the farmers because so far as I can see, the Government look on the farmer as a nuisance.  He is seemingly a nuisance in this country and the opinion amongst the Fianna Fáil Deputies seems to be that the sooner he is wiped out the better.  It is all very well for that Minister to smile but he must remember that it is out of agriculture that everything comes and the farmer at present is not to be laughed at in this House or outside it.  Under Section 7, if a local authority does not repair the local pound or put it into proper order, the registrar in this county can come in and do it for the local authority and the local authority will have to pay whatever expenses he incurs.  In our county this year, £18,000 or £19,000 are being withheld, representing 1s. 6d. or 1s. 8d. in the £.  I may be going out of order but I will not go very far.  I <Col N="1524" /> will not go 100 yards.  It may be that our rates next year are going to be advanced by 1s. 6d. and I think that if the present Government had any regard for the farmer, they would have left this matter of pounds for a later day.  They might have left it to their next session in office.  I should like every member in this House to bear in mind that it is out of agriculture that everything has to come, and with the wiping out of agriculture which, as far as I can see, is the aim, this Government and everybody else&mdash;and I say it without fear of contradiction&mdash;will go bang.  When that day comes, that will be the position and, so far as I can see, that day is not very distant now.</P>

Certain provisions are set out in the section with reference to the repair of pounds on the default of local authorities.  The Deputy should tell us why such provisions should or should not be put into effect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFinlay" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that the county councils are not able to collect the local rates at the present time, and it will be much more difficult for them when they have additional rates to collect arising out of the suggested provisions in this Bill.  The country people are asked in this measure to erect and maintain a sort of prison for themselves, to construct and maintain places for impounding their stock.  It is very hard on any farmer who has been up to this just making a living in the country to carry on his affairs when his financial responsibilities are daily increasing.  The attitude adopted by this Government is calculated to wipe out the farmers.</P>

      <P>I am anxious to know from the Minister and the Attorney-General the number of pounds likely to be maintained under this section.  Now that we have to build and maintain pounds, I would like to know the number we are to be called upon to maintain in Longford and Westmeath.  At the present moment, and so far as we can see for some time <Col N="1525" /> to come, the ratepaying community are and will be in a very difficult position. The Attorney-General told us of a case in Westmeath where a farmer has £2,000.  He is probably one of the lucky ones.  I know scores of farmers in Westmeath who are unable to pay rates or rents, and there is no conspiracy amongst them, because they are prominent supporters of the present Administration.  I happen to know one, a relative of mine, who resides with his father, mother, his wife and seven children.  The sheriffs arrived at his place and seized his cattle.  I paid the rent for him, without going to Mullingar.  I paid the rates for him since.</P>
      <P>There are scores of people in the same position as he is in that district in Westmeath, and yet you now call upon those people to pay an additional rate for the maintenance of these pounds. Is that fair or equitable?  Do you not think that the times are abnormal? You said that in normal times things ought to be so and so.  In normal times this man, with 30 or 40 acres of land, would be fairly well off, but as a result of the policy adopted by this Administration he is now unable to pay his rent and rates.  If he can feed and clothe his dependants, he is not doing badly.  Yet the officers of the State seize his cattle, and now you are proposing to add to his liabilities. You want to add to the rates the cost of maintenance of this instrument of torture.  Is it fair?</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit we have done that, but I respectfully suggest it is still within the competence of the Minister to put this charge on the Central Fund if he wishes to do so. Where a council is unable to meet the demand the registrar, instead of carrying out the repairs at the expense of the council and making the proposed declaration to the Minister for Finance, could make a declaration to the Minister to the effect that the council was unable to defray the expenses and suggest that the Minister should meet them out of the Central Fund.  That is my contention.  It is admitted that there are councils financially embarrassed and, even though law-abiding, something like Deputy Smith's council, and anxious and willing to carry out the necessary repairs, they might find themselves unable to do so.  In that case the registrar might issue a certificate indicating that in his opinion the council was not financially strong enough to carry out the repairs and the Minister should carry them out, drawing the expenses from the Central Fund.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this section is definitely one of the worst sections in the Bill.  It gives tremendous authority to the registrar and throws the obligation on the local body of erecting these pounds and paying for their upkeep.  The same applies to the appointment of pound keepers.  I would like the Minister, or those Fianna Fáil Deputies who are supporting the Bill so strongly, to justify the principle of making one authority responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of pounds and another authority responsible for making the appointments.  This whole principle aims at the destruction of local government and that is one of the most serious aspects of this measure. This Bill is really a step in the direction of the destruction of local government.  Once a popularly elected body is deprived of the right to control the rates which it collects, it is time for it to get out.  How can <Col N="1527" /> Deputy Smith justify the suggestion that the local body is there only to squeeze money out of ratepayers and other parties are responsible for the spending of that money?  That is a procedure that no elected representative in any local body in Ireland can defend.  When a person is elected to a local body he should defend the rights of that body.  I do not think that the Minister should lightly accept the principle set out in the Bill.  I hope the House will vote this section out of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems an extraordinary section to put in, giving the registrar power to repair the pounds and making local authorities bear the expenses.  The urgent use now for the pound is to impound seized cattle and seized stock from people who, in terms of goods, are well able and willing to pay, but who, in terms of cash, are unable to pay because the Government has produced such conditions that the goods cannot be converted into cash. I heard of a classical example recently of where about £200 worth of stuff was seized in Donegal to cover a debt of £3, but the man could not convert the goods into money because of the conditions imposed by the Government. Speaking for the local authority that would be called upon to provide pounds in the County of Dublin and, speaking as the chairman of the local authority, I know what we are confronted with.  I know of men who have their lands fully stocked who cannot pay the rates because they cannot convert their stock into money.</P>
      <P>Here, the registrar has the power to fix up a pound if the local authority does not do it and charge the local authority for fixing up that pound&mdash; to impound cattle seized on foot of a debt that the owner is able and willing to pay, and for which he has sufficient stock to pay, were it not that the conditions, for which the Government is responsible, do not enable that man to turn those goods into money. Where will it all end?  How will the local authority get the money to pay the bill when the registrar puts it up to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1528" /> Only this morning, the owner of one of the best draught stallions in Ireland called to me to know what was to be done.  He said, in effect: &ldquo;I have as much stock as ever I had; I have as much tillage as ever I had.  Here are 50 mare nominations waiting for my horse, but I must pay my rates up to the 31st of March, and I have not got the money.&rdquo;  Now, we, in County Dublin, will get an order from the registrar, and we are supposed, when this becomes law, to put up pounds. For what?  Is it to put this man's stallion into?  Is it to put his sows into?  Is it to put his live stock into&mdash; the live stock that he has worn his feet off driving into the Dublin market hoping to turn them into any sort of money?  It is very easy for Ministers, sitting in easy chairs that they can swing around on, to give an idea of a Bill to the draftsman and tell him to draft the Bill, but will they come down to realities?  What answer can I give this hard-working farmer?  I said that I would see what could be done.  I will see him to-morrow.  What answer will I give him?  Will I give him the answer that to-day we, who are drawing £1 a day from the State, and Ministers who are drawing £1,200 or £1,300 a year from the State, spent this day passing legislation to tax that man to build a pound into which to put his stallion? Is not that the position?  That is the only answer I have to give him, and that is the fact, and I am getting £1 a day for it.  The Minister is getting £3 or £4 or £5 a day, and other Deputies are getting £1 a day simply for squeezing the life-blood out of the people.</P>

Because we cannot get our demands, we put the stock into the pound, and John Brown will buy the stock by the dozen.

The Minister may think that all this is necessary and that those pounds do need repair, but I should like to call his attention to a thing that happened a few weeks ago.  A few weeks ago the Guards seized a dozen milch cows out in the Rathcoole area.  They put the cows into a pound with a foot and a half of muck in it.  One would not put a rat into such a place, and some of these were freshly-calved cows. We, in the Dublin County Council, sent our veterinary officer for the county there.  I am sorry that I have not his report with me, but I shall send it to the Minister if it would be any use to him.  I may tell the Minister that, as a result of that report, we are seriously considering prosecuting the Guards for cruelty to animals.</P>

I suggest to the Minister that if he thinks there is something wrong in the local administration and that he will put it right by the provision of pounds, the central authority should provide the pounds. I am greatly afraid that, even if this is passed in its present form, it will not work out as automatically as it would appear to work out.  I am quite satisfied that, so far as County Dublin is concerned, we have all the pounds there that will be required to be constructed, repaired or maintained, in our time of office at any rate.</P>

      <P>I can assure Deputy Belton that there will be no necessity to construct pounds in his area.  Deputy MacEoin spoke of the responsibility of the local authorities.  I should like to say that when the Minister for Industry and Commerce was coming into this House to take charge of the Bill on its Second Reading I informed him that it was purely a routine or formal measure. Of course, I am well aware of the ingenuity of some people in trying to inject politics into the simplest matter in this House.  I have read the debate on the Second Reading of this Bill and I have been listening here to all this nonsense about the economic difficulty and the economic war, and that these pounds are being provided to deal with that.  I assure Deputies that while my Department is responsible for the collection of land annuities, that is, so far as enforcing the decrees is concerned, I do not want any additional pounds.

We have taken over premises on the borders of Carlow and Kilkenny which are also being used.  We have not to come to this House for any authority for it.  This Bill was referred to by Deputy Cosgrave, who said that in their time they regarded it as administrative mending. If I for one moment thought it was going to be twisted into all this propaganda, away from the administrative mending it was intended to be, I could have done without the Bill, as I do not want it.  I have plenty of powers so far as the seizure of cattle or anything else is concerned.  The position is that when instructions were given at first to have the Bill drafted, representations were made that £10 was not sufficient to maintain pounds in certain counties. There are several counties which have no pounds.  No matter what people may say, sometimes cattle wander off farms, and if the owners are not known the practice is to put them into pounds.  It is all political propaganda to suggest that this Bill is required for the purpose of meeting the annuities situation which may or may not exist in the country.  We have ample powers at present.  We can seize cattle in Cork <Col N="1532" /> and sell them in Dublin.  We can seize them anywhere we like, and we can take over premises anywhere and put cattle into them.  The previous Government gave us these powers.  When the Bill was about to be introduced by the previous Government it was intended, as Deputy Cosgrave said, for administrative mending.

    <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 8 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>This section gives power to the Minister to make regulations for the control of the pounds erected at the expense of the local bodies.  It enables the Minister to fix the fees to be paid to the pound-keepers appointed, perhaps, by the sheriff on suitable occasions, and it imposes a penalty of £20 or, at the discretion of the court, six months' imprisonment, or both, on any person who contravenes any of the regulations made by the Minister under this section as regards the management and regulation of pounds and the powers, duties or functions of the pound-keepers.  Are we to understand from the Minister, who says this is <Col N="1535" /> a harmless Bill, that Section 8 is the real thing which he is looking for&mdash; that he wanted power to frame regulations with regard to these pounds, and that he wanted power to inflict a punishment of £20 or six months' imprisonment on anybody who contravened any of these regulations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>We thought it was a proper control to have, as was thought by the Deputy himself some time ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister asks for extraordinary powers in this section. The Minister is really usurping the functions of the local bodies.  He is asking for powers to make all the regulations in connection with these pounds.  That should not be a matter for the Minister but for the local bodies, who should have the appointment of pound-keepers and should fix their fees and all that sort of thing. It is an old saying and one that is recognised as a true one that those who call the tune should pay the piper. The Minister in this case calls for the tune and makes the local bodies pay the piper.  That is a very wrong principle in any section and I think that power should not be given to the Minister.  If the local bodies are competent bodies they should be fit to discharge the duties imposed on them, and surely they are fit to administer such a matter as the pounds and responsible enough to appoint pound-keepers. I do not see why the Minister should get this power from the House and I feel very strongly on this point.  While the local bodies are retained in this country they should have the spending of the money.  If they are bound to collect that money from the ratepayers whom they represent then they should have the expenditure of the money.  I strongly oppose this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGovern has covered the ground I had intended to go over.  Now that the local authorities have built the pounds and have to maintain the pounds which, I might say, are simply places in which to impound old wandering asses&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    <Col N="1536" />
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I was just pointing out that that is what the Minister has told us pounds are for.  He told us that this is a mere formal matter, that these were pounds to be built and maintained in which to hold wandering animals.  The Minister said that no matter how good a man was as a farmer it would be found that his cattle will sometimes wander. In the old days the R.I.C. took great pleasure in driving the neighbours' asses to the pound and now the Minister tells us again that this is a mere formal measure.  That being the case and, seeing that the local authority has to build and maintain the pounds. I do not see why the Minister should reserve to himself the right.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;to make regulations for the general management and regulation of pounds; the powers, duties and functions of pound-keepers, and the fees to be paid to pound-keepers and the persons by whom such fees are to be paid.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local authority, having built the pound and kept it in repair and all that sort of thing, should be in a position to decide the fees that are to be paid by the persons whose animals are impounded.  The Minister may have elaborate ideas about these matters. I know at the moment cases where cattle are being purchased out of pounds.  I know that as much as 4/- a day has been charged as poundage on each animal.  That is an exorbitant charge.  Even if the pound were full of clover and were a place where the best of everything was given to the stock it should not cost anything like 4/- a day.  Cattle could be kept in the City of Dublin in one of the most expensive places at that rate. The Minister asks what is to be done with the fees and the disposal of such fees.  Again I contend that the local authority, responsible as it is for all the expenditure, should be allowed to say what they are to do with the money.  The Minister should not have anything to say on that question.  I will say that the sale, disposal or destruction of the animals confined in the pound could be a matter for regulation by the Gárda authorities. <Col N="1537" /> However, it is immaterial as to whether it is the Gárda authorities or the Minister who regulates them.  I think, however, that this section should not stand and that the Minister should alter it to read that the local council &ldquo;may, by order, make such regulations for all or any of the following matters.&rdquo;  I think the House should not pass this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Statute law of this State provides that a sheriff's sale must be held in public.  The Attorney-General has demonstrated during the last few months that his conception of a public sale and the conception by the vast majority of the people of this country are two very different things. The Attorney-General's conception of a public sale is to bring in a few down-at-heel hangers-on of the Government, sell cattle to them under anonymous names for a tithe of their value; then furnish them with licences and get the cattle out of the country to the despised and detested British market at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely that has nothing to do with these sales.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the view that obtained in this country about these sales.  I do not blame the Attorney-General for he is over-ridden as he frequently seems to be by the Executive Council in these matters.  I think the Attorney-General has been made the instrument of defending some extraordinary proceedings in this country.  I am not surprised that in this case they did not allow him to act on his own judgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>What case?  I do not remember any case having been brought against me for not having a sale in public except the one in Mullingar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Not yet.  We have tumbled the Attorney - General in so many encounters that we find it hard to find time for them all.  The Attorney-General, however, may rest assured that we will take up these matters with him later.  What I am afraid of is that Section 8 of this Bill may interfere with the success of that project.  Section 8 (1) (a) provides that the Minister may <Col N="1538" /> by order make regulations for the general management and regulation of pounds.  Would that give him power to make such regulations as would interfere with the provision that sheriffs' sales must be held in public?  Would he be entitled under that section to say that not more than 20 people would be entitled to attend a sale held in a pound?  If he had that power, would the courts interpret it as power adequate to amend the provisions of legislation of this House?  If this Bill purports to give the Minister for Justice the right to amend the existing Statute law by order, then I do not think that that section ought to pass in its present form.  I need hardly say that that is a legal matter on which I do not presume to give any information.  But I think the House is entitled to look for guidance to the Attorney-General in that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>Like most of the discussion, I do not think this a genuine seeking for knowledge on the part of Deputy Dillon, but that it is his contribution to the publicity campaign which is engineered on this Bill. The Deputy opened his speech by referring in some way to a practice for which, he said, I am either directly or indirectly responsible for rendering ineffective the provisions of the law as regards the holding of sales in public.  I think it is hardly necessary to tell Deputy Dillon that the sheriffs are the persons responsible for the conduct of sales and that the sheriff is the judge as to the method by which the sale is to be carried out.  The sheriff is bound to have regard to the law. I have no recollection of ever having been consulted by any sheriff as to what the meaning of holding a sale in public is or how far he was entitled to regulate admittance of persons to the sale yard.  But Deputy Dillon must have at his disposal a number of legal advisers who would be willing to advise him if there was any possible cause of action against the sheriff.  It is against the sheriff that an action would lie and if, as he says, there has been an abuse of the provisions of the law which demands that sales shall be held in public, it was open to any <Col N="1539" /> person who felt aggrieved in that regard to bring an action against the sheriff for his breach of the law.</P>
      <P>The public know and appreciate quite well how much genuine concern for obedience to the law is behind this particular speech of Deputy Dillon's and the speeches in general which have been delivered from the opposite benches.  The Deputy knows quite well that every effort has been resorted to &mdash;I am glad to say without success, except in a few instances&mdash;to render sheriffs' sales abortive, and, under the guise of claiming the rights for certain people which the law is supposed to confer on them as members of the public, of attending there, efforts were made which it took very carefully considered action to defeat, to prevent sales being held at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to have patience with the line of criticism which has been adopted in this and in other discussions about this matter.  Is there any person in this country, not to speak of in this House, who is not very well aware that a campaign to render sheriffs' sales abortive, with elaborate organisation before and at the sales, has been conducted in this country for the last couple of years and that sheriffs and Guards, in an attempt to allow sales to be carried out, have to restrict the admission of persons to pounds and so on, it was only done in order to defeat the efforts which were being made to render the whole machinery of the law ineffective?  If the Deputy has any grievance which the persons he referred to were not ashamed to take into court, it was quite open to him, whether he thought the Attorney-General's advice was behind it or not, to invoke the aid of the court.  We have heard during this discussion references to a case in Mullingar where the aid of the court was sought, because it was said the sheriff had done something which was against the law and the case was paraded before <Col N="1540" /> a jury of farmers in County Westmeath and thrown out with contumely.</P>

    <P>shall be guilty of an offence under <Col N="1543" /> this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds or to imprisonment for any term not exceeding nine months or, at the discretion of the court, to both such fine and such imprisonment.</P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In line 32, after the word &ldquo;thereof&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;to a fine not exceeding £1 in respect of the first offence and in respect of any subsequent offence&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 9 provides that any person who damages or breaks into any pound or releases from or takes out of any pound any animals or chattels lawfully impounded therein, or uses violence, threats and so on, shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £50 or imprisonment for any term not exceeding nine months or, at the discretion of the court, to both such fine and such imprisonment. When we dealt with this matter on the Second Reading I put before the House the appalling particulars of an Offaly case where, in very extraordinary circumstances, goods to the value of more than £200, probably £300, were taken in respect of a rates debt amounting to £25.  That was only one sample of the type of thing the people have suffered.  Deputy MacEoin has mentioned a case where, in respect of a debt of £34, 28 cattle were seized. We have known places in South Tipperary where large numbers of cattle were seized and disposed of at rates such as 5/- for a cow.  If the person from whom goods were seized in such <Col N="1544" /> an exorbitant and exaggerated way is driven by his feelings to break into and damage a pound, it is not necessarily attempting to stand up for law-breaking in any way or minimising it in any way to say that it is a very scandalous business to take powers so that that man can be fined £50 and perhaps as well be imprisoned for nine months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy says he is not attempting to minimise the question of breaking the law but, judging by this amendment, I do not know what else he is doing.  He has introduced certain alleged facts about certain cases where people had goods seized.  He apparently thinks that those people may feel justified subsequently in taking forcible possession of, or breaking into and damaging pounds and he says it is scandalous to impose the penalties suggested here. There have been hard cases where people have been deprived of premises and land and, under the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1926, the penalty imposed was six months and a fine of £50 for the first offence.  That merely has been followed here.  If the Deputy wants to reduce the term from nine to six months, I do not see any objection.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In line 32 to delete the word &ldquo;fifty&rdquo; and substitute therefor the word &ldquo;two&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister has endeavoured to make some point to the effect that he has seen an Act under which there was an offence somewhat similar to this where the previous Administration imposed a penalty of £50 and six months.  I do not think I need go into the reasons why any Act of that kind might have been passed.  I want to put this to the Minister: that if there was an Act passed in 1925 which provided for the imposition of a fine of £50 on a farmer, there might have been some chance of his having £50 then.  But the Minister has been in office for three years now, and over a group of agricultural products, including cattle, poultry, bacon, fresh pork, butter and eggs, the income of the farmers, which was about £24,000,000 in 1931, was reduced to £8,000,000 in 1934.  I shall go a certain distance to meet the Minister.  The amendment is to delete the word &ldquo;fifty&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;two.&rdquo;  Bearing in mind how much more difficult it is for the farmer to get £50 now as compared with 1931, if the Minister is agreeable I shall make it £15, and then the section would read: &ldquo;shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding £15.&rdquo;  Failing any kind of accommodation like that, based upon the actual financial position of the farmers to-day, I shall leave in the £2.</P>

He makes no provision for a first offence.  He asks for power to mulct a man like that in £50 as well as being liable to possible imprisonment. If all this is coming to the farmer, then, as far as I can help it, the farmers will hear the tramping feet of the Fianna Fáil army coming to them and the Minister will tramp through the Division Lobby again.</P>

      <P>I am asking the Minister to take cognisance of what any Deputy on the far side who has had anything to do with the carrying on of local government can tell him. The Minister is following up men whom his policy has reduced to a condition of absolute poverty and he is trying now at a very late hour in the day to pound respect for the law into their minds.  He should take some cognisance of the circumstances to which his policy has reduced these people and not be looking for his pound of flesh on the first occasion. The Minister knows very well the circumstances in the country that he is dealing with, and if he goes for his <Col N="1548" /> £50 and nine months' imprisonment, he can go, but he is showing the House that he has very little conception of the conditions in the country or of the way in which he should go about the business.  Unless those responsible for the administration of the law at present show that they have some conception of the conditions of the people they cannot expect respect for the law. They will be driven to coming back and saying that violence and disorder are being caused in the country because breaches of the law have occurred.  What is happening is that breaches of the law are being forced by an Administration which has had no consideration for the people in putting its policy into operation and which now has no consideration for the people when carrying out the very necessary work of finding money somewhere to maintain the services that the people want.</P>

      <P>The unfortunate man whose conditions, as I say, are such that his income is reduced to one-third, or perhaps reduced much more than that, who may be driven to commit an offence under this Bill by an exorbitant seizure such as those I mentioned, is not only liable to be fined £50 under the section as it stands, but is liable to be taken from his family and imprisoned for nine months.  Bad as are his conditions when trying to work under present circumstances, bad as they might be when he is deprived of £50 or perhaps £150 worth of his stock to make up the £50, he is liable as well to be taken away from his work and his family for a period of nine months.  If that is going to happen then the members of the Fianna Fáil Party are going to tramp, tramp, tramp out their decision through the Division Lobbies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that in some cases which have arisen already people have been organised and are paid by an organisation to smash into those pounds.  We saw in the Cork case that men were employed by an organisation at £2 each.  They were put into a lorry and paid by that organisation to attack and break down a pound, or what may be called a pound because cattle were impounded there.  I have not very much doubt but that that organisation, which is a very influential one, is well able to pay the fines of those men when they are fined. I do not think, unless the Deputy wants to encourage them, that he can excuse in any other way trying to make the penalties as light as possible for people who act in this way.  The Deputy will remember that in those cases it is not the so-called afflicted farmers we hear about.  The big farmer who wants to stand out as a member of an organisation and make a hero of himself by saying he can pay but is not morally liable to pay is not the person who is going to suffer imprisonment.  He will be in the background paying people to do that work for him, as happened in the Cork case.  The unfortunate people who were duped into acting in that way were not people who were concerned with annuities.  One of them was an unfortunate labouring man.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, then, if that man sees the penalty there, as I presume he does see the penalty, if he is paid by these people to do a certain act, I do not think that man is such a fool as to undertake on behalf of any organisation or any people work like that until he has counted the cost.</P>

      <P>Say a poor farmer has his cattle seized by the sheriff for costs in, say, an insurance case, and his cows are put into the pound.  He tries to get to the pound and brings some of his neighbours with him.  He is not allowed to get in.  If he takes an ashplant and hits the wall a stroke, that can be taken as violence, and he can be sentenced to nine months for <Col N="1551" /> that, as the Attorney-General admitted. In these hard times in which the farmers find themselves in circumstances that are abnormal, these men, ordinarily law-abiding citizens, are incensed by the situation in which they find themselves.  I must not be taken as saying that there must be sanction for any breach of the law in any time or place.  But there are circumstances in which people are driven to take steps which in cooler times they would not take.  If in such cases you are to inflict nine months' imprisonment or a fine of £50 for the first offence, I think it is a most outrageous punishment for people who are driven by distress and circumstances.  I suggest that the fine be reduced considerably.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Deputy know that these are the maximum penalties that the justice dealing with the case may impose?  These are the maximum penalties.  If the Deputy wants to look up any other offences that come under the criminal law, he will find that the maximum penalties are extremely high in most cases and that the justice has discretion and can exercise it according to the circumstances connected with any particular case.</P>

      <P>Suppose I go to the pound-keeper and say to him: &ldquo;Look here, the sheriff or whoever is conducting this sale is obviously an unscrupulous person, and he is using the pound of which you are supposed to be in charge, for the purpose of robbing perfectly respectable men, because he is going to knock their cattle down, for a tithe of their value, to John Brown or some other secret service agent sent down by the Government.  These cattle will be got away.  You may have heard what happened in Mullingar, where the legitimate bid of a <i>bona fide</i> farmer was deliberately ignored by the person in charge of the sale.  Now, in the light of these facts, you are a responsible man and you undertook to keep the pound if it was properly conducted.  But you find that the agents of the Government are coming down here and deliberately abusing the facilities afforded by this pound.  Therefore, I suggest to you that you ought to quit the position, <Col N="1552" /> and if you find that you are not in a position to forego the emoluments, I am prepared to put my hand in my pocket in order to save the name of the son of a decent family.  I will give you whatever is needed to make it possible for you to forego the wages you are getting for keeping the pound under these undesirable conditions.&rdquo;  Do I commit a crime if I say that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us get this clear.  If I go to such a man and suggest to him that he should resign, in a perfectly legal way, the office he holds, that is not bribing a servant of the State because the condition precedent to offering him any monetary reward is that he should cease to be a servant of the State.  What this Bill purports to do is to create a new crime.  I want to draw the attention of the House to the fact that so far from attempting to bribe a servant of the State, the man actually ceases to be a servant of the State and that is the condition on which I give him anything. Up to this it was never a crime to say to a person: &ldquo;If you cease to be a servant of the State I am prepared to compensate you for the sacrifice you are making.&rdquo;  Section 9 (d) makes it a crime</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;... for every person who uses violence, threats and bribes for the purpose of inducing or preventing any person who has been appointed under this Act to be a pound-keeper or to be an assistant pound-keeper from undertaking or executing the <Col N="1553" /> office of such keeper or assistant...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So that now we have it made a crime to ask a man to retire from an office which makes it incumbent on him to carry into effect the corrupt purpose of an unscrupulous Minister for Justice or an unscrupulous administrator at a sheriff's sale; but it is also a crime to suggest to a person who contemplates undertaking these duties that he should not undertake them and that if it is a monetary consideration that is inducing him to do what he believes to be wrong that rather than do what is wrong he will make good the money lost by not undertaking the office.  The making of <Col N="1554" /> such a suggestion becomes a crime if this section passes into law and the person is liable to nine months' imprisonment.  It is bad enough to make this a crime but to fix a penalty of nine months' imprisonment for going to a man and saying: &ldquo;You come of respectable people and I want to save you from helping people who are engaged in detestable and unscrupulous acts.&rdquo;  Well, if that is a crime the time will shortly come when we will have to get a licence from the Minister for Justice to bid one another good-morning.</P>

There can be no question of suggesting, on the floor of this House, that any citizen of this State is entitled to break the law as enacted by Oireachtas Eireann.  A <Col N="1556" /> duty devolves upon us to be scrupulous to enact the law in accordance with justice and in accordance with the ordinary demands of society, but, once it is enacted, it is a truism to say that it is binding on every citizen of the State and it is the duty of every citizen to conform to the law until such time as it is amended by the same power that passed it originally.  What I object to is the creation of new crimes without any advertence at all to what we are doing.  I have asked the Minister for Justice if it is his desire to make it a crime to go to a citizen of this State and to say: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil is asking you to discharge duties as pound-keeper which no civilised Government in any country would ask a pound-keeper to discharge; I am prepared to make up to you the tempting fiduciary inducement that the Government offers,&rdquo; and the Minister for Justice comes along and says: &ldquo;That is a crime under Section 9 of the Pounds (Provision and Maintenance) Act,&rdquo; and I can then be sent to jail for nine months because I want to induce a self-respecting man not to degrade himself and all belonging to him by joining in what I believe to be illegal and oppressive sheriffs' sales, which are conducted for the purpose of plundering respectable men of property which ought not to be taken from them.</P>

The section speaks of it as an offence to release from or take out of any pound any animals or goods lawfully impounded therein, but there does not appear to be any provision in the section as to any particular time. Perhaps the Minister can tell us when can cattle be legally removed from the pound once they have been put in the pound.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be glad if the Minister would tell us what he wants this section for.  Under what circumstances does he propose to mandamus the local authority?  If the local authority fails to repair or do any work upon the pound that the county registrar thinks necessary, the county registrar has authority under another section to get the work done himself and serve the bill on the county council.  What are those mandamus powers required for?  If the mandamus powers are for the purpose of compelling a county council to do something that it cannot do, this House should not pass a section authorising mandamus proceedings; because it is of the essence of that writ that it will not issue to command an impossibility.  What is the use of the Minister issuing a mandamus against the Clare County Council to build a pound if the council cannot get the money because the supporters of President de Valera will not pay their rates?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will not pay their rates for the same reason that the ratepayers in several other counties will not pay their rates&mdash;because they cannot pay their rates.  When that situation has developed, what is the use of issuing a writ of mandamus against a county council to find money that is not there?  Surely the Attorney-General will agree with me that no court will issue a writ of mandamus to anybody to do something that is physically impossible for him to do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, it is true.  The Attorney-General will agree with me in that.  I want to ask the Attorney-General what is his view of the wisdom of seeking power to mandamus county councils to find money to do certain things, on the one hand, and of pursuing a policy of stripping the county council of money to do anything, with the other hand.  That is what is being done at present and what Section 10 is for.  Of course, heretofore, the answer of the Minister for Justice was that the county councils can get the money if they will vigorously prosecute the people who are withholding it, because they are merely withholding it in pursuit of a political conspiracy. Now, President de Valera's <Col N="1561" /> supporters are withholding it.  Presumably, they are not in the conspiracy. We cannot believe that the Banner County is going to desert the President, so we must be forced to the conclusion that the fact is that they are not able to pay&mdash;a conclusion which we have been trying to force into the heads of the Government for the past 12 months.  What is the point, then, of seeking powers to mandamus local authorities?  Surely, the Minister ought to face facts and realise that he cannot get blood out of a turnip or water out of a stone; that he may get all the powers of mandamus and <i>certiorari</i> and all the rest, but if the money has been stripped from the people by the consummate folly of Fianna Fáil, the High Courts, by mandamus or otherwise, cannot knock it out of the county councils, because the county councils are not able to get it from the people whom Fianna Fáil have beggared.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the use of having the same argument repeated <i>ad nauseam?</i>  Deputy Dillon gets up on one section after another and repeats the same thing.  There are <Col N="1562" /> county councils paying their way. There are county councils which are very far from being in the condition the Deputy pictures here.  The object of this mandamus as an alternative is to compel county councils to provide pounds, and it is not intended to be used for any other purpose.  If, as Deputy Dillon tried to picture, the county councils find themselves not in a position to get the money, then the mandamus proceedings would be of no effect.  It is all right if Deputy Dillon wishes to believe that, but people on this side of the House do not believe it, and the facts do not prove it. Deputy Dillon may wish to make the most of any little indication there was of slackness in some counties in the collection of rates.  That is not something that happened this year for the first time.  Various county councils have, for years past, been in arrears with rates; but those county councils which have been pushed on have been able to get the rates in.  When the rate collection is closed, I am quite satisfied that the position will be very far from what the Deputy desires.</P>

      <Col N="1566" /> Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that owing to the increasing distress of the farming community arising out of the continuance of the economic war, the Executive Council should take steps to relieve agricultural land of rates during the financial year 1934-'35.&mdash;(Thomas O'Higgins, Timothy O'Donovan).</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that Deputy Hugo Flinn was in possession when this debate was adjourned on the last occasion.  I was rather waiting to see if the Deputy would resume the debate.  This motion has been on the Paper for a considerable time, as can be seen from the motion itself.  It refers to taking &ldquo;steps to relieve agricultural land of rates during the financial year 1934-'35.&rdquo;  That should now be 1935'36.  But when this motion was put on the Paper it was evident to most people who were in touch with agricultural conditions that such relief was necessary for the farming community.  That relief, necessary and all as it was at that time, is much more necessary at present. Because those members of the House who are members of local authorities are aware the conditions are considerably worse to-day than they were 12 months ago, and that as a result of the action taken by the Government in withholding the agricultural grants from the county councils because of the non-payment of land annuities, most if not all the county councils in the country to-day find themselves in a very difficult position, to say the least of it.  The amounts withheld in many counties will mean a very substantial and a very heavy increase on the existing rate that has has been struck if the services are to be maintained. At the moment I am not quite clear as to the amount which it is proposed to withhold from us in Tipperary.  We have two county <Col N="1567" /> councils in Tipperary.  It has been intimated to the North Tipperary County Councils that a very substantial sum is to be withheld.  I am speaking from recollection.  The sum mentioned in the statement issued by the Department of Local Government and Public Health recently to be withheld up to the 31st of March was something in the neighbourhood of £44,000.  That is equal, I think, to about 4/- in the £ in the rates in North Tipperary.  Surely, no person and no member of the Fianna Fáil Party, even those members who try to convince us that as a result of the economic war there is no very great hardship placed on the farmers&mdash;will suggest for a moment that it would be possible for the ratepayers to meet such an increase as that.</P>
      <P>In mentioning the figure £44,000, I am speaking subject to correction.  I am not certain that that is the figure but so far as I can recollect that was the figure mentioned for North Tipperary in the statement issued, as I say, by the Department of Local Government some time ago.  In any case, it is absolutely clear that, as a result of the withholding of the agricultural grant, there must be an increase in the rates, if the services are to be maintained at the same level, not to mention county councils going in for heavier expenditure, as many of them would have to do if the ratepayers in different counties were in a position to bear the cost.  I think it is clear to most people who are conversant with affairs in rural parts of the country that even prior to the economic war and prior to the very substantial reductions in the price of live stock and so on, most people found it difficult enough to meet their annual demands for rates, and I think it will be admitted that one of the farmer's principal outgoings, one of the heaviest charges he has to meet in the course of the year, is the payment of his rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Motion asks that they should be relieved from that burden during the continuance of the economic war. I think that is a fair demand to make particularly to a Government which <Col N="1568" /> definitely promised, when seeking the confidence of the people, that they would derate agricultural land in this country.  I know that, since the Fianna Fáil Party came into power, they have on many occasions tried to deny that that promise was ever made or that those statements were made throughout the country, but I do not think that denial was meant seriously because it can be so easily rebutted. I heard it myself on many occasions during election campaigns and I have a very distinct recollection of one very keenly contested by-election, and, if I might say so, that was the real bait, the carrot, that was held out by the Fianna Fáil Party at that time&mdash;the withholding of £3,000,000 by way of annuities, £2,000,000 of which were to be devoted to the complete derating of agricultural land.  The case was then made by every member of the Fianna Fáil Party that the farmers could not continue in farming unless they got the benefit of derating and if that was the position at that time, how much more necessary is it now?</P>
    <P>My friend, Deputy Corry, speaking here last Thursday night, enumerated for us all the splendid and profitable crops which this Government had provided for the farmer and when I suggested to him that, according to his statement, the farmers must be very prosperous, he said that, indeed, they were not.  The Deputy, of course, was quite right as he usually is.  They are not prosperous.  Deputy Corry, I recollect, both inside and outside this House, before he became a respectable member of a respectable Government, on all occasions, and on some occasions when he was not in order tried the patience of this House advocating complete derating for the agricultural community of this country.  The Deputy made a very good case when he told us that the farmers were carrying the whole country on their backs and that they were so crushed that unless they got this relief it would be utterly impossible for them to carry on.  The Deputy, as a matter of fact, was one of those who was largely responsible for converting me on this question of derating.  The argument for derating <Col N="1569" /> to-day is much stronger and much more clear and the case can be made with much more confidence as to the inability of the farmers to meet these rates than it could have been made three or four years ago.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this matter which, I think, ought to commend itself to this House.  If the Minister withholds these moneys, which he says he will withhold, and if county councils are deprived of those moneys, unless they strike a very much higher rate, the services which are usually carried on by local authorities will suffer and many things will flow from that, not the least of which will be a considerable number added to the already very much swollen numbers of unemployed.  I had expected&mdash;I still have some faith in our friends on the opposite side&mdash;that this motion would have been accepted at the beginning. If it had been accepted at the time it was put on the Order Paper, the farmers would have been relieved of a considerable burden.  We hear from time to time that there is a conspiracy against the payment of rates.  So far as I am personally concerned, I know of no such conspiracy and, if there was such a conspiracy, I certainly would not stand for it for one moment. I believe the farmers of this country&mdash; it does not matter what their political affiliations may be&mdash;are finding it very difficult and, in some cases, perhaps, impossible, to meet the charges made upon them and I am quite satisfied that there are many Fianna Fáil farmers who find it as difficult and who find it impossible to meet these charges in the shape of ratés as farmers who are supporters of the U.I.P., or any other Party.</P>
    <P>We have to realise that it is not a political question but that it is an economic question for the farmers.  It is a question of a man not being able to walk into a fair, as he could a few years ago, and be sure of being able to sell his stock and to sell at a good price.  Deputy Corry, or some other Deputy, may tell us that they are getting so much for wheat and so much for beet and so on, but that does not obtain all over the country.  There are <Col N="1570" /> farmers who, perhaps unfortunately for themselves, cannot grow either wheat or beet and cannot take advantage of these fairly heavily subsidised crops because of the nature of their land.  I know, and there are other members of this House who know farmers who are in the position of having to depend absolutely on the few cattle they bring to the fair, and not only is the price of that particular type of beast very much reduced, but cattle of that particular class are almost unsaleable at the moment.  I suggest to the House that it is very difficult indeed for those men to meet the demands made upon them in the form of rates and I suggest that before voting on this question, if there is going to be a vote, members on the opposite side should throw their minds back two or three years and remember the views they then held and to which they gave expression and try to be consistent.  If they are, I have no doubt that this Motion will be carried.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In rising to conclude the discussion on this motion standing in my name and in the name of Deputy O'Donovan, namely, that the rates on agricultural land shall be remitted for the financial year just drawing to a close owing to the inability of the farmers to pay their rates, one would think that on a motion such as that, in times such as these, with the whole machinery of the Government, military, police and others, utilised in order to wring the last shilling out of the farmers towards the payment of overhead charges, at least this much was due to the farmers, that when a matter of this kind was under discussion some Minister who represents an agricultural area would stand up and have sufficient courage to speak for that motion or make a case against it if a case could be made.  There are ten or 12 Government Ministers and four Parliamentary Secretaries.  Two of those Ministers represent city constituencies and one Parliamentary Secretary represents a city constituency, and the only speakers we have had from the Government Bench are the two purely city Ministers and one purely city Parliamentary Secretary. <Col N="1571" /> I do not think that is creditable; I do not think that is facing up to the job either as a Minister or a representative of a constituency.</P>
      <P>If there is a case to be made against this motion, if anyone has a case to make to demonstrate the capacity of the farmer to pay, surely the House was entitled to have that case made. Surely Ministers are not usually such a row of dummies that, when a vital matter arises affecting the main industry of the country and the backbone of their constituency and the class in their constituency most deluded by their own promises, some voice of a Minister representing an agricultural constituency might have been heard. Surely it is a motion on which the Minister for Agriculture might have had something to say.  Not one of those Ministers was so very modest or meek when any question affecting rates came up a few years ago when they were sitting over here, without any economic war and with prices some 40 or 50 per cent. higher than they are now.  One after another they all jumped up to point out the urgent necessity of reducing the overhead charges of the farmers of Ireland.  Is there anyone prepared to justify that slick political game, that shirking of Government responsibility, when a motion of this kind is taken, that no Minister representing a rural constituency will have the courage to say either &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No,&rdquo; taking no action beyond tramping into the Division Lobby against this motion in the hope that his constituents will never hear it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When President de Valera spoke on this question from that seat there, time and time again he told us that any aids to agriculture, short of reducing the overhead charges, would be merely so much useless effort, merely shirking the real way to help agriculture, which is to reduce overhead charges.  When there is a motion to do that, in face of a falling market and in face of the economic war, surely we were entitled to hear some word from the President as to whether he had a view one way or the other or <Col N="1572" /> whether views recently expresed, when he was striving to get over there, were only the protestations, so much cheap chaff of a politician thrown out to catch so many sparrows.  Surely the word of the leader of the then Opposition, who is now President, is of some importance to Ministers and Deputies opposite, and the House was surely entitled to some explanation as to why every promise made by that man in his reckless scramble into power should be now tramped on by the votes of himself and his followers.  It is true the Vice-President made a very feeble attempt to dispute the fact that that promise was ever made by President de Valera.  He played around the word &ldquo;would,&rdquo; as if that promise was contained only in one speech.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Corry at least on his straightforward honesty when he admitted that that promise was made, that he stood for it, but that since that he had changed his mind because he had discovered that a freeholder would get the benefit of it as well as the annuitant.  That, at all events, was an honest statement in contrast to the hair-splitting attempted evasion of the Vice-President when he quoted one speech of the President in which the word &ldquo;would&rdquo; was used. I will quote a speech in which the word &ldquo;will&rdquo; was used:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The overhead charges of the farmers are too heavy for them and must be lightened.  One of the heaviest of these charges is the burden of local rates.  We propose to derate agricultural holdings. They are derated in Britain and the Six Counties.  Two of the £3,000,000 unjustly taken away from us every year in land annuities will suffice for this derating.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was a speech by President de Valera, reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> on 18th February, 1932.  Where is the word &ldquo;would&rdquo; in that speech? &ldquo;Will&rdquo; is there; &ldquo;would&rdquo; is in the other speeches.  Why is &ldquo;will&rdquo; here and &ldquo;would&rdquo; in the others?  Because that speech was three weeks nearer to a general election and he had to come out flat with it; statements had to be made in a manner that would leave no <Col N="1573" /> room for doubt in the minds of any of his farming audience.  It is as clear and definite a statement as was ever made by any man holding a responsible position.  When a motion is put down here merely to honour that word given in public, to honour a pledge that carried with it the votes of 300,000 or 400,000 trusting farmers, there is absolute silence from the man who made the promise.</P>
    <P>With public platforms treated in that discreditable manner, with words bandied about merely as the reckless statements of individuals to serve a purpose for the time being, can we be surprised if constitutionalism is running with a halt up and down this land?  Can we be surprised if the State is shaken by the sapping of subterranean forces, and can we be surprised if hundreds and thousands are flocking to the standard and the ranks of unconstitutional parties in this country?  Is it not well-known that if you want the constitution and the State respected, respect must begin on top?  An example must be set by public men themselves, placing reliance on their own statements and carrying out their own promises.</P>
    <P>In a country with a tradition such as this country has, and with a background and history such as ours, if we shake the faith of the public in the constitutional machinery of the State, we blast any hope that any of us had of ever getting this country trained back along steady constitutional lines.</P>
    <P>We had few Deputies and Ministers opposite who did not speak, and in the speeches that were made we had as much confusion as was ever heard since the Tower of Babel.  We had the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Department of Finance explaining, at great pains and length, why, in fact this motion was necessary; explaining by a comprehensive survey of world conditions how agriculture had been set back, how profits had disappeared, how the markets were slumping, not only in this country, but all over the world.  Then, we had a feeble effort by the Minister <Col N="1574" /> for Local Government and Public Health.  He told us, on the word of a parish priest, that agriculture was never more prosperous in this country. Here we have a Government Front Bench&mdash;the war lords of an economic war&mdash;and when the front line casualties are under survey, and when we inquire into the whole agricultural position, the only expert that can be quoted on agriculture is an Irish parish priest.  To show the Vice-President's extensive knowledge of agriculture, he told us that this parish priest said that agriculture was not so bad because, although money had been lost in the first year of the economic war, in the second year the farmers bought their young cattle cheap.  I wonder does the Minister think that young cattle and calves grow on hawthorn bushes, or that the farmers bought those young cattle at the post office or in Woolworth's Stores?  Did it ever strike the Minister to inquire where the farmer bought those young cattle cheap?  They were not bought from bakers or from Dublin publicans.  They were bought from other farmers.  If any clear picture were required of how this economic war is hitting the very small farmers, it was the quotation from the Irish parish priest that was given by the Minister for Local Government. Having launched into a clerical atmosphere, however, it did not suffice the Minister merely to quote a parish priest as an authority on agriculture. He had to go one further, and I think that some word of protest is desirable.  He quoted, as an argument against this motion and as an argument to illustrate the capacity of the farmers to pay their rates, the fact that they had subscribed well and generously to the building of a cathedral in Mullingar.  I think that kind of argument should not be used. It is well-known in this country that out of their poverty the people have always subscribed to such purposes, and it will be helpful neither to the building of a cathedral nor the collection of dues, nor to any other such purpose, if the amount of a collection is to be used as an argument here to show the prosperity of farmers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1575" /> We have this motion moved in the light of events which are happening in the country.  No matter which side of the House we are on we know that every farmer in this country, big and small, is getting rapidly poorer and poorer.  The various Bills that have been brought in here in order to plug holes in a leaking barrel were all justified from the Government Front Bench on the grounds that something has got to be done; that the bottom has gone out of the cattle market; that England has shoved up tariffs against us and introduced quotas, and that something has got to be done to save that particular industry from complete ruination. We have the knowledge that, whether it is a Fianna Fáil county, a Fine Gael county, or a Commissioner county, a most dismal picture is presented of the increasing accumulation of unpaid rates, and we have, owing to that, the threatened annihilation of social services. We have the bailiff and the sheriff, the armoured cars and all the rest of it, busy from morning to night in frenzied attempts to get in either rates or annuities.  In that particular set of circumstances a motion is put down, to remit the rates and, incidentally, to keep the President's promise, and the answer to that is to tell us that a cathedral has been subscribed for generously in the town of Mullingar.</P>
    <P>As far as any other Front Bench attempt was made to meet it, it was a survey of world agricultural conditions, merely to prove up to the hilt the necessity for some such step in this country. I do not think that that is a square way to face up to this.  There is, and there was, a responsibility on those sitting opposite, before they put a body of people through the mill, to prove that there was the wherewithal to pay.  An attempt was made to show that there was a political conspiracy for the non-payment of rates and that that political conspiracy was sponsored or fathered by this Party over here.  If there were any truth in that it would go to show that the counties in which we had the greatest influence would be the County of Clare and the County of Kerry.  I do not say that those counties are particularly bad in their payment of rates <Col N="1576" /> because they are so pronouncedly Fianna Fáil, but I mention that as an answer to that particular charge.  It was not believed at the time it was made and it is not believed by anybody who listens to it.</P>
    <P>I do not want to hark back any distance, but I am entitled to say this: that the people and the personnel who constitute this Party have given ample evidence time and again of their desire for the strength and stability of this State and of every institution in the State, whether it is local government or central government, and that in the long run the people who built up the State would lose more by the destruction of that State than the people who came in merely to occupy it and enjoy a comfortable position when the State was fairly firmly established.  This motion was put down mainly with the intention of averting bankruptcy in local administration.  It was also put down in an attempt to equate the losses and the hardships of the economic war.  The economic war came about because of a squabble between Governments.  It led to the losing of practically 50 per cent. of the market on which this country lived.  It led directly to the reduction in the prices of agricultural commodities by about 50 per cent.  It was a war started by politicians and carried on by politicians, and it is unfair and unjust that one class of the community, the class that suffered most, should be left to suffer entirely alone.</P>
    <P>The proposal to remit the rates on agricultural land amounts to this: that the sum required for these rates will be borne by all the people; that it will come out of central funds. It does not mean that the other classes should step in and pay what the farmers paid heretofore. The farmer is a taxpayer the same as the rest of us.  It is a case of spreading all over some of the losses arising from this economic war.  Just as there was a responsibility on Ministers, which was shirked, to make a case against this motion, there is equally a responsibility on every Deputy to justify before his constituents his vote in this House, if he votes against this motion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1577" /> Deputies opposite know as well as I do that the main part of their political success in rural Ireland was due to the President's clearly-put promise to derate agricultural land.  The time has come when it is a vital necessity that that action should be taken.  It is for Deputies opposite to make a choice now as to whether they will relieve to a certain extent the most hard-pressed of their constituents and the principal casualties of the economic war, and, at the same time, honour their leader's <Col N="1578" /> word; or vote the other way and go back to their constituents and say, as was said from the Front Bench opposite, that if the farmers are not paying their rates and annuities it is because of a political conspiracy; that they have the money, but will not pay.  They will go back down to those areas and tell the people that President de Valera when he was making those promises was only looking for votes and never meant to keep such promises.</P>

      <P>I withdraw that.  Over a year ago&mdash;to be exact, on the 19th December, 1933&mdash;the British Government made an order that from and after 1st January, 1934, until 31st March, 1934, the numbers of fat cattle allowed into Britain and Northern Ireland from the Free State would be subject to a quota, fixed at, I think, 50 per cent. of the numbers exported in the corresponding months of the previous year.  The Minister for Agriculture <Col N="1581" /> who, of course, like the other Ministers of the Government, had a plan, was aware of this fact on the 20th December, 1933.  He had 11 or 12 days until the 1st January, 1934.  In that period he apparently did nothing.  He waited.  He got the licences from the British Government for distribution here from the 1st January onward. Instead of about 16,000 to 20,000 fat cattle going over in January, something like 8,000 or 9,000 licences were sent to our Minister from Britain.  He made no attempt, and the Department of Agriculture made no attempt, to allocate those licences to the people who should get them.  The Minister simply called in a few dealers and he gave the licences to the dealers.  This was in the best month of the year for selling stall-fed cattle on the British market.  Just before the Scotch and English beef was coming on the British market, when the price was highest there and the demand keenest, he gave the licences to the dealers.  There were somewhere about nine or ten thousand of them, representing licences to export just half the number of fat cattle that were exported in January, 1933.  I should have said that the census afterwards showed that there were slightly more cattle tied up for stall-feeding in January, 1934, than there were in January, 1933, so that there were in January, 1934, at least 20,000 fat cattle available, ready and fit for shipment to Britain for slaughter.  The British Government, saying: &ldquo;You can only ship half of them by licence,&rdquo; hands those licences to our Minister for Agriculture, who hands them to the dealers, so that the dealers went out to buy nine or ten thousand fat cattle in a market where there were 20,000 cattle offering for sale.  If they could not be exported there was no other market for them, because beyond and above that number was a number which filled the markets for home requirements. When the dealers went out to buy those cattle, those generous-minded fellows of course gave two prices for them. There were two cattle offering for the one vacancy, with the result that in a few days the licences jumped up to £6 and £7.  The Minister knew that and he took no steps to remedy the <Col N="1582" /> situation.  He will remember that a deputation waited on him on the 19th January, 1934.  We met the Minister in the board-room of the Department of Agriculture.  He quickly and frankly agreed that the ideal way of distributing those licences and allocating them was to the feeders, but he decided it could not be done.  We expressed surprise that it could not be done.  We said to the Minister that had we at our disposal the organisation or rather, the organisations that we had, we could get a census good enough for working purposes of all the cattle in the Free State within one week, that is to say, the cattle that were tied up and being stall-fed.  He, of course, in his usual easy way said &ldquo;nonsense.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we left that meeting a couple of us from the County Dublin went up to the County Dublin Committee of Agriculture.  I was then chairman of the committee.  I directed the secretary to put in advertisements in the daily papers.  It was, I think, on Saturday or Friday that we met the Minister. The advertisements requested stall-feeders in the County Dublin to supply the secretary of the County Committee of Agriculture, by the following Tuesday, with the numbers of cattle they were stall-feeding; when they tied them up, and when they expected to have them ready for the butcher.  We requested them to have that information in by the following Tuesday, and we directed the secretary to tabulate it for us.  When we met on the following Wednesday we had the information before us tabulated.  It was on that information that the County Dublin was worked.  We produced this census to the Minister, and we said: &ldquo;We in the County Dublin could do this within a week.&rdquo;  The Minister had a notice from the British Government from the 20th of December, 1933, to the 1st of January, 1934, yet he made no attempt to make any census of the cattle that were being stall-fed.  In fact he agreed on the 19th January, 1934, that the feeders should get the licences, but that it was impossible to take a census of the cattle that were being stall-fed. But the proof that the thing was feasible and that we were right was in our taking the census.  We showed <Col N="1583" /> that it was practicable to give the licences to the stall-feeders.  The Minister got to work, and by the 1st February he was able to allocate 50 per cent. of the export licences to the feeders.  By the 14th February he was allocating to them 100 per cent. of the licences.  The Minister will readily admit that during the month of January, 1934, approximately 10,000 fat cattle were shipped out of this country to Great Britain under licence. These licences were given to the shippers. I think most of the licences were given to people who, under the Aliens Bill, would come under what would be called aliens.  A very big chunk of these licences were given to the John Browns.</P>

      <P>I have; I bought it in the market this morning.  At least 10,000 fat cattle passed out of the country in that month, and at £6 a head that was equal to handing £60,000 as a free gift to the shippers. That money was taken out of the pockets of the producers.  I would like the Minister to explain whether those licences were not sold at £6 apiece; whether 10,000 fat cattle under licence were not exported in the month of January last year; and whether that £60,000 was not taken out of the pockets of the producers and handed over to the shippers.  I should say, at a rough guess, that 50 per cent. of those shippers were from Northern Ireland or Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not Deputy Corry's fault if they did not.  In the month of February, when a further 10,000 cattle were exported, licences in respect of 2,500 of these cattle were given to the shippers and from the middle of February up to what exact date I cannot say, they were given to the feeders and the feeders generally expressed great dissatisfaction with the manner in which they allocated. The Minister has been asked many times to explain the method of allocation.  He has been asked to keep a register in his Department, somewhat similar in principle to the register of bacon curers and pork butchers which he contemplates being kept in his Department to show the people who are registered curers and registered pork butchers, and also the registered slaughterers of cattle under the Slaughter of Cattle Act.  Why would he not keep a register in his Department showing to whom licences were allocated if there was not something&mdash;to put it mildly&mdash;wrong with the method of allocation?</P>
      <P>Coming near the end of the stall-fed season, people, in desperation, had to let their cattle on the grass.  The Minister told us here, speaking of the stall-feeding season of 1933-'34, that at one time it was thought that there would be a surplus of fat cattle but it turned out that there was no surplus. Of course, there was no surplus because people got rid of them at any price.  When they saw no hope of getting licences and no hope of selling the cattle as beef, they let out the cattle and tried to sell them as stores, and did sell many of them as stores. The Minister said they got rid of them somehow.  You can get rid of anything anyhow, provided you are prepared to bear the loss, but the Minister cannot suggest that people did not get rid of them at a terrific loss, which has its repercussions now and which, perhaps, played no small part in producing the Pounds Bill we have just put through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1585" /> Then, during the summer months, the Minister changed his policy.  He did not give the licences to the feeders. He gave them again to the shippers and, again, these licences were hawked about by all sorts and conditions of people.  People who never owned a four-footed beast in their lives were able to sell licences.  Would one not expect the Minister to take very stringent measures to prevent this traffic in licences?  He has taken no measures.  He has acknowledged that he knows it is going on and if any hawker produces a licence for a store beast now and gets £1 for it and for a fat beast gets £4 or £5 for it, out of whose pocket is that coming? &mdash;out of the pocket of the producer of that fat beast somewhere or the store beast, as the case may be.  Why does the Minister not endeavour to protect the producers?  He has failed, in my opinion, to do so and it is a justification, if there was no other, for passing this Motion.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture costs us £700,000 or £800,000 a year.  The numbers of cattle allowed to be exported are known to the Minister a fortnight, I think, before each exporting period of a fortnight.  He knows how many cattle and the different categories of cattle which can be exported during the following fortnight. The Minister was of opinion, a year ago, anyway, that the producers of those cattle should get the export licences.  I take it that he is of that opinion still.  If he is not, I should like to hear him in a justification of the opposite opinion and also in justification of his change of mind, but I do not think he has changed his mind. I think that, in principle, he still holds that the producers of the animals should get the export licences.  That being so, has he attempted to formulate a scheme by which those licences could be distributed, as they should be distributed, to the producers, or has he simply thrown up his hands, as he did in the first instance when the quota system was introduced in 1934, and said: &ldquo;It cannot be done?&rdquo; If he has, it is worthy of notice, and very serious notice, not only by this House but by the people <Col N="1586" /> of this country, that we have it from the Minister in charge of the Department of Agriculture, which is costing this poor little impoverished State £700,000 or £800,000 a year, that at all the big officials and experts we are told are there, with all their brains and experience and expert knowledge, are not able to formulate a scheme by which the licences for the export of cattle can be distributed by a fool-proof system to the producers of the cattle to be exported.</P>
    <P>That is terrible condemnation of that Ministry&mdash;the very fact that the Minister acknowledges that it is a desirable thing to do but that, although the Department is costing the country £700,000 or £800,000 a year, and perhaps more, he is not able to do it. Why?  It is due to this House to know why he is not able to do it.  I guarantee to the Minister that, in less than a month, I would do it and that is no empty boast.  I guaranteed to the Minister in his own Department on 19th January, 1934, that we could do it and we convinced the Minister within a fortnight that it could be done.  The best proof of that assertion is that it was done by the Minister and I challenge contradiction upon it. Now, this can be done and why does the Minister not do it?  If it is not done, and if there is no attempt to do it, the Minister and his Department and the whole Government that stands for it deserve the severest censure.</P>
    <P>I made a suggestion here in a previous debate about those licences. The suggestion merely occurred to me at the moment and I did not see any flaw in it.  The Minister said that my suggestion was not practicable.  The suggestion was that all licences should be marked &ldquo;non-transferable&rdquo; and anybody found with a licence not issued to him should be treated precisely as a man found illegally in the possession of a cheque.  In that manner you would very quickly stop the traffic in licences.  The licences do not belong to the Minister, the drover, the fellow with the fish and chip shop, the fellow gathering scrap iron or the school teacher; they belong to the farmers to whom they are issued.  I can produce the names and <Col N="1587" /> addresses of people following the callings I have mentioned who have trafficked in cattle licences.  Why are no steps taken to stop that traffic?  I challenge any Deputy to deny that a licence is worth £7.  Permitting a practice like that robs the owner of a beast of about £7.  The Minister has connived at that, has failed in his duty by not even trying to stop it.  If he has tried I am sure he must not have been able to devise a scheme by which he could stop it.  Whether he did not try or whether he failed in trying is immaterial.  The Department and the Government are deserving of censure because of their neglect or incompetency.</P>
    <P>The quota produced a surplus of cattle.  We were told that poor Britain was shrivelling up, was not able to buy any beast, the people were turning to fish and chips and bread and tea.  Yet during that period they consumed more meat in Britain than they ever consumed in a similar period throughout their history.  The Minister said that the licence and quota system were introduced because the Minister of Agriculture wanted to save British agriculture because it was on its last legs, breathing its last.  He did not put the true picture before this House, that the British realised, in the middle of December, 1933, and it was published in their journals, that if they allowed the importation of Irish live stock as in the previous season, they would have more money collected by the 31st March than they wanted.  They wanted only a certain amount and they regulated the importation of live stock to give them that and they were only out £1,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the people got rid of their cattle anyhow.  At the time they did.  Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof&mdash;that is the principle the Minister adopted on that occasion. Did they get rid of their cattle?  Did he announce that there was a surplus of cattle?  Hence the Slaughter of Animals Bill, the registration and the army of officials which had to be carried on the backs of the cattle trade, the producers, who had already <Col N="1588" /> been robbed by the negligence of the Minister who gave licences to the exporters instead of to the producers. An army of officials was let loose; we had the registration of slaughterhouses, the registration and numbering of cattle, the examination of them as to their fitness for slaughter and so on.  A price was fixed to deal with the surplus and the Minister said he would insist on that price being paid for cattle.  He was told here that he could not fix that price and he knows that he could not get it.  He knows that even a reduced price could not be got.</P>
    <P>The other day a man who sold cattle in the Dublin market showed me a docket marked £11 10s. per head for cattle.  The price the man actually got was £7 5s.  I warned the Minister when the Bill was going through of the very thing that happened a couple of weeks ago in the Dublin market. I told him that no matter what price he fixed, if I were confronted by a butcher who offered to buy my cattle at 17/- or 19/- a cwt. and I considered it was the most I could get for them, I would be prepared to give him a receipt for 25/-.  I could not very well bring home cattle that I had fattened.  They would be a dead loss because they would be consuming more food.  I would be prepared to take 17/- or 18/- a cwt. for them. The Minister well knew the position that made it imperative to bring in that Bill.  He knew the position was that we had five cattle with an outlet for only three.  He tried to camouflage that position and fix a price that he could not get.  I may remind the Minister that he threatened to issue an order that cattle for export should be bought in the Dublin market at 25/- a cwt.  He was beseeched by exporters not to issue that order but he did issue it, and the moment he issued that order, cattle went down 50/- a head.  Why?  They went down because the British let loose frozen meat on the English market&mdash;increased quantities of frozen meat&mdash;filled the demand there and consequently there was less of a demand for our cattle. When those facts are reviewed, it <Col N="1589" /> shows that the Minister did not present the case fairly when he said that the cattle, during the season we are discussing and the season to which this Motion applies, were got rid of somehow.  They were not got rid of. They were there anyhow, because there was no way to get rid of them. They were there, and the Minister had to tackle the problem by means of the Slaughter of Animals Bill.  Then, in order to prevent a recurrence of that position, he started at the baby cattle.  The only solution of the cattle problem in this country was the slaughter of the innocents, and I think he accomplished the slaughter of 130,000 or 150,000 suck calves.  The skins of those calves were exported at, I think, 10/6 or 9/6 apiece and there was a bounty of, I think, 10/- apiece given on them.  It would be better to burn the whole of them than to have any more truck with them.  That was the solution of that end of the trade.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take this dissussion outside its proper limits.  I would like to confine it.  I do not want to go over the whole field of the economic war.  I want to touch on the economic war, if at all, as lightly as possible.  My views on the economic war are well-known and my attitude towards the Government, in the position in which it is now with regard to the economic war, is equally well-known.  All this thing that I have gone over in making a case for the adoption of this Motion is due entirely to the economic dispute. I admit that the Government have a mandate for the economic war.  They also have a duty to use every honourable means in their power to try to bring an end to that dispute.  When I say that, I do not advise the Government to settle at any price, but the country wants them to put a face on things and make some attempt at a settlement or at least let the country know where we stand as regards the economic dispute.  There is no use in trying to camouflage it by saying that we are losing nothing, that the market is gone, thank goodness, and all that sort of talk.  We know that is only child's talk.  Without question, it is the best market in the world.  Even <Col N="1590" /> countries bordering on or surrounding big centres of population in Europe look upon the British market as the best market in the world.  Why should it not be the best market in the world for us when it is the nearest?  It is not the nearest market to Denmark, Lithuania, Esthonia, Latvia, or Sweden.  They have the German and the Belgian market nearer to them, but they find the British market the best of the lot, whereas we start rambling over Europe looking for markets that do not exist.</P>
    <P>What I am suggesting is that every effort should be made to settle the economic war and that we ought to be let know where we stand in this matter.  Is it ever going to be settled? Is any attempt being made to settle it? I do not want to be told that this is whinging, that it is squealing.  Nobody wants trouble in his private business. Nobody wants obstacles thrown in his way, and the people who have obstacles thrown in their way in their private business are going to suffer in their private business, and they are going to make every attempt to get those obstacles removed.  This economic dispute interferes with the private business of the agricultural industry in this country which is the basis of every other economic activity in the country. Meet any man you like in this country and ask him how does this economic dispute stand.  Nobody knows how it stands.  Nobody knows where it was left on the last occasion on which there was anything about it. People say, &ldquo;Well, Germany refused to pay, France refused to pay, and Britain refused to pay.  Why should we not refuse to pay?&rdquo;  But that is not the position.  That is not the case. That is not the cause of the economic war.  I do not question the right of the Government to put up their case for the economic war.  They have got a mandate from the country, but surely they also have a duty to the country, and that is to assure the country that they are not failing in their endeavours to settle that economic war. Other Parties in this House have been taunted with playing England's game in this dispute.  Will the Government <Col N="1591" /> make a gesture to other Parties in this House for a national effort to have this economic war settled?  Let the Government put their cards on the table.  If they do that, then the country will be wiser and will know better where it stands.</P>
    <P>The second motion that we are discussing within the range of this discussion is:</P>
    <P>That the Dáil requests the Government, in order to maintain the present area under tillage and to prevent wholesale unemployment, to take immediate steps to secure a market for our 58 per cent. of surplus stall-fed cattle and, failing to do so, to purchase the said cattle from the feeders at the price ruling in the British market.</P>
    <P>Of course the Government have failed, or did fail a year ago, to find a market for that 58 per cent. of surplus stall-fed cattle.  At the meeting we had with the Minister on the 19th January last year, that was the figure discussed. At that interview it was brought out that the effect of the British quota would be to leave on our hands a surplus of 58 per cent. of stall-fed cattle. It was there that I got that figure.  The Minister himself discussed that figure. He did not question it.  I cannot say how it was arrived at, but it was freely discussed at that meeting.  I am not the author of the figure.  Taking that as a basis, we had no market for the surplus, and we have no market still.  I do not know how failure to provide that market last year affected the number of cattle tied up for stall-feeding this year, but I know that the operation of the quota system and the bounty system confronted the Minister with a problem a few months ago when he found that there was too high a proportion of old cattle to young cattle in the country.  There was a bit of a panic and the Minister withdrew the bounty for the younger cattle, because at the eleventh hour he tumbled to the fact that disaster would occur if a position was to arise that a generation of young cattle had been sold and shipped to Great Britain because of the price offered and, that an older generation, <Col N="1592" /> or two generations, were being left on the people's hands.</P>
    <P>For those who know nothing about agriculture&mdash;and that applies to practically all on the Government Benches at the moment&mdash;I have to go into some details about that.  Old cattle are no use on a farm&mdash;they have to be got rid of at any price.  The Minister withdrew the bounty for the younger cattle, but continued it for the older ones in order to encourage the shipment of these cattle.  He did more.  A &ldquo;line&rdquo; was got on the British Government. All that the country was told&mdash;and I suppose in the opinion of the Government it is all that the country is entitled to know&mdash;was that some message was sent to the High Commissioner in London to have a talk with somebody connected with the British Government.  That talk took place and it was arranged that the policy of Dean Swift, which has been so often quoted, &ldquo;burn everything English but her coal,&rdquo; should be reversed.  Then the patriots who on one Sunday preached Dean Swift's policy, the following Sunday preached the reverse and advised their poor deluded followers to burn nothing but English coal and that England would take our cattle.</P>

I think that was the bargain, though nobody ever saw the agreement.  If ever there was a secret agreement deliberately entered into between two States it was the coal-cattle pact.  So secret was it that even to this day the man who signed it on behalf of this country&mdash;if it was ever signed&mdash;is ashamed to admit that he signed it.</P>

      <P>This motion requests the Government to maintain the area under tillage by providing a market for the surplus cattle.  The Minister's reply to that is characteristic&mdash;that you can grow three or four cereal crops without any farmyard manure.  To grow three cereal crops in succession or in four, five or six years' rotation is no different from the action of a highwayman who goes into a bank and robs it.  In one case, money belonging to thrifty citizens is plundered; in the other case, the fertility of the soil, built up by good farming in the past, is robbed by a bad system.  That system is now being &ldquo;put over&rdquo; on the country.  It is a system which cannot be maintained without doing irreparable damage to the fertility of the soil and, ultimately, reducing the productivity of the soil to a considerable extent.  It may even run the soil out.  Apart from the manurial value to the soil by stall-feeding, there is another and more important side to the question&mdash;the purely commercial side.  No crops that can be grown in this country are wholly and immediately convertible into human food.  Sixty to 80 per cent. of the crops that can be grown here are not immediately available in their existing form as human food.  They can only be converted into food by feeding them to live stock.  Therefore, to make any form of agricultural economy profitable, the live-stock end must be the largest end.  From 60 to 80 per cent. of the crops produced by the soil must be fed to these animals.  Therefore, 60 to 80 per cent. of the productivity of the soil cannot be allowed to go at a loss.  No business could survive if 80 per cent. of it was run at a loss.  The remaining 20 per cent. could not show a profit on the entire business.  If the live-stock end of our agricultural economy is not <Col N="1595" /> profitable, no other section of it can be. What are these other sections?  The two crops used directly for human food are wheat and beet.  It was admitted here last week by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance that sugar can be bought at one-third of our cost of production.  That loss has to be made up somewhere.  The wheat our farmers are raising would rank as second quality on any of the principal corn exchanges in the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>And I support wheat-growing in a sensible way as strongly to-day as I did 12 years ago.  I could deal with another aspect of wheat-growing, but it would be a bit outside the range of the motion.  I do not know whether the Minister himself was warned by experts in his Department, but I know it is on record that these experts issued a warning as to the danger of growing, to any considerable extent, the strains of wheat we have been accustomed to grow in this country, because these strains are liable to certain wheat diseases, and are not the most desirable strains to grow if we want to produce all the wheat we require for our own use.  Being liable to disease, these strains may impregnate the soil; and when we do get a strain of wheat that will be first-class and could be grown so as to satisfy our whole requirements, the land may be diseased and we may not be able to grow it.  We may have a repetition <Col N="1596" /> on a larger scale of the black-scab infection of the soil in Cooley, in North Louth.  The Minister knows that.  That was the opinion of his experts eight years ago.  Unless the experts change with the Government, that is their opinion to-day.  If the experts change with the Government, may we be protected from the experts.</P>
      <P>I was dealing with the commercial value of wheat.  The wheat which we are growing, whether first-rate or not, is good enough.  Let us assume that it is as good as any other wheat. The price ultimately given for it is 26/-.  The Minister will agree that the exchange price of the best wheat in the world is 14/- per barrel.  That difference has to be made up in some way.  That crop is immediately convertible into human food.  Beet is not so immediately convertible, and the best crop hardly averages 17½ per cent. of sugar content.  The balance of the crop has to be fed to live stock.  The other crops immediately convertible into human food are selected potatoes and a few vegetables.  All the others have to be fed to animals.  If those crops immediately convertible into human food are a commercial loss in our agricultural economy, and if the balance fed to live stock also shows a loss, how can our economy be sustained?  I do not want to labour it too much.  I should like if the Minister would apply himself to that when he is replying, or any of the good farmers on the opposite benches, like the Deputy or his colleague, Deputy T. Kelly, would do so.</P>

      <P>The Deputy introduced the subject by one of his usual sneers at the composition of the Government Benches.  He glanced across and saw that those who attend here regularly were in their places, and he pointed at them as &ldquo;the agriculturists.&rdquo; I immediately looked at the signatories of the motions.  The first name is that of Deputy Belton.  Everybody agrees that the Deputy is an agriculturist. The other wonderful agricultural expert is Deputy Alfred Byrne. Coming to the second motion we find the same bunch of famous agriculturists, more or less.  Deputy Belton at the time the motions were tabled was a member of the Opposition-Fine Gael.  Another signatory is another farmer, I suppose, Deputy Thomas F. O'Higgins, who, I understood, was a doctor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">

    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Another signatory is Deputy Sidney B. Minch, and then again comes that famous agriculturist, Deputy Alfred Byrne.  Deputy Belton being the first signatory of the motions which were tabled a year ago, was then a man of standing and a man of importance.  These were the grand old days when there was prosperity, when the people wanted Fine Gael, which was then making an effort to destroy this Government.  Deputy Belton then spoke with authority and had not disagreed with a number of followers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When they were looking for agriculturists on the opposite side why did they not get them, instead of, through some freak of fortune, getting as a signatory of one motion Deputy Alfred Byrne, Lord Mayor of Dublin.  He does not represent an agricultural constituency.  Neither does Deputy Belton represent an agricultural constituency. I admit that the Deputy has a knowledge of agriculture second to no one in this House, and that one is always ready to accept his advice on agriculture.  But, is it not an extraordinary thing that when Deputy Belton went to an agricultural constituency he lost his deposit, and that he <Col N="1598" /> was oftener rejected by the people of County Dublin than elected by the farming community?  That is the Deputy who sneers at these benches, who looks across and says &ldquo;There are the agriculturists.&rdquo;  Deputies on these benches went to the constituencies at the last General Election and, as I stated in the course of a recent debate, they did not get one vote under false pretences.  They put forward their claims and the claims of the Government and they succeeded whether they are agriculturists or not.  Deputies on this side represent agricultural constituencies and with all due respect to Deputy Belton, he would be well advised in future, when taking part in debates, in trying to raise their level to a higher standard rather than making the speech to which we have become so accustomed, and which does not reflect credit on himself nor add to the lustre of this assembly.  There was a different state of things in the country when these motions were tabled.  Some of the things that the Deputies complain of have been attended to in the meantime.  It appears to me that the Deputy is trying more or less by these motions to clear up the mess into which the Opposition got during the last 12 months.  Take the wording of the second motion:</P>
    <P>That the Dáil requests the Government in order to maintain the present area under tillage and to prevent wholesale unemployment, to take immediate steps to secure a market for our 58 per cent. of surplus stall-fed cattle, and failing to do so, to purchase the said cattle from the feeders at the price ruling in the British market.</P>
    <P>Then take the wording of the first one:</P>
    <P>That the Dáil expresses its dissatisfaction at the manner in which the Ministry of Agriculture has allocated the export licences for fat cattle.</P>
    <P>At the time these motions were tabled the system of licensing was different from what it is to-day.  Many of the things that Deputy Belton then complained of have since been <Col N="1599" /> remedied.  I did not catch whether the Deputy during the course of his speech adverted to that very important fact. There are Deputies on these benches who did not quite agree with the manner in which licences were being given.  The majority of Deputies, and I am sure the Minister too, wanted feeders and producers of cattle to get the export licences.  Notwithstanding the Deputy's graphic description of what took place 12 months ago, the Minister has gone a long way to remedy some of the difficulties. A number of Deputies assisted in trying to get remedied things which, in their opinion, should not have occurred, believing that feeders and producers were best entitled to the licences.  Of course the Deputy introduced the subject of the economic war. Apparently no debate can take place, and no motion can be tabled without the economic war being introduced.  I am glad at any rate that Deputy Belton has recognised one thing, and that he was emphatic about it, when he declared during the debate that took place on Thursday last that the Government had a mandate to carry on the economic war as best they could; <Col N="1600" /> and that the Government has done nothing except what it had authority to do.  Like the Deputy I do not want to go into the merits and demerits of that subject now, but I am a little surprised at finding Deputy Belton taking part in a motion like the first one and switching into a diatribe condemning tillage, in a sense, by saying that wheat growing is being done in an imprudent way.  I am not so sure that the Deputy really means that.  If he does it does not fit in with many of his previous speeches.  If the Deputy meant to convey to the House that it is imprudent to go ahead with the tillage policy and with wheat production, he is not the Deputy I know.</P>
