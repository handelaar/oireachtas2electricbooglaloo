      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether the Committee of Management of the Unified Society appointed under Section 4 of the National Health Insurance Act, 1933, consists of three civil servants and, if so, whether he will state the period for and the conditions under which these appointments were made and, if the appointments are temporary, the arrangements made in the Department of State from which these civil servants were transferred, to discharge their duties during the period of their absence in the service of the Unified Society; whether any part, and, if so, how much of their salaries is borne out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, the total amount of the remuneration paid to each of the persons concerned, and the sources from which it is provided, and whether it is his intention to make provision at an early date in accordance with the provisions of sub-section (4) of Section 4 of the National Health Insurance Act, 1933, for the appointment of a representative committee of management of the Unified Society.</P>

      <P>Under Section 4 (3) of the National Health Insurance Act, 1933, three persons who hold civil service posts have been appointed to act as a provisional committee of the Unified Society.  They will hold office unless their appointments are previously terminated until a day to be appointed by me under Section 2 which will not be later than the 14th July, 1936.  During the periods in which they are absent from their Departments their official duties are <Col N="504" /> being carried out by other members of the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>The portion of their salaries attributable to work performed for the Society is paid out of the administration account of the Society and the portion of their salaries attributable to their official duties is paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The total remuneration of each of the persons concerned is A, £1,037 7s. 6d.; B, £897 19s. 10d.; C, £718 19s. 9d.  The division of these amounts for the year 1934 is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Paid by Society, A, £1,037 7s. 6d.; B, £660 16s. 0d.; C, £507 5s. 3d.</P>
      <P>Paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, A, Nil; B, £237 3s. 10d.; C, £211 14s. 6d.</P>
      <P>Under Section 3 of the National Insurance Act, 1911, two-ninths of the portion of the salaries paid out of the administration account of the Society falls to be recouped out of monies provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Consideration will be given in due course to the steps necessary to give effect to the provisions of Section 4 (4) of the National Health Insurance Act, 1933.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether his attention has been called to the attempts made by persons holding responsible positions in the Unified Society to form, with the knowledge and consent of the Committee of Management, an unrecognised, employer-promoted trade union; whether meetings for promoting the objects of this so-called trade union were held, with the knowledge and consent of the Committee of Management, in the offices of the Society; whether the members of the Committee of Management of the Unified Society are serving civil servants; and, if so, whether before giving sanction to this attempt to prevent genuine trade union organisation among the staff, they first sought and obtained the sanction of the Government; and whether he is prepared now to inform the Committee of Management that the staff of the Unified Society must be free to join a trade union of their own choice without being interfered with by <Col N="505" /> persons holding managerial positions in the Society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no knowledge of the matters referred to in the question.  The Provisional Committee of the Society consists for the time being of three persons who hold Civil Service posts, but they have independent powers as regards the recruitment and organisation of the staff of the Society.  The National Health Insurance Act, 1933, under which the Society was constituted, gives me no power to intervene in the manner suggested in the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy's question addressed to me on the 28th February, I gave him full information in respect of the number of firms on the live register as engaged in the women's clothing and millinery trades, and in respect of the number of inspections of these trades during the year 1934.  The list of 2,135 firms, to which he alludes as being recorded in the Office of Trade Boards, is a list not only of firms which are at present engaged in these trades, but includes many other firms which at one time or another, sometimes seasonally and for short periods, were engaged in this industry.  Notices of the determinations of the Board are sent to this more extensive list of firms so that they may be kept fully informed in case they may at any time be affected by these determinations.  I have already informed the Deputy that the total number of premises visited in respect of the Women's Clothing and Millinery Trade Board in the year 1934 was 258.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan (for Mr. Wall)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that offals are costing an abnormally high price in the Free State for some time past; that the high prices are attributed to the fact that large quantities of offals are exported periodically; that the export price is appreciably lower than the price prevailing here, and if he will have inquiries made in the matter with a view to putting into practice the promises made by the Minister that the milling of our own flour would result in the provision of cheap offals for the farmers of the Free State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is under a misapprehension as to the present position with regard to offals in the Saorstát.  The export of wheaten offals from Saorstát Eireann was prohibited as from the 11th of June last and, save for a relatively small quantity of red bran (not in demand here at the time) exported under licence in July, no pollards or bran have been exported since that date.</P>
      <P>At this season of the year the demand for wheaten offals is usually keen, and in the corresponding period of other years the prices of such offals were normally somewhat higher in this country than in Great Britain. This year, however, the position would appear to be reversed, the prices of pollards and bran quoted ex mill or f.o.r. in the Saorstát being slightly lower than the Liverpool &ldquo;spot&rdquo; prices quoted in the trade journals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Gallagher was dismissed by my direction because of an infringement of the regulation which forbids civil servants from active participation in political matters.  He was aware of the regulation and was given an opportunity of submitting any statement he wished to make in explanation of his action.  I did not regard his explanation as satisfactory. As to his previous conduct, he was reprimanded in July, 1930, and again in December, 1932, for neglect of duty. He was also warned in December, 1932, as to the need for complying with the regulation forbidding Government employees from taking part in politics.  Otherwise, his record was satisfactory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: That the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The Agricultural Products (Regulation of Export) Act, 1933, was passed by the Oireachtas to meet the situation created by the decision of the British Government to restrict imports of certain classes of agricultural products into the United Kingdom to such quantities as, after due allowance was made for home production, would satisfy that country's requirements. With this object quotas were allotted to the exporting countries, and each such country was required to establish satisfactory machinery for ensuring that:&mdash;(a) quantities in excess of the quotas would not be exported to the United Kingdom; and (b) the full <Col N="512" /> quantities covered by the quotas would actually be so exported.</P>
      <P>For the purpose of providing this machinery, so far as Saorstát Eireann is concerned, legislation was necessary. Accordingly, the Act above referred to was passed empowering the Minister for Agriculture to make Orders regulating and controlling the export from Saorstát Eireann of any agricultural product subject to the following conditions:&mdash;(1) the country to which the agricultural product in respect of which the Order is made is exported must be a country to which that particular agricultural product is usually exported from Saorstát Eireann; and (2) the country to which the agricultural product in respect of which the Order is made is exported must have established a system of restriction or control of the import of that agricultural product into that country from Saorstát Eireann; and (3) orders made under the Act are to be directed to regulating and controlling the export in such manner as appears to the Minister to be calculated to secure for exporters from Saorstát Eireann the maximum benefit permitted by the system of restriction and control established by the exporting country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While these conditions present no difficulty in the case of exports to the United Kingdom, they render the Act inoperative in the case of countries to which agricultural products hitherto have not been usually exported from Saorstát Eireann, or of countries which have not established any &ldquo;system of restriction or control on the import of agricultural products from Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; but have made or may make agreements or arrangements entitling or requiring Saorstát Eireann to export to them limited quantities of certain classes of agricultural products. In order that the Government may be in a position to secure that the terms of the agreements or arrangements which I have just referred to will be implemented, it is necessary that the Minister for Agriculture should have powers of regulating and controlling exports of agricultural products to the countries with which such agreements or arrangements are made <Col N="513" /> similar to those powers which he can at present exercise in regard to exports to the United Kingdom.  The Bill, accordingly, proposes to amend Section 2 of the Act of 1933 by inserting in lieu of sub-section (1) of that section a new sub-section enabling the Minister to make Orders under Section 2, subject to either of the following conditions&mdash;(1) that the Government of the importing country has established any system of restriction or control of the import of any agricultural product into that country from Saorstát Eireann, or (2) that the Government of the importing country has made any agreement or arrangement with the Government of Saorstát Eireann whereby any agricultural product is permitted or required to be imported to a limited extent into that country from Saorstát Eireann.  The effect of this amendment will be to substitute one or other of these two conditions for the three conditions which have to be fulfilled as the Act at present stands before any Order can be made under Section 2.  Section 2 of the 1933 Act also sets out certain specific matters which may be provided for in such orders in addition, of course, to the matters in general These specific matters are contained in paragraphs (a) to (f) of the existing sub-section (1) of Section 2.  It is proposed to re-enact these paragraphs in the new sub-section subject to amendments in paragraph (a) and paragraph (c).  The amendment to paragraph (a) is a drafting amendment which omits the words &ldquo;to such country.&rdquo; The new paragraph provides that the Orders may prohibit the export to a particular country of any specific description of any agricultural product. This provision is necessary to enable the Minister for Agriculture to prevent the export of inferior or unsuitable descriptions which might be unacceptable to the importing country or depreciate the reputation of Saorstát produce in that country.  Another amendment proposes to alter the definition of the expression &ldquo;agricultural product.&rdquo;  It appears that it is not clear that the existing definition includes livestock, dairy produce, eggs and articles of food, &ldquo;agricultural product&rdquo;<Col N="514" /> being held by some people to include only what grows on the soil. The definition is being altered to include all live stock, live-stock products and the produce of the soil.  That particular provision is being made retrospective in case there should be any doubt as to the scope of the definition as it stood in the original Act.  I have read this statement because the amendments are rather technical.  In short, the two major amendments give us power, say, in the case of Germany or Belgium, where we are making treaties but where we had not been carrying on export up to the present.  Under the old Act, we had not that power. In the second place the amendment of the definition of &ldquo;agricultural product,&rdquo; to which I have referred, is made.</P>

      <P>I intended to conclude this debate last night, but I was requested by the Opposition to continue to-day.  I am glad to comply with the request because <Col N="515" /> it gives me an opportunity to deal somewhat more fully than I did with the question of licences.  Licences for cattle are issued in two ways.  In the case of fat cattle the licences are being issued now, and for some little time have been issued, to the producers. From the tone of the debate last night, I take it that there is no objection to the practice of issuing those licences to the producers.  On the other hand, it does lead to many of the complaints that were made here regarding trafficking in licences.  As I mentioned last night, we can only send inspectors to look over these cattle in the stalls every five or six weeks.  There may be three issues of licences between the visits of the inspector.  Suppose licences had been issued on the 1st February, the inspector having been there at the end of January, and suppose the particular feeder was entitled to two licences on the 1st February, he would automatically get two more in the middle of February and two more on the 1st March before the inspector would be around again.  In many cases the owner of the cattle meeting with a favourable opportunity of disposing of the cattle to a butcher or a dealer, the cattle would be gone by the time the last two licences were issued, and he would sell these two licences.  That is one way in which licences come on the market.  Then, sometimes, a dealer buys cattle with the licences.  The dealer meets with a favourable opportunity of disposing of the particular cattle to a victualler or home butcher, and he sells the licences also.  Another objection to that&mdash;if it is an objection&mdash; is that we could not possibly adopt the safeguard suggested by Deputy Belton. Deputy Belton suggested that we should make these licences non-transferable. If we issue the licences to the producer, we know quite well that the producers themselves cannot in all cases export the cattle.  In many cases the exporter would have only one licence, and it would be too much even for Deputy Belton to suggest that that farmer should go across to Birkenhead or Glasgow to dispose of one beast.  It is obvious that cattle are sold with licences to some dealer or exporter and, <Col N="516" /> in that way, the licences are transferable. The system of issuing these licences to the producers leads, in my opinion, to greater traffic in licences than if they were issued entirely to the people in the exporting business.  In the case of stores there is a different system.  They are issued to those with records as exporters of cattle.  In 1934 they were issued on the basis of the exports for 1933.  That is to say, we took all the cattle exported in February, 1933, and the number of licences we got for February, 1934, and we worked out the percentage.  Each exporter of 1933 got his proportion of the licences.  They were given, of course, to those who drew the export bounty and that, in itself led to certain trouble because we had bitter complaints from people who claimed to be exporters that the person who drew the bounty was not the exporter, but was an agent of the person making the complaint.</P>
      <P>We could not set ourselves up as judges in that case, and unless the agent was willing to agree to send us a signed statement that the licences should not be issued to the other persons we could not act.  In addition to that class of regular exporters for 1933, there were special areas, which were approved by the Consultative Council which consists practically altogether of exporters.  In these special areas, where it was felt that there was more hardship than was necessary, more licences were issued than were actually due to them.  These were far away places such as Donegal, most parts of Connaught, Kerry and West Cork and areas like those, away from the main and central markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were, also, special cases such as this.  A man may have been exporting regularly for years, and for some reason over which he had no control&mdash; usually sickness&mdash;no exports were made by him during certain months of 1933.  These people were not exporting their usual numbers.  I said last night that when all that was concluded there was always an odd number of licences over.  For instance I was looking at some figures and found this example.  There were 32,000 cattle exported in certain <Col N="517" /> months in 1933.  For the same months in 1934 we got 30,000 licences, so we had to work out a percentage and we found that on the figures available it worked out at 46 per cent.  The exporters got 46 per cent. of the licences in the first half of the year and 46 per cent. in the next half, making 92 per cent. in all.  Having worked that out we found that we had 280 licences over.  The number of licences over sometimes is as low as 50 or 100; it is very seldom so high as 280.  Now something had to be done with these licences, and it is only in cases like that that I have any discretion in the issue of licences.  The lists are prepared for people all over the country and the licences are issued in very small numbers to those people.</P>
    <P>Now we know that licences were sold.  A case was reported to us that a certain individual was selling licences.  The case was investigated and, as a matter of fact, it was found that the charge was true.  If no export bounty is applied for within two months by the licensee we know the licences were not used by that person; and every man who is convicted of that offence of selling licences has his name taken off the list and gets no more licences.  I do not see what more we can do except to adopt another system which I shall deal with later.  In 1935 we issued licences on the basis of the 1934 exports. That is we took the people who drew the export bounty during the months of 1934 and we issued licences to those people.  Every person who got a licence in 1934 and who sold it and did not draw the export bounty was automatically ruled out for 1935. In that way I think we are likely to rule out a lot of people referred to here as drovers and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>These will be such small numbers they will be automatically ruled out.  I do not think there would be any persons in any month that got from five to six licences, who would be entitled to come in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister checked these?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but perhaps I might mention our attitude on that point. Last year no person was entitled to a licence unless he recorded having shipped 20 cattle in the month.  When we came to a settlement, and licences were a little more plentiful, and found the case of a man who in 1933 shipped less cattle than the regular shipment and whose total for the year would not have been 20, and would be automatically ruled out, these persons came up for special consideration.  I do hope, of course, that when we get an increased number of licences, sometime this year, we will be in a position to withdraw all restrictions on licences.  That would be the ideal solution but we have not reached that point yet, and it would be very dangerous to try it at the moment because there would be more applications than we could deal with.  But if we reached the point where there would be no restriction on licences then of course all this trouble would be gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another solution, very often suggested by those who do not think deeply on the subject, is the issue of licences to producers.  That is absolutely impossible.  If we were to issue licences to producers the implication would be that every producer would be entitled to a number of licences. I was looking into this point.  I found first of all that in 1933 there were 379,000 land holders in the country. That would mean we could only give one licence to the great majority of the farmers in the country, and two licences to only a very small number.  What is more if a farmer applied we might have to say: &ldquo;Your turn will not come until next November.&rdquo; Licences issued in that way would be useless because the farmer might not get the licence when he wanted it and, at any rate, one licence would not be of any use to him.  It would really only make things worse.  Another suggestion was to nationalise the whole business and to set up a Department to deal with the question of licences.  That would <Col N="519" /> entail colossal machinery and very great organisation, and what is more it would mean that for some time the best prices would not be got from the market by one exporter.  There is some value in having a number of exporters.  All these have a number of connections on the other side.  If we were to put everything into the hands of one monopoly these connections would be lost, and the value that we get through such connections would be lost.  It is held on the other hand that in that case the farmers would get more.  In other words that by having a huge private exporter we could afford to give the farmer more for his cattle.  If that were true there might be something to be said for it but I am not at all convinced it is true.</P>
    <P>It is quite true that the whole trouble is due to the fact that we have not got as many licences as we have cattle.  While it is quite easy for us to agree on that, it is not nearly so easy to agree on the solution.  An increase in the number of licences is a matter for two Governments.  If we want an increase in the number of licences, we must convince the British Government that they ought to give them to us and that may not be possible. I doubt if it would be advisable to proceed on that line at present, because the more cattle we send into the British market&mdash;I do not know whether I could claim that our cattle have great influence or not&mdash;the price appears to go down.  On the other hand, a reduction in cattle numbers here is a matter for this Government and for the people of this country alone, and there is no necessity either to get the consent of or to consult the British Government about it.  That would appear to me to be the right line to go on.  It is the line that should be taken and it is the line which this Government is inclined to take in dealing with this issue.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the better the price. And, what is more, what must naturally follow is that if we cut our cattle numbers, we must try to improve the quality.  I hope that members of the Opposition will not continue to see anything illogical in the policy that is being pursued of trying to improve our cattle more and more, even though we are cutting them in numbers, because, if we are, it is all the more necessary to have good quality, in order to get better prices.</P>

There is no Deputy here now&mdash;I think that a few years ago they did oppose our scheme for improving butter prices &mdash;would rule out some sort of bounty or subsidy on butter exported, even if there were no tariffs in Great Britain at all.

The Minister is talking of the necessity for subsidising, to a very considerable extent, by bounty and by levy, which increase the price of butter to the consumer, what he regards as the basis of our agricultural industry here.  Those of us who live in the city and who have to contemplate the sufferings of the people in the city, as a result of a rise in the cost of living, would like to hear the Minister for Agriculture explaining why the very basis of our fundamental industry in this country has to be subsidised to such an enormous extent?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I understand the Deputy very clearly, but if the Deputy is complaining that butter is too dear in the city, I say that there is no country in the world, or I should like to have a country named, with the exception of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, in which butter is so cheap.  There is no country in the world, I think, which has not got some form of subsidy which puts up the price of butter to the home consumer. It is no great defence if you like, but I mention that to start with.  We go back then to the time of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  Under that Government, butter in the city varied in price from 1/7 to 1/10 and there was no complaint about the price of butter. It is now 1/5.  We have not put it back <Col N="523" /> to what it was at that time.  Here is another instance.  Suppose we were to cut down our butter production to our own needs and have no export.  We would then probably deal with the thing by tariff, in order to give our own producers a chance.  Does anybody imagine that we would put on a tariff lower than would give the creameries 140/- per cwt.?</P>

      <P>Deputy Curran raised the question that the farmers are not getting the bounties.  Does the Deputy mean that they are not getting the full benefit of those export bounties?  I ask that because, so far as I know, it has never been claimed in this House by the Opposition that the export bounty is not going to the producer.  I never heard it said by <Col N="525" /> any Deputy inside the House or outside that the creameries do not pass the bounty to the farmer.  It is the same with regard to eggs and everything else produced by the farmer except cattle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister allow me for a second?  My point is this.  Butter is 1/4 a pound.  What is the farmer getting for his milk&mdash;the raw material?  It is 4d. a gallon.  It takes 2½ gallons of milk to make a pound of butter.  In other words, 10d. worth of milk produces a pound of butter.  It costs 1½d. to 2d. per pound for manufacturing.  Now the Dublin people are wondering why they are paying 1/4 a pound for it.  The reason is this&mdash;the Government levy is 4d. a pound; in the case of the small creamery with which I am connected, a creamery that is very badly hit financially, we paid last year by way of levy £7,100.  We did not get a single bob back.  My point is that the farmer is not getting a sufficient price for his milk, while the consumer is taxed over and above.  Then, again, the price of butter is too high, so high that it has the effect of restricting the consumption of butter in the poorer areas in the country.  The price of butter is too high&mdash;1/4 a pound.</P>

      <P>Deputy Curran says the consumption of butter in a number of the poorer areas has gone down.  If that is so the number of poorer areas must be less than it was because the consumption of butter in the Free State as a whole has gone up.  Whether that is because the people are better off I do not know.  At any rate the consumption of butter has gone up.  Deputy Curran said they <Col N="526" /> were paying a levy on butter and had got nothing out of it.  If the Deputy would study the principle underlying the stabilisation of prices, he would find that the farmers are getting benefit from it.  If there were no levies, and no bounties, the farmer would be geting 66s. a cwt. for his butter. Deducting 2d. a lb. for manufacturing costs off the 66/-, that would leave about 44/- so that if there were no bounty and no levy Deputy Curran would be getting 2d. a gallon for his milk.  That is what would happen if there were no levy and no bounty.  It is because the Deputy pays the levy that he is getting 4d. a gallon for his milk.</P>

The bounties for cattle are not a big item in this total Vote.  Out of £3,000,000 that will be paid out in export bounties during this financial year the amount paid for bounties on cattle exports will not exceed £600,000, that is only 20 per cent. of the total Vote.  I am inclined to agree that when the licences were not issued to the producers direct, the bounty did not come back to the producer. Still, of course, I do not know.  I have already stated the difficulties with regard to cattle&mdash;there were too many cattle for the number of licences available.

The expenditure on the supply of free turf by local authorities during the financial year ended 31st March, 1934, was not fully recouped within the year as the actual expenditure had not been ascertained.  The scheme proved very successful.  In some areas there is a difficulty in the distribution of supplies and there is always dissatisfaction when schemes of this nature apply in some areas and not in others.

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is asking the House to provide additional sums for grants towards house building. I would like the Minister to tell <Col N="529" /> the House when he proposes to give his real opinions of the housing schemes that are being carried out.  The Minister has a very expensive housing board, and a very much increased housing staff attached to the Department, and when we took at the achievements under his present housing scheme we must be appalled at two things, first, the cost and, secondly, the lack of any reasonable expression of opinion, or any reasonable statement of what the Minister really thinks is happening.  The total number of houses completed under the 1924-1931 Acts, taking the houses that were completed, say, by September, 1932, was 24,231 and they involved a cost to the State of £1,609,152. Deputies on the far side like to be somewhat meticulous as to detail and to convince themselves by working out things to the last penny, so I may as well inform them that the actual cost to the State was £1,609,152 13s. 4d. That was the cost of the 24,231 houses.</P>
      <P>The Minister has provided figures, in reply to Parliamentary questions, which show that by the 31st December last there were 16,155 houses criochnuithe.  By that I mean completely finished and done with, ready for people to live in.  The cost to the State of the 16,155 houses was £2,616,515.  As regards the 16,155 houses, some of them had grants of an explicit amount as fixed by the 1932 Act.  Where houses were built by local authorities, I am taking the cost of each house as being £300.  The Minister knows that there are very few parts of this country where houses are being built at £300, but I am taking £300 as the average price in order not to be extravagant in arriving at what the Minister's costs are. I think he will admit it is a modest sum.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be glad if the Minister will say what percentage of the 16,155 houses finished by the 31st December last were finished at a cost per house less than £300.  Can he indicate the percentage as between Dublin City, Carlow, Tuam and <Col N="530" /> Enniscorthy?  I am basing my case on an average all-in cost of £300 per house and I submit it is a reasonable one. There were 24,231 houses constructed for £1,609,152.  Under the Minister's régime there were 16,155 houses at a cost of £2,616,515.  We have this important fact connected therewith, that practically every halfpenny of the £1,609,152 that was a State grant in the case of houses built under the 1924 1931 Acts was paid out of revenue at a time when the taxation was very considerably lower than at present, while the Minister under his scheme leaves £1,800,000 out of the £2,616,515 which his 16,155 houses are costing the State as a debt to be paid over the next 30 odd years.  When is the Minister going to explain the implications of that?  He has an expensive housing board supposed to be closely reviewing every detail of the whole position and he has a very extended housing staff.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in reply to a Parliamentary question put by Deputy Norton the other day, said that by the 1st February last 19,987 houses had been erected.  In keeping track of the achievements in the matter of housing I have been asking the Minister to tell the House, by way of parliamentary questions from time to time, the number of houses criochnuithe.  I ask the Minister now to tell us what is the difference between &ldquo;criochnuithe,&rdquo; as he understands it, &ldquo;completed&rdquo; as he mentioned in reply to parliamentary questions and &ldquo;erected&rdquo; as was used in reply to Deputy Norton, because while the figures given to the House show that 16,155 houses were criochnuithe by the 31st December last, we can imply that a month later 19,987 houses had been either crected or completed. I would like to know whether, in fact, the 3,832 houses representing the difference were all completed or criochnuithe, or whatever word is to be applied to houses that are so finished that a person can live in them. I want to know whether the 3,832 houses were so completed during the month of January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of cost, the Minister indicated in a reply on February 14 that the plans that had been reviewed and passed up to the present time <Col N="531" /> covered the erection, in time, of 49,142 houses.  Again, the cost of the Minister's scheme arises here.  If the present State subsidy is to be continued, then by the time the Minister's plans in regard to the 49,142 houses are completed, there will have been incurred a cost to the State of something over £6,500,000.  The greater part of that will be met by the raising of money by taxation in future to pay off interest and sinking fund.  Let us consider the matter from the point of view of the City of Dublin, where there are large numbers of people able to pay a reasonable rent, but who find it absolutely impossible to get houses at the present time.  The question of whether, some time or another, money is going to be given to help those people to get the houses they are looking for is a very big one indeed, and while the Minister may not be in a position to go into this matter thoroughly now, I submit that the disclosures that his figures make with regard to cost are such that when he presents his annual estimate we ought to have a very complete statement from him as to the whole housing position.  The size of the figures and the complete silence of either the housing board or the Minister are very remarkable things. Neither in the Minister's speeches from time to time&mdash;if he will pardon me suggesting it&mdash;nor in any of the broadcast statements we have had with regard to housing, can we get anything that a person reviewing the position in a kind of systematic way would be satisfied with.  There seems to be nothing but drift, with large sums of money being committed to a scheme the merits of which seem to be very questionable.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also asking us to vote a Supplementary Estimate for turf.  He tells us that the turf scheme has been dropped; but the fact remains that we have never got any kind of a reasonable explanation of what exactly happened in connection with the scheme for which we are now asked to vote a residue of money.  I pointed out before in this House that of the £25,000 voted last year in a supplementary estimate for the provision <Col N="532" /> of fuel to poor families in areas where native fuel was not readily obtainable, a sum of £13,000 was allocated to the Dublin Board of Public Assistance.  When the Board came to examine the wants of the people they were to minister to they decided that they wanted about 400 tons per week. That decision was come to in December, 1933, but it was not until the last week in January or the 1st week in February following that they were able to get a supply of turf; and then they were only able to get it at a grotesque cost.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce explained in reply to a Parliamentary question in May last that turf was obtainable at the Turraun Peat Company's works in Dublin at 26/8 per ton.  The Dublin Board of Assistance, however, although they appealed to the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Industry and Commerce to assist them in the matter, had to pay 38/4 per ton for turf delivered in small quantities within the old City of Dublin and 40/- per ton in areas like Rathmines and Pembroke which were outside the old city boundary.  It was pointed out that it was only reasonable that there should be some additional cost for delivering turf in small quantities very often to the top of tenement houses; but at the same time it was also pointed out that through the Lord Mayor's coal fund coal of good quality was being distributed in the same way in small quantities at 36/8 per ton.  We are now asked to vote a sum of £4,000 to wind up a scheme administered in that particular way, and the Minister should have something to say as to why, when the Minister for Industry and Commerce was insisting that turf could be obtained, at any rate at the works in Dublin, for 26/8, the Dublin Board of Public Assistance, after appealing to the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, could not get turf at as low a price as coal could be obtained, and why the astounding price of 34/8 and 40/- per ton was charged to the Board of Assistance in Dublin for turf delivered in this way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="533" /> I should like to ask the Minister, now that the scheme has been dropped, whether the price of coal has been taken into consideration.  The Minister will be aware that the Controller of Prices intervened last year when a complaint was made that bellmen were selling coal at the rate of 30/- per ton.  This was considered to be so exorbitant that the bellmen were forced to reduce the price to 29/- per ton. I have been in touch with people during the last few days who complained of a rise of 6/- per ton in the price of coal.  People in modest circumstances a month ago had to pay 17/- for a half ton of coal and a day or two ago they had to pay £1.</P>

      <P>I only mentioned it in this way: The Minister has explained that this scheme has been dropped for this year as other arrangements have been made&mdash;that unemployment assistance is being paid.  I would ask the Minister to consider that the introduction of the unemployment assistance scheme in the City of Dublin has, in fact, in quite a good number of cases reduced the amount of public money going by way of relief into a large number of necessitous households. Although it is rather late in the day to be discussing in the month of March the fuel position with regard to people in the City of Dublin, nevertheless there must be something that requires to be cleared up in connection with this matter.  There are necessitous households at present in Dublin receiving less than they were before the Government introduced the Unemployment Assistance Act.  The price of fuel has increased very considerably and I should like to know if anything is going to be done to assist the poor in the matter.</P>

      <P>I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister certain <Col N="534" /> matters in connection with the administration of the Housing Acts of 1932 and 1934.  As a result of the considerable impetus given to house building in the Saorstát under these Acts, a goodly number of houses have been erected in urban and rural areas.  I refer particularly to the houses erected by local authorities in both areas.  I have had occasion to complain to the housing section of the Minister's Department about the apparent unwillingness of local authorities to require contractors to complete houses in the time set out in the contract.  Cases have come to my notice where contractors have been given 26 weeks in which to complete labourers' cottage schemes and I have had to call the attention of the Minister's Department to the fact that, whereas these cottages should be completed within 26 weeks, in some instances the cottages had not been started within 26 weeks after the date upon which the contract was sealed. If there is any value in putting in a definite date in a contract for the completion of houses and if there is any value in having that particular clause in a contract approved by the Local Government Department, there should be insistence by the Department that the contract so accepted would be completed within the time allowed; or otherwise that the contractor, on failing to give a reasonable excuse, will be required to comply with the penalty clause of the contract.</P>
      <P>In many areas where cottages have been scheduled for erection applicants for these cottages are constantly inquiring when they are likely to be erected. The Department must be troubled a good deal answering inquiries on that matter from applicants and from Deputies.  I think if the Minister were to insist that these contracts must be complied with to the letter, so far as the contractors are concerned, it would do a good deal to obviate a fruitful source of dissatisfaction to applicants and a fruitful source of complaint to Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In previous discussions on Supplementary Estimates for the Department of Local Government, reference has <Col N="535" /> been made to the necessity for ensuring the general application of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act to house-building activities.  The Minister has been urged on previous occasions to impress upon local authorities the necessity of putting into operation the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act and has been further urged to explain to such local authorities that there is no charge upon their rates by making that Act applicable in their respective areas.  I should like to know from the Minister whether his Department is satisfied with the activities of local authorities in the matter of the administration of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act.  I think there must be some areas in the country where the Act has not been adopted or where, if it has been adopted, no apparent effort has been made to bring its provisions under the notice of potential small house builders.  In other areas where the Act has been adopted, a very low maximum advance has been fixed.  I know one county in which the maximum advance under the Act is limited to £50.  If one endeavours to secure an advance of £50 under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act in that county, one will have the privilege of paying £7 for getting a loan of £50.</P>
    <P>Something should be done by the Minister's Department to lift a low maximum of that kind and to ensure that an adequate sum is advanced and that, in addition, the rates of charges for negotiating a loan of that kind should be substantially reduced, because it is obviously unfair that the person should have to pay one-seventh of the sum advanced in order to obtain such a small sum as £50.  I should like the Minister to look at that aspect of the matter and to try to bring local authorities, which are at present in a backward state in regard to the operation of the Act, into conformity with the best standards attained by the most progressive local authorities.  Here in Dublin a considerable amount of agitation, if not indeed consternation, has been caused by the recent decision of the Dublin Corporation only to advance money <Col N="536" /> under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act in the case of houses built on Corporation property.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy talks the most arrant nonsense on any matter on which he pretends to know something. At any rate, the advances are not being made available and unless there is some change of policy, they will not be made available for persons who do not build houses on Corporation property in the City of Dublin.  I think the Minister's Department must be aware of that fact and, in any case, I should like to hear from the Minister rather than from Deputy Belton what the position is in that respect.  I think the Minister's Department should have no hesitation in confirming the statement I have made.  I have discussed the matter with the Minister's Department already and I think they are familiar with the position in Dublin.  An authority like the Dublin Corporation with its enormous borrowing powers, and placed, as it is, in an extremely solvent position, should have no difficulty whatever in raising money for the purposes of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  I hope the Minister's Department will be able to persuade the Corporation that further sums should be borrowed for advances under this Act not merely to people who desire to build on Corporation property but to other persons who desire to build in any portion of the city area.</P>
      <P>I could agree to a considerable extent with the suggestion that the money ought not to be advanced for the purpose of the expensive kind of house but where small houses or reasonably-sized houses are erected, I think the Corporation should be asked to endeavour to provide money for such house-building activities or, failing that, the Minister's Department might consider whether it is possible to advance money out of the Local Loans Fund for house-building activities under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter which affects many areas throughout the country and that is the question of the erection of houses by local authorities <Col N="538" /> in brick or stone.  Experience has shown that the Department of Local Government does not look kindly on a proposal to build houses of brick or stone if it results in increased costs for the house.  The Department's attitude appears to be that it is necessary to build houses at the lowest possible price.  With that object in view, they are rather predisposed to the erection of houses of concrete or part brick and part concrete.  There is a good deal, I agree, to be said for building houses at the lowest possible price, consistent with good workmanship and fair conditions of labour, but I think the Department might give more sympathetic consideration to proposals from local authorities to build houses in brick or stone.  After all, in many areas stone is available and, if exploited, would not only help to provide local employment but would help to keep alive a craft that is fast dying out because of the introduction of the newer method of building construction. In other areas there are brick factories either in existence or likely to come into existence and nothing should be done by the Department, by showing any partiality for concrete, to hinder the normal development of these brick factories, or to prevent their selling their products for the purpose of the erection of small dwellings.  In any case I think it will be admitted that the brick house or stone house looks a very much better house when completed.</P>
    <P>While the Minister is bound to have regard to the ultimate cost of the erection of houses by local authorities under these Acts, I think that the Minister's Department should look more favourably in the future on proposals for the use of brick or stone for house-building purposes.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question of mine to the Minister recently, I was furnished with a certain tabular statement showing the number of labourers' cottages erected in the various counties. I should like the Minister to give special attention to the return then supplied.  I think you will see that although the Housing Act was <Col N="539" /> passed in August, 1932, many of these local authorities make a very poor show in the matter of providing labourers' cottages under the Act.  In some cases, excellent progress has been made, and if such progress can be made in one place, there is no reason why the same progress could not be recorded in other places if there were the same zeal and enthusiasm for house-building.  I am sure that the Minister and his Department are aware of the necessity for speeding up house-building in every possible way, and I would suggest to him that the special attention of local authorities should be called to the fact that there is still ample scope for the erection of labourers' cottages; that there is still a clamant demand from persons living in slums and rain-soaked cabins for decent accommodation.  I hope he will give special attention to those local authorities which, so far, have a very poor showing to their credit in the erection of cottages under the 1932 Act.</P>
    <P>Similarly, under local authorities, and mainly under the administration of boards of health, in small towns, there is a disposition to confine their activities to the erection of labourers' cottages in rural areas and on the fringes of small towns.  I should like to draw the Minister's special attention to the advisability of erecting artisans' dwellings in these towns.  So far, they seem to be content to erect cottages on the fringes of towns, but a great deal could be done in such towns with regard to the erection of reasonably-sized houses at reasonable rents.  If local authorities, and especially boards of health were to take that matter in hand, a good deal could be done to get rid of many unhealthy sites and rows of insanitary dwellings which exist in far too great abundance in some of the smaller towns at the present time.</P>
    <P>In discussing this Estimate, I should like to pay a special tribute to the housing section of the Minister's Department in the matter of house-building activities.  I think that the record of their activities <Col N="540" /> under the 1932 Act is an excellent record and far out-paces anything previously done in the matter of house-building.  It is an excellent record, and the Minister is not only entitled to praise in the matter of house-building, but he and his Department are also entitled to praise for the excellent work which the housing section of his Department is doing at present to satisfy the housing needs of the people.  I have had occasion to visit the Department from time to time on house-building schemes of one kind or another, and I can only say that the officials of his Department are not only courteous but exceedingly helpful in every way, and I have found them only too anxious to assist in every possible way in the elucidation of any difficulties that may be presented to them or in any scheme designed to satisfy the housing needs of our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chinn Comhairle, so far as any experience that I have had with the housing section of the Minister's Department is concerned, I can substantiate everything that Deputy Norton has just stated.  I interrupted the Deputy when he was making a positive statement about the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act with regard to the citizens of Dublin. Apparently, the Deputy has got a skeleton of information which has got a grain of truth in it, but which does not represent the true position in the way that the Deputy stated it.  As the Minister, I am sure, is aware, the application of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act by the Corporation of Dublin started about three years ago.  I think it started about the autumn of 1932&mdash;say, two and a half years ago.  That Act, I think, functioned in the City before then, but I had no experience of it. However, in 1932 the Corporation asked the Minister for £2,500,000 for the operation of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  They asked for £2,500,000 at 3 per cent.  I think that is the correct percentage.  The Minister replied that he would not give £2,500,000 but that he would give <Col N="541" /> £50,000 at 5½ per cent.  The Corporation had then agreed to float a loan of £500,000.  The offer of the Minister was rejected by the Corporation on two grounds.  The first ground was that it was not sufficient, and the second ground was that the money was too dear.  Now, when Deputy Norton starts flinging bouquets at the Government&mdash;and I am not going to fling thorns at them&mdash;let him bear those facts in mind.</P>

      <P>What I said, Sir, and what I repeat, in the hope that it may now strike the Deputy, is that money will not be made available by the Corporation for houses costing more than £600, and that the Corporation <Col N="542" /> have decided that for the future, unless their policy changes, they will not advance money under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, for the erection of houses not erected on Corporation land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I leave it to the House to try to interpret that.  The present position was created some months ago.  There is a small committee in the Corporation to look after loans, and the provision of money for the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act is the primary concern of that committee. I think it is known as the Special Finance Committee.  In recent loans we had to earmark money for specific objects, one being for the purposes of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act. The City Manager, who is a man of some experience, was definitely against any more money being used for that Act.  When opening on this matter Deputy Norton said, in effect, that it does not affect the credit of local authorities to lend money under the Small Dwellings Act, because there is no charge on the rates.  It is strange that a man of such responsibility, experience, and admitted ability as the City Manager of Dublin, takes a different view.  He takes a view that I do not share fully&mdash;I share it some of the way.  When the public are asked to invest in stock offered by the Corporation, they naturally look at the debt.  I think the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act is responsible for over £2,000,000 of the present debt of £6,000,000 of the Dublin Corporation. The investor looks at that debt to see how much of it is reproductive. I do not want to develop the matter beyond that point.  The reason given by the City Manager for curtailing the operations of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act was that it was eating into our credit position.  At the time some of those on the committee opposed that policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to then the Corporation had not availed of the full provisions of the Act to advance 90 per cent. of the commercial price of houses.  They had only advanced 80 per cent. of the value of houses, as valued by an outside valuer.  It was then put up to <Col N="543" /> the City Manager to grant on, houses valued for £600 and under, 90 per cent. of the purchase price, and to make some money available under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act.  He opposed both proposals, but finally we got him to compromise and to agree to provide another £200,000, provided that it would be the last. We would not agree to that.  Agreement was then got, but there was an atmosphere there against any more advances.  We compromised with him for 85 per cent. of the purchase price of houses valued at £600 and under. Perhaps what influenced the City Manager and the Corporation in favour of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act at that time was this: that a considerable amount of land, in the form of sites, had been leased by the Corporation at good prices to speculative builders, and the City Manager and the council felt under a certain amount of moral obligation to help to finance houses being built on these sites.  An allocation was finally agreed to by the City Manager and the council. It is probable this allocation was not fully understood by those who gave Deputy Norton the information, and that that has mixed the matter up.  An additional sum of £200,000 was to be given, on the basis that £100,000 was for houses being built on sites leased by the Corporation; £25,000 for houses being built on other sites at any price specified by the Act; and £75,000 for houses valued for £600 and under, built on any sites.  When it came to apply that in practice, we found that for houses costing over £600, being built on sites other than Corporation sites, the £25,000 had been over-applied for, to the extent of £38,000.  A further meeting decided to cover that amount, and to extend authority for another £50,000, leaving the £250,000 which the Minister sanctioned.  That amount was not available in cash.</P>
    <P>We had no money borrowed; what was done was this: We took money out of other allocations that were not ready to avail of it and used it for the purposes of the Small Dwellings <Col N="544" /> Acquisition Act.  All that money has now been used.  In the loan that will be on the market within the next two or three days there is included £250,000 for the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act, but in actual practice, the money has been already used. It was borrowed from other allocations, and when the money under this new loan is available, it will have to be paid back.  There is nothing available at present for any houses being built under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act.</P>

      <P>The Deputy repeated that the policy of the Corporation in future was to have no money available under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act, except for houses being built on Corporation sites.  No such decision was come to by the Dublin Corporation.  As a matter of fact, the feeling of the majority&mdash;and I regret it very much&mdash;is against working the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act any more.  I hope that atmosphere will change.  I had intended, before Deputy Norton mentioned the matter, to put the position before the Minister in this debate.  No money is being borrowed at present that will be available for such work.  The Minister for Finance knows that no money will be available from the loan for the purposes of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act.  Perhaps, later on, when times are more propitious for discussing this matter, the reasons can be more definitely stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton can take it that there is no money available now, even before this loan comes in.  Neither will there be any money available after this loan comes in.  I would be glad to hear from the Minister, or from anybody else, ways and means for borrowing money.  There is no use in getting up and, with a wave of the hand, saying that a big corporation like the City of Dublin can borrow money cheaply and lend it out under this Act.  It is all right to say that a distance away from the problem, but when you are up against those who control money and those to whom you must turn to borrow <Col N="545" /> from, you will find that the problem is not so easy as it looks.</P>

To a reference that I made, the Minister for Finance chipped in and said that the Government had nothing to do with the borrowing of the Dublin Corporation.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Corporation have got under this loan all the money that they could get&mdash;and it is not their fault if more money was not borrowed &mdash;I would just like to say this: if Deputy Norton wants reasons in connection with this matter I would prefer to give them in private to him rather than in public.  He will find at any rate that every member of the Corporation is anxious to put the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act into operation, and no member more so than myself.  Perhaps I may take the major share of the credit for putting £250,000 through by way of loans of this kind.  It is all a question of getting the money.  I would appeal to the Minister to use his influence to see that the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act is developed more in the future than it has been in the past with regard to cottage dwellings built and disposed of under a house purchase system.  The Minister knows the sad story of the cottage scheme of the Dublin Corporation.  He knows the terrible initial loss that the City of Dublin had to bear, in the first instance, by selling these house at a price below their cost to the Corporation, and then the losses sustained in <Col N="547" /> the matter of the instalment payments running into so many tens of thousands of pounds.  Under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, houses were provided for much the same class of people as those provided for under the cottage dwellings scheme of the Corporation, and no loss was sustained.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister say why money for the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act cannot be provided by the Central Government much more cheaply than at present?  They charged 5½ per cent. for money up to the 1st October, and now they are charging 4¾ per cent.  That adds considerably to the cost of local authorities in their efforts to house.  The Government have been able to borrow money at between 3½ and 3¾ per cent.  For some of that money, local authorities were charged 5 and 5½ per cent. so that the Government made a profit of nearly two per cent. on it.  Of course, I admit it was not all profit.  I think the Minister should attempt to devise a scheme whereby an effort might be made to develop house building in urban and municipal areas.  The Minister for Finance should be able to borrow money on more reasonable terms than a municipality.  Last year the Government beat the Corporation in their loan by two points.  They were able to float a 3½ per cent. stock at 98. The Corporation had to float their stock at 96, and a similar stock is to be floated by the Corporation this year at 93.  It would be a distinct advantage to local, as well as national, government if money could be got on better terms so that the community as a whole would have the advantage of those better terms instead of the people who purchase the stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister admits that housing is a national scheme.  Surely the finance to help housing should be on a national basis too.  Could the Minister not devise a scheme whereby he could give local authorities money at 4 per cent?  I am quite sure that if he can make available £500,000 at 4½ per cent. to the Dublin Corporation for the purpose of the Small Dwellings Act, it will be accepted with <Col N="548" /> thanks.  House-building, which is now dropping considerably in and around the city, will then pick up and resume the position in which it was five or six months ago.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton spoke about the materials for the building of houses. He suggested to the Minister that brick or stone should be used in the erection of labourers' cottages.  I doubt whether it is advisable to use stone at all.  At best, a stone house is cold and damp.  Deputy Norton referred to the extra amount of labour which would be given in quarrying the stone and he also mentioned that native brick could be used.  I submit to the Minister that the best way to spread out labour in building is by using concrete blocks, because the concrete block will have to be made on the spot and local labour will have to be employed.  There is as much labour, generally speaking, in raising the gravel and making the blocks as there is in making the brick.  All that can be done locally and provide employment locally.  It will be a much drier house than a stone house.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>As to the dryness of concrete compared with stone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not speaking of mass concrete.  I would advise the Minister to set his back stiffly against the erection of mass concrete houses for labourers.  I urge that for structural reasons and also because of the amount of muck that can be used without being seen in the case of mass concrete.  When blocks are being made, there is an equal amount of pressure on all of them and bad material cannot be so easily worked in as in the case of mass concrete. Where a house is built of concrete. with a cushion of lime or sand around each block, that house will be much <Col N="549" /> drier than a mass concrete house and much drier even than a stone house.  It will approach very nearly in natural dryness to a brick house and it will be much cheaper than a brick house.  I should like to hear what facilities the Minister would be prepared to give a local authority to face up to the housing problem in a semi-urbanised area &mdash;for instance, the administrative county of Dublin.  The Minister is aware that the housing problem in the County of Dublin is causing great difficulty to the County Dublin Board of Health.  Under the Labourers Acts we are limited in the board of health area to a certain contribution from the rates.  Our powers in this respect are practically exhausted in the belt constituted of the north and south rural districts of the County Dublin. Our powers to build more labourers' cottages under the Labourers Acts are virtually exhausted because of the fact that practically all the money that can be charged to the rates to subsidise these houses is used up.  In remoter parts of the county we are not so much hemmed in, but in those areas where we can go on with building there is not such a demand for working class houses.  The board of health have asked the Minister's Department what help they would give the board in carrying through a scheme or schemes of workmen's dwellings in that portion of the county nearest the city.  The board of health could rent them or sell them on a house-purchase basis on economic terms.  In other words, there would be no charge on the rates.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will observe that the Vote before the House is No. 41 and contains two items&mdash;one dealing with the turf supply of last year and the other mainly with grants to public utility societies.  Strictly, the debate should be confined to these two items.  On a Supplementary Estimate, the whole field of local government housing schemes should not be covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matters raised by the Deputy would be germane to the main Estimate but they are not relevant to this Vote.  There are special housing problems in the city and county of Dublin <Col N="550" /> but I presume that there are many similar problems throughout the country which might be raised on this Vote with equal relevancy or rather irrelevancy.  The debate would thus extend over the whole question of housing.</P>

      <P>I shall close my remarks about housing by inquiring from the Minister whether he does not think that a policy of helping house-purchase would be better than providing free grants&mdash;whether a scheme of house-purchase might not be more helpful in the development of house-construction than free grants.  As regards grants for the supply of native fuel for necessitous householders, I wonder how the price of native fuel and the policy of providing native fuel-in other words, providing turf instead of coal&mdash;have been affected by the coal-cattle pact.</P>

      <P>There are just three little matters that I should like to bring to the attention of the Minister on this Vote.  The first is I would like some information as to the activities of the Housing Board, so far as rural Ireland is concerned.  I would like to know what it is doing.  Does it pass plans of houses submitted to it, and does it insist that there shall be compliance with some plan that will relate to the future?  What I want to know is does this Board insist upon a regular plan or is it some hamstrung kind of programme without any actual object in view?  The second thing I want to know is as regards the materials used in the building of houses in the country by the local authorities.  Does the Minister insist that concrete shall be used, and if so, is the material examined and tested by an engineer so that it will be of enduring quality, or is anything done except to build a house and put on a roof?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="551" /> The third matter I want to ask about is one of some substance.  I have considerable difficulty with regard to applications from people who apply for grants.  After the grants have been sanctioned and plots bought under the Land Commission these people cannot get the lands sub-divided.  I put this matter to the Minister so that he might be good enough to approach the Minister for Lands in the matter.  Everyone knows it is the traditional policy of the Land Commission not to sub-divide land.  They seek to prevent the breaking up of land so as to prevent holdings from becoming too small and uneconomic. I rather fancy the Land Commission is still imbued with that tradition.  For that reason I think their attitude is rather &ldquo;to sit tight&rdquo; with regard to applications for sub-division.</P>
    <P>That being so, the rate of building in rural Ireland is being held up, and the only person, I think, that can give an urge in this matter is the Minister for Local Government and Public Health. In cases where land has been purchased for building under the Housing Acts, I think the Minister should urge the Land Commission to speed up on the question of sub-division.  A number of cases have come under my notice.  I have seen another glaring case in the papers, where the Urban Council of Athlone built houses on land that had not been sub-divided.  They have compulsory powers, of course, to acquire land, and the sub-dividing can come afterwards.  The land can be bought by the local authority and taken over until it is sub-divided, but the loan cannot be paid until the actual sub-division takes place.  I would appeal to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to see the Minister for Lands and to urge on him that in all applications where it is obvious to the Land Commission that sub-division has taken place for the purpose of building houses the matter should be dealt with expeditiously.</P>
    <P>I am not at all suggesting that the Minister should ask the Land Commission to depart, in any way, from its hostility to the dividing of land into small farms so as to make them uneconomic.  I am only dealing with <Col N="552" /> the matter of land surrounding small towns in rural Ireland where people have to go out to get a plot of land to build upon.  It is somewhat on the same principle as if a man was asked to divide his farm amongst his two sons. I think expedition in this matter would be of great benefit in many cases where grants are sanctioned, and where it now takes nearly a year before the land is sub-divided.  I hope this will be attended to.  The fact that it has not been attended to has held up a lot of people in connection with the building of houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The last return I have from the Housing Department of the number of houses erected or completed, shows that the number of houses erected by local authorities from 1st April, 1932, to 31st January this year, was, in urban areas, 7,030 and in rural areas, 3,312, totalling 10,342.  The number of houses erected by private persons and utility societies in urban areas was 3,688, and in rural areas, new and reconstructed houses, 5,957, making a total of 9,645 and a grand total of 19,987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy spoke some time ago on the question of cost of housing under the 1932 Act, extended by last year's Act, and compared the cost of houses erected under the Housing Acts, 1924 to 1932.  He said that in the first period 1924-32, 24,231 had been built, and gave us the cost.  As against the 24,000, built in these eight years, just 20,000 have been built in practically two years. Undoubtedly the cost to the State may be greater, but looking at the number of houses built in the two periods, and taking the average of any one year, it will be seen that there was a much greater rate of building; and also even without those figures it is demonstrated that the rate of building from 1924-1932 was not such as would at any period of time overtake the necessity for housing. It would not overtake, at any period of time in the future, the necessity for building to deal with the slum problem or the problem of overcrowding. <Col N="553" /> I hope, with the present rate of building, that within a measurable time we can overcome these two great problems&mdash;the slum problem and overcrowding in our cities and towns, and the problem of providing houses for people who ought to have been provided for, some way or other, during the last 40 or 50 years.  The Deputy who, with his colleagues, was responsible for some of the period, must realise that, at the end of his term, he had not tackled the problem.  He may have faced it&mdash; I am sure he did&mdash;considered it and got all he could in the way of grants from his Government to assist public authorities and to encourage private persons and public utility societies to build houses, but he must realise by now that his Government did not do anything but scratch the surface of the problem.  I am not satisfied with the present rate of building and, therefore, I am not satisfied with the cost to the State.  I wish there were, in some areas at any rate, double the number of houses being built and that double the demand was being made on the State for the provision of grants to enable them to build these houses.</P>
    <P>The Deputy complains that I have not talked on housing and given facts. I think I am talking on it nearly every week of the year, in some place or another.  I have not had much opportunity in the House of talking on it, but any time I have spoken on the subject I have never hesitated to express my opinion, to answer any question and to state very definitely and clearly what the aim and policy of the Government were.  We shall have, I expect, a full-dress debate on the subject when the general Estimates come up, probably next month.  All the activities of the Housing Department and the other Departments of Local Government will, I presume, be gone into in great detail.  Deputy Mulcahy pointed out that it would take £6,500,000 to complete our housing programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so and even when we have expended that <Col N="554" /> sum of £6,500,000 we shall not have finished with the housing problem.  We shall be coming back here for at least another £6,500,000 and I expect we shall get it because the demand will be there.  The demand is there at the moment, rapidly as houses are being built in some areas, and, in other areas, not so rapidly, but still a considerable number of houses are being built in town and country, in city and in rural areas.  In some districts, however, even where a considerable number of houses have been built in the last two and a half years, it would appear that the demand is as great as ever.  Take a town like Drogheda, which has done remarkably well in my opinion.  So far as my information goes, there seems to be just as great a demand as ever there was three years ago when we tackled the problem first.  What I say of Drogheda is true of many of the urban areas. In Dublin a considerable amount of good work has been done and I know that the City Manager, assisted by the members of the Corporation and his officials, is working hard, but, judging by the numbers of letters I get to my Department every day of the year, there seems to be scarcely any slacking off in the demand for housing accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>So that after we have finished the present plan, that £6,500,000 more will not, in my opinion, complete the task that remains to be done and it is just as well to have that known and to let the House and the country realise what it will have to face.  I think from what I know of the feeling in this House with regard to housing and from what I know of the feeling outside, so far as it is vocal in local authorities, and of private opinion generally, the country is quite satisfied to pay the price to get the housing problem adequately and properly dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do believe that grants at at least the present rate will be necessary until this terrible problem has been brought within measurable distance of completion.  Deputy Norton spoke at <Col N="555" /> considerable length on the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act and made reference to the fact that it had not been put into operation by a number of local authorities.</P>
    <P>I have circularised all local authorities which would be empowered under the Act to put it into operation.  My officials&mdash;inspectors of the Department&mdash;who go around the country, have been informed of the views of the Minister and of his anxiety to get this Act adopted, and as a result of the encouragement we have given, it has been adopted by many local authorities in the last two or three years, but, as Deputy Norton knows, the Minister for Local Government is not a dictator.  I do not know whether the Deputy would be inclined to act the dictator if he were in my shoes, but he might change his notions on these matters if he happened to be Minister for Local Government for a while.  Local authorities have their own views and many of them will not allow themselves to be pushed, even in a right direction, by the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>What I say of local authorities in general applies with equal force to the Dublin Corporation.  This much I can say of the Dublin Corporation, that, since the Act was originally passed by the British Parliament, it has done well in the way in which it has generously extended loans to private persons and public utility societies under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  It is true, however, that in the last year, the City Manager has had qualms of conscience on the question of extending further facilities to private persons and public utility societies under that Act.  I have had talks with him on the subject and I have a considerable amount of sympathy with his point of view, because I want, and the House wants primarily, I think, the question of the housing of the poorest classes of the population dealt with first.  We want the people who are in the cellar dwellings taken out of them; we want the people who are in the slums that we know in Dublin taken out of those slums; and we want the people who <Col N="556" /> are in rooms in houses that are over-crowded taken out of these over-crowded rooms.</P>
    <P>It is my view, and the view, I think, of the majority of the people who have given consideration to the matter, that these aspects of the housing problem must be tackled first. In the secondary place, comes the almost equally urgent problem of providing houses for people who are at present living in housing accommodation which is unsuited to them, but who are there only because they cannot get proper houses.  There are decent artisans and there are many of what are known in some places as &ldquo;white collar workers&rdquo; who are living in single rooms or sharing rooms in small houses and who are able to pay an economic rent, but who, up to the present, cannot get housing accommodation.  I would like, and I know that the City Manager would like, to be able to help these people, but he has put it to me over and over again that his first problem is the housing of those who are in the worst condition, and, as I say, I have considerable sympathy with his point of view.  I have, however, urged upon him the desirability of not ceasing the operation of the Small Dwellings Act, so far as the Dublin Corporation is concerned, and I know that that matter is getting his consideration.</P>
    <P>There was some truth in what Deputy Norton said about the restrictions that were suggested to be put upon the utilisation of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  But I do not think that the suggestions mentioned by Deputy Norton were ever put into operation.  Deputy Norton also referred to the question of delay. There has been considerable delay in some housing schemes, and complaints have from time to time reached my Department on the matter.  Whenever we got complaints we sent officials of the Department to the particular scheme and got into touch with the local authorities' officials and contractors. We are always ready to hear complaints of that kind and anxious to help in expediting schemes.  Any influence that the Department of <Col N="557" /> Local Government and Public Health and its officials can use in helping to get over difficulties and to speed up house-building will be exerted towards that end.  The speeding-up of house-building is badly needed in town and country.</P>
    <P>The question of building the houses in brick and stone versus concrete was referred to.  For my own part I would very much prefer that houses should be built of brick or stone rather than in concrete, whether blocks or mass concrete.  Of course, mass concrete is the least desirable of any of these four kinds of material.  But there are not many places in the country where bricks are available. Where bricks are available for the ordinary labourer's cottage or house or small dwelling for the artisan built in town or city it adds a not inconsiderable sum to the cost.  I regard it as my job within certain strict limitations to get as much value as possible out of every pound of public money that is spent on housing or indeed on any other purpose under the Local Government Department.  I, myself, and anybody who bears responsibility must examine very closely every scheme put up to us; look into the cost and see what amount of housing is going to be provided for every thousand pounds.</P>
    <P>But we have to look at it also from the aspect of the tenant.  Every £10 additional cost on one of those labourers' cottages costing round about £300, some of them considerably less, means an additional sixpence a week to the tenant in the way of rent. That is a very heavy burden.  These things have to be taken into consideration. But there is no objection in the Department&mdash;provided the additional cost is not too great&mdash;to having these houses built by the local authorities in brick or stone.  There are places in the country where this has been done.  If I remember aright, I think it was in Macroom that one of our housing schemes was built of stone with practically no additional cost.  There was, of course, some additional cost but it was not very much.  There are other places too <Col N="558" /> where stone is available and there the houses were built of stone.  Provided that the additional cost is not too much per house there is no predisposition in the Department against building them of stone.  My own view is that where bricks can be used, I would prefer to have them used, but with the limitations that I have just mentioned.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Norton who also referred to the question of building small houses in towns.  We have already approved several schemes for small houses in the small towns and villages in different parts of the country.  If I am not mistaken some of these schemes have already been put into operation in Wexford.</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton talked about the necessity for cheaper money.  I would be very happy indeed if we could get cheaper money provided at much less cost for all the local authorities in the country.  This question of borrowing money adds considerably to the difficulty of the Government and of the local authorities.  In my capacity as Minister for Local Government I have not got to deal with the raising of the loans, but I know that this matter of the cost of the loans receives the very earnest consideration of the Ministry.  I do not know if Deputy Belton has any practical suggestions to offer as to how money could be got.  However, going into that question would probably get us into suggestions and discussions of the kind that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle would not permit on this Vote.  However, other opportunities will arise, and if the Deputy has any suggestions to offer as to how to get cheaper money I, for one, will be very happy to hear him.</P>
    <P>We come now to the money provided for free fuel.  There was a sum of £25,000 voted.  Of that sum £12,723 11s. 8d. was spent.  Deputy Mulcahy mentioned that £13,000 was the amount allocated to Dublin.  The figure was £13,238.  There was spent of that a sum of £5,670 1s. 5d.</P>

      <P>Yes, but if Deputy Mulcahy were Minister they would have got none.  At any rate they got £5,670 worth of it.  There was allocated to Cork £2,519, but Cork got £2,710 1s. 5d; Limerick, £1,266 3s. 6d.; Dunleary, £81 10s.; Waterford, £908 5s.; Galway, £100 12s.; Dundalk, £202 5s. 10d.; Drogheda, £386 19s. 3d.; Wexford, £378 3s. 2d.; Sligo, Nil; Tralee, £290 9s. 5d.; Clonmel, £93 13s. 3d.; Bray, £277; Athlone, £51 7s.; Carlow, £93 10s. 4d.; Cobh, £213 10s. 1d.</P>
      <P>Out of the total voted, a little over half, £12,723 11s. 8d., was spent.  This was largely because in some areas they did not see fit to use it and in other areas they could not get the supply of turf that was demanded.  In Dublin, during some of the time, they were asked to pay too much for it.  At any rate, that shows there was a tremendous demand for the turf supply that time.</P>

In other places it was sold per cwt., and these were the prices: Dún Laoghaire, 1/6; Drogheda, 1/5; Dundalk, 1/5; Limerick, 1/3, in yard; Waterford, 1/4, delivered in the yard, and sometimes 1/6; Wexford, 1/2 to 1/3, delivered. There were difficulties in getting supplies in some of the towns and there was also a difficulty between different towns, sometimes towns pretty close to each other, about the question of price; but taking into consideration that the scheme was a new one, that the turf scheme under the patronage of the Department of Industry and Commerce had only been got working, we are satisfied that the granting of that free turf brought a considerable amount of relief to people who were badly in need of it, and we think, with the additional relief that has been brought to so many people by the Unemployment Assistance Act, that the continuance of the scheme is not necessary.</P>

    <P>Last August a Supplementary Estimate for £80,000 for Army pensions was passed by the Dáil and was intended to cover expenditure under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1934, but as that Act was not passed until September 13th, 1934, it became necessary to introduce another Supplementary Estimate in order to regularise the position.  In presenting this new Estimate the opportunity has been taken to revise the former Supplementary Estimate in the light of the fact that it was not possible to get the administrative machinery functioning as early as was anticipated and that, in consequence, the number of cases to be dealt with during the present financial year will be less than was originally expected.  Hence, the present Estimate is in substitution for that passed last August and the Dáil is now asked to approve the sum of £18,600 instead of the £80,000 then voted.  Further, savings on other subheads of the Vote to the extent of £7,400 have been effected and these have been used to offset the gross sum of £18,600, leaving a net sum of £11,200 to be voted in the present Supplementary Estimate.</P>

      <P>There follows from his inactivities and his partiality in certain cases a tendency on the part of some people in the country to think they can do anything they like and the Attorney-General is going to regard them, so to speak, with the blind eye. The Attorney-General started this financial year very badly and he seems to be winding it up just as badly.  We have occasion from time to time to put questions to the Minister for Justice with regard to acts of violence carried out in the country with arms.  We never got very much satisfaction from the Minister for Justice with regard to these things, but there are one or two samples of these cases in which the Attorney-General has a responsibility. I would like to put those matters up to him now to see what kind of defence he can make in respect of his general attitude.</P>

    <P>On the 28th April last there was considerable disturbance in the town of Mohill.  An attempt was made to take forcible possession of the Gárda barracks.  A shot was fired in the street and a platform intended for use at a public meeting was taken and maliciously burned.  The matter came under the notice of the Guards.  They were involved and the matter came to be dealt with by a charge against certain persons.  That charge was brought before the District Court and <Col N="564" /> the facts of the case were brought out at that court.  The barrister who represented the State in the court pointed out that men to the number of 50 assembled in Mohill on the night of the 28th and acted in a riotous manner.  A shot was fired and an attempt made to take possession of the Gárda barracks, while a platform intended for a United Ireland Party meeting was set on fire.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The police superintendent detailing what happened said that a particular man fired a shot in the air, some others carried hurleys and another man carried an iron bar; telephone wires were cut, 240 yards of wire were taken away and a number of baton charges had to take place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <P>The superintendent said: &ldquo;I have no hesitation in saying from information in my hands that there was an organised attempt to seize the barrack and run the Guards out of Mohill.&rdquo;  The district justice, commenting on the situation, said that he had to express appreciation of how Superintendent Ryan had met and handled this dangerous situation in Mohill that night.  The Guards' barracks would have been taken and burned to the ground but for his action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Attorney-General had this case before him apparently his instructions were that if the persons charged <Col N="565" /> with these offences recognised the District Court certain very serious parts of the charge would be withdrawn. For instance, the State Solicitor said: &ldquo;If the defendants agreed to be tried by the district justice the conspiracy charge would be withdrawn, as also a charge against James Agnew of having in his possession a revolver with intent to endanger life and the charge against the other defendants of aiding and abetting Agnew to have in his possession a revolver.&rdquo;  There was a conspiracy to invade the town of Mohill and, if necessary to their purpose of destroying the platform erected for the purpose of a political meeting, the persons were prepared to attack and, in the words of the district justice from the evidence before him, burn down the barracks there and they had firearms and iron bars in their possession; yet the attitude of the Attorney-General was that if these people would be so kind as to recognise the District Court all the serious aspects of the charge would be withdrawn. They recognised the court.  I could not say what the punishment imposed was, but I do not think it was very much.</P>

      <P>I am trying to keep the Attorney-General straight.  One of the ringleaders who evaded arrest for some time was subsequently taken. Superintendent Ryan was asked in court by the person charged: &ldquo;Did you not <Col N="566" /> ask me to do something, and did I not save the situation?&rdquo;  Superintendent Ryan said: &ldquo;You did not, and if you were not there that night there would be no crowd.&rdquo;  When that man was charged with these offences the attitude taken up was that if he recognised the court the serious part of the charges would be withdrawn.  When you compare the attitude taken up in a case like that with the attitude the Attorney-General takes up in quite a number of other cases sent, for instance, before the Military Tribunal, there is a very definite stamp of partiality on the Attorney-General's actions.  Personally, I do not think that he can escape being convicted in the public mind of that partiality.  I am sure that this House would like to hear, and is entitled to hear, from the Attorney-General any defence he has to make and any explanation he has to give of his policy in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the way he began the year, and he is finishing it in this particular way.  We shall take another couple of samples of charges being brought against people who were in possession of arms, the type of courts they were brought before and the results and consequences to them.  In the beginning of December an outrage was committed in the Strokestown area and the Gárda carried out a series of visitations of a number of houses in the area that were described as Republican houses.  In a hayshed attached to one of these houses a service rifle was found and two occupants of the house were charged, an uncle and a nephew, the nephew being the local captain of the I.R.A.  The Attorney-General apparently considered that the case was not one to go to the Military Tribunal, that it would be adequately dealt with before the District Court.  The District Court sat some time in December.  The uncle appeared before the court and was acquitted.  The nephew would not recognise any court like that.  He was not arrested and he told the local sergeant that he did not recognise the court.  The case against the nephew was adjourned and was again brought on in January.  The sergeant swore that the person charged would not <Col N="567" /> recognise the court and was not going to come to the court, and a fine of 10/- was imposed.  A service rifle was found in a hayshed attached to the house of the person charged.  He was not arrested, and the punishment inflicted, although he refused to come before the court or recognise it, was a fine of 10/-.</P>

      <P>I am not discussing it.  Then we come to another case. On 18th September, under certain circumstances, members of the Gárda visited the house of Patrick Quinlan near Glanworth, County Cork.  They searched an engine room in an outhouse of Quinlan's farm and found in a milk can, part of a milking machine, an automatic pistol and some rounds of ammunition.  The Attorney-General thought fit to send that case before the Military Tribunal.  As to the type of man who was being dealt with, Superintendent Brady gave evidence that the prisoner was of very good character generally and there were no convictions against him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result, what happened?  Quinlan got nine months' imprisonment. Here you have a case in which a military service rifle is found in a hayshed in a particular house in the North Roscommon area.  Then you have a case in which an automatic pistol and some rounds of revolver ammunition are found in a milk can in an outhouse on a farm in Cork.  One case goes before the District Court and the person charged refuses to recognise that court. He is not brought to it by the Guards. The other person is brought before the Military Tribunal.  There is no question of the recognition of the courts there, and when we come to write the end of the story one person who does not recognise the court is fined 10/- while the other gets nine months' imprisonment. I only quote these two <Col N="569" /> cases but numerous other cases could be quoted from one end of the country to the other.  Again, I do not think that the Attorney-General can excuse himself before the people of a charge of criminal partiality in the carrying out of his duties.  I do think that some defence of some kind or another should be made by him in this House, by way of explanation of what his policy is in these matters.  We should like to hear what he thinks of the success or otherwise of his policy, what is the objective of his policy, and how he is succeeding in attaining his objective.  We are now only dealing with a period of nine months of his responsibility.  But he has had two years' experience before entering on that nine months.  There is no sign that he has changed his tactics in any way, and, therefore, I think we should have some explanation from him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">

      <P>It seems to me that the Minister for Finance in introducing this Supplementary Estimate has not shown a feeling of very great courtesy to this House.  I think that when a Minister introduces an Estimate he should be in a position to explain the necessity for the Estimate to the House.  He should not come into the House, as obviously the Minister has come, in a complete state of abject ignorance.  We ask him to explain what is the necessity for these extra charges and the Minister knows nothing about them.  He gets up and makes the foolish statement that additional provision for fees to counsel, for conducting State prosecutions, etc., is occasioned by the State's defending actions brought against it.  What is the necessity for extra prosecutions and why have they cost us so much more?  Why is it there is this extra sum of £5,500 for fees to counsel?  We want to know all that and we require something more convincing than the foolish explanation of the Minister.  If the Minister's explanation were correct, or if the Minister would go to the trouble of ascertaining the facts, the Minister would see that the additional receipts anticipated in respect of costs and fees recovered by the Chief State Solicitor amount to the puny sum of £100.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If these actions brought against the <Col N="570" /> State are all foolish, ill-considered, unfounded actions, as the Minister would have us believe, why is it that the extra costs awarded to the State have amounted to the wretched little sum of £100?  Is that not a proof that in the cases that came before the courts, the law officers, the Attorney-General and his advisers, have proceeded in a most foolish fashion?  They have brought prosecutions that they could not maintain.  They have had motion after motion for <i>certiorari</i> granted in the courts and have had to pay the costs.  Is that not the reason that the Minister for Finance is thoroughly ashamed of the Attorney-General and of the Attorney-General's counsel who advised him, that the Minister for Finance is afraid to give us the facts, if he knows them, which I very much doubt?  I think this House is entitled to full particulars of the expenditure.  What is the cause of this extra expenditure?  Why is it that an extra £2,000 is required for various expenses of juries, defence of prisoners in case of murder, and miscellaneous expenses of State solicitors?  The item for defence of prisoners in cases of murder would amount to a very trifling sum. I suppose 30 or 40 guineas would cover that item.  Would the miscellaneous expenses of State Solicitors account for the balance?</P>
    <P>We all know that a great number of cases have been brought before the Military Tribunal and the State Solicitors do not figure there at all. The State Solicitors do not come up to prosecute before the Military Tribunal, as they come to prosecute in the Central Criminal Court.  The prosecution before the Military Tribunal is conducted by a special solicitor, not by the State Solicitor for the county.  What is the reason then for that extra £2,000?  Does it not come down to this, that the State has been saddled with an extra £7,000, the amount of this Supplementary Estimate, because the work of this Department is being shockingly badly done, because individuals have had to come into court again and again and have had to invoke the aid of the courts to set them right, to vindicate their <Col N="571" /> liberties which the Executive Council and the Attorney-General have been endeavouring to invade?  But, Sir, as far as these items of £5,500 and £2,000 are concerned they are trifling. They are of no consequence.  The real sub-head which is of importance is the sum of £238 for the office of the Attorney-General.  I say that as far as I am concerned, and, I believe, as far as every single member of this House who has any respect for law and order, any respect for the administration of justice is concerned, we shall give no vote, not merely for £238 but for one single farthing, which goes to support the office of the Attorney-General, when the Attorney-General is not doing the work which is his duty and when the Attorney-General&mdash;and I use these words advisedly&mdash;is shutting his eyes to crime.</P>
    <P>There is one principle of law, Sir, which is thoroughly well established. Where one individual takes the life of another individual, he must justify the taking of that individual's life. That is the law.  It is fixed.  It is established right down from the very basis of our law.  If you take the life of your fellow-man, you must justify that taking of life.  You may partially justify it.  You may reduce it to manslaughter, but, <i>prima facie</i>, whenever you take the life of a fellow-man, you are guilty of murder, and the burden of proof is on you to reduce that from murder to manslaughter, or to justifiable homicide, if you can justify it.  Acting on that principle, Sir, a body of men, in Marsh's Yard, in the City of Cork, admittedly opened fire on a body of civilians&mdash;admittedly killed one of them and admittedly wounded six. Those men, in law, are guilty of murder until they have shown some facts&mdash;if they can show facts&mdash;reducing that shooting from murder to manslaughter, if they can so reduce it, or to justifiable homicide, if they can so prove it to be.</P>
    <P>Now, Sir, let us take the facts of this case.  There was a sheriff's sale&mdash; whether legal or illegal I shall not <Col N="572" /> stop now to argue.  At any rate, there was a sheriff's sale in Marsh's Yard in Cork.  A small body of men&mdash;15 in number&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A body of 15 men in a lorry got through the gate of Marsh's Yard.  The lorry ran into a pen immediately in front of the gate, and there was brought to a standstill.  Inside that yard there were then 15 unarmed men in a lorry and some three or four young men who came in in the wake of the lorry. That was the position in Marsh's Yard.  At the outside, there were 20 civilians.  There were very nearly 50 Guards.  Within 20 seconds, according to one superintendent of the Guards, and within 30 seconds according to another superintendent, a cordon was formed outside the gate, and there was no possibility of anybody else coming in.  Then you have the situation that before they could even jump out of the lorry you have these 15 men cooped up in the lorry opposed to 40, or nearly 50, members of the Civic Guards.  It is ridiculous to suggest that those 20 men, if they had broken the law, could not have been arrested and prosecuted, under the law, without the use of revolver fire or rifle fire.  What happened, however? I am glad, at any rate, to be able to say that not a single uniformed Guard disgraced himself that day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, Sir, that we are not.  I think, however, that I am entitled, at any rate, to say that much in favour of the Guards.  If I may not say any further words in favour of the uniformed Guards, I shall say nothing, but I shall say this much, and this is the very essence of the matter: that not because there was any danger&mdash;according to their own sworn testimony&mdash;but because they thought danger might arise, and as a precautionary measure&mdash;those were the very words used by one of these Guards&mdash;they opened fire, and as a result they hit seven men and murdered one man.  Now, some Deputy wanted to know what happened at the coroner's jury.  The coroner's jury did not bring in a verdict exculpating these men.  The coroner told the jury not to bring in a verdict of that sort.  He said, in the course of his address, that it was a very unusual thing, and unprecedented in his experience, for a case like that to be left to a coroner's jury at all, and he expressed his surprise that the ordinary procedure was not followed and that, where life was taken in such circumstances, the men were not brought before the district justice. That was the coroner's view, and, following out the view expressed by him, the jury found that Michael Joseph Lynch died by bullet wounds. That was all that was necessary, so far as the coroner was concerned.  They did not find that the man died by bullets fired by the Civic Guards and that the Civic Guards were entitled to take that course.  Even if a verdict of that kind had been brought in, there would still have been the duty of the Attorney-General to have instituted proceedings, but such a verdict was not brought in, and no proceedings of any kind have ever been instituted against those men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How is there going to be any respect for law, in view of such proceedings? How can there be respect for law?  Is there any other place on God's earth where such things could happen?  Is there a single person on the face of God's earth, responsible for the bringing of State prosecutions, who would close his eyes to proceedings of that <Col N="574" /> nature?  Here you had a case the facts of which are perfectly public.  There is no question about that.  Here you have a body of armed men, with the deliberate intention of shooting to wound and kill&mdash;it is not denied by them&mdash;who opened fire upon a small defenceless body of 15 or 20 unarmed men.</P>

      <P>Is not that a case which ought to be investigated? Why has it not been investigated?  Do we not know, and does not every single member of this House know, that if those men had belonged to a different association, if they had been political followers and not political opponents, if they had been political allies and not political opponents of the Fianna Fáil Party, those Guards would have been prosecuted forthwith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here you have got a case which, on the surface at any rate, is <i>prima facie</i> a case of murder, and you have the Attorney-General making himself an accessory after the fact of the crime by instituting no proceedings.  Surely this House cannot stand for that doctrine.  That is the doctrine which the House is asked to stand for; that the Guards can shoot down ordinary civilians, and that there will be no prosecutions if they do so; that the armed Guards are licensed executioners is the Attorney-General's attitude when he brings no proceedings in this case.  Why has he not done so? We know.  The law is not to be impartially administered.  Touch a finger of people of another political view and proceedings will be taken.  But the Guards can shoot down political opponents of the Attorney-General and he will not prosecute them.  They are perfectly safe while he is Attorney-General. They have immunity from punishment.  If an occurrence of this kind happened in any other country, if it happened in England or Scotland, would there not be an inquiry forthwith? Would there not be an investigation forthwith before the district justice?  Would not the public be satisfied, if these men were brought before a district justice, if there was not a <i>prima case</i> for a jury, if <Col N="575" /> these men did no wrong, that they would be acquitted?  Why has not the Attorney-General taken that step?  I charge the Attorney-General with this that he has not taken that step because he knows these men could not be acquitted.  That is a charge I deliberately make against the Attorney-General. I charge him with having failed to discharge the duties of his high office.  I charge him, in one of the gravest occurrences that have taken place in modern Irish history&mdash;the first time in which human life has been taken by the Guards&mdash;with deliberately acting in a partisan spirit and I charge him with degrading the high office that he holds.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked how was there going to be any respect for the law if such conduct as he described could be attributed to the Attorney-General.  I wish to say first that, in my opinion, the administration of justice here has produced respect for the law, and has taught all sections of the community that the law will be enforced, is being enforced, and has been enforced, so far as I have had control of it since I took over the reins of office.  The Deputy developed his attack, and used rather strong language condemning me; suggesting that I have been a traitor to my duties; that I am not fit to occupy this <Col N="576" /> position; and he based all that on one single case about which, apparently, he feels very deeply, and in which he was engaged for the defence at the coroner's inquest.  The Deputy has mentioned this case several times in the House, and he has now had an opportunity to let himself go.  He has let himself go with a vengeance.  I make bold to say that the Deputy's description of what happened in connection with the Marsh's Yard incident is not correct, is not true, and is not a fair statement.  I do not think it is proper for the Deputy as he has done to come forward and pretend to inform the House that he is giving an unbiassed statement of the facts and then to ask the House to judge whether, in the light of the facts, and his description of them, there has been failure on my part to take action which he says I should have taken.  At the end of his remarks he said that if the incident which he purported to describe happened in any other country, in England or Scotland, the members of the Guards who used firearms on that particular occasion would be brought before a court of summary jurisdiction and a charge of murder would be preferred against them.  As far as I am aware, I am sure the Deputy could, if he looked up this type of affair, find that there have been several instances in which firearms were used in putting down riot.  On several occasions when the armed forces of the Crown have been used I defy the Deputy to produce a single case in which the charge of murder was levelled against police officers or the military responsible.</P>

      <P>I am not drawing on my imagination.  Prior to the particular sale at which the unfortunate shooting incident took place there was another sale attempted in Cork, and, if my recollection serves me right&mdash;I think I am not drawing on my imagination in saying this&mdash;the mob, under the control and direction of friends of the Deputies opposite, practically beat the Guards off the <Col N="580" /> streets of Cork.

      <P>No Deputy who is not prepared to draw on his imagination or shut his eyes to what were the facts in connection with the circumstances of the time will deny that when this sale was being arranged in Marsh's Yard the Guards were faced with the possibility that an effort would be made to overwhelm them as well as the persons who attended there to buy the cattle.  It is all nonsense to pretend that this was an open yard.  The complaint made at one time was that the gates were shut for what should have been an open sale.</P>
      <P>Nobody who is not living in the moon will fail to realise that the Guards, on that particular occasion, were dealing with a very troublesome and difficult situation, a situation which was not peculiar to Cork.  The trouble in connection with Cork was greater than in other areas, partly due to the fact that the crowd had scored a great measure of success on the previous occasion to which I referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone knows that, although certain of the more level-headed leaders of the Party opposite attempted to restrain their followers and prevent violence at sheriffs' sales, certain areas were at that time seething, due to the instigation of those who saw that if the sheriffs' sales could be carried out their campaign against the non-payment of the annuities was bound to fail.  Then the method of bringing people to <Col N="581" /> these sales, people armed with sticks with a direction to say nothing and to pretend that they were members of the public, had been followed in several instances.  But apparently the Guards must have had the feeling or have got some information that the organisation which had been attempted on a wide scale of getting groups of farmers to mix with members of the public at these sales and then prevent people opening their mouths to bid had not been successful. These men were known to be there to buy the cattle.  The Guards felt, as is clear from the manner in which they arranged their forces, that there was going to be serious trouble at the sale.  What the Guards did was to put 50 Guards in Marsh's Yard to surround the buyers who came there with an armed guard.  Was not that well known?  No one can deny for a moment that the gentlemen who, as it turned out had organised on a large scale a huge crowd to assemble in the City of Cork, foregathered in the vicinity of Marsh's Yard.  They knew quite well that there was an armed guard going around with those men who were attending the sales. The gate was closed so as to prevent, if possible, violent interference with the sale, but the people who were organising this form of interference specially prepared a lorry as a battering ram and put 15 or 20 young men into it.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney completely omitted to give a true picture of the scene there with a howling mob of two or three thousand people outside the yard and with this lorry, used as a battering ram, charging the heavy gate leading into the yard.  It appeared suddenly.  It burst through the cordon of Guards with, as I say, a howling mob behind to get into the yard.</P>
    <P>The uniformed Guards were, if you please, to be sufficient to deal with them.  A superintendent had been knocked down by a lorry and it was lucky he was not killed.  The miracle of the whole affair was, as some people have remarked, that many people were not killed on that occasion. This matter has to be put in <Col N="582" /> its proper setting, in the background of the agitation which was being winked at, covertly assisted by friends of the Deputies opposite and was carefully organised.  The men charged by the responsible police authorities with the protection of the lives of the persons bidding at that auction exercised their judgment and I am to sit down solemnly, weigh up the rights and wrongs and decide in a matter where split seconds count whether the members of the Gárda, charged with a certain duty, were wrong in thinking that the force that appeared thus suddenly in the gateway, in the circumstances I have described, were armed and were going to do violence to and, perhaps, do to death the men whom it was their duty to guard.</P>

I take it that when the responsible Gárdaí officers commit rifles, guns or deadly weapons to the hands of certain members of the force, they instruct them as to the circumstances in which they are to be used, and rely upon their judgment to use them for the purpose for which they are intended.  I am not going lightly to arraign these people for murder, even though the Deputy thinks I should do so.  I think that the argument is all the other way&mdash;against doing that.  To come back to Deputy Mulcahy, he used language which, if he were serious, he should have justified better than he did.

In the judgment of some people, the Deputy might possibly be excused for expressing an opinion that a certain other course might have been followed in two cases, but to say that he was justified in charging me with being criminally partial, on the strength of the matters he described in his speech, is monstrous.

      <P>If I recollect aright, he discussed it on the adjournment. I have not the papers here, and, at this distance of time, I am not in a position to speak with absolute certainty as to the way in which that case came before me or how it was dealt with.  The Deputy seems to overlook <Col N="585" /> the fact that I have cases before me frequently, with police opinion as to what is the most advisable course to adopt.  I pay the greatest attention to the recommendations of the super-intendents in charge of the local areas. I have to decide, for instance, in certain cases, whether, in the initial stages, they should be transferred to the Military Tribunal.  When the case gets past the stage of preliminary investigation, I have to decide whether it should be transferred from the local venue and dealt with at the Central Criminal Court.  Where it is suggested that a case should go to the Military Tribunal, it is often most helpful to have it investigated in the District Court and transferred subsequently, if the evidence justifies the district justice in returning the case for trial.  I cannot say that my recollection of the Mohill case is absolutely correct, but, to begin at the end, I think that what happened in connection with that case has been more than justified by the condition of affairs in that area since then.  There has not been another case of that kind in the Mohill area.  The Deputy asks what is the objective.  I have to combine, to a certain extent, with the Gárda in charge of the peace and order of the district, and, often, I have to yield to their judgment as to what is the wisest course to adopt in connection with particular cases.</P>
      <P>The Deputy overlooks completely this fact that no district justice is bound to accept and deal with summarily, any case that comes before him.  It is altogether a matter for his own judgment. Directly that a case is presented to the district justice and he is asked to deal with it summarily, he can refuse to deal with it in that manner, and return the accused for trial.  In this particular case the district justice dealt with the case summarily and accordingly imposed the sentence which the Deputy read out, which was pretty severe and sharp, namely, six months in one case and four months in the other and several cases of two months.</P>

      <P>The Opposition are quite inconsistent in their views.  They make complaints about sending cases before the Military Tribunal and they complain about cases being dealt with summarily.  I am altogether in favour of the use of the ordinary courts.  I am altogether in favour, where it is possible, of having justice satisfactorily administered in local areas by the local justices and by local juries.  I am altogether in favour of that.  Everyone will agree that the more quickly we can return to the normal recognised ways of trying prisoners the better.  We have a case here which was dealt with in the ordinary courts, and dealt with severely, and dealt with in a manner which has produced peace and order in that district.  The area is a very difficult one and the Deputy knows it.  Yet I am supposed to be criminally negligent of my duty in allowing that case to be tried in that particular area.  That is the indictment which is brought against me and it is an indictment that could not stand one second's investigation.</P>
      <P>Then the Deputy jumps a period and comes down to the month of December to find another case to buttress up some of his outrageous charges.  I see that the Deputy smiles.  No doubt he may think he is justified in making statements of this nature here.

      <P>The case was not referred to me at all.  The Deputy must be aware that although I am in charge of all prosecutions, the dealing with prosecutions and the initiation of prosecutions are not all referred to me. <Col N="587" /> Very many of them are not referred to me at all.  My name is used in prosecutions, but I could not possibly be expected to attend to all of them.  The practice has been, as everyone knows, to allow the judgment of the local Gárda officer and the local State solicitor to be used to see if there is sufficient evidence to institute proceedings in certain cases.  This particular case, if my recollection is right, was not referred to me at all.  Most cases concerned with firearms are referred to me, and most cases in which there is any unusual feature are referred to me for direction.  But in a good many cases the proceedings begin and are completed in the District Court&mdash;this is the usual practice&mdash;and then they are referred to me for formal direction as to whether a prosecution is to come before the Circuit Court or the Central Criminal Court or the Constitution (Special Powers) Tribunal.  So far as I recollect &mdash;I am not pinning myself down to complete accuracy&mdash;this case was not mentioned to me at all.  If it had been I think I would recollect it.  The Deputy's story is a very extraordinary one and does not seem to bear out the inferences he draws from it.  He says that a rifle was found in a man's house and that an uncle and his nephew were charged.  The uncle was acquitted, but the district justice apparently thought there was evidence against the nephew. The nephew refused to recognise the court and apparently in his absence he was ordered to pay a fine of 10/-.  If what the Deputy says is true, the fine of 10/- would seem to be altogether out of proportion; but again the district justice with all the facts in his hands could have refused to deal with the case summarily, or he could have inflicted a much more severe sentence if the charge had the gravity that the Deputy attaches to it.  A fine of 10/- would seem to me to show that a competent district justice, applying his mind to the facts, as presented to him, knowing all the circumstances of the case and hearing the evidence, dealt with it as he thought it should be dealt with by inflicting a fine of 10/-.  Am I to be <Col N="588" /> indicted for that?  Although the district justice could have sent the man to jail and could give him six months' imprisonment if he thought fit, but only inflicted a fine of 10/-, is it suggested that I should have sent that man before the Constitution (Special Powers) Tribunal.  The use the Deputy makes of this is that he compares this case with the case of a man named Quinlan. I recollect that case; the man got nine months' imprisonment.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>The presumption, I should imagine, with regard to all these type of cases before whatever tribunal they may be brought, is that the measure of punishment ought to be much the same.  But the standard of punishment that ought to apply in all these cases is a matter for the courts. And unless the Deputy is suggesting that the district justice is incapable of dealing with the evidence in a case of the possession of firearms, and is incapable of imposing a sufficient sentence, I do not know what he wishes me to infer from his observations that the scheme is different.  I find it difficult to know what the Deputy is aiming at.  He seems to suggest that I am not following a definite, settled policy, or that I should follow a definite, <Col N="589" /> settled policy, that could be easily pointed out with regard to cases that should be sent to the Constitution (Special Powers) Tribunal.</P>
      <P>I think the Deputy, by following the cases that come before that Tribunal, could quite readily come to some understanding of the scheme.  The main objective aimed at, I think, when the Constitution (Special Powers) Tribunal was devised was to ensure that jurors should not be terrorised; to ensure that the courts would be able to deal with serious organised crime, where the conditions in a particular area rendered it likely or unlikely that the cases could be properly dealt with before a jury.</P>
      <P>As I said in the earlier part of my speech, each particular case that comes before me has to be dealt with on its own peculiar facts.  The reasons why, in certain cases, the Tribunal selected is the Constitution (Special Powers) Tribunal differ from case to case, from area to area, and from county to county.  I treat this matter seriously and I treat my duties with regard to the handling of these prosecutions very seriously, I assure the Deputy, whether he believes it or not.</P>

One case goes before the district justice in North Roscommon, although the person involved declines to recognise the court and does not go there, and he is fined 10/-.  The other man is brought by force of arrest before the Military Tribunal and he gets&mdash; again I wish to correct myself; the Attorney-General was right-nine months.  I do not understand that, and I do not understand why nine months <Col N="590" /> is given to a man who is found guilty by the Military Tribunal of having had possession of a revolver, by reason of its being in a milk-can in his outhouse, and why a group of people who walk into Mohill, determined to burn down the police barracks, if necessary, and who carry arms and iron bars, can be described by the Attorney-General as being severely punished by one of them getting six months, ten of them being allowed completely off, and 15 of them getting a suspensory sentence of two months and some three months.</P>

      <P>Yes.  When I answer the Deputy in that way, what I mean is that there are frequently cases in which persons are found in possession of shotguns, and of firearms of other types, and in which the Gárda are satisfied that the possession of those firearms could be explained in some way which satisfied them that the firearms came innocently into the possession of the individual and would not, in any circumstances, be likely to be used for committing any crime.  In those cases, and there are a fair number of them, I consider that the District Court or, if necessary, the Circuit Court, is the proper tribunal to deal with them, but if persons have firearms, and, from their associations and from the reports which come before me as to the circumstances under which they hold these firearms, it looks probable that they were held for use in the commission of crime, I consider that, at the moment, anyhow, the proper tribunal to deal with them is the Constitution (Special Powers) Tribunal. I do not know whether that is a satisfactory test to apply or not, but I think it is, and for the satisfaction of the Deputy, I make clear my attitude with regard to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in introducing the Vote might, if he wished, have given one explanation as to the increase in it, and I suppose he will not object if I mention it now.  This is a Vote which I am quite safe in saying cannot be calculated with any degree of certainty from one year to another.  There is nothing which the circumstances of a particular time affect so much as the number of prosecutions which have to be undertaken by the State.  We have had a very considerable increase in the number of prosecutions which had to be brought.  I brought&mdash;the Deputy would say that I should not have brought them&mdash;before the Constitution (Special Powers) Tribunal prisoners to the number of 551, as against 51 in the previous year, and of those, the great majority&mdash;75 per cent., I suppose&mdash;were <Col N="592" /> gentlemen who were engaged in the business of obstructing the collection of land annuities.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy gives me notice I will supply him with particulars of every single one of them. This attempt, by throwing out vague questions to me, to create an atmosphere will not succeed.  Everybody in the country has seen the necessity for dealing with the organised campaign which has, I think, practically come to an end, but which only came to an end after we had to make extraordinary use of the Constitution (Special Powers) Tribunal.  A great amount of this increased Vote is necessary to provide for the expenses of dealing with over 400 of the Deputy's friends and persons whose activities, I am sure, he will quite sympathise with in cutting telegraph wires, felling trees, obstructing sheriffs' sales and attempting, by every means in their power, to organise such a campaign of obstruction that the land annuities could not be collected.</P>
      <P>I think with regard to the way in which those cases were presented on my behalf it was quite obvious that I did not make any attempt to score over political opponents.  I think the Deputy ought to have the decency to realise, in the way in which large numbers of those men came up charged with very serious offences, that I took a course which might possibly have been condemned on the ground that I was not pressing the charge as far as I might have been expected to press it when I agreed to have the cases dealt with in a manner sufficient to deal with this outbreak.  That was, in allowing the men to be dealt with leniently, and, if they gave an undertaking of future behaviour, to allow them to be released.  But there was nothing, not one word of that, from the Deputy.  He speaks of criminal partisanship, but I do not know if he means it.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £841 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1935, for the repayment to the Contingency Fund of certain miscellaneous advances.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Contingency Fund is, as the House is aware, to defray urgent or unforeseen expenditure which is not covered by the ordinary Votes, and for which it may be impracticable to seek the immediate approval of the Dáil.  Accordingly, the Minister for Finance may make advances from the fund to meet deficiencies on the ordinary Votes and for new services. Advances from the fund are repaid from the appropriate ordinary Votes where a Vote for the service for which the advance is made exists; in other cases, they are repaid from the Vote for the Repayments to the Contingency Fund.  The purpose for which the repayments to the Contingency Fund are required in this case is set out very fully, I think, on the face of the Estimate.</P>

      <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £2,356 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1935, for payments under the Railways Act, 1924, and for other purposes connected with Irish transport.</P>
      <P>With regard to sub-head C, the position is that in the year 1911 the Congested Districts Board advanced a sum of £7,500 to the Galway Bay Steamboat Company for the purchase of the steamer, &ldquo;Dun Aengus,&rdquo; to be used for the transport of passengers, live stock, and goods between the Aran Islands and the City of Galway.  The Congested Districts Board provided, in addition, an annual subsidy of £1,100 out of which the loan instalments were met.  This arrangement continued up to 1926.  Additional grants were made to the company in the years in which heavy repairs to the vessel had to be undertaken.  An investigation by officers of the Department of Industry and Commerce into the company's position resulted in a decision to permit the company to suspend payment of the loan instalments for the four years 1926 to 1929, the subsidy for these years being fixed at £1,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In consequence of economies in working resulting from other activities undertaken by the company, the loss in working on the &ldquo;Dun Aengus&rdquo; was reduced and for the years 1930 and 1931 payments of £500 and £600 respectively only were made. For 1932 the subsidy had again to be fixed at £1,000 owing to exceptional repairs which had to be carried out on the vessel.  With a view to equalising the annual charge to the State, an agreement was prepared <Col N="600" /> which provided for the payment to the company of a fixed subsidy at the rate of £300 per year from the 1st January, 1933, and the writing off of the outstanding balance of £3,693 10s. 6d. of the original loan account.  The company's assent to this agreement was only notified in November, 1934, and the £300 originally provided under this sub-head in the main Estimate was applied in accordance with the terms of the agreement in discharge of the 1933 liability.  The provision now required is to meet the payment for the year 1934.</P>
    <P>There is a second item included in the sum also which arises from the fact that for the period from 1st January, 1931, to 31st May, 1932, during which the State-subsidised Sligo-Killybegs steamer service was in operation, harbour dues at Killybegs were not paid owing to a dispute as to the scale of charges applicable. Agreement has now been reached as to the basis of charge and the sum of £56 is required to discharge the outstanding liability.</P>
    <P>Sub-head CC provides for a payment to the Londonderry-Lough Swilly Railway Company.  It will be remembered that in anticipation of the undertaking by the company of the reorganisation of their entire undertaking, made possible under the provisions of the Railways Act, 1933. and the Road Transport Act, 1933, a subsidy was provided in 1934 to make good a moiety of the loss on working for the year 1933.  The subsidy was paid on the understanding that no further subsidies of that nature would be considered.  However, unexpected difficulties arose in effecting the reorganisation of the undertaking, principally in the matter of raising the additional capital required, and also because of the postponement to 1st July, 1934, of the date for the coming into operation of the Road Transport Act, 1933.  The position which it was hoped to have reached in 1934 has, therefore, had to be postponed for a further year.  Substantial progress has now been made in the preliminary stages of the reorganisation and the subsidy is proposed to <Col N="601" /> make good to the company a moiety of the loss on working in the year 1934.  I understand that a corresponding payment, although on a different basis, will be made by the Government of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The next sub-head is an unusual item and arises from the fact that certain sums were due to the State by this company.  The first of these represents the unpaid moieties and percentages which have accrued as from the 1st July, 1922, under the provisions of the Irish Railways (Confirmation of Agreement) Act, 1919, as continued by the Irish Railways (Settlement of Claims) Act, 1921. The liabilities in respect of the Carndonagh and Burtonport sections were based on the results of working for 1913 when the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Company were allowed, out of gross revenue, £3 10s. per mile, per week, for working these lines, a moiety of the balance of gross revenue in each case being payable to the Government as the owners of the line.  The liability in respect of the Letterkenny Railway is based on a pre-war agreement under which the line was to be worked for 65 per cent. of the gross revenue, the balance of 35 per cent. being similarly payable to the Government, through the Board of Works, as mortgagees in possession. The sums due to the Government had to be retained by the company, however, to meet working expenses and the total liability which thus accrued to the 31st December, 1934, is as follows: in respect of the Carndonagh extension, £5,900 4s. 8d.; in respect of the Burtonport extension, £18,234 6s. 4d.; in respect of the Letterkenny Railway, £28,362 9s. 8d.; making a total of £52,497 0s. 8d.</P>
    <P>While these moieties and percentages are legally due under the provisions of the Act I have referred to, there is a very strong case in equity for their remission, as during the entire period the working expenses of these lines have been substantially in excess of the gross revenue.  In fact, owing to the continuance of losses in working and the inability of the company to meet them, it has been necessary since 1924 for the Saorstát Government and the <Col N="602" /> Government of Northern Ireland to contribute equally in payments to the company to enable the lines to be kept open for traffic.  The total Saorstát advances made during the years 1924 to 1934 amounted to £54,191.</P>
    <P>With regard to these advances it is claimed that the losses incurred by the company in keeping open the three Government lines since 1922 exceeded the amount of the advances, and, while separate working accounts have not been kept, it is thought that the company's contention is well founded.  It may be observed that the corresponding payments made by the Government of Northern Ireland have been treated as free grants and there is no obligation on the company to repay any portion of them.  It is proposed, therefore, to wipe out this obligation.  No charge on the Exchequer will arise on account of the sums made available under this sub-head, as a similar amount will be brought into credit as appropriations-in-aid.  This procedure is necessary in order to have on record the formal approval of the Dáil to the writing off of these amounts.</P>

      <P>I should first like to ask the Minister a question in connection <Col N="603" /> with sub-head C.  I take it that sub-head C has to be read in conjunction with a sub-head which we had a few days ago on Vote 53 for Fisheries. There we had a sub-head EE, which represented moneys due to the Minister for Agriculture in respect of an amount advanced to the Galway Steamboat Company in the years 1911 and 1912. A balance of £3,694 odd has been wiped out, and I understand that in future this provision is to be considered as State liability.  Is the Minister satisfied, having examined the figures, that this annual charge will be adequate to maintain the service and that it will not be necessary to come back to the House and ask for larger sums in future years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been an agreement with the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will recognise that the agreement is not worth the paper it is written on, because you will have to maintain some kind of service. Is he satisfied, after examination of all the facts, that the position is now sufficiently satisfactory to give us a reasonable hope that the annual subsidy will not grow into something greater?  If the Minister believes that this is only a makeshift arrangement, and that he might have to come to the Dáil next year for £500 and in the following year perhaps for £600, it would be very much better to face the job now and to take such steps as are necessary, even to the extent of providing a new boat, in order to make the line a thoroughly efficient service and one in respect of which we can see the ultimate limit of our liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-head CC raises a very large question in regard to the transport conditions obtaining in County Donegal.  I take it the sums under CC and CCC represent the conclusions of the existing transport services of the county.  I think the Minister ought to inform the House of what plans he has in mind for the purpose of providing County Donegal with alternative accommodation both as to goods traffic and passenger traffic. The Minister set up recently a Commission <Col N="604" /> to consider the desirability of establishing a deep-sea port in Donegal.  Of course I believe that the Commission in question was set up for no other purpose than to throw dust in the eyes of the more gullible supporters of Deputy Blaney, Deputy Brady and Deputy O'Doherty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brady Mr. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>And of Deputy Dillon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It was manifestly absurd to suggest that there should be established in any part of County Donegal a really efficient deep-sea port in the accepted sense of that term, whatever might be said for a proposal either to repair the existing ports and improve them, or in the alternative to link up Ballyshannon and Sligo by rail and to link up Stranorlar and Raphoe.  Whatever course is adopted with reference to the deep-sea port proposition, some accommodation will have to be provided for that part of the county which is being stripped of accommodation by the winding up of the Lough Swilly Railway that serves the north and practically the entire west down as far as Dungloe or Burtonport.  The situation is peculiarly difficult, because the roads in West Donegal or in North-west Donegal are extremely inadequate already.  The Minister may have observed that the attention of his colleague, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, was called to the fact that the roads to the Rosses and southern end of Gweedore are already almost impassable for the ordinary traffic to that area.  To imagine that any volume of goods traffic can be carried through the Burtonport country on the existing road accommodation is perfectly absurd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard a lot of talk about a grand scheme which was to isolate Derry, and if the political incompetence of the present Government carries us to the conclusion that we must reconcile ourselves to the permanent exclusion of the Six Counties from the rest of Ireland, and we are forced to determine finally on the material destruction of the City of Derry by diverting the Donegal business to the town of Sligo, surely that should be borne in mind when the Minister is devising <Col N="605" /> whatever plans he intends to adopt, to substitute for the Lough Swilly Railway and the other railway systems in the north of the county.  Surely he ought to make up his mind before he winds up this railway what he is going to do about the deep-sea port business? If he makes up his mind that the best way to handle that situation is to give Donegal an effective connection with Sligo, he must then determine whether he is going to end his railway system at Stranorlar or whether the additional traffic that will come up from Sligo, if it were connected with Stranorlar and Raphoe, should be carried on to the Lough Swilly system.</P>
    <P>If he makes up his mind that the Lough Swilly Railway and the railway to Carndonagh must go, then he ought to consider taking the Minister for Local Government into consultation with a view to devising a completely new road system for the north and the west of the county.  That is a very formidable enterprise.  I do not know how familiar the Minister is with the condition obtaining in any part of the county, but it will be nothing short of a major catastrophe for the densely populated areas in the Gweedore and the Rosses areas if this railway system is allowed to collapse before adequate road accommodation is provided.  If it does collapse, it will enormously complicate the task of making that provision, because while it will be a comparatively simple thing to provide adequate roads, so long as there is comparatively light traffic over them, it will be a desperate enterprise if a really effective system of roads has to be built while the entire traffic of that part of the country is travelling over them.</P>
    <P>It is some time since the Minister dealt with this question of the railways and I expect that, when referring to these two items, he will tell us to-night when he expects these two railway lines to close down&mdash;or does he intend to close them down finally?  The purpose of my opening remarks was to urge upon him, with all the emphasis at my disposal, that before arriving at a determination of that matter, he should arrive at some <Col N="606" /> understanding with the Minister for Local Government and Public Health as to the disposition of the roads, and that he should impress on the Executive Council the necessity for taking heroic measures in regard to the roads in that part of the country.  I think that the Minister might also take this occasion to inform us as to whether or not he has received the report of the Commission which he set up to consider the question of transport in Donegal and whether his mind is moving in the direction of creating a new Cobh in the west of Donegal or the proposal of linking up Sligo with the rest of the county and orienting the rest of the county in that direction.</P>
    <P>I seem to remember the Minister, when he was defending an Estimate in connection with these matters before, saying to Deputy Good, &ldquo;I am asking for these moneys on the clear understanding that this is the last application to this House for moneys to defray the losses on the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company,&rdquo; but I see that under sub-head CC he is asking for £2,000 more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will also explain why he is satisfied that transport will be made available from some other source than the roads of County Donegal, because that source will not be adequate to provide the kind of accommodation, or even to provide the minimum accommodation, that will be required in the event of these railways closing down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one question that I should like to ask the Minister. I should like to ask him whether, in connection with these subsidies, he has <Col N="607" /> considered the necessity for appointing nominees, or claiming the right to nominate at least one director, either in the case of a railway company or a shipping company.  We all know the way a railway director is appointed, and very few people have confidence in railway directors because of the manner of their appointment.  It seems to me that when the State subsidises shipping companies or railway companies they should be entitled to nominate a director to see that their money is secured by decent management.  I am quite sure that the shipping companies, at all events&mdash;because they are of comparatively small importance&mdash;have not got the very biggest men in the country on their boards, and it would seem to me that the State could improve matters a little by claiming and exercising the right of nominating a director.  It is quite possible that this matter has been considered by the Minister's Department, but I should like him to say whether it has or not, and to tell us that where the State's money is going out the State should have a voice in the spending of that money and in seeing that it should be repayable by good money.</P>

      <P>With regard to the question of transport in Donegal, I do not think it is desirable that I should make any statement with regard to general policy on that matter until Deputies have received the report of the Donegal Transport Commission. It must be remembered that the Commission have other functions to perform than to inquire into the possibilities of a deep-sea port in that county. They covered the whole question of transport in that part of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But the deep-sea port was the high light.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The inquiry dealt with the general question of transport there, and the report deals with all transport questions there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>So we may take it that the deep-sea port is dead?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Let the Deputy wait till he sees the report, and then he can see what is dead in Donegal, apart from the Cumann na nGaedheal Party. The Deputy contends that if this railway system, which is operated by the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company, is allowed to collapse, it will be a serious matter for the whole of the county.  I admit that that is true, but it is because the Government realises that fact and because they feel that it must not be allowed to collapse, that this Estimate is being introduced and the loss on last year's working is being made good, partly by the Government and partly by the Government in Northern Ireland.  The onus of working out a scheme of reorganisation which will put the transport system of Donegal on a profitable basis rests with the company.  The company has, in fact, been working out such a scheme.  When I introduced the estimate last year for making up the losses in 1933, I said that that was being given on the understanding that they would carry out immediately that scheme of reorganisation, and that they were not going to get any more subsidies of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The delay in carrying out the reorganisation was due, as I <Col N="609" /> explained, to two causes.  One cause was the difficulty the company had in raising the necessary capital to enable them to effect the reorganisation. I understand that their difficulty in that matter has now been overcome, or, at least, is in sight of being overcome.  The other cause was that the Road Transport Act of 1933, which was to have been an effective instrument in the hands of the company, did not come into operation on the date on which it was expected. It was, by an amending Act passed in the early part of 1934, postponed until July of that year.  Consequently, the reorganisation which we contemplated would take place in 1934 was postponed until 1935, and because of that it is necessary, if the company is to remain in existence at all, to assist it in making good losses incurred in the working of the line last year.  That is why this Estimate is provided.  The Deputy can also be assured on this point, that, in so far as it is possible for the Government to ensure it, the railway services will be maintained until adequate alternative services have been provided, and if the provision of these adequate alternative services necessitates extensive road reconstruction until that work has been carried out.  In fact, no application has yet come from the company to shut down any part of its system.  The Minister's ability to make an order authorising the company to discontinue services depends upon his being satisfied that adequate alternative services will be available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice a change in the form of the undertaking.  I recognise that the Minister for Industry and Commerce must be satisfied before he authorises the closing of part of the line, but the substance of my representation to him was that in arriving at that decision, if he is to be satisfied at all, he should consult his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, and satisfy himself that the system of roads obtaining there is adequate to bear the traffic they will be called upon to bear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Department <Col N="610" /> of Local Government that will be asked to advise on that matter.  In fact, they will be responsible for approving of roads for the various classes of traffic.  Unless they approve of the roads in that part of the county for the traffic that will pass over them, in the event of any portion of the system being closed down, either the system cannot close or expenditure on these roads will be undertaken.  With regard to the point raised by Deputy Moore I considered the advisability of having on the Board of each transport company assisted by the State, a Government director, and very definitely decided against it.  I think the most invidious position a Government could be placed in would be one in which they would have responsibility without power.  If we had a Government director on the board of the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway, on the Galway Bay Steamboat Company, or any other transport organisation, we would be, in fact, taking a share of the responsibility for the decisions of such boards, without having effective power to direct those decisions.  Government participation in the management and direction of organisations of that kind must be 100 per cent. or not at all.  Therefore, I think it is the better policy to stand aloof from the boards of these companies, and to influence them in the direction we want them to act by other means, which are fairly obvious, when it is clear that these companies require subsidies to carry on.</P>

    <P>The excess on this Vote is not entirely due to the speeches made by Deputy Dillon and his colleagues during the course of the year.  Nevertheless, there has been unforeseen expenditure on paper and printing, which has occasioned an expenditure heavier than was anticipated at the beginning of the year.  The excess of £2,750 on Sub-head J.&mdash;Miscellaneous Office Supplies&mdash;is partly due to the same causes.  The expansion of staffs within the last year has necessitated the spply of many items of office supplies.  A substantial portion of the excess is attributable to the fact that typewriters and accounting machines supplied in the years immediately following the change of Government in 1922, are now becoming unserviceable and require to be replaced. A typewriter nominally ceases to be economically repairable at the end of ten or eleven years of use, and replacements have in consequence been so heavy this year that the Stationery Office has only three machines in stock.</P>

The more the <Col N="612" /> Minister swells the list the more the loss.  The Minister referred to Miscellaneous Items, and pointed out that the typewriters have gone out of order.  The fact is that the Minister is the epitome of bureaucracy in this country.  The Minister loves to be lord of all these services.  No man in this country may now move, or buy or sell, and in good time no man will be allowed to walk, to sneeze or to laugh without getting a licence from the Minister.</P>

I shall seize the opportunity to raise another question which I intended to raise on the last Estimate but which I refrained from raising because it dealt with the Oireachtas services over which you, Sir, so gracefully preside. I understand the custom of the House is not to embark on a detailed discussion of these services, as there are other means of doing so.  I take this occasion to recall a statement made by the Minister for Finance when <Col N="613" /> defending his original Estimates after I had drawn attention to the fact that the Book of Estimates was of an unprecedented size and involved a burden of taxation which was a grave reflection on the Government.  The Minister for Finance then blandly replied:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Ah, the Deputy does not understand. The Estimates look big, but this year we have provided for every conceivable head, and whereas last year we had a very considerable number of Supplementary Estimates, we do not expect to have any now.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There has been a snowstorm ever since the financial year started.  It developed into a blizzard two or three days ago when we got 11 Supplementary Estimates in one lump, which were followed by another handful of Estimates the following day.  I venture to say that in this current financial year there have been larger Supplementary Estimates, and more Supplementary Estimates, than in any year since Fianna Fáil came into office.  I am aware that this Government has reduced to a fine art the business of saying to-day what suits the present circumstances and trusting to God that everyone will have forgotten all about it in 12 months' time.</P>

That is the difference between us.

But we have had more Supplementary Estimates this current financial year than ever.  That, says Deputy Kelly, is merely Fianna Fáil piety: that, says Deputy Dowdall, is merely a Fianna Fáil statement.

    <P>Debate resumed on the following Motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that owing to the increasing distress of the farming community arising out of the continuance of the economic war, the Executive Council should take steps to relieve agricultural land of rates during the financial year 1934/35&mdash;(Deputies T. O'Higgins and T.J. O'Donovan).</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion suggests <Col N="616" /> that the agricultural community should be relieved of the payment of rates during the financial year 1934-35 because of the continuance of the economic war.  There is abundant evidence of the increasing distress amongst the members of the agricultural community, whether we take as proof of that the huge amount of arrears outstanding either as rates or as land annuities.  Another thing that illustrates that distress is the tightening of credit by merchants and shopkeepers in the cities and towns. Those engaged in agriculture are experiencing great difficulty in getting an advance of money from some of the larger banking institutions.  Even those engaged in the selling of seeds and farm implements are demanding ready cash payments from farmers, who, for the reasons stated, are unable to make them.  The Government's panacea for the relief of this distress, brought about by Government policy, is intensive tillage.  The farmers are getting the advice to till more land and they hear the slogan &ldquo;Grow more wheat!&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is to be regretted that there was a tendency to allow much of the arable land of the country to go out of cultivation and to turn it over to the bullock.  It was a tendency that should be stopped.  But, the present Government, in their zeal to check that evil tendency, moved the pendulum too far to the other side.  It was agreed that in order to have a balanced agricultural economy the area under tillage should be increased, but, as I have suggested, the Government, in their anxiety to carry out that very laudable idea, went ahead with their tillage policy without examining all the facts.  The result has been that their policy has been a most disastrous one for the agricultural community with corresponding ill-effects on the working-class people of the country. It would be very useful for some members of the Government Party to look up occasionally the statistics provided for them by the Government Departments.  Anybody who takes the trouble to look up the Census of Production for 1933-34, and who directs his attention particularly to page 23 <Col N="617" /> will find most illuminating information. He will find that there is an average 600,000 acres of our land under oats. The average yield of grain per acre is slightly over one ton.  That is calculated to give a ration of something like 36 stone of oats per annum to every member of the community, including young children and babies, or about 26 stone of oatmeal, 1 lb. per day. In that commodity, we have obviously a large surplus, which comes under the heading of &ldquo;exportable agricultural surplus.&rdquo;  We grow about 2,000,000 tons of potatoes which amount is calculated to give to each inhabitant, including young children and babies, about 28 lbs. each week of the year.  Here, again, we have an exportable surplus.  In nearly every department of increased tillage, we find that we have an exportable surplus.  Assuming that we double, treble or quadruple our tillage, we shall certainly double, treble or quadruple our exportable surplus of these agricultural products.  Assuming that we go in for increased tillage, the ordinary farmer will tell you that the produce must be fed to stock. Owing to the economic war, which is mentioned in this motion, the market for live stock and live-stock products has been restricted and made unprofitable. We all agree that we should not expect the farmer to grow crops which he cannot dispose of either in the home market or in a market which is already restricted and rendered unprofitable.</P>
    <P>I remember well the guffaws and marks of approval on the Government side of the House when a Deputy suggested, in his speech, that the British had gone over to the Sinn Féin policy, that they were practising a policy of self-sufficiency and proposed to go extensively into tillage. Everybody should know that that state of affairs can never be brought about in Britain.  She will never, unless she wishes to lose her position in the industrial world, be able to till sufficient land to produce food for her 40,000,000 people.</P>
    <P>The failure of our special representatives at Ottawa is responsible, in my view, for a great deal of the <Col N="618" /> trouble and the depression that exists amongst the farming community at present.  I understand that the scheme for the regulation of meat imports into Britain will come to an end on the 31st March of this year.  It is well known that the Dominions are watching the position in anticipation of what may happen when this agreement comes to an end.  When the Minister gets up to reply, I hope he will have some suggestion to put before the House and that he will give some indication as to what he intends to do in relation to this agreement which comes to an end on 31st March.  We have been told that agreements have been entered into with other countries.  Here, again, I would recommend members of the Fianna Fáil Party, and particularly members of the Executive Council, to look up the census of production and to ascertain how much of our products will enter Germany and what the quantity and value of the imports from Germany into this country will be.  I looked up the position in regard to Belgium and I find that we are buying from Belgium £9 worth of goods for the £2 worth they buy from us&mdash;about 4½ to one.</P>
    <P>We have been told by Fianna Fáil spokesmen that, as a result of recent negotiations, an arrangement has been entered into which should ease the position somewhat for our farmers.  The arrangement referred to is known as the &ldquo;cattle-coal arrangement.&rdquo;  Deputy Belton, I think, described it as the cattle-coalscuttle arrangement.  That arrangement has not had the effect that many people anticipated.  Already there are indications that the price of the imported commodity is to be increased, with corresponding ill-effects on the agricultural community, including agricultural labourers, and on the workers in the towns and cities.  Under ordinary circumstances, we exported cattle to the number of about 700,000 per annum to Britain.  That was before the economic war.  There is no reason why that market should not be opened to us again.  Even under present adverse circumstances. our only enemy&mdash;as Britain has been <Col N="619" /> called by some of the Government spokesmen&mdash;has taken over £500,000 worth of cattle from us in a very short time.  In the year 1934-5 she has paid us for our cattle something like £4,000,000, even with the economic conflict in progress.  I felt, and many other people also felt, that there was a return to sanity on the part of the present Government when it entered into the agreement relating to coal and cattle.  I regarded it as an indication that further agreements with our nearest neighbour were to follow. So far, we have not heard of these agreements from members of the Government or their supporters.</P>
    <P>I was approached by a number of farmers in my own constituency who asked me, not alone to support this motion, but to support another motion on the Order Paper which suggests that the Government should undertake the running of two, three or more farms in the Free State and see if they could make a profit out of them. I do not know what will happen to this motion, but I want to press, as sincerely as I can, upon the responsible Minister that it is about time that we got away from a policy of prejudice and got back to a sane and ordered Government in this country. Let us, once and for all, make up our minds, as I said on a previous occasion in this House, that we cannot expect Canada, or the Argentine, to take our agricultural produce, neither can we expect the people of China or Peru to eat our beef.  I would ask the Minister responsible to press upon the Cabinet the desirability, in the interests of the people in general, and of the agricultural community in particular, to get back to some kind of decent agreement with our neighbours and to get them to open their markets closed to us, in my view, by some contentious politicians and people actuated by prejudice.</P>
    <P>Someone has said that every farm in the country was a factory.  I do know it was at one time the policy of the President of the State to foster, as far as possible, small farmers in their particular industry.  But since he became head of the Government the <Col N="620" /> obverse seems to be the case, and everything he and his Government are doing, in so far as it relates to agriculture, at any rate, is the negation of the policy they preached in this country some years ago.  I am in almost daily touch with farmers in my own area and I can assure the Minister, and the Government, that I have not heard one of these men proclaim, as was charged here last evening, that they would not, in any circumstances, pay their rates or annuities. I do not want to labour that aspect of the situation for certain reasons.  I am perfectly certain that when the Minister and his Government were going before the country they put their policy and programme fully, and I believe honestly, before the people, but so far few of their promises have been fulfilled.</P>
    <P>I disagree with what was said by one speaker last evening on this side of the House, when he apparently suggested that the farmers did not vote for the present Government.  They did vote for the present Government, and if the farmers are in trouble to-day, to that extent, they deserve to be in trouble.  I think it is useless to suggest that the farmers did not vote for this Government, because as the Minister for Local Government pointed out they got their majority in certain rural constituencies. He was careful to admit that one county did not support his policy, namely, County Cork.  In that, again, Cork showed its wisdom.  It is quite true Cork has frequently blazed the trail in this country.  We all look forward to the next general election when, perhaps, the rest of the country will follow in the footsteps of Cork.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister and his colleagues to go closely into the figures which the Department of Statistics publishes from time to time.  If they do they can easily see who is our best customer and whether it is wise for us to open up again the markets we have got or to depend upon whether we might sell a few packages of eggs to Belgium.  I said before that we were pursuing a dangerous policy in allowing too much of our arable land to go out of cultivation.  I agree tillage should be the groundwork of that <Col N="621" /> policy.  But again I emphasise the fact that the present Government in its over-zeal to do the right thing, and to develop the industrial arm of the country, have gone a little too far, and that they have not shown the courage that they proclaim they were capable of showing, in grappling with this question and doing the big thing once and for all.  It is more difficult to swim against the current than to float down with it.  I ask the Government to take their courage in both hands, and as they have made an approach in the matter of trying to regain our market, to make a further approach.  If they do that they will do so without any loss of dignity; they will act as men worthy of the trust and confidence of the country if they get rid of this economic war and the disasters that it has brought in its train.</P>

      <P>When this Motion was introduced Deputy O'Higgins quoted from a speech delivered by the President at Ceannanus Mór on the 14th June, 1931, and tried to lead the House to believe that in that speech President de Valera promised full derating for the agricultural community. The President, on that occasion, when speaking of the amount of money that was being sent out of the country annually to Great Britain, and the magnitude of the amount sent away each year, did say that if that money were retained and some of it applied to derating, that quite easily £2,000,000 could be devoted to that purpose.  I happened to be on the platform when that statement was made by the President, and I say I was not deceived by it, nor was anyone in the crowd listening to him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why was the statement made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>To prove that by retaining £5,000,000&mdash;£3,000,000 for land annuities and £2,000,000 of other moneys sent to England&mdash;the farmers could obtain at least the benefit of £2,000,000 of that money.  But we found that other services which were neglected by the last Government needed relief, and that these were services that would bring relief to the <Col N="622" /> farmers.  We found it would be more advantageous to the farming community to have their annuities halved and consequently legislation to halve the land annuities was introduced. Deputy O'Higgins asked us if it was a promise that President de Valera made to gull the farmers.  I can assure him it was not and I can assure him that it did not gull the farmers, and if Deputy O'Higgins happened to be in County Meath when the next general election was held, he would behold the spectacle of the big ranching farmers sending out their six-cylinder cars to carry people to the poll, although I must say they were running practically empty all day.  It does demonstrate the fact that the farmers were not gulled by any statement made either by President de Valera or by any of the Deputies or others who were present at public meetings down the country. The working farmers voted for us on that occasion.  We were told by Deputy Anthony that the farmers voted for us. Yes, the working farmers did vote for us, but other gentlemen who own large tracts of land dismissed the few employees they had when they learned that they voted for the present Government, and, consequently, left them as a charge upon the rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been stated by Deputy O'Higgins that the action of the British Government was deliberately designed to crush the Irish farmer out of existence. Other speakers on this Motion stated that we could not get along without the cattle trade and that until we could secure the English market again there would be no prosperity in this country.  It merely shows the perverted conception of the whole situation which these Deputies have. Supposing we could get the English market in the morning, would we not be faced with the problem of competing against the produce of the English farmers?  A great measure of protection for the home market has been introduced in England.  A subsidy of 5/- per cwt. for home-produced beef in England has been paid by the English Government in an effort to retain for the farmers of England their cattle trade, and, not alone that, but the farmers in England are at present <Col N="623" /> agitating for a still further increase in the subsidy, and it is anticipated that up to 10/- per cwt. will eventually be paid to help the English farmers to secure a remunerative market for their cattle.  Five shillings per cwt. for a 10-cwt. beast is £2 10s., and that is what we would be faced with at the present time, and if a still further 5/- is put on, we shall be compelled to compete against £5 on a 10-cwt. beast.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>And a £6 tariff on each beast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Less the bounty.  It has been authoritatively stated that the English farmers are losing, even though they are now getting 5/- a cwt. subsidy, 5/- on every 10-cwt. beast they produce for the market in England. Do Deputies opposite suggest for a moment that if our interests clash with the interests of the English farmer, the English Government would give whatever benefits would be derived from the English market to the farmers of this country and allow their own farmers to have a market that would not be a paying proposition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, I wonder if the English market would be as open as it was heretofore.  I am quite satisfied it would not, even though a settlement were made in the morning.  The expansion in the home supply of meat in the English market last year was two and a half cwts., and a corresponding decrease was effected in the competing imports from all over the world.  A further extension of the English home market was to be looked forward to, and a consequent tightening of the quotas, so that even though we could get into the English market in the morning, even though we could have what is called the economic war settled, and even though we could have the tariffs that are now imposed on the entry of cattle into the English market taken off, we would still be faced with the problem of the quota system and the still further question of the £5 per head.  Surely no Deputy can visualise prosperity along those lines?  We have <Col N="624" /> had suggestions as to a way out of whatever difficulties may face us at the present time, but it would appear to me that the biggest problem which public bodies have before them at the moment is the question of defaulting land annuitants.  Deputies who go out through the country and suggest that the people have already paid their land annuities twice over have a great responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies who could pay their land annuities, and who would not pay them, also have a great responsibility. It has been proved that there are Deputies who have not paid their land annuities, or who did not pay them until they were compelled to do so.  If they did not pay them, the position would be that people who had paid their rates would be called on to bear a share of what they had defaulted in. That is not a position which we can tolerate in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies have not told us where this money should come from.  Deputy O'Higgins suggested that we get the money from savings and that we could at least save £2,000,000.  I cannot at the moment imagine where Deputy O'Higgins would suggest we could effect this saving.  Surely it is not to be got by a saving in the existing allowances to farmers.  I am sure he does not assert that there should be any saving in the matter of the housing grants and I am sure he does not recommend any saving in respect of free milk, free meat, welfare schemes, unemployment assistance or bounties and subsidies, because all the money that is voted to these items goes, either directly or indirectly, into the farmers' pockets.  With regard to the free beef, we heard Deputies on the Opposition Benches last evening complaining <Col N="625" /> that there were certain families down the country receiving too much free meat.  They were complaining, in other words, that the farmer had too big a market because certain people were getting too much meat to eat.  Even the money that is devoted to free milk goes directly into the farmer's pocket.  Deputies may laugh&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>If we give more for nothing, we could not effect the savings that would be required to give this money that is asked for.  On the question of the derating of agricultural land, I cannot find myself in agreement with those who suggest that there should be flat derating of all agricultural land.  The small working farmer has been derated to a certain extent. The man who is giving employment has been derated to a certain extent. He is receiving certain reliefs for each man he has employed during the year. So it has been with other small farmers who found that in one way or another certain reliefs were available to them.  Then again the halving of the land annuities gave great benefit to those working farmers throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand we have the large ranching farmers who do not receive any relief under the scheme for the halving of the land annuities.  That is because it was generally found that many of these were freeholders and held their land free of rent.  Any relief in the direction of halving the land annuities was of no benefit to these.  Neither did some of them experience any benefit from the amount of money that was devoted towards the relief of rates calculated on the number of men employed by the farmer during the year.  That was because it was usually found that the large rancher employed only one man caring or herding 200 acres to 2,000 acres of land.  They received no relief under that heading.  Hence the cry of derating from these men, who found that only by derating could they receive any benefit as they did not receive relief under the halving of the land annuities <Col N="626" /> or under any of the other schemes introduced by the Government. I think no responsible Deputy could stand behind any agitation to derate people like that who hold large acreages of land and do not give any employment.  Not only do they not give any employment but they do not even support the local needs.</P>
    <P>This Government has increased the local services during its term of office. It has embarked upon wonderful improvements. I do not think that will be denied by any Deputies on the other side of the House.  Wonderful improvements, of course, had to be effected, because when we took over office we found the position was such that no Government with a Christian outlook could tolerate it for a moment.</P>

In the first part of this motion we find it set down: &ldquo;That owing to the increasing distress of the farming community arising out of the continuance of the economic war...&rdquo; steps should be taken &ldquo;to relieve agricultural land of rates.&rdquo;  I cannot agree that distress is increasing.  If there has been distress in any particular area in the country, or if there has been distress in individual cases, it is amongst those who devoted their farming economy to the rearing of cattle.  I acknowledge that they may have found much distress but I cannot agree that distress is increasing.  As a result of the various agreements that have been made the volume of trade has improved.

      <P>Farmers have been receiving improved prices for all their agricultural produce during the last year; the cattle trade is the only exception to that.  Perhaps those farmers who have been adversely affected by the cattle trade will find it will be more remunerative for them to change their farming economy and have a mixed system of farming rather than pin their faith to the rearing of cattle. Farmers have, of course, the remedy quite at hand in the growing of wheat, oats, barley, fruit and other remunerative crops rather than producing sheep, pigs, and poultry.</P>

      <P>If you happen to go down to our county we will show you how to grow fruit.  It is pathetic to see some farmers still persisting in their ignorance, fostering an industry that is completely out of date, an industry that is no longer a paying proposition.  It would be much better for those farmers to accept the good advice tendered to them by the Government.  If they do accept that advice I think that instead of relief of rates on agricultural land, as suggested by the Deputy with its consequent upsetting of local government administration and the centralisation of all local government control, they will adopt an up-to-date system of farming.  We hear oftentimes that there should not be any centralisation of local services.  But if this resolution were passed, as it stands on the Order Paper, we would certainly have a centralisation of local government services against which we hear an outcry on all sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have at all times believed that the local people should have an opportunity of electing their own representatives to safeguard local interests in the local councils.  That is a method <Col N="628" /> of administration that we should be very chary about upsetting.  If this motion were to be passed I foresee centralisation coming.  To the Deputies on the opposite benches I would say that, perhaps, they may be inclined sometimes to become despondent because they have a generally perverted outlook.  They have been for the past couple of years trying to get Fianna Fáil out of office.  Unfortunately they have studied one side of the situation only.  It would be very well before they go down with their ship to stretch out their hands for the life belts within arms' reach.</P>

      <P>I think the most pleasing feature about the speech which was begun last night by the Minister for Local Government was that, on mature consideration, he decided to-day he would not continue that speech.  He moved the Adjournment last night and I was very glad to see that he was not in his place to continue his speech to-day. I hope that the reason was that, on mature reflection, the Minister was thoroughly ashamed of the speech which he had partially delivered.  Certainly if you come to consider the ineptitude of that speech as a defence of the Government position, if you consider the insolence with which the Minister addressed various members of this House, and if you consider also the most extraordinary statements of fact which he made in the course of his speech, I do hope that, light having brought counsel, he was too ashamed of his speech last night to continue it further to-day.  We in this House, impelled by Christian charity and by the laws of the House, must attribute certain things to a strange loss of memory which, I am afraid, people outside the House will not attribute to loss of memory; rather, will they apply a very much more severe word to it.  We may think that the poor Minister for Local Government is suffering from that disease, amnesia I think the doctors call it, by which somebody's memory completely and entirely goes&mdash;he forgets his own name.  Where he comes from and he forgets everything about himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="629" /> When the Minister for Local Government, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, declared that Fianna Fáil did not make it a plank in their election that they would give derating to the agricultural community of this country, we in this House may attribute it to a strange and abnormal loss of memory.  But I am afraid the people outside will not so attribute it and it is not good for the reputation of this House or the reputation of any political party here for the Vice-President, knowing, as I suppose he does, how desperately defective his memory is, to omit jogging that memory before he makes statements of that kind.</P>
    <P>The Minister might have thought out an answer to President de Valera's speech in Kells.  These were President de Valera's words, as reproduced in the <i>Leinster Leader:</i>&ldquo;£2,000,000 of the £3,000,000 would give complete derating to all agricultural holdings, big and small, and to the farm buildings as well.&rdquo;  That was after he talked about the £3,000,000 in respect of land annuities.  That was what the President said, but now we are told that the people who believed Fianna Fáil would devote £2,000,000 to derating were deceiving themselves.  The President was only like a fraudulent company director putting out a fraudulent prospectus with a little loophole through which he might escape.</P>
    <P>In the election advertisement of the Fianna Fáil Party we were told that with £2,000,000 of the £3,000,000 involved &ldquo;the farmers can be relieved completely of the rates of their holdings and another £1,000,000 is available for the relief of taxation or for such purposes as the Dáil may determine.&rdquo; Is that not an undertaking by the Fianna Fáil Party?  Again, the people are only deceiving themselves. Again, it it only a fraudulent attempt to get votes by false pretences. How about this which you will find in the <i>Irish Press</i> of the 18th February, 1932&mdash;it is a speech by President de Valera:&mdash;&ldquo;The overhead charges of the farmers are too heavy for them and must be lightened.  One of the heaviest of these charges is the burden <Col N="630" /> of local rates.  We propose to derate agricultural holdings.  They are derated in Britain and in the Six Counties. Two of the £3,000,000 unjustly taken from us every year in the land annuities will suffice for this derating.&rdquo; Is that definite enough for the Minister for Local Government?  Is that definite enough for Deputy Kelly, who has just spoken?  No words could express President de Valera's meaning more clearly than those words.  It is not often that President de Valera is willing to express his meaning quite so clearly as he did on that occasion.  We have here what every person in the country knew and what was shouted off Fianna Fáil platform after Fianna Fáil platform&mdash;that Fianná Fáil, if they were elected, would give complete derating.  We have here a responsible Minister of State, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, suffering so much from a strange loss of memory that he has forgotten what was the main policy of his Party a couple of years ago before they got into office.</P>
    <P>The Minister thought he would be very clever at Deputy Broderick's expense last night.  He said that Deputy Broderick was on the Derating Commission and the Deputy did not believe in the policy of derating.  Deputy Broderick's speech last night was that in his opinion this motion should be carried and acted upon, but he put it forward that it was in his opinion only a temporary measure necessitated by the impoverished condition of those who are endeavouring to live by agriculture, an impoverished condition which in one part of his inconsistent speech the Minister for Local Government admitted and in a subsequent part denied.  That was Deputy Broderick's attitude.  The Minister says: &ldquo;What an awful thing it would be if there was derating now?  There would have to be derating for all time, and there would have to be a change in the system of local government.&rdquo;  If it becomes necessary, when this terrible incubus, the Fianna Fáil Government, has been removed from the shoulders of the Irish farming community&mdash;if it becomes necessary to put the Irish farming community back in <Col N="631" /> a sound and solvent position, I see no reason on earth why they should not have complete agricultural derating. If this country is going to thrive&mdash; indeed, if this country is going to live &mdash;it is necessary that our farming community should be rescued from the terrible condition in which the incompetence of this present administration has plunged them and, if derating is necessary for them, I know that, so far as I am concerned, complete derating would have my support.</P>
    <P>We must, at whatever cost, if this country is going to survive, restore agriculture to what it was.  We must undo the deadly work which the Fianna Fáil Party have done since they came into office.  The Minister for Local Government at one time declared that the farmers' condition is admittedly bad.  It is admittedly bad. It is worse than it has ever been in the memory of living man.  If you go back to the worst times you can remember, if you go back to the years 1879 and 1880&mdash;those desperate years&mdash; you will find that there is more poverty in Ireland at the present minute than there was then, and worse prices for cattle.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether Deputy Kelly owns any cattle, or knows the first thing about them.  All I can tell Deputy Kelly is that if he went to some western fairs he would discover that, far from improving, they are getting worse. The worst fair held in my constituency in South Mayo was held in Ballinrobe this week.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Local Government knows nothing about agriculture, but Deputy Kelly comes from Meath and ought to know something.  The Minister for Local Government says that poultry are very excellent.  Why do not the Minister and Deputy Kelly pay some attention to what the poor Minister for Agriculture says?  The Minister for Agriculture says that the poultry trade is desperate, and that you must limit your supply of eggs.  Of course, Deputy Kelly and the Minister for Local <Col N="632" /> Government never heard that.  They know nothing about the condition of the egg industry which, in my constituency, is the most important next to the live stock industry&mdash;far the most important source of income that we have got.</P>
      <P>Sheep are flourishing.  Are they? There is only a little more than half the sheep population in the country now that there was a couple of years ago, and the price of sheep is nothing like what it was then.  The Minister, having admitted once that the farmers' condition was desperately bad, and then having changed, came along with two illustrations which I must say were astonishing.  The farming community is in a splendid way in Westmeath. Why?  Because £10,000 was collected in the town of Mullingar for the building of a cathedral.  It seems to me rather strange that you would find farmers living in the town of Mullingar.  If there were merchants and professional men in Mullingar in a position to pay £10,000 towards the erection of their cathedral, I do not see that that reflects in any way upon the financial position of the farmers in the county.  We all know that there were good times and that this country was getting on quite well until Fianna Fáil got into power.  We all know there were savings, and if the merchants and professional men in Mullingar, Kells, or any other town in the diocese of Meath, are able to pay £10,000 in subscriptions towards the cathedral fund, that is no evidence that that money came directly or indirectly out of the pockets of the farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a credit to them to have paid it, but it certainly does not show that the farming community is flourishing in Meath or Westmeath.  The Minister for Local Government has another great argument. He met a parish priest who told him that he had losses for one year only and that after that he made a little money as he has been buying so cheaply.  He has not made very much but he has made a little money. That is to say, I suppose, that the parish priest has got, possibly, 10/- or <Col N="633" /> 15/- a head more than he paid for his cattle after keeping them for a year or so.  But will the Minister for Local Government consider the position of the real farmers, the men who produce these animals?  Will the Minister consider the position of a man who is compelled to sell a three-year-old bullock for £4 10s. or £5, even though he sells it to a parish priest?  These unfortunate persons, who have reared cattle, who have spent their little substance in trying to get cattle into proper condition, when they turn them out to market discover that they can get very little for them.  In some instances they will not get more for a three-year-old bullock than they paid for the same animal when a suckling calf.  Anybody who knows the fairs in my constituency knows that what I am saying is an absolute fact. These are the people who are suffering and who require relief.</P>
      <P>The Minister produced the most extraordinary figures and said they had given £8,000,000 to help agriculture. Here and there, in some small and favoured areas, such as those where beet factories have been established, it is probable that they have benefited agriculture.  But over the vast area of this country the Government's policy has been to do one thing only, and that is to ruin agriculture. They say they have helped the dairy industry and given money for that. That is untrue.  They have not given one halfpenny.  That money is taken entirely from the pockets of the persons who buy butter and there was no necessity for a Government measure for that at all.  They took that scheme unaltered from Australia, where the butter ring, without any Government intervention, had succeeded in introducing a similar scheme on its own behalf.  The Irish dairy people are being no more helped by the Government, as far as that is concerned, than are the people of Australia where, without any Government intervention, an exactly similar scheme is in force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we have the Minister for Local Government saying, and his faithful namesake, following him dutifully along the path, re-echoes him: &ldquo;There would be poverty in any event.&rdquo;<Col N="634" /> Granted that there would be a fall in prices; granted that prices in England are not the same as they were a couple of years ago, but far higher than they are at present in this country.  If Irish agriculture were in a flourishing condition, in the condition it was, say, during the height of the Great War, it would possibly be in a position to bear the burden of £6 per head upon exported cattle.  But, if prices are down, as you say they are down, then the £6 per head bears more heavily.  The more depressed the condition of Irish agriculture is, the less able it is to bear this added burden.  The Minister says: &ldquo;You will be poor in any event.&rdquo;  If the Irish farmers will be poor in any event and, if superimposed upon their necessary poverty, there will be this extraordinary outside burden, then surely that is an overwhelming reason why this motion should be accepted, not a reason to the contrary.  The poorer an industry or an undertaking in a country is, the less it is able to bear the burden.  You cannot take a man with an income of £1,000 a year and a man with an income of £100 a year and substract the same sum of money from them and have precisely the same effect upon them.  The man with £1,000 a year can bear to have a large sum of money taken from him, but the man with £100 cannot.  Because this country is in a £100-a-year condition you want to treat it as if it were in a £1,000-a-year condition, and you want to pass off that in this House as statesmanship.</P>
    <P>There is another point which the Minister completely and entirely ignored.  This motion deals with the local rates.  On the local rates the entire social services in the counties rest.  Outdoor relief, public health, and the whole local services rest upon them.  If there is a breakdown in the rates position, if there is inability to pay rates, if the county councils cannot collect the rates owing to the inability of the people to pay, social services will come to an end.  When the Minister states that there is an organised campaign against the payment of rates in this country, or that there ever was, the Minister is drawing on a very vivid imagination indeed. <Col N="635" /> There is no organisation and there never was an organisation in this country against the payment of rates. I believe that 99 per cent. of the people of this country who can pay their rates are paying them willingly, but there are any number of people who cannot pay their rates and it is useless for the Minister to shut his eyes to that fact.  It is useless for anybody to shut his eyes to the fact that there are large numbers of people who cannot pay their rates.  That number is being augmented day by day and will be augmented day by day until there is a change of policy on the part of the Government.  If the fast-coming result of the Minister's policy does arrive&mdash; it will arrive very soon unless there is a change in policy&mdash;and if we have bankruptcy in the local councils, if we have inability to pay the poor rate, and we have in consequence inability to give poor law relief in its various shapes, you will have this country in a very desperate state indeed.  Yet the Minister says: &ldquo;I can do nothing.  I have to keep back various sums because by law the Guarantee Fund must be kept in existence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am not going to argue whether the Guarantee Fund under the law must be kept in existence or not.  But I will say that this motion here requires legislation to implement it, and if the Guarantee Fund must be kept in existence by the existing law, then your remedy would he at once to change the law.</P>
    <P>You have got a choice between legislation on the one hand and the ruin of the local bodies on the other hand.  Wherein lies your reluctance to legislate?  Do you hate legislation? We get Bill after Bill of the most unnecessary kind from day to day.  If legislation is necessary in this instance, by all means let us have legislation. The people have now become impoverished owing to the policy undertaken by you, by this carrying out of the Fianna Fáil pre-general election policy, the policy of non-co-operation with England, which President de Valera announced when he was leader of the Opposition.  By carrying that policy into effect you have brought <Col N="636" /> the farming community down into desperate poverty.  There is no part of Ireland which you have brought into greater poverty than the poor districts in my own constituency.  It is necessary that this relief should come to them, and that, and even greater relief, will have to come and come quickly, or you will have the burden on your souls of having brought to starvation some of the best people in the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion was put on the Order Paper on the 26th January, 1934; it is now 7th March, 1935.  The motion suggests that owing to the increasing distress of the farming community, arising out of the continuance of the economic war, the Executive Council should take steps to relieve agricultural land of rates during the financial year 1934-35.  We saw, when we tabled this motion, the result of the policy of the present Government and the impossibility of getting any rates from the agricultural community.  We had gone through a year or two of the economic war and we know what the results were.  We had a decline of £25,000,000 practically in our export trade in the year 1933-34, which we saw at that time-that is a decline since 1931.  That decline was entirely due to the fall in the quantity and value of agricultural produce exported and the farming community must have suffered as a result to that extent.  We also saw that the income of the individual farmer was lowered by at least 50 per cent. more than in the worst year from 1921 to 1931.  We saw further that the cost of living of the average farmer was not less than that estimated by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  That would be 57 per cent. higher than in 1914 and 12 points higher than in 1931.  We also saw that the prices paid for farming requirements, and for essential commodities on the land, were from 60 to 100 per cent. higher than in 1914 and the prices obtainable for farm produce would be 30 per cent. under the standard of that year.  On these facts, we raised the question that it was impossible for the agricultural community to meet the demand for the <Col N="637" /> rates and, hence, we tabled this motion.</P>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister for Local Government treated this question with a degree of levity last night of which I thought he was not capable.  He tried to show a sense of humour last night but I do not think he has one. His reference last night to the Cathedral at Mullingar and to the £10,000 that was collected, was I think, very small coming from a Minister for Local Government.  It was very small also to hear the Minister talk about the parish priest who is making money now although he lost it some time ago.  I think it was very small for him to suggest that people should not collect or subscribe money towards a Cathedral but that they should subscribe money to keep him here in his office.  He made a further reference which I thought he was not capable of.  When he was tackled and refused to answer the case put up by Deputies here on this side, he made a reference to a decent Deputy who has the confidence of his constituents down the country and he said: &ldquo;Would that dumb fool shut up?&rdquo;  I suppose it is what we must expect from him.  The remark is worthy of him and he of it.</P>

I thought that the Minister's reply would have made some attempt to refute the statements made by Deputy Broderick. Deputy Broderick put up a case and the Minister did not answer the Deputy's statement.  He was not <Col N="638" /> able to answer it.  The Minister and all his Party went out in 1932 with promises of derating and no annuities. They were going to improve the social services, reduce unemployment, and reduce taxation by £2,000,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and all the rest of it.  They have improved social services, probably.  They have given free meat and free milk and doles, but how does it affect the rates?  In the West Cork Board of Health district, where there is free meat and free milk and doles, and where they promised that unemployment assistance would be in force and that home assistance would go down by 50 per cent., I doubt if home assistance is down by 5 per cent. at the moment. Who is to bear the brunt of all this? The ratepayers have to bear it.  It is the ratepayers who have to pay for the free meat, the free milk and the doles. That is the kind of social service that we have been given.  The Minister always has the cry that they are doing all this in order to help the poor, but he has created a new poor.  As a result of the Minister's policy people who a year or two ago were able to carry on and able to meet their annuities, their rates and their ordinary debts, to feed and clothe their families and pay their way generally, cannot do any of these things now.  They are faced with misery and bankruptcy.  They cannot meet their rates or their annuities, nor can they pay their shop debts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to come down with me to a fair in West Cork and see what is happening there.  They talk about the markets created here for us for bacon, butter, pigs, and all the rest of it.  Let the Minister come down to a fair in West Cork and see what is happening.  Last Monday, in my native town of Clonakilty, I saw people who could paper all the rooms in their houses with bills from the sheriff for their annuities and from the rate collector for their rates.  They could paper all the rooms in their houses with bills.  Then, after feeding their pigs and bringing them to the verge of perfection, they find pigs down 10/- last Friday, and there the <Col N="639" /> unfortunate people are left wondering how with those pigs they might be able to meet some portion of their annuities or rates.  Instead of the pigs enabling them to meet these liabilities, they find that the price would not even cover the cost of production or anything like it.  The same thing applies to the cattle fairs.  All over the country they keep telling us each month that the next month's fair will be better, but the next turns out to be worse, and so on.  But then they say: &ldquo;We thought it could not be getting worse,&rdquo; but now it is worse.  That is the situation.  That is the situation the people in the country are up against.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his reply to Deputy Broderick with regard to County Cork, says: &ldquo;I will see that the rates will be paid in County Cork.&rdquo;  Deputy Broderick told him why the rates in Cork and other counties were not being paid; that it was because they were withholding the agricultural grant, and he went on to say that the Minister for Local Government, at the instigation of the Minister for Finance, is now finding himself the victim of circumstances and is compelled to go on a marauding expedition to take away that grant.  That is the situation.  We have Deputies in this House talking about bounties and so on.  We had Deputy Ben Maguire talking about a bounty on beef in England, and saying that because things are done in England they should be done here also.</P>
    <P>He said that the prices are bad in England.  No matter how bad they are in England, however, our cattle have to pay £4 and £6 a head.  If you stopped that foolish economic war and gave us that £6 a head, there would be no need for tabling a motion such as this, and no need for the Minister to have out his sheriffs to collect the rates.  Deputy Maguire went on to say that prices in England are bad and that prices in the North of Ireland are bad.  According to the Guards, as far as I know, the greatest industry that has been established in this State is the smuggling industry which has been established along the <Col N="640" /> Border.  If there was not money in it&mdash;and I would not be at all surprised that the Government knows that there is money in it&mdash;that smuggling would not be carried out. The Government's policy is an incentive to smuggling and to dirty work. That is what this Government has done.  It has provided an incentive for everything that is demoralising since they came into office, and they are continuing that policy.</P>
    <P>I notice that Deputy Corry did not speak with his usual amount of &ldquo;jizz.&rdquo;  I remember Deputy Corry going out in my constituency of West Cork and openly advocating derating. I remember him saying at Drimoleague, at a date that I could mention, that the annuities were not going to be paid and that when their Party came into office they would not be paid.  When his Party came into office he changed to derating. That is the mentality of Deputy Corry and it is the mentality of the whole of those on the Government Benches.  They think from their own narrow parochial viewpoint. They cannot see from the point of view of a number of individual members in their own constituency.  All they think about is how they are going to save themselves, and that is the policy of the Government.  Deputy Corry says, &ldquo;We halved the annuities,&rdquo; but he forgot that as a result of the nonsensical policy of his Government we have an economic war on and that England is collecting the annuities off the people of this State. They are paid.  That must be acknowledged by everybody.  Then Deputy Corry's Government comes along and collects half the annuities, which is another form of land tax.</P>
    <P>A good deal has been said about the policy of changing over to wheat and beet.  The peat policy has been dropped.  It was killed as a result of the coal-cattle pact.  Wheat will be grown while the subsidy lasts.  The wheat policy is no good to small farmers.  In the South, at any rate in my constituency, they would be foolish to change from a system that has been established for will-o'-the-wisp and wild <Col N="641" /> cat schemes like those the present Government are trying to carry on.  They should know that the live stock industry is the main industry in this State.  It is the main branch of agriculture.  When the live stock industry has been killed the agricultural community will be deprived of the means of getting the wherewithal to pay rates or annuities.  A tillage policy is all right in its own way.  I know what tillage means.  Invariably for the past 20 years I had 40 or 50 per cent. of my land under tillage.  I can grow wheat, oats, barley, potatoes and roots.  I always had a better market than I have now for all that I produced.  I had not to go into the shops to buy feeding stuffs.  I fed my own produce to my cattle, and I brought these cattle to the market and was able to realise satisfactory prices. That is all changed now.  I am still trying to continue in tillage, although I find it is not paying.  I have no market for my potatoes.  I have no market worth talking of for other things.  There is no money in wheat for me.  If I can grow eight or ten barrels of wheat to the acre, and sell it for £1 a barrel it costs practically every penny I receive to produce it.  When I was able to grow it and to feed it to my stock, and to sell that stock in a good market, it paid me to grow wheat better than it does now.  I have no market for anything else I produce.</P>
    <P>There is talk about developing our industries and about the establishment of new ones.  If I could see an extra penny a day for eggs, bacon, beet, or any part of the industry, or if I saw any hope in the home market developing on lines that would benefit me, I would be whole-heartedly with those on the opposite benches in their industrial campaign.  I say they have killed the main industry, because every homestead and every farm was a hive of industry.  They have developed some industries in which cheap juvenile labour is employed at wages varying from 6/- to 10/- weekly.  That kind of labour cannot afford to give me a price that will cover the cost of production and a little more.  There has been no increase in the prices I receive for anything I produce.  It is obvious that <Col N="642" /> the new industrial policy is a hopeless failure.  The first thing that should be done should be to put the big industry on its feet, by making a decent agreement with our best neighbours for what was our best market.  Put agriculture on its feet by giving farmers an opportunity to get into the market that always purchased our produce and then the farmers will always pay.  The Irish farmer was always honest, always hard working, and always paid his way until demoralisation set in when this Government came into power.</P>
    <P>The cost of social services can be met only from three sources: savings from prosperous years; moneys withheld from payment of bank or shop debts; and a reduction in the number of essential live stock kept on the farm. Those are the three sources from which money can be got to meet social services. As these three sources have disappeared nothing is left.  The Minister stated yesterday that he would see that the rates would be paid not only in County Cork but all over the country.  When Ministers send out the bailiffs, as has been done by the Land Commission, the land will be depleted of stock.  What will then be left from which to get money for these services? How will the State be kept going? The Minister went through a whole litany of what had been done for the farmers by the Government.  He said that the arrears of annuities had been funded at a cost of £4,000,000; that bounties on agricultural produce amounted to £3,100,000; that the beet subsidy amounted to £800,000; the butter subsidy to £1,100,000; the wheat subsidy to £200,000; and that additional old age pensions represented £750,000; unemployment assistance, £1,500,000; minor relief schemes, £250,000; and that there was a saving on land annuities of £1,860,000, making a total of £8,000,000.  When I asked the Minister the source from which these £8,000,000 came, he said they came from the taxpayers.  When I asked the Minister who were the taxpayers he answered: &ldquo;Everyone in the State.&rdquo;  I say that the one source from which the £8,000,000 came was from the representatives of the main industry&mdash;agriculture &mdash; because while <Col N="643" /> practically every other person in the State is able to pass on the cost, the farmer, who is the last man, cannot do so.  No matter where the money comes from, and no matter how it is paid, there is really only one source from which it comes, the farmers.  When Ministers make speeches down the country one would think, when they say they are giving so much for free beef and for old age pensions and other things, that the money came out of their own pockets.  Very little of the money for these services comes from any source but from the men on the land, and the sooner the Government realises that the better.</P>
    <P>In view of facts that have been pointed out from these benches, there is no reason why the Government should not accept this motion.  If such a motion was necessary previously it is 100 per cent. more necessary to-day, 24 days from the end of the financial year.  I hope wise counsels will prevail, that the Government will see the error of its ways, realise that agriculture is in a very bad way, that it is down and out and needs some assistance.  The one way to assist it is to give it the relief now asked for, I think about 37 per cent. of the rates have been collected in Cork and we are now within 24 days from the end of the financial year.  I know the county well, and I know that the people who could pay always did so. There are people there now who cannot pay and who are being forced to pay. They asked that the rates should be taken in instalments, and they offered £1, £2, or £3, but these offers would not be taken.</P>
    <P>This motion is intended to help people who are honest and have always paid their way.  They have pigs and other stock on hands that they are unable to dispose of for the reason that their credit is gone.  I know farmers in West Cork who have pigs, and because they are unable to get further credit from the shopkeepers they are not in a position to finish these pigs and put them on the market to make the money required for the payment of rates or annuities.  It is no exaggeration for me to say that <Col N="644" /> there are people at the moment who have not salt to eat with their potatoes. I submit that the Minister should step into the breach and assist these people.  They are the poorest of the poor at the present time, and they deserve to be helped out of their difficulties until such time as a brighter and a better era dawns on our country.</P>

      <P>I have listened to a lot of talk this evening about the distress that exists amongst the farmers of the country.  I am a farmer and I am in close touch with the farming community. I realise what their difficulties are and the causes of them.  I have the greatest confidence in the agricultural policy that Fianna Fáil is endeavouring to get adopted all over the country.  In fact, it is being adopted each year to a greater extent by farmers, because they see it is their only salvation and the only way in which the distress amongst them can be relieved.  Their distress will be relieved when there is a wholehearted change over to the new agricultural system.  If one were to judge by the speeches delivered here this evening, then one could only come to this conclusion: that agriculture and the cattle trade were wonderfully prosperous prior to the period when Fianna Fáil came into power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been a long time associated with farming.  I was born and reared on a farm.  All my relatives and friends have been in the cattle trade. I remember that in 1911 or 1912, when there was a very big outbreak of foot and mouth disease in England, the cattle trade of this country was completely paralysed.  Every port in the country was closed.  During the Cumann na nGaedheal régime, despite what Deputy O'Donovan has said to-night about the bad prices that are being paid for pigs, I saw a situation here when farmers could not sell their pigs.  I remember reading in the newspapers at the time that young pigs were being given away practically for nothing.  Under the same régime I saw periods when barley and oats could not be sold, and while that was so the people had to pay their rates and annuities, the full annuity and not in instalments as at present.  During <Col N="645" /> all that period the position of the farmers was becoming worse.  The difficulties that farmers are labouring under to-day are, in my opinion, due to the neglect of the last Government over a long period.</P>

But if the country were to be wholly dependent on the cattle trade, and if you had an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, as occurred years ago, look at the position we would be in.  I say that conditions are not as depressed as they have been represented here.  I mix a lot with the people of Kildare, and I have observed that those who have adopted the agricultural policy of the Government are very hopeful.  I admit that they have to work hard and that conditions are pretty hard, but they realise that the success of that policy is going to bring them through. They are sowing more wheat this year than last.  It is a fact, too, that the price of grazing land has gone up in the county this year.  I have been told by auctioneers that in parts of the County Kildare uneconomic holders are giving from £4 to £5 an acre for conacre land to till and grow wheat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harris</NameTxt>
      <P>My summing up of the situation is this: that what is wrong with a lot of the people who are complaining is that they have too much land.  If they were relieved of some of that land, instead of relieving them of their rates, and it was given to the uneconomic holders, that would help to solve the problem.  They could then by adopting the policy of the Government work the land left to them in a more intensive way.  That, I think, would solve the whole situation.  Amongst the majority of the working farmers of County Kildare who employ labour, there is no demand for derating.  As Deputies know, farmers who employ labour get relief of rates under the legislation introduced by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, and passed by the Oireachtas. That scheme, which has been in operation for some time, satisfies the working farmers and the men who till their land in the County Kildare.</P>
      <P>I must state that there is great dissatisfaction amongst the uneconomic holders and the industrious small farmers of the county, who would work the land if they got it, at the delay and slowness of the Land Commission in acquiring and dividing up the big estates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHolohan" hpid="Mr. Holohan Mr. Holohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Holohan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the Deputies who spoke from the Government Benches referred to this as a more or less political motion.  It is not a political motion.  It is put before the House so as to give it an opportunity of knowing the facts as they affect the farmers.  The debate has gone on for a very considerable time and I think that the motion deserved full consideration. If Deputies regard the position as it is and compare the living farmers are getting now with what it was a few years ago&mdash;when we <Col N="647" /> had sufficient to pay our rates and meet all our demands&mdash;they will find that the income of the farmers has been reduced by about 50 per cent. That is during the period from 1931 to 1935.  If there is any difference, our overhead charges are greater than they were in 1931.  A strong case for derating was made at that time. Surely, if there was a strong case for derating in 1931, the case for derating in 1935 is immensely stronger.  I am moving amongst farmers up and down the country every day.  I know that they are decent, hard-working, honest citizens.  They are always prepared to work hard in order to meet their obligations.  We foresaw the position at which we have now arrived long before this motion was put on the Order Paper 12 months ago.  We knew that, under the policy advocated by the Government, farmers would find it almost impossible to make ends meet, especially since the Government wanted to bring about their big change in a year or two years.  The live-stock branch of our industry was the principal branch.  When I speak of live stock being the principal branch of our agricultural industry, I do not want members on the Government Benches to take me as saying that we were depending altogether on the live-stock or the cattle trade.  The more cattle a man could keep, the more tillage was necessary.  The farmer who carried on a system of mixed farming&mdash;dairying, the rearing of young cattle and the tilling of a considerable acreage so as to feed all his stock&mdash;would give more employment in one year than would the policy advocated by the Government give in many years.  Not only that, but it is quite evident to any farmer and it is evident to most Deputies, whether they be on the Government Benches or on these benches, that to continue growing beet or wheat or any species of corn crop, it is necessary that a certain number of cattle should be kept and fed on the farm in order that there may be sufficient manure for the crops. Everyone of us could grow corn to a great extent for two or three years, but at the end of that time we would <Col N="648" /> find that there would not be sufficient manure for the land.  Without manure to bring it back into fairly decent good condition corn growing would end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The killing of the live-stock branch of our industry is responsible for the present depression in agriculture. Let us consider the losses in the live-stock branch.  A farmer with say 50 or 60 acres would have 14 or 15 yearlings to sell.  That man's rates would be from £15 to £20 and his land annuities would be in or about the same amount.  He would lose more at present on the 14 or 15 yearlings than would pay his land annuities and rates for two years.  There is that degree of difference in the price.  A tillage policy is not objected to by many farmers.  I myself agree with a tillage policy, to a certain extent. But there is a limit and we must have regard to that limit unless we are going to run out our land and leave it practically useless.  I do not want to introduce the personal element into my remarks but I till about 50 acres on an average and I give considerable employment.  I rear practically all the young cattle on the farm from the time they are dropped until I finish and sell them.  I do my utmost every year to produce sufficient to keep the stock in good condition with what I grow on the land.  All the time I was able to get more out of the corn I grew on the land by feeding it than I was by selling it.  We can grow more wheat for a few years and we can grow more corn for a few years but, after growing, every year for a few years, 10 or 12 acres more than we can manure, we will find ourselves with a lot of old, stubble land which will be practically useless.  Wheat is a hard crop on the land.  It takes a good deal out of the land and requires a good deal more labour and a good deal more attention than either barley or oats.  It is in the land for practically 11 months.  If you continue growing all that wheat for a number of years, you will find that practically half of the farm will not be able to grow anything unless you are able to manure the same number of acres every year as you till.  To <Col N="649" /> do that, it is necessary that the live-stock branch of our industry should be retained.  We are told that there is not a market available to us in England, that that market will be closed in a few years, and that the English farmer is going to produce all England's requirements in that respect. To that, I would say that, at any rate, the market should be made available to us until then and let us have a few years to consider the position and see what we are going to do and how we are going to do it.  The amount of money lost on the live stock branch of our industry since this policy was adopted two years ago is much more than the rates and the land annuities put together.  That is what is responsible for the depression in agriculture.  The farmers are accused of organising for this and that purpose.  We ought, at least, to have liberty to voice a grievance when we have a grievance and God knows we have a grievance at the present time.</P>
    <P>I know farmers who are trying to pay their rates and their land annuities. They are borrowing the money to help them to do so and they are asking their neighbours who have a few pounds to spare to help them.  I know there are shop bills that are unpaid by the farmers.  If many farmers were to sell out to-morrow they would hardly realise as much as would meet their debts.  These men were in fairly sound positions a few years ago.  These men would not take up the attitude they have taken from any political point of view but from the honest point of view, and it is from that point of view that the assistance of the Government is required.  If the agricultural industry and the farming industry are closed down in this country other industries will go down with them.</P>

      <P>I wonder what purpose Deputies opposite think they are serving when they pretend that there is some course open to the Government of this country by which it can secure for them, or for the farmers generally, an unrestricted market for their cattle. Whom do they think they are deceiving? <Col N="650" /> They are not deceiving anybody in this House familiar with the position. We have repeatedly demonstrated to them, at elections, national and local, that they are not deceiving the farmers. Are they deceiving themselves?  I do not think so.  They are all talking with their tongues in their cheeks.  These statements made by Deputies opposite who have just spoken, about the market for cattle that exists in Great Britain, are made with the intention of deceiving somebody, or else they are made in ignorance.</P>
      <P>Deputies opposite must not have taken the trouble to find out, from obvious sources of information, what is the truth concerning the market for cattle in Great Britain.  Only in this morning's paper there was published a White Paper, circulated at the instance of the British Government, to the members of the British Parliament, about the market for cattle in Great Britain. Did Deputies read that White Paper?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>How?  By two specific methods, stated in their White Paper: <Col N="651" /> by imposing duties on all imported meat into Great Britain or, alternatively, restricting these imports in quantity in a drastic manner; not imports from this country, for this year they entered into an arrangement with us which determined the number of cattle to be imported.  These duties which are going to be imposed in the interests of the British farmers or those quantitative restrictions are not designed against us.  They are designed, as the White Paper expresses it, against other members of the British Commonwealth&mdash;Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. It is against members of the British Commonwealth, none of whom, except ourselves, are engaged in an economic war with Great Britain, that these restrictions are intended.</P>
      <P>If the British Government feels compelled, in the interests of its own farmers, to take that action against those other members of the Commonwealth, do Deputies opposite think they are going to take an entirely different course with this country if, as Deputies opposite suggest, we grovel in the dust in asking and begging for some concession in their market, so that the great industry of cattle rearing can be re-established in its old prosperity in this country?  Do they think they are fooling the British by these speeches?  If the circumstances in the British market are such as the British Government describe them, is it not obvious for us that if we are to have an agricultural policy it ought to be a policy that will not leave us dependent for prosperity upon the chance of selling cattle in the British market?

      <P>Let them formulate another policy based upon the production for home consumption of agricultural goods that formerly were imported into this country to the value of millions of pounds. The proposal which Deputies opposite ask the Dáil seriously to consider is that there should be complete derating of agricultural land for this year.  Do they think that if there was complete derating of agricultural land this year that it would be possible to reimpose a rate charge next year? Does Deputy Cosgrave think that? Deputy Cosgrave, as President of the Executive Council, gave serious consideration to this question of derating agricultural land and he decided against it.  He decided against it for very weighty reasons, all of which were stated here in the Dáil when the matter was discussed.  Has he changed his mind?</P>

      <P>And if he can think of any other reason except the depressed condition of his Party and their urgent need to get votes by any means, it will surprise not merely members on this side, but a number of members on the opposite side also.  What exactly are the conditions of the farmers?  The Minister for Agriculture indicated here <Col N="655" /> a number of the measures that were taken in order to improve the position of those who were engaged in agriculture. I am not saying, and no member of the Government or of the Government Party has ever said, that the position of the farmers is as we desire it to be.  Quite the reverse.  Agriculture, not merely in this country but in all countries, is passing through a period of considerable depression.  The fall in the prices of primary products which commenced in 1929 and continued during the subsequent years has not yet been arrested, and in every country the farmers are depressed.</P>
      <P>In every country Governments are subsidising agricultural exports and it is these very subsidies, given by different Governments to try to tide their farmers over the crisis, that are in turn aggravating the crisis.  Look at the price of butter on the English market.  Would it pay the Irish farmer to produce butter at that price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I asked the Minister for Justice certain questions in connection with recent events at Edgeworthstown and the President of the Executive Council thought them of sufficient importance to answer them in person.  I asked (1) whether on the 5th November last the Edgeworthstown Town Tenants' Association passed a resolution inviting the intervention of the I.R.A. in the Sanderson Estate dispute; (2) whether, on the 20th November last, the same association, having announced that the I.R.A. had accepted the above-mentioned invitation, passed a further resolution inviting the I.R.A. to hold a public meeting in Edgeworthstown; (3) <Col N="659" /> whether a public meeting under the auspices of the I.R.A. was held at Edgeworthstown on the 2nd December last, and whether incitements to violence were uttered at that meeting in the presence of members of the Gárda Síochána.</P>
      <P>The President answered all these questions in the affirmative and he admitted that these matters had been published in the Press and had otherwise been brought to the attention of the authorities.  He further admitted that no action had been taken by the Department of Justice or the Gárda Síochána other than to make arrangements for preventing a breach of the peace on the occasion of the meeting on the 2nd December and to institute patrols in the neighbourhood of Mr. More O'Ferrall's place.  It was not stated on what date the patrols were instituted or whether they continued up to and including the date of the murder.  I think I am not going too far in describing these answers by the President of the Executive Council as sensational.  I hope, quite honestly, for the sake of the reputation of the country and for the sake of the future of the country, that he will be able to disclose further matters to-night that will put his answers in a more favourable light than that in which they at present appear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to the invitation extended by the Town Tenants' Association to the I.R.A., the association had already exhausted every conceivable constitutional means of pressure and propaganda in order to get their way. Their task was rendered easier by the fact that leading members of the Town Tenants' Association were also leading members of the local Fianna Fáil club.  What, then, ought the Civic Guard and the Department of Justice to have inferred from the decision of that association to bring the I.R.A. on the scene?  What would they have inferred supposing it was a group of farmers who were objecting to the payment of the land annuities and had successfully invited the I.R.A. to come upon the scene? Surely what they ought to have inferred&mdash;and what they would have <Col N="660" /> inferred had it been the case of farmers objecting to the payment of land annuities&mdash;is that having failed with constitutional methods, it was proposed to see what violence could achieve.  The invitation to a body which boasts of possessing arms and claims to judge of when and where to use those arms was in itself a threat to peace and order and the reign of law which ought to have evoked the immediate attention of the authorities. Why did it not do so?  Partly, perhaps, because of the traditional Fianna Fáil policy of patience and brotherly love towards terrorist organisations; but I think, perhaps, more especially it was due to the fact that those who were bringing in the I.R.A. were many of them prominent supporters of Fianna Fáil and were in close touch with the Fianna Fáil Deputies representing the constituency.</P>
    <P>I suggest then that the first dereliction of duty on the part of the Department of Justice was when it failed to put an immediate stop to the whole business of bringing in the I.R.A.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there is the matter of the public meeting under the auspices of the I.R.A.  Mr. More O'Ferrall asked in vain that that meeting should be prevented from taking place.  The President says that the Gárda Síochána &ldquo;took whatever steps they considered necessary to prevent a breach of the peace.&rdquo;  What were these steps? Civic Guards were sent to the meeting. Presumably if those who attended it had proceeded to march forthwith <i>cn masse</i> to Mr. More O'Ferrall's house the Guards would have intervened to prevent them doing so.  However, the Guards did nothing to stop language of a very inflammatory character uttered at that meeting, language calculated and intended to produce a breach of the peace.  Reports of the meeting were published in the <i>Longford Leader</i> and in <i>An Phoblacht.</i> These reports make it clear that there was incitement not to pay rents and that threats were uttered against anyone who should dare to do so.  I shall not detain the House by reading extracts from the Press reports, but in case my statements are challenged I have them here and I am prepared <Col N="661" /> to substantiate what I have said. Apart from what was published in the newspapers, I am informed on good authority that much more violent things were said than were published in the Press, including direct threats against the person and even the life of Mr. More O'Ferrall.  These were presumably reported to their superiors by the Civic Guards who were present. Even so the Department took no action except that it was then perhaps that the patrols of which the President speaks were started.  The effectiveness of these patrols can be judged by the fact that it was found possible for four men to arrive in a motor car drive up to the house and to shoot up the household without interference.  I understand it was several hours after the occurrence before the family were able to get any sort of protection or assistance.</P>
    <P>These facts speak for themselves and seem to constitute an overwhelming Indictment of the Department of Justice.  The very circumstance that for reasons of their own the Government have refrained from declaring the I.R.A. an unlawful association puts all the greater onus on them to give full protection to the citizens of this country when mischief at the hands of that body in manifestly in the wind.  It would appear, <i>prima facie,</i> that the obvious duty of the Department of Justice was neglected on that occasion.  It was neglected, I am afraid, for the sake of party advantage and out of subservience to the local Fianna Fáil clubs.</P>
    <P>The present case appears to have been a particularly flagrant one.  I am informed that the rents in Edgeworthstown are low as compared with other similar towns and it appears that some of those taking part in the agitation are getting more by subletting a room or two rooms in the house than they are paying for the entire house.  Further the beneficiary of the estate is in a mental home and so far from there being a bloated plutocrat, I am informed that her income is barely sufficient to maintain her in that mental home.  Further, the estate is administered under the direct orders of the court and it is <Col N="662" /> by direction of the court that Mr. More O'Ferrall has been bound to act in every matter affecting the collection and the reduction of rents.</P>
    <P>A cruel and cowardly murder has been committed, not without warning, not out of a clear sky, not in a sudden and unexpected affray, but as the logical outcome of circumstances well known to the authorities and of activities flowing naturally from the propaganda and principles of the Irish Republican Army.  Whether the persons who did the deed were actually members of that organisation, of course I do not know, but it is certain that for a considerable period of time drilling, recruiting and incitement to violence were in full swing at Edgeworthstown from the date of the I.R.A. accepting the invitation to come in and help.  The I.R.A., therefore, cannot escape a heavy responsibility, whoever were the persons who actually did the deed; neither it would seem, can the Department of Justice escape a heavy responsibility for gross negligence, or rather for even worse than negligence&mdash;for an absolutely reckless inactivity inspired by Party considerations.  The Department of Justice is at present prosecuting farmers from County Cork for utterances in connection with the payment of land annuities which, according to the prosecuting counsel, Mr. Geoghegan, K.C., were regarded as largely humbug because of the peaceable and law-abiding behaviour of the accused.  I ask the House to meditate on the comparative seriousness of the events in Cork and in Edgeworthstown and to meditate also upon the contrast between the view of its duty which the Department of Justice took in the one case and in the other.</P>

      <P>I doubt if the Deputy who has just spoken has ever appeared in this House under conditions that made his remarks appear more irresponsible than on this occasion.  He surely is aware that the police authorities have been engaged for several weeks in the pursuit of investigations and inquiries dealing with this murder.  He is aware also that certain persons have been arrested and <Col N="663" /> are detained at this moment awaiting a charge, possibly, in connection with this murder, yet he chooses this particular moment to make charges, the dealing with which, if I were to go into them in detail, would necessarily involve me in statements which would be bound on the one side or the other to prejudice this whole position.  Now he is posing as a gentleman who is very wise: certain conclusions should inevitably have been drawn.  But I suggest he is like many another person who poses to be wise; he is wise after the event.  If all this negligence was apparent, I think the Deputy could have taken an occasion before this to call public attention to it.</P>
      <P>The whole of his case is this, that there has been negligence mainly because some people who were involved in this agitation, the Edgeworthstown Town Tenants' Association, are composed of prominent members of the Fianna Fáil organisation.  He surely is not unaware of the fact that their committee is practically half and half supporters of his Party as well as supporters of Fianna Fáil and that on an occasion when they sent a deputation to the then agent, Captain Montague, they chose as their spokesman Deputy Seán MacEoin, who is, I suppose, &ldquo;a prominent member and supporter of Fianna Fáil.&rdquo;  The fact is that there was no negligence of any kind on the part of the authorities; that they followed the policy in regard to wild statements that they have followed consistently, not merely with reference to the I.R.A. but in regard to another organisation which is associated with the U.I.P.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion, of course, is that because inflammatory or wild statements were made they should have been regarded at their full value as leading to immediate and serious consequences.  If that be so, I wonder what action should have been taken by the authorities on, let us say, the 16th July, when Commandant Cronin welcoming a prisoner from Arbour Hill, is reported as having made a certain statement.  I will read his statement in order to show that <Col N="664" /> as regards statements the policy adopted, wise or unwise, has not been a partial policy; that it has been impartially observed as being on the whole the best way of maintaining peace.  We have consistently and persistently pursued anybody who has been guilty of any attack or overt action tending towards a breach of the peace.  These are the police instructions and they have been consistently followed.  On the other hand, in regard to statements we have not followed them up in that particular way for certain reasons, first, because it is extremely difficult to get evidence which would convict in these cases, and secondly, because we believe that intemperate statements are being made and will be made, and that it is next to impossible to prevent them completely.</P>
    <P>Now with regard to the statement that I have here&mdash;and let me say again that I am simply using it to show that the authorities have acted impartially in this matter&mdash;I would like to read the following extract:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;James Dwyer was convicted on the information of some spy in Tipperary. We have members of the police force earmarked and when we get into power we will know how to deal with them and to relegate them to their proper place.  I warn the police now that any of them that are doing the dirty work for a tyrannical Government will find themselves where they are now trying to put others.  I hear we are to have more persecution and any of you may find yourselves where James Dwyer is after leaving.  The Blue-shirt movement will go on in spite of any opposition or persecution.  If we are persecuted and driven to it we may have to resort to arms, and what we did in three months in 1922 we can do again and teach them a lesson they will never forget.  De Valera had spoken about dictatorship, but I say here to-night if a dictatorship is necessary for the Irish people we are going to have one.  It will be better than the so-called democratic Government we have, run by foreigners and Jews.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a police report &mdash;the same evidence that the Department would have about incitements down in Edgeworthstown&mdash;precisely the same.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I say we have here precisely the same reports and the same authority as far as the Department is concerned&mdash;the police reports. The Deputy is very quick to ask for our evidence.  In other words, he would like to know whether we could secure a conviction.  Exactly the same question would be asked about the Edgeworthstown incitements.  Now the police did their duty with regard to Edgeworthstown.  They went to Mr. More O'Ferrall on the day before he was to appear in Longford to collect the rents and asked him when he intended to take further action in connection with those rents in order that they would be there to give the assistance which might be necessary.  He did not want them about his house, but the police did patrol although he did not want them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is suggested that the patrols were not effective.  That is so.  But the only way in which they could have been absolutely effective, I take it, would be if they garrisoned his house&mdash;if they actually stayed in his house&mdash;and clearly his whole attitude was that he did not want that.  Now the police in my opinion, and I have examined into the matter, did their duty.  They were ready to see that any decrees or warrants issued by the court would be enforced.  The natural time to expect anything like violence or resistance, or anything that would savour of force, was when these warrants were about to be executed.  If the police thought that there was to be violence of any kind they would have expected it then&mdash; and mind you, there was nothing except these inflammatory statements, if they were inflammatory in the sense that they did in fact inflame their hearers. The police did not take the view at that time that these speeches did in fact <Col N="666" /> inflame their hearers or did in fact tend to endanger anybody's life&mdash;and if they did make a mistake, it was that they anticipated that if there was any need for action, it would be when the warrants were being executed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put one question? As the Attorney-General is there I can put it the more readily. Would there not have been ample evidence to sustain a charge of conspiracy at the time when the armed body were originally called in to help?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>When there are people detained I do not think that the Attorney-General should answer that question.  The Attorney-General and the Law Department will, perhaps, have to do their duty in connection with these prisoners.  I think it is most unfair to ask these questions.  In fact, some of the statements which I am compelled to make here in order to explain the situation are in their very nature prejudicing the matter in one way or the other.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that the police had no reason to anticipate that before these warrants were executed there was going to be any resort to violence. There were pickets on two occasions and these pickets acted in a peaceful way and did not interfere with anybody. They were warned and those taking part in the picketing indicated to the police at that particular time that they did not intend to interfere with any <Col N="667" /> of the people who were about to pay their rents.  It was a form of what is called peaceful picketing.  Despite the charges made by the Deputy I hold there was nothing up to the time of the actual attack on Mr. O'Ferrall, that would indicate to the police that violent action was about to be taken.  I hold that the police in this matter acted in accordance with their general attitude in regard to statements that might be regarded as inflammatory.</P>
      <P>I have shown that the Deputy is completely wrong when he suggests that this local association is composed of supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party.  My information is that they are pretty evenly divided.  I have given some proof of that by pointing out that on the occasion in which there was a deputation to the agent with regard to the reduction of the rents the spokesman chosen was Deputy MacEoin.</P>

      <P>We have no evidence of that.  What evidence has the Deputy that it split?  Simply the mere statement that he thinks is suitable for the moment.  There is no other evidence.  The Deputy knows well that he has no evidence of that <Col N="668" /> which, according to my information, is not true.</P>

      <P>I think it was disgraceful on the part of the Deputy to use an occasion like this to make the charges he has made.  They are not becoming either to him or to his Party.  As far as I am concerned, I have chosen to answer this because I think it is a most serious matter&mdash; this whole question is a serious one and is seriously engaging the Government's attention.  I see no reason why our policy, however, should be changed.  I think it has been proved to be on the whole a successful policy.  The people of the country are gradually getting to understand that it is the right policy &mdash;that wherever there is any indication of the use of force by people that those who use it, or overtly break the peace, whether belonging to the U.I.P. or any other Party, will be dealt with; and that when we do get these wild statements, as to which it is difficult to secure a conviction, we have to let them go for the moment.  It may happen that we shall have to take another view of it.  Anyhow, that has been the policy and it is the policy which we propose to continue.</P>
