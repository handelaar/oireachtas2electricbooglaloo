      <P>I am aware that the master bakers in the Dublin area have within the past six months notified three increases in the price of bread including an increase of ½d. in the price of the 4-lb. loaf on the 14th instant, but I am not aware that the Prices Commission on the 5th August last recommended a reduction in the price of bread in this area.  Having regard to the report of the Commission, it appears that the recent increase in the price of bread in Dublin can be justified in view of fluctuations in the price of flour.  I propose in the near future to bring before the Dáil proposals for legislation to deal generally with bread prices.</P>

      <P>I move amendments Nos. 2 and 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>2.  In page 3, Section 2, immediately after line 43, to insert the words &mdash;</P>
      <P>the expression &ldquo;representative of employers&rdquo; means such association or all such associations of employers as are, in the opinion of the Minister, representative of the employers in relation to whom the expression is used or, where in the opinion of the Minister there is no such association, persons who are, in the opinion of the Minister, representative of such employers.</P>
      <P>3.  In page 3, Section 2, immediately before line 44, to insert the words &mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;representative of workers&rdquo; means such association or all such associations of workers as are, in the opinion of the Minister, representative of the workers in relation to whom the expression is <Col N="67" /> used or, where in the opinion of the Minister there is no such association, persons who are, in the opinion of the Minister, representative of such workers.</P>
    <P>In various sections of the Bill as drafted it was provided that the Minister should do certain things after consultation with the persons who are, in his opinion, representative of employers interested or persons who are, in his opinion, representative of workers interested.  Representations were made to me, both on behalf of the employers' interests and workers' interests, that that provision should be extended to put upon the Minister an obligation of consulting with organisations of employers or of workers, where such organisations exist, and those amendments are being moved for that purpose.  They define who constitute representatives of employers, and similarly the persons or organisations who constitute representatives of workers.  The adoption of these amendments involves a number of consequential amendments throughout the Bill where the original provisions occur.  The effect of the change required is that where such consultation must take place it shall be with associations of employers or of workers interested in the matters concerned, where such associations exist, and only with persons deemed by the Minister to be representatives of those interests where no association exists.</P>

Peter and Paul; August 15th; November 1st; December 8th and Christmas Day&rdquo;. &mdash; (Tadhg J. Murphy).</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="68" /> 18.  In page 5, before Section 5, to insert a new section as follows: &mdash;</P>
    <P>(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, the following days and no other days shall be public holidays within the meaning and for the purposes of this Act, that is to say: &mdash;</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>) Christmas Day, and</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>) St. Patrick's Day when it falls on a weekday or, when it falls on a Sunday, the next following Monday, and</P>
    <P>(<i>c</i>) Easter Monday, Whit Monday, the first Monday in August, and also (if it falls on a weekday) St. Stephen's Day.</P>
    <P>(2) Whenever in any year a day is appointed under the Public Holidays Act, 1924 (No. 56 of 1924), to be a bank holiday instead of a day mentioned in the next preceding sub-section of this section, the day so appointed shall in that year be deemed to be substituted in the said next preceding sub-section for the day so mentioned and that sub-section shall be construed and have effect accordingly.</P>
    <P>(3) Any employer may, on giving not less than one month's previous notice to all persons in his employment, substitute in any year any of the following days for any of the days mentioned or deemed to be mentioned in paragraph (c) of sub-section (1) of this section, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>) the 1st day of January,</P>

    <P>(<i>c</i>) Ascension Thursday,</P>

    <P>(<i>g</i>) the 1st day of November,</P>
    <P>(<i>h</i>) the 8th day of December.</P>
    <P>(4) The following provisions shall have effect for the purpose of the next preceding sub-section of this section, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>) the notice mentioned in the said sub-section shall be in writing and may be given to any person by handing a copy thereof to him personally or by posting a copy thereof in a conspicuous position in the place in which such person is employed;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="69" /> (<i>b</i>) no day mentioned in the said sub-section shall be substituted under that sub-section in a year in which such day falls on a Sunday;</P>
    <P>(<i>c</i>) when a day mentioned in the said sub-section is substituted under that sub-section by an employer in respect of any year, the day so substituted shall, in that year and in respect of all persons employed by such employer, be a public holiday within the meaning and for the purposes of this Act instead of the day for which it is so substituted.&mdash;(Aire Tionnscail agus Tráchtala).</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments might be discussed together.  The Bill as originally drafted provided that workers in industrial undertakings should be allowed public holidays, and the public holidays named in the Bill are those six statutory holidays at present in force.  It was, however, represented that in many parts of the country it was the practice of industrial undertakings to observe not the public statutory holidays but Church holidays, and it was suggested that the provisions in the Bill should be altered so as to enable Church holidays to be observed in lieu of statutory holidays, wherever it was considered advisable or desirable to do so.  The effect of the amendments I am moving, numbers 4 and 18, is to provide that such substitution can take place, but without increasing the number of holidays.  There are, I think, ten Church holidays in the year, and only six statutory holidays.  The effect of amendment 18 is to provide that where an employer so chooses, and gives the requisite notice provided in the amendment, he can substitute for Easter Monday, or Whit Monday or the first Monday in August any of the Church holidays which are set out in sub-section (3) of the proposed new section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Murphy proposes to substitute for the six public holidays the ten Church holidays.  The effect of that amendment would be to make the observance of Church holidays compulsory in all areas, whether at present observed or not, as well as to increase the number of holidays that would be provided.  I do not think <Col N="70" /> that is desirable.  There is nothing in the Bill to prevent the owner of an industrial undertaking agreeing with his workers to observe all the Church holidays, if he so wishes.  The minimum obligations which the Bill imposes on an employer is to provide six public holidays in the year, with power to select in respect of four of them, whether he will observe the statutory holidays or the nearest convenient Church holidays. I do not think it is desirable that we should impose statutory obligation in excess of that.</P>
    <P>It is desirable that I should again remind the Dáil, as I did on the Committee Stage, that the obligations imposed by this Bill are minimum obligations and not intended to restrict any employer from conceding to his workers better conditions of employment than the Bill lays down. So far as we are concerned, it is our aim to secure six public holidays, apart from the annual holidays that will be given in industrial undertakings. The only question arising now is whether these should be the six statutory public holidays or whether discretion should be given to substitute Church holidays for them.  The purpose of my amendment is to enable substitution to take place at the discretion of the employer, after notice has been given to the workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. T.J. Murphy Mr. T.J. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that certain provisions in the Bill are intended to be the minimum provisions.  It is right to say that, to a very large extent, they will be the maximum provisions, because in many areas there will be very little opportunity of getting any extension of them, and by quite a good number of employers they will be regarded &mdash; even though the Minister describes them as minimum provisions &mdash; as very revolutionary provisions.  I approach this matter from a different point of view.  I think it does not need any very strong argument to make the Church holidays public holidays. Many of the local authorities observe this principle already, as they arrange that meetings are not held, and that the staffs are relieved from work on Church holidays.  Recently in Cork <Col N="71" /> the country council extended the principle to workers employed on the roads.  I see no reason to depart from the view enshrined in my amendment, and given expression to by me at another stage.  In this country there should be no question about holidays being a matter of choice.  I see nothing in what the Minister said to enable me to depart from my proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should mention that the present statutory obligation is only to provide three holidays while the proposal in the Bill increases these to six.  If it is the practice of employers in any area to allow all the Church holidays to be observed as holidays by their workers, I presume that practice will continue.  They are doing so at present without being under any statutory obligation, and I presume they will not change in consequence of the passage of this Bill. The proposal is to substitute for the present practice a statutory obligation and I do not think that is desirable. If employers adopted the other practice, with the present statutory obligation only to provide three holidays, I do not think they are likely to depart from that when there is a special obligation providing six public holidays.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain extraordinary anomalies arise in some districts in regard to Church holidays.  I know numbers of cases where men who are not working on bank holidays get no pay, while the same men are compelled to work on Church holidays, when a great many other workers in the same neighbourhood are free.  In country districts work is automatically suspended on Church holidays.  It seems an extraordinary thing, in a country where 99 per cent. of the people are of one faith, to see one set of workers compelled to work on Church holidays, and very often scarcely getting time to attend Mass, while on other days, when their faith imposes no obligations on them, they are not at work and are not paid.  I think if we are to select holidays we should select holidays that are prescribed by the Church.</P>

      <P>I am in agreement, to a great extent, with Deputy Murphy in this matter.  Being a Catholic, I am compelled to observe certain holidays called holidays of obligation and I am obliged to abstain from all sorts of work.  Being a good Catholic and having a good deal of business activities at one time, I closed certain parts of my business on holidays of obligation and I thought I could get others to do so, but I failed.  As a result I had to open my shops again on Church holidays.  I was anxious to give my men a holiday, and to pay them.  We cannot ignore the fact that we are a Catholic country, and we ought to keep in step with the Catholic religion, and instead of keeping pagan holidays like Easter Monday, Whit Monday, and other days which were imposed upon us by Imperialists and anti-Irish institutions and which the Minister referred to as statutory holidays, we should keep the Church holidays.  The statutory obligations in this respect are altogether Protestant, pagan and English.  If we are to have regard for holidays, we should have regard for the holidays that are obligatory in a Catholic country.</P>

      <P>After all the wonderful expressions of piety that we have heard I am intervening now, as I am rather anxious that this Bill should pass.  The Minister has gone a great length to meet the wishes of many workers, by establishing one week's holidays in the year.  That must be considered a big step in advance.  We all know that in many industries a week's, and in many cases a fortnight's, holidays with pay are given. I am rather concerned to know in how many cases is pay given, whether on Church holidays or on bank holidays. We can all be very pious, but I can give one instance where piety failed, as far as wages were concerned.  In the Ford Factory in Cork an attempt was made on one occasion to get Church holidays recognised.  Mr. Henry Ford said, &ldquo;All right, you can have the Church holidays and the bank holidays if you like, but you are going to get no pay.&rdquo;  I think the acid test of a man's piety is to go in sack cloth <Col N="73" /> and ashes and if he takes Church holidays let him pay for them.  Let us be honest and frank about this.  It is all right to tell certain people that they should get the Church holidays, in addition to the holidays provided in the Bill, but remember that the holidays provided in the Bill were never given before, and never got statutory sanction.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the effort. I believe it will be welcomed by the working classes in this country generally. I do not see the object of suggesting that additional holidays should be given.  I should like to know how many of these people got holidays which are not statutory holidays as we have known them up to the present and who have, in addition, got the Church holidays.  I certainly would be intrigued to learn the names of any employers who have been so pious as to give their employees the bank holidays and the Church holidays in addition.  I feel that Deputy Murphy, having heard the Minister's explanation, might agree that this Bill has already made many steps towards satisfying the demand of country workers, in addition to town workers, for a week's holidays which they have never got before by statute, or for which they had not any statutory authority.  As the Minister said, it is an initial effort, and when this Bill gets a chance of working and we learn by experience what the results of it will be, it will then be time to introduce the amendment suggested by Deputy Murphy and others.</P>

      <P>I should like to call the attention of the Minister to the effect of his amendment.  The Bill provides that the expression &ldquo;public holidays&rdquo; means certain days which are defined in sub-section (1) of the amendment. The Minister goes on then in sub-section (3) of the amendment to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="74" /> Any employer may, on giving not less than one month's previous notice to all persons in his employment, substitute in any year any of the following days for any of the days mentioned or deemed to be mentioned in paragraph (c) of sub-section (1) of this section, that is to say &mdash;</P>
    <P>and then eight Church holidays are set out.  I should like to call the attention of the Minister to what is likely to happen under a section of that kind. In the first place, the employer is the person who is going to regulate the bank holidays of the workers in future. The worker at present knows, at all events, that so far as the first Monday in August, Easter Monday, Whit Monday and St. Stephen's Day are concerned, they are public holidays at present.</P>

      <P>Now we are getting to the seriousness of the position.  It is coming to the point under this amendment that the building employer is going to say, &ldquo;I am not going to cease work on the first Monday in August; instead I am going to cease work on the 1st November, or I am going to cease work on the 1st January.&rdquo;  All the building operatives are going to be working on the first Monday in August, which is usually a period of the year when recreation is enjoyed by building workers and all kinds of workers.  Now they are going to have substituted for <Col N="75" /> that a day at some other period of the year, and all this is going to be done at the sole instigation of the employer. The worker is not going to have any opportunity of expressing his views on the matter.  All the employer has to do is give one month's notice and the change automatically takes effect.</P>
      <P>Let us take what is likely to happen in laundries.  There is always keen competition amongst laundries as to what firms can supply laundry round about the first Monday in August, particularly in this city where there is a big influx of visitors.  The laundry that closes on the first Monday in August is at a disadvantage therefore compared with the laundry that can open on that day.  What is possible under this section as drafted by the Minister is that a laundry can announce that it has substituted, let us say, New Year's Day for the first Monday in August, and immediately its workers will be required to work on the first Monday in August and will be off on New Year's Day.  The laundry that organises its scheme of work in that way will have a very unfair advantage over the other laundries and the workers will be required to accept a day off on the 1st January instead of on the first Monday in August.  I do not think that it is a sensible arrangement and I do not think it is an equitable arrangement from the point of view of the workers.</P>
      <P>In any case, I do not think that the employer ought to be allowed, of his own volition to decide what are the bank holidays which the workers are entitled to enjoy under the Bill.  I would vote for an amendment giving the workers the bank holidays and the Church holiday &mdash; the bank holiday as we know them at present and the Church holidays as defined in the section, but under the Minister's amendment it is well known that the bank holidays are going to be abolished. That is going to have a serious effect in large industrial centres where the bank holidays are in fact observed by workers and employers who do not observe Church holidays, notwithstanding their particular religious faith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should not allow employers to vary <Col N="76" /> the public holidays unilaterally and that he should insist that the employers and workers will be required to join together either in petitioning him or mutually accepting an arrangement to vary the bank holidays and the Church holidays, or that at all events the Minister should hold the power in the last resort to say: &ldquo;I will decide whether the representations made to me in respect of this substitution of a Church holiday for a bank holiday are such as to justify me in giving permission of that kind.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This section is an unfair section as it stands.  It is only fair to the employer. The whole purpose of this amendment is not to deal with the question on any territorial basis, or on any craft or class basis.  It is possible under the amendment for one employer in the City of Dublin to say: &ldquo;My business is going to remain open on the first Monday in August.&rdquo;  All the other employers in that industry might be prepared to close their business on the first Monday in August, but a single employer is able to opt out under the amendment and thereby inflict hardship on his competitors in the same trade.  It is possible for him to say: &ldquo;Instead of the first Monday in August I will give you Ascension Thursday, or New Year's Day, or the 8th December, or the 1st November.&rdquo; Employer No. 2 might come along and pick an entirely different Church holiday, and employers three and four may do the same.</P>
    <P>I think you will produce considerable chaos under an arrangement of that kind.  The fair and obvious thing, if there is going to be a close-down, is to have a close-down on a territorial basis or a craft basis or a class basis. Giving each individual employer the right to opt out in order to inflict possible injury on his competitors and possible hardship on the workers is an arrangement which I do not think the Minister should insist on in this amendment. I ask him to look into the matter further in order to make sure that the employer is not the person solely entitled to move for the substitution; that he should be required to get agreement from the representative of the workers; or, if the Minister is not prepared to say that, at all events <Col N="77" /> that, in the last resort, the Minister should take the power to decide the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>While Deputy Norton was speaking I thought that it might meet the point if the words &ldquo;by agreement with his employees or their representatives&rdquo; were inserted after the words &ldquo;any employer.&rdquo;  It would then read: &ldquo;Any employer, by agreement with his employees or their representatives, may, on giving not less than one month's previous notice to all persons,&rdquo; etc.  Would the Minister look into the matter with a view to inserting those words or any other words he might suggest himself to meet the situation in a better way.  I think it would meet the point raised now by Deputy Norton with which, by the way, I am a good deal in agreement, and it might avoid a good deal of conflict if the Minister inserted those words.  With regard to the question of territorial basis, I think we would require to define the territory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>It would have to be defined.  The territorial basis might mean anything because the county and the county adjoining might be extended from Dublin to Cork.  In view of Deputy Norton's remarks, I would suggest to the Minister that he should insert certain words after the words &ldquo;any employer&rdquo; in sub-section (3) of his own amendment &mdash; the representatives of the employees might be the trade union body for the operatives concerned in the various industries. Of course, craftsmen would be represented as well as the other industrial workers.  I think that the Minister might look into it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Deputy Norton has raised any point that needs to be met.  So far as I can follow his remarks, he apparently believes that employers who at the present time are observing public holidays under no statutory obligations to do so are going to cease to do so when the possibility of substituting other holidays for these is given to them after a statutory obligation to give six <Col N="78" /> holidays is imposed on them.  Deputy Norton talks about laundries at the present time in Dublin observing the 1st August as a holiday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say the 1st August.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the only holiday the Deputy mentioned was the 1st August.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say the 1st August.  There is no holiday on the 1st August.  I said the first Monday in August.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, the first Monday.  But, in order to get some trade advantage, it is suggested that, when this amendment is passed, they will substitute some other holiday for the first Monday in August.  There is no obligation on them at the present time to observe the first Monday in August as a public holiday, nor is there anything to prevent a laundry employer or any other type of employer opening his factory and requiring his workers to work.  At the present time, there is an obligation in connection with three public holidays only and, in respect of two of them, the employer has the choice as to which he will observe.  Neither is there anything in this Bill which requires any worker to work on these holidays.  I do not think it is necessary to get an agreement as to the holidays to be observed.  A wise employer, no doubt, will do that, but if there are overriding considerations against having a holiday on a particular day, it is obvious that it must rest with the employer, provided that the obligation to give six holidays with pay is fulfilled.  I could not follow the point of Deputy O'Neill's remarks either.  The six holidays now existing are public holidays in consequence of the Public Holidays Act of 1924, and, bad as that Act was, I do not think it could be described as pagan or by any of the other terms that Deputy O'Neill used.  That Act created these public holidays and that Act can be amended. If the Dáil now, or any other Dáil, wants to substitute other holidays for these, it can do so, but I do not think it should be done by an amendment to <Col N="79" /> this Bill.  I think it should be done by an amendment to the Public Holidays Act and then, if that Act is amended, to provide here that the days substituted will become the days on which the obligation to cease work operates in consequence of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The only question that arose at all was the fact that representations were made from certain areas to the effect that these existing public holidays were not ordinarily observed in certain trades and in certain districts and that it was desired, in the interests of the workers, to substitute for some of these public holidays convenient Church holidays instead.  It was decided, on these representations, to give that power of substitution in respect of four of the holidays, and that is all that is being done.  No employer is going to substitute one holiday for another unless it is obviously necessary either in the interests of his business or for the convenience of his workers, and the main consideration there arising is the practice in the locality.  It is the practice in the locality that is going to determine the choice of holidays wherever that choice is exercised.  If no choice is exercised, then the six holidays provided for in the Public Holidays Act must be observed. I think it would be a big mistake to attempt, by an amendment of this Bill, to change the existing public holidays and substitute a larger number of other dates for those at present prescribed as public holidays by the Statute of 1924.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I may be permitted to ask the Minister a question. Would the Minister agree that an obligation is imposed on the employer now to recognise with pay six statutory holidays in respect of his workers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>And still the Minister can see nothing in the point that is made?  If so, it is because he does not want to see the point that is made. <Col N="80" /> This Bill proposes to put on the employer a statutory obligation to pay for six public holidays, and my point is that this is an amendment allowing the employer to change the public holidays.  The Minister pays considerable obeisance now to the provisions of the Act of 1924 and says that it provided for certain public holidays, but he is going to allow every employer in the country, without regard to the requirements of his own workers or their convenience, to select what are to be the public holidays, because he is going to see that, while the Act imposes upon me the obligation of recognising certain public holidays defined by sub-section (1) of the amendment, it gives me power also to change those.  I object to the employer being allowed to change these holidays unilaterally.  The Minister wants to maintain the present public holidays, and yet he is going to allow employers, on their own, to change these public holidays and recognise his obligations, not in respect of the six holidays in sub-section (1), but in respect of four other particular days.  I think that the employer ought not to be allowed to do that in the way the Minister proposes.  As far as Deputy Murphy's amendment is concerned, I think it is immensely preferable to the provision the Minister is making here, which might as well have been drawn up by an employer.  In fact, I do not think it would have got the support of any employer who wants some kind of order and regulation in his business.</P>

      <P>That is the worst case I have ever seen put up here.  This is an Act of Parliament and the Minister could say in the Bill that there should be consultation.  He could insert in the Bill these words :&mdash;&ldquo;Any employer can in consultation with his workers&rdquo; do so and so.  The Minister will not give the workers an opportunity of having a voice in this matter in consultation with the employers.  Then the Minister could be the final arbiter. Instead of that the Minister is going to give the employers a statutory opportunity of changing the six bank holidays in the Bill as it stands, to six other holidays.  Every employer who wants to get over a deal with a rival knows the value of this section. The Minister is asked to do one thing, namely, to let the men who run the business for 365 days of the year have some voice in the bank holidays.  He will not let the workers appeal to the Minister himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is obviously trying to avoid understanding what I am telling the House.  There is power in the Bill to make changes in the holidays.  In this Bill a new obligation is imposed upon the employers.  There is nothing whatever in the Bill that prevents the workers or the representatives of the workers discussing with the employers or with anyone else changes in the public holidays.  But I say the final word must be with the people who run the business, having regard to the fact that these public holidays have to be paid for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that I am obviously trying to avoid understanding the Bill.  I could not do that half as successfully as the Minister is doing it.  The Minister has adopted the attitude of being impervious to understanding the Bill.  He says there is nothing in this Bill to prevent the workers coming along and agreeing with the employers.  There is nothing preventing their coming along and saying they agree to everything in this Bill.  Many of the rights that have been won for the workers have been won for them by instruments entirely different from this Bill and many of the rights that will be won for the workers will be won for them by instruments entirely different from this Bill. But this Bill tries to ensure, where the employer is not prepared to move in accordance with modern standards, that the State will impose these standards upon him.  As the Bill stands one individual employer who wants to break down well-known bank holidays, can substitute for them holidays which are probably not of any benefit to the workers.  We say that the employer should not be allowed to do that purely on his own responsibility. He ought, at all events, be required to go into consultation with the representatives of the workers on <Col N="83" /> the matter.  The employer should be required to get agreement with his workers before he can substitute some other days for these well-known holidays. The Minister does not want to be troubled on the matter and he does not want to trouble the employer.  He does not want to put on the employer any responsibility of consulting his workers.  The Minister, in fact, says to the employer: &ldquo;All you have got to do is to give a month's notice at least,&rdquo; and he can substitute any of the eight days mentioned in sub-section (3) of amendment No. 18 for any of the well-known public holidays &mdash; Easter Monday, Whit Monday, the first Monday in August and St. Stephen's Day.  All I am asking the Minister to do is to say that the workers ought to have some say in a proposal of that kind.  It is a one-sided proposal.  It gives the employer discretion to do what he likes within the ambit of sub-section (3) of this amendment and the Minister will not listen to an appeal on behalf of the workers to have some voice in determining what the arrangements are to be in connection with these holidays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in agreement with Deputy Norton in the case he has made against giving the employer power to substitute any of the days mentioned in sub-section (3) of the amendment for the public holidays. This is something that should not be tolerated by the House, because as Deputies are aware there will be a class of employer who will say that there is some advantage in working his men on these bank holidays.  Such a man would score over his rivals in trade, if permitted to make this substitution.  The Minister says there is at present no obligation on the employer to give Easter Monday, Whit Monday or the first Monday in August, days which have been recognised all over the country.  In actual practice it would not be good for some of the employers to try to change other days for these days.  Now the employer is permitted by a clause of this Bill to make this substitution and to ask his employees to take another day instead of Easter Monday, Whit Monday or the first Monday in August.  If that is <Col N="84" /> permitted it will prevent many employees from going on these days with their friends for a holiday.  The Minister in permitting this is breaking up a whole family circle.  You have such a thing as members of a club going on a holiday together.  It will be found that certain employees cannot go on holiday if this substitution is permitted.  They cannot go together on outings that may be arranged.  I am in full agreement with the protest made that no employer should be permitted to substitute other days for the six days named in the Bill.  I would appeal to the Minister not to be so steadfast.  I ask him to consider the suggestions made by Deputy Anthony and Deputy Norton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am more confused than enlightened by the speech made by Deputy Byrne.  Deputy Byrne says he is supporting Deputy Norton and Deputy Norton is supporting Deputy Murphy, who asks that the very same days with the addition of St. Patrick's Day and Christmas Day be substituted for the six public holidays.  But apparently Deputy Byrne's suggestion is that the present set of holidays be left undisturbed.  The Bill is providing for six statutory holidays only.  It is to observe these holidays and no other days and to prevent employers from employing their workers on these days. But it was in consequence of representations made in this House when the Committee Stage was going through as well as representations made outside, that it was considered desirable to introduce an amendment giving power to substitute four Church holidays for four of these holidays which are not of themselves Church holidays.  I am quite certain that the power given is going to be exercised in accordance with the practice in each locality.  If it is the practice in a locality to observe existing bank holidays they will be observed and if it is the practice to observe Church holidays they will be observed.  It is desirable that the power of substitution will be there so that it will be possible in each locality for the existing holidays that are observed to be observed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beckett</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the solution that the Minister is offering will eliminate the difficulty that certainly has occurred in the trade that I am associated with.  Our experience has been that it is custom that determines the observance of holidays in various districts throughout the country. Down through the country, for instance, it is the Church holidays that are observed.  The reason for that is that the people in the country will not work on Church holidays.  We have carried out work down in Kerry.  We necessarily had to bring down Dublin men, skilled men, on the job.  The Dublin men would desire to work on Church holidays, but the local men would not.  In the case of bank holidays, the local men would want to work, but the Dublin men would not. I think that what the Minister is proposing will provide a solution for that difficulty.  In future, when we are doing a job in the country, we can make provision that the Church holidays are to be observed.  In Dublin provision can be made for the observance of the bank holidays.  In Dublin, as long as I can remember, it has been the custom for workmen not to work on bank holidays.  They do work on Church holidays.  I think that the <Col N="86" /> Minister's solution will get over all this difficulty and that it will avoid friction.  I think very few employers want to dictate to their employees on the question of holidays.  They want to see the machinery relating to holidays working on proper lines, and to observe the holidays that fit in best with local traditions.  If they tried to impose other holidays on the workers then a difficulty would be likely to arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we may assume that the Bill recognises six statutory holidays for which workers not engaged in work are to be paid.  I am in this difficulty, that I come from a part of the country in which all the Catholic holidays mentioned in Deputy Murphy's amendment are observed. At the moment, of course, in a great many cases, payment is not made to the workers in respect of those days.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The position at any rate is that in the County Wexford there is no work done on Catholic holidays.  The workers in the county do work on Easter Monday, Whit Monday, the first Monday of August and on some of the other days mentioned. My difficulty is that I do not want holidays created by an English institution, if you like, substituted for Catholic holidays.  I think it would be much better if some arrangement could be made whereby workers employed in districts where the Catholic holidays are observed all the year round were paid for those holidays rather than make it a statutory obligation to have the other holidays observed.  I think that the Bill as originally introduced was far better than it would be by the insertion of the Minister's amendment, and for that reason I will be compelled to vote against it.  As far as I am concerned I prefer Deputy Murphy's amendment.  I would prefer to have the Bill as it was originally rather than have it with the Minister's amendment.</P>

      <P>There is just one point that I want to make, and I think it is not unreasonable in view of the attitude of the Minister.  It is this: that there ought to be reasonable support for the suggestion to insert words which would provide for consultation between employers and the representatives of the employees, and that failing agreement &mdash; I do not foresee disagreement in all cases &mdash; the Minister should take power, by the insertion of suitable words in the Bill, to decide in cases where there is failure to agree.</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows well the reason why Church holidays have been observed in a number of districts. The reason is because workers will not work on those days.  Is not that so? That is the only reason why those holidays have been observed.  That has been the practice in those districts, and that practice is not going to be changed when this Bill becomes law. Where it has been the practice to cease work on Church holidays, that practice will continue to operate, but the obligation to pay the workers will only operate in respect of six of those Church holidays.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that in the City of Dublin, where the Church holidays are not observed, it will be possible for employers under this section to substitute the Church holidays for the bank holidays without the consent of the workers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly.  I would impress this point on the Deputy, that at the present time the practice which exists in Dublin in respect of public holidays is not imposed by any statute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am naming six statutory holidays.  If, at the present time, without any statutory obligation at all, the practice is to give certain holidays, why do you assume, if provision is <Col N="88" /> made for six statutory holidays, that that practice is going to change?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>At the present time an employer need not give any holidays except three.  Now, because a statutory obligation is being imposed on employers to give six, Deputies are assuming that employers are immediately going to stop a practice that heretofore they had voluntarily adopted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The position will be quite different if the Minister's amendment is adopted.  There was a recognised custom with regard to holidays in the past, and it would be an unpopular thing for a man in trade if he attempted to depart from what had been the custom.  Under the section provision is made for six statutory holidays, but a discretion is given to employers to swing over to days other than those which were heretofore observed as public holidays. Under the section an employer can now give notice to his employees and say that in future they will have to work on the August bank holiday. A man may do that for trade reasons and to gain an advantage over trade rivals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>One reason is that under trade agreements if men are required to work on bank holidays they have to be paid time and a half or double time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever obligations there are with regard to the payment of time and a half or double time, in cases such as the Deputy refers to, still persist and are not upset by this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Norton has mentioned the case of laundry workers. Deputy Byrne, I think, put his finger on the spot when he spoke about trade <Col N="89" /> agreements.  Deputy Norton spoke about Dublin.  There is no doubt that in Dublin employment in laundries and other places is governed by agreements in which bank holidays are specified.  Therefore, in the case of Dublin there can be no extraordinary swing-over, because an employer who attempted it would be immediately held up under the trade agreements to which he was a party.</P>
      <P>If we are going to consider what Deputy Norton and some other Deputies seem to ask for, namely, that a month before the bank holiday an employer may give notice as to a change, I do not think that will satisfy anybody because it will leave a certain number of employees able to argue with the employers that they want a different day substituted.  Possibly they may be only 5 per cent. of the employees, but they will leave the question over for decision up to the very last moment.  It seems to me that if there is anything the workers want to know, they will try to ascertain it a long time in advance of the holidays.  My opinion is that if there is any overwhelming demand for substituting certain days, they will be changed under the wages agreements. That I believe will be the best way to settle the matter because it will be an arrangement come to between employers and employees. I do not think that at the present time there is the slightest chance of any worker agreeing to having the first Monday in January, when there will be probably snow on the ground, substituted for the first Monday in August.</P>

      <P>He can do it under the Bill when this amendment is passed but certainly that is not going to make for the case and contentment of the worker who is regulating his holidays 12 months ahead.

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know what demand has come from organised workers in regard to the substitution of Church holidays for bank holidays. <Col N="90" /> I want to know whether any Trades Council in Cork, Limerick or Dublin has passed a resolution calling for these holidays in lieu of the ordinary bank holidays.  I know of none.  I know of several industries in which the workers get a fortnight's holiday with pay and we all know that possibly an extra week or two in the year would be relished by everybody in employment.  I made a suggestion to the Minister a moment ago and I should like him to consider it.  I think it would be acting contrary to the principle of the whole Bill to vote against his amendment, but I should like to ask him to reconsider it, in view of what has been stated by Deputy Norton on the one hand and Deputy Dockrell on the other.  If there is to be any substitution of these holidays, I should like to see the matter put to a vote of the persons concerned and I am quite optimistic as to what the result will be.  As far as Church holidays are concerned, I know that ordinary working class people are prepared to take any holiday provided they are paid for it, but I would ask what body has stated that the workers are prepared to work on bank holidays and take Church holidays in lieu of them?  It is quite evident that with the exception of a few Confraternities and people like that we do not hear a word about that.  Will Deputy Davin deny that?</P>

      <P>We would all take five or six additional holidays in the year, bank holidays or Church holidays, if we were paid for them.  Remember that they cannot have it both ways. They cannot have their bread buttered on both sides.  I speak on behalf of thousands of workmen who are honest enough to say that this Bill is a good Bill.  It is giving statutory sanction to something that hitherto depended on the volition of the employer.  I consider it is a confession of weakness on the part of the Labour Party to suggest that the trade unions are not strong enough to insist on employers in the various industries coming into conference with them in regard to the substitution of holidays.  I do know that there are trade unions in this country, even if this amendment passes, the members of which will approach their employer and get into conference with him on this question of substituting Church holidays for bank holidays.  It is a confession of weakness to suggest that the trade unions are not strong enough to insist upon employers conferring with them to consider the whole matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as Deputy Anthony's speech is concerned, he has only given expression to his personal views, which are not the views of a great many members of this Party. Deputy Anthony states that bank holidays are observed all over the country, whereas we know that bank holidays are only observed in the larger centres of population.  It is not a question of substitution.  Bank holidays are unknown in the greater part of the country and all we want to secure under the section is that when the statutory holidays are being fixed they will be the holidays as observed by the Church.  I think that would refer to the greater part of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make an appeal to the Minister, and if he takes note of Deputy Anthony's speech it should have more effect on him than anything said before.  Deputy Anthony has envisaged a conflict on this matter as between employers and employees. I think it rather strange to suggest <Col N="92" /> that there should be a test of strength between employers and employees to fight out an issue that should be settled here and now.  We do not want to get into conflict with employers over a trivial matter of this kind that can be easily settled by the Minister by bringing responsible representatives of the employers and employees together.  Why be so adamant on this matter?  I quite agree that if there is any attempt to change the holidays observed for some years the workers will resent it.  The workers may have an excursion arranged for a certain period beforehand, as Deputy Byrne stated, and if the employer without consultation with them makes a change in the holiday it will be very properly resented by them.  We want to take precautions now to ensure that nothing of that kind can happen, and that is the reason we suggest that there should be consultation with the representatives of the employees and employers when a change is to take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions in the Bill relating to holidays are of a different character.  They impose on the Minister an obligation to consult with the representatives of the parties before he makes regulations of general application.  In this case, we are allowing individuals to exercise a certain discretion provided they observe the six days holidays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would there not be a fluctuation each year then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That will not take place in every case.  It is a different thing to say that this change can only be effected between an individual employer and his individual workers, in which case you will have to provide for some means of finding out the opinions of the workers.  It might be by a majority vote or something of that kind.  On the other hand, there might be a difference of opinion amongst the workers.  The suggestion is that the Minister, before making general regulations, must have certain consultations.  It would be a mistake to provide for the exercise of this <Col N="93" /> power only when agreement had been reached.  I think it is much better to say that the change can be made at the discretion of the employer.  I think we can rely on this as a certainty, that no such change will be made except in accordance with the general practice of the locality.  If there is any attempt made to use the power unreasonably, then the same methods that have secured the recognition of public holidays when there was no statutory obligation to provide them will operate to check any such abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might be permitted to suggest how I think it would affect Dublin.  I see now that we are discussing two sets of circumstances. Deputy Corish has put the case as coming from the country district and I have to put it as coming from the city.  The circumstances that apply in Wexford do not apply in Dublin. Suppose you make Church holidays statutory holidays and give the employers all over the Saorstát an opportunity of substituting one of these for, say, the first Monday in August, what would be likely to happen?  There is a well-known drapery firm in Dublin who advertise excursion parties from the country to the City.  The drapery industry is controlled by a very powerful and great trade union, looking after the interests of its members.  Under this measure are you not running the risk of one of these firms saying: &ldquo;We will advertise an excursion from Wexford, bringing the people from there to Dublin and we will keep our shop open on one of the bank holidays&rdquo;?  That is what I am afraid of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill does not refer to shops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Anthony suggests that the attitude adopted by the members of this Party is an admission of a certain weakness on the part of trade unions to enforce proper working conditions and holidays.  I do not think there is now, and I do not think there is likely to be, any weakness on the part of unions that have existing agreements with industries.  Does Deputy Anthony suggest that if there <Col N="94" /> is room for differences of opinion he would prefer to see these questions settled by strikes rather than by the Minister in the simple way this Party is asking him to settle them?  I admit there are at the moment, and there are bound to be, more cases where the workers now being employed in new industries are not automatically organised on the day the factories are opened.  I think that there should be some form of consultation provided for and in the few cases where there is likely to be a failure to agree, the Minister would not be taking too much authority on himself if he had the right finally to decide, in cases of disagreement, what the day should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose the workers cannot agree among themselves?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there not provision for that in the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister was somewhat unfortunate in his original suggestion.  He ought to have realised that there is a difference between the City and the country.  One weakness in the Labour Party's proposal is the type of example they have put up.  They suggested that a laundry owner might possibly decide to open on the first Monday in August.  I would like to see a laundry owner doing that.  What would he open on the first Monday in August for?  Or, look at it from the other angle, why does he shut on the first Monday in August? Obviously, because his workers have practically nothing to do on that day. Laundry establishments usually get out all their goods on the Saturday before the bank holiday.  If one were to examine the books of a laundry one would find that on no day has that laundry less stock belonging to customers than on the Saturday preceding the first Monday in August.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A case can be made in regard to the trouble about a consultation.  Take the case of Dublin workers.  The men from Dublin want to be off on the bank holiday, but country men may want to work on that day.  There might be a ballot taken, but no matter which side wins, the Dublin man wants the day off and he will not work.  The countryman <Col N="95" /> wants to work, but there is no work for him to do because the tradesman is not there.  Consultation in that case is out of the question.  Similarly, with regard to a Church holiday, the Dublin worker has been accustomed to work on that day and he does not see why he should not do it still.  The countryman will say: &ldquo;Whether you do it or not, we will not turn up.&rdquo; In such circumstances consultation goes by the board.  Is it likely that an employer will get any great advantage over any of his contemporaries by working on a bank holiday?  I fail to see it.</P>
    <P>In both amendments there are two days, Christmas Day and St. Patrick's Day, that are not in dispute, so that only four days remain in dispute. These will remain in dispute in such a <Col N="96" /> case as was mentioned by Deputy Corish, where the tradition has been that the men will not work on that day.  Some accommodation must be made in respect of them, and I would like to hear some example more convincing than that mentioned by Deputy Norton about the laundry.  The Minister could have saved himself a good deal of bother in this case.  I suggest, when he is ear-marking certain days which might be substituted for bank holidays, he should give these days their Catholic titles.  For instance, the 1st January might be put in as the Feast of the Circumcision and the 6th might be put down as the Feast of the Epiphany.  He does it in respect of Christmas Day and St. Patrick's Day, and I do not see why he should not follow the same rule in respect of the designation of those other days.</P>

      <P>In the amendment which the Minister has proposed, it is sought to exclude from the Bill persons engaged in the &ldquo;transport of persons or goods.&rdquo;  The phrase &ldquo;transport of goods&rdquo; may have wider application than the transport of goods associated with the carrying of persons.  In a certain form of industrial work which is within the scope of this Bill, there may be a motor-driver <Col N="99" /> who is engaged in carrying the industrial goods so produced.  The men engaged in manipulative or labouring work in the industry will come under the scope of the Bill.  Is it definitely intended that the transport of goods of that kind should be excluded under the Bill because, up to the present, it was possible to argue that it was not excluded?  On the Committee Stage of the Bill, even the Minister admitted that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention of the amendment is to exclude them.  In the matter of the regulation of their hours of work and so forth, a different method will have to be adopted than is proposed for workers in other kinds of employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister given any consideration to the case, say, of a quarry?  Certain workers may be engaged in quarrying operations, these operations bringing them within the scope of the Bill.  Another person may be engaged in virtually the same kind of work &mdash; not in quarrying sand or stone but in removing it from one place to another, perhaps by means of a vehicle.  The carriage of goods is, under this amendment, to be definitely excluded from the scope of the Bill, but it is possible to argue that persons engaged in the way I have described should come within the scope of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is intended to exclude them.  There are obvious difficulties. You may say to a worker in a factory that he is not to work more than eight hours per day.  At the end of eight hours he will stop work.  A man who is driving a motor lorry or delivering goods cannot stop when the clock strikes the eighth hour.  He has got to get his vehicle back to the garage or to get his goods delivered. He is subject to obligations which do not apply in the case of the other type of worker.  In relation to such workers, the regulation of their hours of work and the improvement of their conditions will have to be done by a different method and in a different measure.  We are excluding that class <Col N="100" /> of work as we excluded mining.  These workers will have to be dealt with in a different way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister ought to leave the Bill in such a way as not definitely to exclude everybody engaged in the carting or transport of goods, because some of that class of work may be so closely allied to industrial work that the person engaged in it may be able to argue that he comes within the scope of this Bill and that he should get the benefits conferred by it.  I think it is better to leave the Bill somewhat vague on that point and let disputes be decided in the way that such disputes are usually decided. I think that the Minister is clarifying the section rather unfairly to people who might come within the scope of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The House should bear in mind that it is highly undesirable to promote litigation.  Therefore, in so far as we can, we ought to divide people into very clear-cut categories which will be easy of recognition.  So far as I am aware, there is nothing in this Bill to prohibit people from working overtime.  What the Bill does is to lay down that there shall be a normal working day and that any work beyond the time prescribed shall be statutory overtime.  I agree with the Minister that while it is easy to fix hours for work in a factory or a quarry or elsewhere, it is not easy to do that in the case of a person who is carting, but would the Minister think of allowing the terms of the Bill to apply to persons who are carting in connection with industrial business of one kind or another and exclude such persons as are engaged in the transport of persons or goods within the meaning of the Road Transport Act, which defines persons who are licensed carriers of persons or goods?  If the Minister would do that, he would divide the people into clear categories and leave no scope for litigation as to whether workers are factory workers within the meaning of the Act or transport <Col N="101" /> workers within the meaning of this exclusion.  Therefore I suggest to the Minister, if he wants to remove transport workers generally from the scope of the Bill what he ought to do is to remove from it any person working for a transport undertaking as defined under the present law and to let the Bill operate in the case of any transport worker who is for ordinary purposes a person affected by Section 3 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is not as to persons employed in ordinary transport work; the difficulty is as to persons engaged in the transport of goods in factories and such places, such as ordinary workers and commercial employees who might drive a factory lorry.  It is difficult to regulate their conditions of employment in the same manner as the conditions of those other workers employed in the factory.  I say it is done in a different manner.  Take people employed in bakeries.  They have certain conditions of employment that can be regulated in the ordinary way.  But a person employed delivering bread, as the driver of a bread van, is treated under different regulations and their conditions of employment must be in a different manner.  I therefore propose to exclude the ordinary bakery worker for the purpose of not having them in a Bill that will cover transport workers only.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In my experience these could be checked out.  A man is found to take out his cart in the morning say at 9 o'clock and his time for beginning work is that hour.  He checks in in the afternoon when he has put his horse into the stable for the night; the man then checks out.  I take it his hours would be ascertained by finding the difference between the hour at which he checked in and the hour at which he checked out.  So far as he has exceeded the ordinary statutory working day he would then be entitled to overtime.  I see no difficulty about that in administration. <Col N="102" /> But I see an enormous difficulty for the Minister and for the employers if they have to differentiate whether a man is included in the kind of transport workers that the Minister proposes to provide for here or not.  You might have a casual labourer working about the yard.  There might be a light vehicle there for use for the delivery of light articles.  Such a man might be told to put a pony between the shafts and deliver some consignment of goods.  Would he come under the Bill?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister takes a man working in the forenoon who does transport work for a time in the afternoon and hopes that the law courts will hold with the amending words of the Bill that that individual is an industrial worker and is entitled to overtime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister wants to exclude carters and persons engaged in the delivery of goods because of the difficulty of defining their hours, there is nothing to prevent him saying, in this Bill, that they are excluded, for the present at all events, from certain sections of the Bill.  And he could quite easily say that a person engaged in the transport of goods is included, that their right to holidays is safeguarded and that their rights to wages for a maximum 48-hours week are preserved.  The Minister could get that kind of control pending the more <Col N="103" /> regular rules and regulations.  But he should not dismiss the idea of getting control over that kind of work and transport so far as it is possible under this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that what the Deputy suggests would be possible and would not be very difficult except that it is better to deal with transport in a separate measure, just the same as we are dealing with regular work. We touch part of the problem in this Bill.  The whole field will have to be covered until there is a series of measures enacted.  There is no reason why we should upset the general plan of industrial workers &mdash; manual, commercial or other workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A person deemed to be a commercial worker and not coming within the scope of this Bill might be deemed to be more closely akin as for instance in bakeries.  Those employed in the industry are industrial workers.  Then you have transport workers and then you have those engaged in the selling of the goods who are described as clerical workers, and who consequently are not included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that these distinctions may entail unfortunate circumstances to the owner of the business.  It is embarrassing to any person engaged in business to have considerable Government regulations at all.  We all know that under modern conditions a certain amount of Government regulations is necessary, but the less complex they are the better.  Take the case of the bakeries.  Those engaged in them will consist of two classes of workers generally &mdash; that is, the industrial workers who would be engaged in the process of baking, and the shop assistant who would be engaged in the commercial job of selling.  The Minister is now introducing a third class, and we are going to have three separate statutes applying to the employer.  The employer, if this Bill passes, in the Saorstát, who will have to co-operate <Col N="104" /> with social legislation of this kind will have to carry a tremendous burden if he has to keep elaborate books for one class of labourer, we will call John, a second, Michael, and a third, William. The Minister ought to consider the administrative difficulties which this will entail to the humble citizen as well as to his own Department.  While these administrative difficulties are bound to embarrass anyone, his Department, of course, have much greater facilities to overcome them than the ordinary citizen has.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>One understands now where the issues are joined.  In my opinion, the sub-dividing of employees under this Act will make the carrying out of the Act very much more difficult than otherwise.  I suggest to the Minister that he is dealing with this matter with a bureaucratic outlook.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I suggest to the Deputy that it does not make any difference to the employer whether the employees are put into different classes by the one Bill or by three Bills. Under this Bill he may have half-a-dozen different classes of employees, all subject to different regulations.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but only the work of the Minister.  As that complexity in regard to male and female workers already exists, I am appealing to the Minister not to add further complexities to the Divine order.  From long experience, we can easily deal with the complexities that arise from people happening to be women and men, but it is quite another question <Col N="105" /> if they are to be arbitrarily defined as different classes of working people. My case to the Minister is that he ought to keep the classes as few in number as he possibly can, and that this amendment of his is designed to create a new class, which he expects to regulate at a later date by a separate Bill, and as he has explained to Deputy Norton it is highly likely that he will have a third Bill regulating clerical employees as well.  I urge on him most strongly to think twice before he does that, and to require his own permanent officials to overcome whatever administrative difficulties might arise as a result of leaving out the amendment which he proposes to insert in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I make this submission to the Minister?  I have in mind a quarry where sand and stone are quarried, and I have in mind two brick works.  As one can imagine, there is a fair amount of cartage in those particular undertakings.  In the quarry, for instance, which is close to a railway line, quite a considerable number of persons are employed carting material from the quarry to the railway line, and the product of the quarry is consigned, in the main, by rail.  Under this amendment as proposed by the Minister, the carters, who go into work at the same hour as the ordinary persons engaged in quarrying, and finish work at the same time as the persons engaged in quarrying, will not be within the scope of this Bill, but the person engaged in the quarrying will be within the scope of the Bill.  There is no question of any difficulty whatever arising in regulating the time of their arrival at the place of business, and the time of their departure.  There is a slight difference in the kind of work they do.  One uses a vehicle for it and the other does not, but there is no essential difference in the work.  One man mines sand and stone in one portion of the quarry, and another person removes them from a certain other portion to a railway line. Who is doing the more valuable work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In such a case it would be quite simple to regulate them both on the same basis.  That is not a <Col N="106" /> typical case.  The trouble is that on the average case there will be difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Those persons come into work at the same time; they leave off at the same time and are paid substantially the same.  There is no real difference whatever in the nature of the work which they do; yet the person making the bricks and engaged in handling, the bricks is going to be treated as within the scope of this Bill, and the man who carts them is outside the scope of the Bill.  If this amendment is passed, the effect of it may be much wider than the Minister contemplates. It may be held, for instance, that the person whose normal job is carrying, say, sacks of flour from one portion of the mill to another portion of the mill is engaged in the cartage of goods.  It may possibly be held that a person engaged by a big firm or a big undertaking, which has a variety of departments in it, in carrying goods from one department to another, is engaged on cartage within the scope of the Bill.</P>

Probably a more polite term for that would be &ldquo;transport,&rdquo; but essentially they are the same operations.  I think the Minister, by this amendment, is not going to cure difficulties for himself, but is probably going to cause difficulties, and that he is going to exclude from this Bill persons whom I contend should be within it.  At least they ought to be within such portion of the <Col N="107" /> Bill as it is possible to make applicable to them, until the specific application of the provisions arises.  It should be possible for them to get bank holidays; it should be possible for them to get annual holidays; it should be possible for them to be allowed to work the maximum working week of 48 hours.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to make clear the nature of sub-section 1 of Section 3.  This is practically a drafting amendment.</P>

      <P>On this drafting amendment, I direct the Minister's attention to paragraph (a) which defines as industrial work:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;manufacturing, altering, cleaning, repairing, ornamenting, finishing, adapting for sale, testing, grading, packing, breaking up, demolishing, or transforming any article.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Will it be held under that paragraph that to pack goods in a retail shop, for sale, is adapting these goods for sale?  The Minister is aware that in modern grocery practice almost all commodities requiring to be packed at all are not packed at the request of the customer, but are packed in preparation for sale and when called for are tendered to the customer as packed goods.  Is it his intention that that preparatory packing will bring the person who does it within the scope of paragraph (a)?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It is only acknowledging that it should be done, when done on an industrial scale.  The phrase used there is used in other statutes, and I think the meaning is fairly generally known at the present time.  It has significance where it is intended to define industrial work adapted for sale.  It does not cover such work when done in connection with a retail establishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister's words are included my difficulty will be answered.  Will the Minister undertake, in the event of the courts holding that the words of the statute do not effect the purpose which he first prescribed, to introduce amending legislation to give effect to his intention, <Col N="110" /> as he now expresses it; that is, that no packing operation carried out in connection with the retail distribution of goods shall be deemed to be industrial work within the meaning of this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Packing, of course, is covered definitely here.  One of the words in paragraph (a) is &ldquo;packing.&rdquo; The term &ldquo;adapting for sale&rdquo; really means altering.  In any event, the whole of the section is merely a definition of industrial work.  It may be that certain test cases will have to be brought into court to deal with borderline cases, but in relation to this particular phrase, the whole of paragraph (a) of this sub-section, these cases have, I think, occurred already. In any event, the phrase as it stands is taken from other statutes which have been in operation and in respect of which no such difficulty has arisen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This, to my mind, begs the whole question.  Why should we have test cases?  Test cases should only arise if the Legislature has overlooked an ambiguous expression.  The matter then goes to the courts and the courts remove the ambiguity.  The purpose of a debate in a Committee of this House, to my mind, is to direct the attention of the Minister to possible ambiguities before they reach the stage of the test case; to ascertain from the Government what their intention definitely is, and, having ascertained it, to combine to find a form of words which will make it clear to the citizen and the courts what the purpose of the Legislature is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to difficult cases where there may be doubts as to whether work done is industrial work or commercial work. In so far as work is done in connection with the sale, whether wholesale or retail, of any article, it is definitely excluded from the scope of the Bill by the definition of commercial work later in the section.  The expression &ldquo;commercial work,&rdquo; which is excluded from the scope of the Bill, means &ldquo;work of a clerical nature, the work of overseeing, directing and managing industrial <Col N="111" /> work, or work done for or in connection with the sale, wholesale or retail, of any article.&rdquo;  That, I think, covers the type of packing which the Deputy has in mind.  There may be border-line cases which will have to be decided in the courts.  The aim is to try and make the legislation as specific as possible and avoid that possibility. But I do not know if it would be possible to get it so very specific and clear that doubtful cases will not arise. The only doubt arises as to whether work is being done as industrial work or in connection with the sale, whether wholesale or retail, of the article.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister drafted, or had drafted, paragraph (a) and included the word &ldquo;packing,&rdquo; he must have had something in his mind.  To the ordinary man in business packing is associated with the preparation for sale, either wholesale or retail.  I cannot conceive any other purpose for packing anything.  Would the Minister tell me one instance of packing goods which would not be either with a view to wholesale or retail trade?  I cannot think of any packing operation that could be carried out which would conform to the Minister's definition of what he means by industrial packing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>All industrial work is done in connection with the sale of some article, but the work of packing may be part of the industrial work, such as the work of canning peas, which is clearly industrial work.  In fact, the only thing that is done to peas is that they are packed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Now we are getting an understanding of where we are and the purpose of the Bill.  I can readily see a difference in an operation such as canning peas.  That is the kind of information we ought to have.  The Minister's desire is to differentiate that kind of operation from the operation of packing such as might take place in a shop.  I urge on him strongly, if the Chair will allow a further amendment on the Report Stage, to consult experts on that question with a view to arriving at some words <Col N="112" /> which will make the differentiation clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the definition of &ldquo;commercial work&rdquo; makes it clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Minister that unless he does that, the ordinary merchants are going to be involved in endless test cases.  These cases frequently occur.  A merchant, perhaps, has large premises in which he conducts a wholesale and retail trade. Ordinarily, he packs his commodities for retail distribution on the counter. But some commodities, which he packs with the intention of distributing wholesale in outlying districts, he might pack in the store attached to his retail premises.  Inevitably test cases are going to arise as to whether a worker who is packing in the store is not an industrial worker within the meaning of paragraph (a), and unless the Minister makes it perfectly clear, by the choice of some words that, where the operation is merely one of convenience for the wholesale or retail distribution of goods, it is a commercial and not an industrial occupation, you are bound to have endless test cases arising.  We ought to try to avoid them.  We all have bitter experience of test cases that are continually arising under the Workmen's Compensation Act, that keep a considerable part of the Law Library busy.  It would be highly undesirable if this legislation were to give rise to a similar state of affairs.  I therefore urge strongly on the Minister this particular point, and point out that further clarification is necessary.  I recognise that he cannot do it out-of-hand here, but I suggest that between now and the Report Stage he should give attention to that matter.</P>

      <P>In page 4, Section 3 (1), to delete paragraph (c).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I announced during the discussion on the Committee Stage that it was proposed to delete from the scope of the Bill the class of work covered by paragraph (c), that is work done in warehouses where mechanical means <Col N="113" /> of lifting are employed, and to regard that class of work as coming within the scope of commercial work which will be dealt with in a separate measure. The difficulties that might arise in certain cases if we left paragraph (c) in the Bill are considerable, and we think it better, for the purpose of effective operation of the measure and effective definition of the class of workers to which it applies, that work done in warehouses should be excluded from the Bill and dealt with in the measure which will deal with commercial operations generally.</P>

      <P>Various examples will occur, such as work done in warehouses in connection with railways, docks, etc., where the workers in one warehouse might be within the scope of the Bill and the workers in another warehouse outside the scope of the Bill.  We do not think it is a sufficiently clear definition of the nature of the work done to say that the only workers to be covered are those employed in warehouses where mechanical means of lifting are employed.  We should have all warehouses either in or out.  I think it is more appropriate that they should be set out of this Bill, and in a Bill dealing with commercial work.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is doing what he did in the case of a previous Bill connected with transport.  One can get cases of such workers so closely analogous with industrial workers that it is very difficult to exclude them.  On the other hand, one can find cases which clearly justify their exclusion.  We think it is better to draw the line between the factory and the warehouse and to let the warehouseman be regarded from another standpoint.  It is not intended that they shall be excluded from the benefits of this legislation, but that their cases should be covered by a different Bill.</P>

      <P>When this Bill was first circulated and when it had run the gauntlet of keen scrutiny in the Minister's own Department, all the wiseacres there at that time thought it perfectly desirable to put sub-section (c) in this section.  In other words, <Col N="115" /> when the Department were examining this Bill in the first instance they, as a Department, felt that it was desirable that sub-section (c) should be in this Bill, and that was the Bill as it passed through the House in the Second Stage, the Minister indicating on the Committee Stage, when he got representations from somebody, that the proposal to include warehousing of goods in any warehouse was to be excluded on the Report Stage.

They are not associated with any industrial concern.  They are warehouses which warehouse or store goods in connection with the transport organisations which serve them.  It was intended that the workers employed in such warehouses should be included in this Bill originally, where these mechanical means of lifting were used, because that was the recommendation embodied in the Washington Hours Convention.  On reconsideration, however, we came to the conclusion that it would be more expedient to deal with these workers in a separate measure as commercial workers than to deal with them in this Bill.  It is merely a matter of securing effective administration, and the exclusion to be made here is not for the purpose of depriving these workers of the benefits of this measure, as I have explained already, but because we think that these benefits can be better secured to them in another manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to continue to make the case I stood up to make, namely, that already the Minister, by carrying amendment No. 7, has excluded the transport and cartage of goods, even from the factory in <Col N="118" /> which industrial work is being undertaken. Now he proceeds, by this amendment, to suggest that the warehousing or the storage of the goods in an industrial undertaking should be also excluded, and the effect of these two amendments is definitely to worsen whatever benefits are conferred by this section of this Bill.  The Minister may say it is desirable to include warehousing when they come to deal with commercial activity.  That may be true, but there is no difficulty in leaving them in this Bill, any more than there is difficulty in leaving carters in the Bill.  I think that they ought to be left in the Bill until such time as some other Bill is introduced which will regulate more precisely their conditions in relation to any other persons who are somewhat comparable from a vocational standpoint; but there is no case at all for the exclusion of warehousemen at the moment.  There may be a case for a better grouping of them later on when you have two or three Bills dealing with the regulation of industries, but that is a case for assigning them to a more clearly definable category.  But it is not a case for excluding them from the scope of this Bill, especially as the Minister already proposed when the Bill passed its Second Reading to allow them to remain in the Bill.  I think amendment No. 7 is definitely worsening the Bill and so is this amendment.  There is no case for removing the scope of them.  Any classification can be done later when other Bills are available. In the meantime they ought to be allowed to occupy the position which was assigned to them when this Bill was circulated to the House and when it was subsequently adopted.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (c) of Section 3 (1) is, if excluded, going to create a great anomaly, for men working in goods stores are classified as warehousemen. These men would at other times be turned on to shunt in the yards.  It would be almost impossible to differentiate what classification they would then be in.  I think that is what the Minister had in mind when he was first considering this Bill and I think it would not be of advantage to the Bill to have paragraph (c) deleted.  I <Col N="119" /> would ask the Minister to try if he could see his way to make clear that men partly engaged in warehouses as distinct from men entirely occupied in warehouses are included.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been trying to understanad what the differentiation is.  It is obviously impossible to construe warehousemen as being industrial workers because the mere phraseology &ldquo;industrial workers&rdquo; would rule out warehousemen, for warehousemen were not deemed to be industrial workers.  Industrial work is done in connection with any of the following activities &mdash;&ldquo;manufacturing, altering, cleaning, repairing, ornamenting, finishing, adapting for sale,&rdquo; and so on.  Paragraph (a) of Section 3 (1) is widespread.  I ask the Minister if there is a type of warehousing that is not for one of the purposes in paragraph (a).  There is one that stands out &mdash; simple storage &mdash; not a hand laid on the article for the purpose of &ldquo;packing, breaking up, demolishing, or transforming any article for sale.&rdquo; I think in that case that warehousing would be industrial work.  When the Minister was dealing with a Bill intended for industrial occupations he thought fit to include simple storage as long as it was simple storage effected by mechanical power.  He tells us now that he got that definition from the Washington Convention. That Convention was the result of international agreement.  A variety of other minds and other Parliaments decided that simple storage as long as it was done by mechanical means was an industrial occupation.  Why are we now asked to decide that it is not?</P>

      <P>There is possibly some reason why these are to be taken up now.  We were told this came in here because of the reliance upon the Washington Convention.  I do not think this was discussed from the angle from which the Minister is now approaching it &mdash; of taking it all together. I raised the point as to the distinction in the last few phrases as to whether mechanical effect was by mechanical power.  The Minister was reluctant to give us any information.  I think that was the only point raised on it.  Now, having to alter the thing, there must be some reason for it and there ought to be an argument for doing that.  But the only argument that has been advanced is that we are to take the original proposal because the original proposal commends itself to that view. Even storage in relation to any of these things is more easily dealt with as an industrial occupation and will cause less trouble than the mixed business.  How is the owner of such a warehouse going to make discrimination between his staff employed partly on this and partly on other work?  We are told that that would be carried out in the Bill that is promised later.  Is the owner asked to make a division of the <Col N="121" /> staff and say that some are never employed except simply as storage men?  I suggest the paragraph should be left in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion paragraph (c) in the Bill when it was originally introduced was an error. When I decided the Bill should not apply to dock labourers, men engaged in shipping and transport, I should also have decided to take out this paragraph.  It would be impossible to have those employed in connection with warehousing covered by this Bill. On the other hand, whatever resolution deals with one group should deal with the lot.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We need not go to that extent.  The exclusion of paragraph (c) makes it clear that industrial workers of any kind, and particularly in connection with the activities there covered by the Bill, are referred to. The matter would then be clarified when the whole field is covered by other measures dealing with other classes of work and with measures which will provide the same general conditions even if they were to be enforced in a different manner.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister considered what is to happen as between two classes of merchants &mdash; one of them warehouse men, and the other people who do their own warehousing, firms like the Dublin Warehousing Company?  If paragraph (c) is deleted from this Bill you will have a situation in which a warehousing company is excluded altogether, whereas the merchant who does his own warehousing will, under Section 47 of the Bill, find that his warehousing is deemed for the purposes of this Bill to be &ldquo;industrial work.&rdquo;  So that two merchants engaged in exactly the same trade will have to carry on their business under entirely different conditions.</P>

      <P>Again, I put it to the Minister that while there is a desire on the part of everybody to co-operate in social legislation of any kind, it is neither prudent nor fair to add to the complexities of the necessary legislation, and to create a situation in which two merchants engaged in virtually an identical calling&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that merchants will not be concerned at all, but let them be merchants or industrialists that does not matter. One industrialist may warehouse his goods in the Dublin Warehousing Company.  Another industrialist may do it on his own premises and in his own warehouse.  Therefore, you have these two men engaged in exactly similar activities operating under different circumstances.  The Minister says this is only for a short time until he has had an opportunity of getting round to the remaining cases.  But it may be a year or two before the Minister can hope to cover all the ground of a complex scheme of legislation such as he has in mind. Why not leave paragraph (c) in until his new Bill is ready for submission to the House, and then if he wants to lift this class of workers into the other Bill and codify the regulations for them under the new Act, he can insert a section in the new Bill repealing paragraph (c) of Section 3 of this Bill when the new Bill comes into operation, thus avoiding, even for a period, an inequality between two citizens of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge on the Minister not only in connection with this Bill but all analogous Bills that as regards the operations of his Department one of the principal dangers that beset his activities is discriminating against one <Col N="123" /> citizen, sometimes involuntarily, and sometimes, as I have alleged, deliberately. That gives rise to bad feeling and creates prejudice in the minds of those who would wish to co-operate. If this kind of legislation is to be a success, my belief is that it should be put into force without causing undue inconvenience to anyone.  Otherwise it is going to react in a most undesirable way against the whole trend of this legislation.  If, for a year or two there are going to be administrative difficulties for every employer in the country, I urge him to withdraw the amendment and leave paragraph (c) in until the amending legislation is introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that whether the section is left in or out there is going to be apparent discrimination in the case of certain types of workers.  I believe there will be grave discrimination in the case of railway workers and those working in goods stores and warehouses and that it will be practically impossible to apply this section. There is not much use in introducing legislation that is going to create a situation of that sort.  I think it would be better to wait for the other measure the Minister has promised, the one that is to deal with the whole of the transport industry.  A very difficult situation will be created if those engaged in warehousing in industrial concerns are to be in one category and those engaged in warehousing in transport sheds, quays, and railways are to be in another.  The real danger in this was adverted to by Deputy Norton that men may be included in the category of warehousing by simply storing flour, the product of their own mills, in a room upstairs pending shipment.  The Minister said that was not intended. In my opinion, it would be better to leave this whole question over to be dealt with in the Bill promised by the Minister.</P>

The Minister has moved an amendment here because he says he is doubtful whether quarrying is in the Bill, and he moves to insert quarrying irrespective of the depth of the quarry.  Then we are asked to envisage another kind of operation which is not mining and is not quarrying, because quarrying is dealt with in the new section (j).  We are asked to visualise an operation which is &ldquo;removing from the ground stone, slate or sand otherwise than for the purpose of a mine.&rdquo;  If any ill-digested phrase could be imagined in connection with the Bill, surely that is a classic example.</P>

The Minister may exclude it, or may make regulations excluding it for certain purposes, <Col N="130" /> but he cannot do that with regard to the provisions which relate to the hours of work, unless after consultation. There are limitations on the exclusions that can be made.  Let me put this point: I am not saying the Minister would like to do this; but if he did like to do it, it is open to him under the terms of the Bill &mdash; to prevent the printing of a newspaper for sale on a Sunday, by the same staff of compositors as have been on duty right through the week, even though they are paid at overtime rates of wages.</P>

If the House accepts it, judgment is passed and I cannot move to exclude newspapers from the ordinary regulations. The Minister has created that difficulty by this late introduction.

      <P>It may be quite accidental; but there is no such procedure in this House as putting down an amendment to a suggested amendment, unless the matter has been discussed previously and the amendments are in the form of gathering a formula to meet something already discussed.

      <P>But that does not give time to get the matter reasonably put before the House.  I put it to the Minister: Would it delay the progress of the Bill to hold over the insertion of that?  It is not that he is weakening in his arguments; it is simply that the matter remains in abeyance for a few days.  I would like to get an opportunity of discussing this.  This Parliament is meeting here for the discussion of Bills such as this.  We are supposed to argue these things, and when a Bill is finally passed it is supposed to embody the results of our discussions.  I see no way in the present circumstances of putting down a reasoned amendment against this.  I am merely asking the Minister, in view of the difficulty of procedure brought about by his own action, that he should hold over the amendment until the Report Stage.  It is not a very big request.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>I was questioned on the Committee Stage as to whether printing was included in the scope of the measure and I said it was; it was clear to everybody that it was included. When, on re-examination, I felt that that might not be reasonably clear, I proposed to put in an amendment and I had that circulated in the ordinary way and no case has been made against it by anybody.  The mere fact that Section 22 requires consultation, is not an argument.  In the particular trade we are now discussing, a trade so highly organised from the trade union point of view, it would be impossible for any body of employers to take action except in consultation with the trade unions concerned, who are probably the most powerful trade unions in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently by an unavoidable circumstance he was unable to introduce into the Bill this paragraph which he proposes to put in by way of amendment.  Clearly, he would have put it in the body of the Bill but for an oversight, inasmuch as he did not think it was necessary at first.  Now, all that is suggested to him is this, we want to discuss the Bill intelligently and make it a good Bill and we would like an opportunity later of discussing this particular matter.  The Minister may have at his disposal all the information he requires, but we have not.  We do not ask him to yield an inch of his position or leave the House under the impression that he is prepared to be swayed by argument.  We are prepared to believe that he has made up his mind definitely.  We merely ask him to put this one item back to the next Stage so that whatever case we have to make in relation to it may be fully made.</P>
      <P>If you want intelligent and helpful discussion of Bills of this kind, you are bound to accede to that request. If, on the other hand, you want to steam-roll legislation of a wholly noncontroversial kind through the House, you can pursue the line you are at present travelling.  The fact of it is that the Minister has got his heels in the ground now and he is blowed if he is going to give way.  It is a very foolish attitude to take up, because it means that both sides of the House begin to wrangle over comparative trivialities.  The matter can be disposed of in a moment if the Minister will consent to putting the thing back to the next Stage.  Our case will be stated in five or six minutes, but, if the Minister remains adamant, the matter will go to a division and there will be an end of it.  The other course will give the House and the country the satisfaction of knowing that, when the Minister understands that a cogent case is going to be put up, he will give time to prepare it.</P>

I am not going to let Deputy Dillon represent me as unreasonable or provide himself with an excuse for being unreasonable. This Bill has been before the House for six months.  It is fully three months since we discussed it in Committee and, in Committee, this question of whether printing was or was not included was raised.  I expressed the opinion then, which opinion I still hold, that even without this amendment printing is covered by sub-section (1) of this section.  If there is a particular matter to be raised in relation to the printing of newspapers or the printing of particular types of newspapers, there is nothing to prevent Deputy Dillon or Deputy McGilligan putting down an amendment which will enable that matter to be raised on the Report Stage.  The matter can be fully discussed then, but no reason has been advanced as to why this clarification of the definition in sub-section (1) should not be inserted now and the particular matter which it is desired to raise raised on a specific amendment directed towards that point.  It is a full month since the amendment was circulated to members of the Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must surely be aware that the exigencies of newspaper production frequently require that overtime should be worked, and sometimes perhaps an inordinate amount of overtime, against which many trade unions protest and protest rightly.  It would mean the employment of more men in the industry, but the exigencies of the business frequently call for overtime on certain occasions.  Let us take, for instance, the publication of the Sweepstake results.  That necessitated the working of extra overtime in the Dublin newspapers, and the Minister must also be aware that at the time of general elections, for instance, a very large number of hours of overtime are worked.  Provision cannot be made because of limitations of space, etc., to employ extra men.  If I could see my way to do away with overtime I should be only too happy to do so, but these occasions occur fairly frequently in newspaper production, and I suggest to the Minister that before pressing his amendment he would get into consultation with representatives of the printing industry, and particularly the newspaper branch of the printing industry, and with representatives of the workers in the industry with a view to hammering out some form of words that would meet the wishes both of himself and of the persons engaged in the industry.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is intended to meet a difficulty that might arise in connection with persons engaged in hotel or restaurant work.  As the definition of domestic work stands in the Bill, it includes the work of preparing food in any hotel or restaurant if the food so prepared is intended only for consumption in such hotel or restaurant.  But, as Deputies are aware, it is the custom for caterers and hotel keepers occasionally to take a contract for providing food temporarily in various places where functions are held, such as the caterers who provide food at the Horse Show and Spring Show and persons who operate buffets at bazaars and fetês and so on.  It is desired to extend the definition by including work done in connection with the supply of food by the proprietor of a hotel or restaurant to such a place, and, <Col N="138" /> therefore we are adding the words set out in the amendment.  These people are excluded from the Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not believe that, if the expression is in order.  In the Bill, there was definite provision for public holidays which were defined as St. Patrick's Day, Easter Monday, Whit Monday, the first Monday in August, Christmas Day, St. Stephen's Day and any day which might at any time be substituted as a holiday for any of such days.  If the Bill had been carried in that form, it would have been possible for every worker to have got the benefit of its provision in respect of exemption from work, with pay, on public holidays.  The Minister is now proposing to put in, instead of that sensible section, a provision which opens the door for considerable misunderstanding, <Col N="140" /> considerable friction and considerable disappointment so far as many workers are concerned.  The Minister is preserving the same definition of public holidays as is in the Bill but he is giving by his amendment any employer power to disregard the public holidays and substitute certain religious holidays.  I am not opposed to the substitution of religious holidays. There may be good reason for doing so, particularly in certain areas where religious holidays are more largely recognised than bank holidays. But the Minister has opened the door so widely that he permits an employer in an area where bank holidays are now generally recognised to adopt some other day in lieu of them.  That may be a day at some other season of the year when the facilities available to the worker on bank holidays are not available.  The Minister, in discussing another amendment, said he believed that employers would be guided by the custom of the locality. If that were done and if there were some measure of agreement between workers and employers, everything would be all right, but it is possible under this amendment for all but one of the employers in a particular locality &mdash; the City of Dublin, or of Cork or Waterford &mdash; to say that they intend to observe the first Monday in August as a public holiday and for the one employer to say: &ldquo;I prefer to observe some other holiday in lieu of that.&rdquo;  The purpose of his doing so may be to get advantage over a trade rival or to inconvenience his own employees in the event of there being friction between him and them.  Why should there not be some well-defined basis of deciding under what circumstances the substitution is to take place?  Let the municipality or the local authority, where there is a local authority, decide the matter, or let there be agreement between the persons affected and the employers.  In the event of disagreement, there might be no substitution or the Minister might decide the matter.  These are all well-known, previously tried remedies.  The Minister proposes to allow the employer unilaterally to say: &ldquo;I substitute a particular holiday for <Col N="141" /> a well-known bank holiday.  I have complied with the section by giving a month's notice and that is all there is about it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that case, an employer who is under an obligation to pay the worker for, say, the holiday on the first Monday in August may not pay him for that particular holiday but may pay him for some other holiday.  I want to tie down the employer to liability to pay the worker for whatever day is observed as a bank holiday in the district.  Under this amendment, it is not possible to do that because an individual employer is not obliged to take any notice of what anybody else is doing.  He is obliged to satisfy only himself.  Deputy Cosgrave said that he did not know of any case in which it would be advantageous to an employer to open a laundry on the first Monday in August.  I wish Deputy Cosgrave would have a talk with some laundry proprietor as to that.  It might be possible for other employers to secure an advantage in the same way.  I know that the argument against the likelihood of their doing that is that the workers have a holiday on that day.  But the employer will now be able to come along and say: &ldquo;That was all right when we were relying on tradition in closing on a bank holiday but here is a measure which legislatively gives us a choice between that day and some other day. We are entitled to make that choice, tradition notwithstanding.&rdquo;  The employer is entitled to say to the employee under the amendment: &ldquo;If you do not attend for work on the first Monday in August, you will get no pay in respect of that day, as I have selected some other holiday for you.&rdquo;  This seems to be a rule of thumb of dealing with what is a fairly important matter.  The original provision was immensely preferable to the uncertainty which will arise under the Minister's amendment and I should like the Minister to go back to the Bill, as originally drawn, unless he is prepared to agree that the workers should be consulted on the question of what should be substituted for a well-known bank holiday.  If the Minister is not prepared to agree to <Col N="142" /> that, he should, in the last resort, take power to decide the matter in dispute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly think the workers ought to be consulted.  I think no sensible employer would do what is suggested by the Deputy. What is to be the position if the employers and workers do not agree?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to make that decision in respect of every individual industrial undertaking in the country.  I think that would be an impossible position for any Minister to get himself into.  The obvious course is the one we are taking.  Where public holidays are not taken, some very good reason will have to exist.  If there are special reasons, the principal of which will be the prevailing practice in a particular area, which makes it advisable to substitute some of these holidays by Church holidays, at certain times, then we are requiring the employer to give a month's notice to his employees of the substitution.  This section will only be operated, in practice, to enable the custom prevailing in different districts to be reconciled to the provisions of this measure.  In Wexford, and other parts of the country, the preference will be to observe the Church holidays; in Dublin and Cork, perhaps, the preference will be to observe the statutory holidays.  It will be possible by this amendment to satisfy both areas at the same time, whereas under Deputy Norton's suggestion only one area would be satisfied, while another would be dissatisfied.  This is a rehash of the debate on amendment No. 4, when the matter was fully gone into.  I do not think it desirable that we should not have the elements of discretion exercisable by the employers, nor do I think that it should be non-exercisable unless the employer obtains agreement with his employees &mdash; whether agreement should be unanimous or not.  I do not know. I think it is extremely unlikely that this power will ever be used except to bring this portion of the Bill into conformity <Col N="143" /> with local practice.  I do not think the employer would be so unwise as to effect a change without securing the consent of his employees first.  I believe it will only be done where general opinion available in the locality is in favour of its being done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing in this Bill which compels any man to work or any employer to keep his factory open on any holiday.  If in Wexford it is desired to close down upon the ten holidays then, because there is a statutory obligation to comply with six of these holidays, there is nothing to compel them to keep their factories open for the other four.  If trade unions and the exercise of public opinion have been able to get statutory holidays observed in the past they will be able to get them observed in the future with this addition that they can demand payment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister want to see a situation arise where an employer may decide that instead of <Col N="144" /> having a well-known bank holiday observed he can adopt another, and, as the result of his action, he can create a situation where the workers have reason to complain and are not satisfied with the rearrangement made by the employer.  All that will produce friction and discord.  It is not easy, in order to avoid that difficulty, to provide by legislation that the workers should be consulted?  There is nothing wrong in that.  The workers' holidays are not the employers' holidays and they ought to be entitled to know that they will get the holidays they want.  One would think the employer was providing for his own holidays.</P>

    <Title>National Loan (Conversion) Bill, 1935&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee) Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this measure is to facilitate the conversion of the First National Loan.  This Loan, as the House is, of course, aware, was the first issue made on behalf of the Government of the Irish Free State. When Stock of that Loan was first offered to the public it was an issue of a novel character here, and the offer was made in circumstances of great difficulty. It was not unnatural therefore that, from the Exchequer view-point, the conditions governing the issue were somewhat onerous, particularly in regard to the provision to be made for the ultimate redemption of the Loan.  For it was covenanted that no less a sum than £750,000 would be set aside each year for the service of the interest and Sinking Fund on the debt.  It is not by way of criticism, but rather in justification of the step which we now propose, that I point out how very heavy indeed was the burden which was thus imposed on our annual Budgets.</P>
      <P>The very ample provision thus made for the service of the Loan, in time created a certain difficulty for the Exchequer.  Each year, as the amount required to meet the interest charge was reduced by the operation of the Sinking Fund, an increasing proportion of the £750,000 went to swell the latter, and each year it became more difficult to utilise this money advantageously to redeem the Loan in accordance with the terms of the prospectus and with due regard to the interests of the State.  As the first redemption date drew near, it would, therefore, have been the duty of whatever Government and Minister happened to be responsible for the public finances at that period to consider very seriously the possibility of reducing the Sinking Fund allocation to more manageable proportions, apart altogether from the desirability of securing a reduction in the interest charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have referred to the somewhat exacting provision which, under the terms of issue, has to be made for the Sinking Fund, as that, from the point of view of the Exchequer, happens to be the main feature of the First National Loan.  There is another aspect of that matter, however, which in present circumstances I think ought to be stressed.  It is, in fact, largely due to that more than ample Sinking Fund provision that the State is in a position to undertake the conversion of the Loan at the present time.  If the allocations to the Sinking Fund had been less generous, it is doubtful whether, in all the circumstances, <Col N="147" /> there would be the same incentive to undertake an operation of this kind. One clear thing is that our capacity to undertake it, as represented by our cash resources, would have been considerably less.  I, therefore, very willingly acknowledge that we are fortunate to find ourselves in the position that, at the earliest date which the prospectus allows for the Loan's redemption, not only has the amount of the original issue been reduced year by year until the amount outstanding is only £7,000,000, but that, as well, we have in the Sinking Fund approximately £1,150,000 in cash &mdash;and this at a time when interest rates are ruling very low.  An opportunity of converting the Loan upon such advantageous terms as may not soon be again available is thus afforded us.  It is our duty on behalf of the State and the taxpayer generally to avail ourselves of it, and accordingly we have brought in this Bill, to provide facilities for undertaking the conversion.</P>
    <P>There is a point of some importance in relation to the introduction of this Bill at the present moment, to which, at this stage, I think I ought to refer. That is as to the reason why its introduction has been delayed until now. The House is, presumably, aware that in connection with the great conversion operation which was carried through in Great Britain in 1932, powers to facilitate the conversion, similar to those which we are asking for in this Bill, were taken in the British Finance Act of 1931.  We might have adopted the same course here and have sought such powers in the Finance Bill of this or of last year.  There would have been, however, in my view, a number of disadvantages in taking that course.</P>
    <P>Firstly, while it was clear that, under the terms of the Constitution, the powers which are sought in this Bill could be asked for in the general Finance Bill of the year, a consideration of some importance, having regard to the nature of the proposed operation, was the fact that the Budget and the annual Finance Bill are often the subject of very acute controversy.  I <Col N="148" /> felt that any proposals to facilitate the conversion of the Loan should, if possible, therefore, be considered altogether apart from the annual Budget and, I hoped, in a different spirit, and in a different atmosphere, to that which sometimes prevails, particularly at the end of what is ordinarily the most laborious and prolonged session of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from this objection, however, there was another one of greater practical importance.  The Bill is one to facilitate the conversion of a certain Government Stock.  It would not be unreasonable if, before giving the Government such facilities as we are now asking, the Oireachtas were to seek some information as to the terms upon which the conversion was to be carried out.  Whatever may have been the practice up to now in regard to Government issues of the ordinary kind, I would not feel justified in resisting a request for such information in relation to a conversion operation.</P>
    <P>It is obvious, however, that until the Minister for Finance, guided by the best advice available to him on the matter, had come to a decision as to the terms upon which conversion might be offered to the stockholders, and had made the necessary arrangements therefor, he would not be in a position to give the information to the House.  Moreover, I think that it will be agreed that, in the circumstances as they have existed internationally for the past few months, it would not be possible to make the necessary financial arrangements for the conversion at any period far in advance of the actual conversion date. Thus, on the hypothesis which I have laid down, that, in regard to a conversion operation in connection with which special facilities are asked for, the Dáil is entitled to know the terms upon which conversion will be offered to the public, the introduction of a Bill of this kind must, in practice, synchronise as closely as is practicable with the conversion offer. In accordance with this view, I shall, with the permission of the Dáil, take an opportunity to-morrow to announce the terms upon which conversion will <Col N="149" /> be offered to holders of First National Loan Stock.</P>
    <P>To come now to the Bill itself.  As the Long Title explains, this is a Bill &ldquo;to make provision for the conversion of holdings of stock of the Irish Free State 5 Per Cent.  National Loan, 1935-45, into stock of a new security to be created for that purpose, and to provide for matters incidental to such conversion.&rdquo;  It should be appreciated that while the Bill will materially facilitate the operation of conversion, it is not introduced for the purpose of seeking authority therefor. The Minister for Finance already possesses powers to effect a conversion on the general lines proposed, and the operation could be carried through without any additional statutory provision. This is to be a facilitating Act, not an enabling Act.</P>
    <P>Before going on to discuss the actual provisions of the Bill, I should, perhaps, briefly refer to the circumstances which, in our view, make it desirable that such facilities as the Bill proposes to grant should be provided. There are about 11,300 separate holdings of the First National Loan and of these over 9,000 are in respect of parcels of stock not exceeding £500 apiece.  In view of the large number of holders, it is clear that even if the terms of the offer were definitely attractive &mdash; as, indeed, we believe they will prove to be when announced&mdash; mere apathy or delay on the part of any large number of holders may result in a failure of the conversion operation.  It has, therefore, to be remembered in this connection that many of our investors may not be familiar with the various incidents of a conversion operation, for this is the first operation of its kind in the history of the Saorstat; and that, therefore, they may not appreciate the necessity for positive and urgent action on their part if the operation is to be carried through successfully.  Accordingly, it is desirable to provide by legislation that where a holder does not, before the date specified in the Bill, lodge either an application for conversion or for redemption, he shall be deemed to have accepted the offer for conversion, <Col N="150" /> and shall be regarded as having lodged an application, accordingly, on the closing date.  Incidentally, this provision will be advantageous to such stockholders who, while desiring to convert, may wish to be relieved of the necessity for sending in a definite conversion application.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill provides for this procedure which, as I will indicate later, has a very notable precedent.  I wish, however, to make clear from the outset that the purpose of this Bill is not in any way to take advantage of the investor.  The Bill is designed to facilitate holders of the First National Loan (whether it is their intention to apply for conversion or redemption) as much as to facilitate the Department of State which is carrying through the Conversion scheme.</P>
    <P>The second main object of the Bill is to facilitate stockholders, especially those who hold the Loan, not in a beneficial but in a fiduciary capacity, as trustees, executors, and administrators. It will simplify the procedure for such persons and will perpetuate Powers of Attorney and other instruments governing investment. The provisions to this end will be found in Sections 4 and 5 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The precedent in relation to all these matters and upon which the proposals in the Bill are mainly based is, of course, that of the conversion of the 5 Per Cent.  War Loan by the British Government in 1932.  The Bill now submitted closely follows the lines of Part III of the British Finance (No. 2) Act, 1931, in so far as the powers of conversion and the facilities for joint and fiduciary holders are concerned.  It does not incorporate certain other features of that Act which we are satisfied are not required for our purposes.</P>
    <P>There is another point in connection with the Bill which should be referred to.  It will be observed that the Bill is expressed to apply to a Conversion scheme, whether announced before or after the passing of the Act, provided that it is so announced before the 16th November, 1935.  It was necessary to adopt this course as, if action had been <Col N="151" /> deferred until the Bill became law, the notice given to holders as to the terms of the proposed conversion would have been short.  Care has been taken, however, in all the forms prepared for the operation not to anticipate the decision of the Oireachtas.  It will be appreciated, however, that an early enactment of the measure is most desirable in order that holders may be cognisant of their legal position.  I understand that all sections of the House are prepared to assist us in that regard.</P>
    <P>On this question of notice, I may, perhaps, say a few words also.  It will be remembered that last May, in the course of the Budget statement, I announced that in the coming December we should undertake the redemption or conversion of the First National Loan.  I think it will be agreed that this was a clear intimation to all holders that they ought to consider what, in either event, they would elect to do with their investment. The preliminary announcement made in the Budget speech was followed up in due course by the formal notice to all holders of our intention to redeem the Loan at par which was published in the issue of <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> dated August 30, 1935. This notice was published in all the Saorstát daily newspapers and, simultaneously with it, there was also published both in these newspapers and in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> an intimation that holders of the Loan would be given an opportunity of exchanging their stock for stock of a new Government loan, the terms of which would be announced in due course. Consequently, holders of the stock have, in my opinion, been given ample notice of our general intentions regarding it.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated in the opening part of this speech, the exact terms of the conversion will not be announced until to-morrow.  But I have no doubt that the market has been making shrewd guesses at them for some time past, so that I do not think any significant interest has been detrimentally affected by their deferred publication.  It may be thought, however, that some special <Col N="152" /> consideration should be given to the position of persons who may be outside Saorstát Eireann at the date of the conversion announcement, and an amendment will be brought in on the Committee Stage of the Bill to provide for this.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which, before I conclude, I should refer. When holders of the stock in a joint or fiduciary capacity receive their forms they will note, no doubt, that, whereas the form of request for conversion need be signed by a majority only of the holders, executors or administrators, in the case of the form of request for redemption it must be signed by all the holders, executors or administrators, as the case may be. Once again, we are following a notable precedent in that regard, and for a very sound reason.  Conversion of an investment from one stock to another is not a material change, since it remains an investment.  But the redemption of an investment and its replacement by money is a material change.  There would be a very grave risk in omitting any of the safeguards which the ordinary law and administrative prudence dictate and in allowing a majority of holders of an account to act on behalf of the whole number, so as to secure the redemption money without the formally expressed concurrence of the whole number of beneficiaries. It has always been a requirement that, when redemption money comes to be paid out, the formal concurrence of all the holders must be obtained, their signatures being attested by competent witnesses.  It would be most injudicious and unfair to holders if this safeguard were now to be omitted.  That is not to say, however, that the majority of a body of joint holders are not competent to decide upon redemption rather than conversion, but only that all the body of joint holders by their signature to the form of request for redemption must signify that the decision to redeem has, in fact, been properly taken by a majority.</P>
    <P>I do not think that there is any other point in the Bill which calls for comment at this stage.  Therefore, in conclusion, I merely wish to say that <Col N="153" /> in undertaking the conversion of the First National Loan, I have received the wholehearted co-operation of the Irish banks on terms which indicate that they regard the operation, as we must all regard it, as of the very greatest importance to the community. I think I may say also that they feel that, in dealing with this matter, I have placed myself, so far as is humanly possible to do so, above all Party considerations.  For, as I have endeavoured to make clear here to-day, we are able to undertake the operation largely by reason of the present favourable monetary conditions and as the result of the ample Sinking Fund which, under successive Governments, our citizens have built up.  It is, I feel, the duty of us all not to allow the propitious moment for this operation to pass without doing our utmost to take advantage of it.  We rely, and I think I can say confidently rely, on the co-operation of all sections of the community to make the undertaking a success.  As I have said, our banks will do their part.  We hope and believe that our ecclesiastical institutions, our stock exchanges, our commercial houses, our stockholders large and small, and, equally important, all sections of our public representatives with a common zeal and patriotism will combine to do theirs.  If our expectations in this regard are realised, the significance and success of the conversion will be heightened by the fact that after all our years of differences, all sections of our citizens, without prejudice to the respective views they hold, have been able to unite in one great effort for the good of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, we are supporting this measure, and it is a matter of not a little regret to me that it should be necessary to say so in the Parliament of the people.  The Loan, which is now in process of conversion, was raised during a time of difficulty, and, in order that there should be no misunderstanding about it, we are supporting this proposal, as it would be the duty of every Party, in a State democratically controlled such as this, to accept that responsibility which the electorate confers upon their public <Col N="154" /> representatives in Parliament.  As long as the Parliamentary institutions of the country prevail, the authority of the electorate falls upon these men in the discharge of their duty, and when the public is asked to subscribe to a loan for the State, that loan is not merely the responsibility of a particular Party or the Party supporting the loan, or supporting the Government of the time, it is a liability and responsibility of all Parties in the State.  It would be well if that point of view had been as prevalent some ten years ago as it is to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Loan was raised ten years ago, as the Minister has said, it was raised in a time of difficulty.  It was a new State.  It was raised, if my recollection is correct, a 5 per cent. loan at 95, which was a fair price having regard not only to the circumstances existing here, but to general world circumstances.  At the same time that that Loan was raised, a Continental country, having a much longer tradition than we had, raised a loan in New York &mdash; a 7 per cent. loan at 93. During the better part of ten years this National Loan has, over the average, preserved a fair market price. It is desirable not only in the interests of government, but in the interests of stable economy, that there should not be marked fluctuations in the National Loans that are floated by this country, or, indeed, by any country.  It should have been the duty of every Party and every individual in the State to contribute towards in the maintenance of a level, steady price in respect of that Loan during that period.  The time, as the Minister says, is propitious now for this conversion Loan.  It is to the interests of every person in the State that the conversion should be a success.  To my mind, the Minister has missed an opportunity for making it a still greater success.  I think this Bill ought to have been introduced some time since&mdash;at least during the year&mdash; and that he should be in a position now at this moment to give notice as to the terms of the Loan.  When a very big undertaking of this sort was put through in Great Britain, the Act was first passed in the year 1931, although the operation for conversion <Col N="155" /> was not announced until the 30th June, 1932.  On that night there was sent out to every stockholder of War Loan a notice to the effect that he had until the 30th July to convert, and that the interest in respect of the old Loan would be paid, as usual, on the 1st day of December.  It had this advantage, that, while the conversion was taking place, people were assured of the full rate of interest up to the first of July of the following year, and it gave full notice to people.  The Minister, too, might have taken the opportunity this evening of directing the attention of investors to the fact that one can convert in this particular Loan without any cost except, perhaps, the postage; whereas, if one transfers in the normal course of events from one security to another, in any Stock Exchange transactions, stamp duties or other charges arise which do not arise in this particular case.  I venture to say, in conclusion, that I hope the necessity will not arise in future in informing the people through the Parliament that there is general acceptance of responsibility on the part of different political Parties regarding National Loans or national undertakings which are entered into by the Government on behalf of the people of this country.</P>

      <P>I should like to put a question to the Minister, with your permission, Sir.  Before doing so, I should like to take the opportunity of expressing the hope that, as the original issue of the Loan met with the general support of all patriotic citizens, so this appeal from the Government for support in this conversion will meet with an equal measure of support in all directions and apart from political views; and that I hope no political considerations will arise. The question I intend to put is a technical one.  I understood the Minister to say that the signatures of all trustees would be required if an application was made for conversion.</P>

      <P>For redemption. Very well.  One of the essentials of success in such conversion is, I think, <Col N="156" /> that it should be made perfectly clear to all holders that they have a free choice.  Therefore, I assume that that means the signatures of all surviving trustees, and the question I want to ask is what kind of evidence as to the signatures of all trustees being provided will be required.  Perhaps it is too early to take a question of the kind.</P>

      <P>I should like to agree with everything the Leader of my Party has said and with what the Minister for Finance has said.  I should like to point out to the House, however, that, possibly, it might have been within the competence of the Government to relieve the taxpayers of this country of a considerable burden in connection with this conversion if they had endeavoured previously to make a convenient settlement with Great Britain.  While one cannot enter into a general discussion of these matters, I think it would be right to say that if the Government had established stable financial relations with Great Britain, the burden of the taxpayers would be less than as a result of the present conversion.</P>

      <P>I am very grateful indeed to all sections of the House for the sympathetic consideration which has been given to my plea for co-operation in making this conversion operation a success.  I have already said that this conversion will be a success, but if it is a success it will redound to the credit of all of us here in this House and to the people who sent us here.  Henceforth, there will remain no doubt in the minds of any person entrusting his capital to an Irish Government that the Irish people will accept wholeheartedly whatever obligations will be imposed upon them.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 20:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 5, Section 6, to delete all from and including the word &ldquo;in&rdquo; in line 38 to the end of Section 6 and substitute the following paragraphs&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) where such person is a worker, to a fine&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) in the case of a first such offence, not exceeding two pounds, together with (where such offence is a continuing offence) a further fine not exceeding ten shillings for every day on which such offence is continued, and</P>
      <P>(ii) in the case of a second or any subsequent such offence, not exceeding five pounds, together with (where such offence is a continuing offence) a further fine not exceeding one pound for every day on which such offence is continued, or</P>
      <P>(b) where such person is not a worker, to a fine&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) in the case of a first such offence, not exceeding ten pounds, together with (where such offence is a continuing offence) a further fine not exceeding two pounds for every day on which such offence is continued, and</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6 provides for certain penalties. Under the Bill as it was introduced penalties were provided for offences committed by persons employing workers.  During the discussion on the Committee Stage, however, the <Col N="158" /> opinion was very generally expressed from all parts of the House that wherever it was made an offence to employ workers to do certain things it was also an offence for the worker to do them.  Consequently, a number of amendments have been introduced into the Bill to achieve that purpose. That being so, it was necessary to recast the section dealing with penalties and therefore this amendment is introduced. The effect of it will be that there will be lower penalties provided where the offence is committed by a worker than in the case of an offence committed by an employer.  That is the only change the amendment effects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this the kind of amendment that meets with the approval of the Labour Party?  I think discriminations of that kind between classes in the community are extremely offensive.  If an offence is prescribed by statute and two citizens are both guilty of the offence prescribed, I think it is a highly undesirable departure in a democratic State where you have got universal suffrage and where any man is free to take up any position he likes in this country, to provide that one citizen should be fined £10 and another citizen, for exactly the same kind of offence, should be fined £2&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is just the thing the Minister does not see.  The Minister has the profoundest contempt for the courts of this country.  His assumption in every Bill he sponsors is that the judges are either deaf, blind, imbecile or senile.  He wants to take every discretion from the courts and remove from them every case he can.  He claims the right for himself and for his officials to decide every question that can, with any appearance of commonsense, be retained in his Department.  The judges of this country are not fools.  They are experienced, sensible men and they recognise as well as the Minister does, if they have two persons before them, one with an income of £1,000 a year and <Col N="159" /> the other with an income of £100 a year that the punishment must be commensurate with the crime.  While they would fine the one man £20 they would fine the other a much lesser sum with the knowledge that they were meeting out evenhanded justice.  The precedent the Minister is seeking to set up in this amendment &mdash; that two citizens of this State shall be liable to two different penalties for the same offence, because they happen to earn their living in a different way is without precedent in this country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is creating a precedent to take cognisance of the barely fortuitous fact of a man's income in a statute of this House.  Legislation in this House should be equal for all citizens and the imposition of penalties described by statute here were always left to the discretion of the Judicature to fit the penalty to the crime they have before them.  We say that a defendant should be fined a sum not exceeding £100.  That means that the Justice may fine him 5/-, 10/- or £100, according to the circumstances in which he finds the defendant.  I know of no other statute in this country in which the circumstances under which a man is living in the community are picked out for the purpose of differentiating between him and his fellow-citizens in the eyes of the law. If that sort of thing once starts, if we are going to introduce class legislation into the statutes of this State there is no end to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mind what is the modern practice in other countries. I am concerned with Saorstát Eireann where I live and of which the Minister is a Minister of State.  I know of no statute operating in this country in which that is incorporated.  I do not think the Minister can quote one.  On its merits and regardless of what may be the case in other countries, does <Col N="160" /> the Minister think it is a desirable think to establish a statutory recognition of a purely arbitrary class distinction of that character?  I do not think it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a remarkably good innovation.  I long ago suggested in this House that we should consider seriously adopting a practice which is now in operation in many Scandinavian countries of assessing penalties in the court in definite relationship to the income of the persons before the court.  In those countries the practice of fining a culprit one day's income or a month's income is, I think, an excellent idea, and one that I would like to see adopted generally.  This amendment is not intended to be a step in that direction. It is merely intended to deal with the requirements of this measure, but in so far as there is any principle raised in it, I think it is one that can be well justified.  I think that if the Deputy consults with some of his colleagues in his own Party he will find that they also share that opinion.  At least they did at the time the matter was discussed some years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle defended by the Minister is not the one that I attacked.  The one I attacked was an entirely different one.  The principle of measuring a penalty and saying that a person shall be put to an arbitrary test is an entirely different thing to saying that because a man is a worker he will be liable to one penalty and if an employer he will be liable to another.  That establishes a class distinction which should not exist in a Christian community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite realise that it is Deputy Norton's function in life to convey that kind of claptrap to the more gullible type of the community. But everyone knows perfectly well that there is no sincerity in that kind of talk.  It is just that kind of clap-trap that the Minister is evoking by this proviso.  It gives the opportunity to Deputy Norton to go down the country and say that, in fact, the capitalist tyrants in Upper Merrion Street differentiate between the exploiters and the exploited and all that blatherskite about all men being equal before the law.  In a democratic State that is all nonsense.  In this the Deputy wants to raise the red flag, and then we will get his equalitarian State in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to pursue the Minister into one of his various bypaths, but fortune has provided me with an admirable example of the kind of evil that I foresee will arise from this kind of legislation.  It will provide material wherewith the ubiquitous clap-trap merchant can go down and fool the more gullible sections of the people.  You give him the opportunity to say that this Oireachtas recognises class distinctions and actually incorporates them in its statutes.  This kind of legislation can be represented as enshrining class distinctions which do not and cannot exist in a Christian State and to which we should give no appearance of validity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what I object to.  I quite recognise that the Minister with his peculiar type of mind takes no cognisance <Col N="162" /> of principles at all.  He simply does not understand the meaning of the word principle, and consistency is abhorrent to him.  Nevertheless, it is my duty to warn him when he starts off with this kind of apparently innocent section, that it is going to lead to the kind of claptrap that we have heard from Deputy Norton, and will eventually lead to grave deception being practised, a specious type of deception, on a considerable part of our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I was really pained to see the change that has taken place in Deputy Dillon since he lost his sparring partner.  He has actually told us that all men are equal.  Earlier in the day he announced that he would not presume to criticise the works of the Almighty.  He must be ill.  Certainly he is very different from the man whom we used to know when the Dáil was last in session.  However, I will admit this, that he will probably recover in time.  His ability to spin words, even though he may say nothing, seems to have remained unimpaired during his illness.  The fact is that an offence committed under this Bill by an employer is a much more serious matter than an offence committed by an employee.  There is a difference between an employer and a worker in every respect, both in respect to their responsibilities as well as in respect to their financial positions. The Deputy will, I am sure, appreciate that a fine of £2 on an ordinary workman is a much more severe penalty than a fine of £10 on the average employer.  To insist that both should be fined the same amount for the same offence is to suggest that the worker should be penalised much more severely than the employer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two factors which must be kept in mind.  One is that there is much more direct responsibility upon the employer to see that the provisions of this measure are carried out than there is upon the worker, and that if an employer commits an offence it is a much more serious matter than if the worker committed an offence. The employer's offence may affect a very large number of workers.  The <Col N="163" /> worker's offence may only affect himself, and under these circumstances it seems clearly justifiable to have a higher maximum penalty where an employer is convicted than in the case where a worker is convicted.  So far as Deputy Dillon is concerned, perhaps we may be able, with the combined help of Cumann na nGaedheal or Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil and Deputy MacDermot, in time to persuade him to realise that he may be wrong occasionally.</P>

One might be able to congratulate Deputy Beckett if he had <Col N="164" /> called Deputy Dillon to order then. Deputy Dillon has told us that he would like to see some principle accepted in this Bill by which all men are equal.  The Deputy proceeded to give workers and employers equality before the law, but only before the law.  They are all going to be equal in the cells; they are all going to be equal in the jails! They are all going to be equal in the policeman's arms or in the Bridewell, but that is the only kind of equality that Deputy Dillon wants to give them in relation to their employers.  Do not give them financial equality, equality in housing, equality in wealth, any kind of educational or cultural equality; just give them equality in the dock! His protestation of standing for theoretical equality between the worker and the employer is just, as the Deputy himself described it, so much claptrap, because the Deputy does not want to give the workers any real equality.  The Deputy belongs to the class who believe that the workers exist for the purpose of being exploited and for the purpose of making profits out of them and that, when they grow too old to make any profits out of them, then under the philosophy of the Deputy and his Party they are to be thrown on the scrap-heap.</P>

It <Col N="165" /> is only in the dock that equality is going to extend to the worker.  I am sure that even the Deputy must see the absurdity of the contention he is advancing.

      <P>(2)  A prosecution for an offence under any section of this Act may be brought at the suit of the Minister.</P>
      <P>(3)  A prosecution for an offence under any section of this Act may be brought at any time within whichever of the following periods latest expires, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  three months after the date on which it is certified in writing sealed with the official seal of the Minister that evidence sufficient to justify the institution of such prosecution came into the possession or procurement of the Minister, or</P>
      <P>(b)  six months after the commission of the offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary to have a provision such as it is proposed to insert here.  It provides that a prosecution can be brought at the suit of the Minister and also that proceedings can be instituted within six months of the date of the offence or within three months after the date on which the Minister certifies that evidence has come into his possession of the commission of the offence.  It is a provision which has been embodied in a number of statutes, where it is possible that information that an offence has been committed may only become available sometime after the offence itself has been committed and it becomes possible to institute proceedings.  A similar principle is embodied in the Unemployment Insurance Acts and similar Acts. It is an obvious requirement of the Act that provision should be made for <Col N="166" /> bringing prosecutions at the suit of the Minister.</P>

      <P>In page 5, to add at the end of Section 6 the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where a person convicted of an offence under this Act is a company the chairman and every director and every officer concerned in the management of the company shall be guilty of the like offence unless he proves that the act constituting the offence took place without his consent, connivance or wilful default.</P>
      <P>This Bill provides for the imposition of fines in respect of certain offences under the Bill.  My amendment is designed to ensure that where a person convicted of an offence under this Act is a company, the Chairman and every director and every officer concerned in the management of the company, shall be guilty of the like offence unless he proves that the Act constituting the offence took place without his consent, connivance or wilful default.  We may be presented with a case of a company or a corporate body being guilty of an offence under the Act.  The scale of penalties is not very high in respect to a wealthy corporation or company.  It may well be that a company can commit an offence of a substantial kind and can run the gauntlet of paying such fines as may be imposed.  I do not think that that brings home to those in the firm, who may be aiding and abetting the actual commission of the offence, the responsibility for their misconduct before the law.  The object of the amendment is to ensure that not merely will the company be held responsible as a body before the law, but that those in the company who are responsible for its management will be deemed also to be guilty unless they can show that the offence committed in the interests of the company was not, in fact, committed with their consent.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I cannot see the necessity for this amendment. If a person is employed by a company <Col N="167" /> in contravention of the provisions of this Act, the Company should be charged with the offence and fined, if found guilty.  I do not think it is necessary to go after the individual members or officers of the company. The company is the employer and it is upon it the responsibility of observing the Act rests and, consequently, the fine should be levied on the company. I think the amendment is not necessary.  A provision of the kind Deputy Norton suggests is occasionally required in legislation of a particular kind, but I do not think this is legislation of the kind which requires it. Where we set out statutory provisions covering employment, the obligation should rest upon the employer, and the employer in this case is a company and, consequently, it becomes liable for the penalty.</P>
      <P>If the circumstances should arise at any time in which a company would so flagrantly violate the law that continuos prosecutions would not make it mend its practices, but would prefer to pay the £4 a day or whatever maximum fine would be prescribed, then we would have to consider introducing other legislation to deal with it; but I think it is a most unlikely development, having regard to the odium that would attach under these circumstances to the company, and the effect of that upon its commercial successes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may say that the principal means of enforcing statutes of this kind is public opinion, rather than the financial penalty involved for breaches. But one of the difficulties in securing effective public opinion in these matters is that newspapers do not publish particulars of offences under existing statutes.  I have had repeatedly to comment that when proceedings under the Factories and Workshops Acts are brought against firms sometimes for flagrant breaches of these Acts accounts rarely, if ever, appear in the newspapers, presumably because advertising revenue may be less on that account.  That is a difficulty I would like to draw attention to.  The importance of securing proper conditions of employment and safety <Col N="168" /> and health in our factories is so great that due publicity should be given where firms are charged with and convicted of offences in such matters.</P>

      <P>I mentioned that following the discussion we had on the Committee Stage it was decided, throughout the Bill, wherever the Bill makes it an offence for an employer to employ a worker under certain conditions, to make it also an offence for the worker to work under these conditions, so that there will be a dual method of enforcing the obligations of the Act.  This is the first of these.  It is the one in respect of which that power is least required.  In this case it is unlawful for an employer to employ any person under 14, and it is supposed to make it equally unlawful for a person under 14 to accept employment.  A similar change is being effected right through the Bill.</P>

    <P>It was Deputy Norton who suggested on the Committee Stage that whenever a young person has been taken into employment it should be obligatory on the employer to require that person to produce a birth certificate as proof of age.  This amendment is to that effect, with a further provision that the birth certificate can be secured for such purpose for the nominal fee of 6d. and it makes it an offence for the employer to employ a young person unless proof of age has been forthcoming.</P>

      <P>Amendment to amendment No. 30.</P>
      <P>To add to the words proposed to be substituted and inserted in Section 11 (4) by amendment No. 30 the words &ldquo;or where an industry has not been designated under the said Act by an apprenticeship committee approved by the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I indicated on the Committee Stage I was proposing to extend the definition of young person in sub-section (4) of this section, so as to make it clear it does not include an apprentice employed under indentures whereby he is bound to serve as apprentice for a period not less than three years, or a person employed as an apprentice under rules made by an apprenticeship committee under the Apprenticeship Act, 1931.  I do not <Col N="172" /> think it is necessary to indicate the reason for that exclusion.  In so far as it is desired to limit the employment of young persons, that does not extend to those young persons I have mentioned, those who are indentured or apprentices serving under the rules of the committee.</P>
    <P>The amendment which Deputies Dockrell and Good have tabled is one which I would find difficulty in accepting because I am not quite clear what it is intended to do.  If there is an apprenticeship committee, which might be approved of by the Minister, and if there are apprentices serving under that committee, the easiest way to deal with the situation is to have that committee constituted under the Apprenticeship Act.  No difficulty would exist under these circumstances.  I do not know of any case where there is an apprenticeship committee dealing with apprentices and making rules for the training of the apprentices of a kind of which I am likely to approve which could not, without difficulty, be brought in under the Apprenticeship Act, in which case the amendment would not be required.</P>

      <P>I do not want to say a lot to the Minister on this question. Of course the Minister, possibly, is very well informed as to the class of apprentice who is in an industry which has not been designated under the Act, and if he thinks he does not wish to accept those, I do not wish to press the amendment.  At the same time, I would like to submit that there may be cases where the apprenticeship machinery is not sufficiently clear. As the Minister knows, there has been a considerable delay in bringing these committees into existence, and perhaps the Minister will consider some scheme that would not exclude these people from the provisions.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is, no doubt, aware the Apprenticeship Act had to be passed because of the abuses which existed and which had to be removed.  We want, under this Act, to avoid a repetition of the abuses, and therefore we accept as apprentices only those who are clearly apprentices <Col N="173" /> without a question of doubt, that is, those who are indentured apprentices or acting under the rules of an apprenticeship committee.  I agree that there are not many committees constituted as yet.  It is only, I think, last year, or even this year, that the first committees commenced to function.  There were delays in bringing that Act into operation, but there is no reason why there should be delays in the future. I hope to see quite a large number of committees functioning under that Act, at an early date, and possibly the operation of this section in this form will facilitate the realisation of that hope.</P>

      <P>If they are not working under the rules of a committee, or if they are not properly indentured apprentices, I think we must regard them as coming within whatever restrictions it is decided to impose under this section upon the employment of young persons.  The problems associated with individual cases can, of course, all be examined before regulations are made, and, as the Deputy is aware, regulations cannot be brought into operation until the interested parties have been consulted and it is at that stage that I would hope to have the Apprenticeship Act utilised, in order to get over difficulties that might be brought forward in the form of objections to the regulations, by having these committees constituted. In other words, under the operation of this Bill, I would regard the existing Apprenticeship Act as part of the code to be brought into operation at the same time that regulations are made under this Bill for the general improvement of the conditions under which young persons are employed in industrial occupations.</P>

    <P>(3)  Every employer who is required by this section to keep a register of outworkers and fails to keep such a register in accordance with this section and the regulations made thereunder shall be guilty of an offence under this section.</P>
    <P>It was Deputy Norton who made the suggestion, which, I think, is a valuable suggestion, which has resulted in this amendment.  It provides for the keeping by each employer who employes outworkers of a register of all the outworkers from time to time employed by him and gives power to the Minister to prescribe the form of the register and the information to be set out in it.  The amendment also proposes to make it an offence for an employer to fail to keep that register. It will, I think, result in a considerable improvement in the effective control of the employment of outworkers to have this obligation to keep a register imposed upon employers.</P>

      <P>In page 7, before Section 14 (2), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  On the application of an employer, the Minister may, if he thinks proper so to do having regard to all the circumstances of the case, <Col N="176" /> issue to such employer a permit authorising him, subject to compliance with such conditions (if any) as may be stated in such permit, to pay piece-work wages to workers and outworkers employed by him without complying with the next preceding sub-section of this section, and whenever any such permit is so issued to an employer the following provisions shall have effect in regard thereto, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the Minister may at any time revoke such permit by notice in writing given or sent by post to such employer;</P>
    <P>(b)  so long as such permit remains unrevoked and such employer complies with the conditions (if any) stated in such permit, it shall not be obligatory on such employer to comply with the said next preceding sub-section of this section.</P>
    <P>The existing Section 14 provides that an employer who employs workers at piece rates must, before the commencement of any work, give to each worker a note in writing showing in certain detail particulars of the rate of piece-work wages and of the work in respect of which such rate is payable.  Representations have been made that in certain trades it is not necessary to have that provision, because the nature of the work to be done and the piece rates for the work are well known and have been established by custom sometimes running back over very long periods, such as in the coopering business and certain other trades of that kind, and that it is not necessary as a safeguard to have that obligation imposed upon employers in such trades. The amendments which I propose give power to the Minister to exempt a particular employer from that obligation wherever the Minister is satisfied that such exemption will create no difficulty in the matter of the enforcement of piece rates.  It is really only in certain trades that the danger of abuses exists in consequence of the inability of the workers to understand the piece rates prevailing for certain classes of work.  In some of these older trades, where the division of the work has been established by custom, which <Col N="177" /> has sometimes existed for centuries, the danger of the worker misunderstanding what he has done and what he is entitled to receive for doing it is very slight.</P>

      <P>In page 8, Section 15 (2), line 17, before the word &ldquo;discloses&rdquo; to insert the word &ldquo;knowingly.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a matter which we discussed on Committee Stage, and I was hoping that the Minister would have seen fit to accept the amendment.  There is not very much involved in the matter, but there is a danger that the section, as drawn, might be construed in such a way as to put a representative of the workers who might be present at a conference with his own employer and with other employers in a position in which he might be accused, through a strained reading of the section, of being guilty of an offence under the section.  The section reads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If for the purpose of divulging a trade secret any person discloses any <Col N="178" /> information derived by him from a piece work particulars docket... he shall be guilty of an offence... and shall be liable... to a fine not exceeding £10.</P>
    <P>The object of my amendment is to make it clear beyond all doubt that the offence could only be committed where it is shown that he knowingly disclosed a trade secret for that particular purpose and to ensure that the worker will not be put in a position in which he might be afraid of arguing his case, or even of exposing an undesirable practice by the fear of the possibility of being involved in an offence under this section.  There is not much in the point, but I think there is a better case for the inclusion of the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; than there is for its exclusion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the section goes even further than the Deputy suggests and certainly much further than the Deputy contemplates in his amendment.  The difficulty always of putting a word like &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; into a statute or into a section of this kind is that it places on the prosecutor the obligation of proving not merely that the act was done but that it was done knowingly.  Here we are going farther. The words used are &ldquo;for the purpose of divulging a trade secret.&rdquo;  If that is done, then an offence is committed. That clearly throws on the prosecution the onus of proving not merely that information was disclosed but that it was disclosed for the purpose of divulging a trade secret.  Nobody could disclose information for the purpose of divulging a trade secret without doing it knowingly.</P>

A worker in Factory A may say that he has a complaint against his employer because, in respect of a particular operation, he is only paid a certain rate.  It might be held that an exposure of that kind was an offence under this section.  I want to make sure that, where an exposure is made in that <i>bona fide</i> way, it will not operate against a representative of the workers unless it can be proved beyond all doubt that he knowingly disclosed the information for the purpose of divulging a trade secret.  I want the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; inserted, so that there will be no possibility of a worker, under these circumstances, being made amenable under this section.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 40:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 8, before Section 16 (2), to insert the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>It shall be lawful for a duly authorised representative of a trade union of which any worker or outworker is for the time being a member to attend in or at an industrial undertaking where such worker is employed for the purpose of checking the reckoning by the employer of such worker of the amount of work done and the result of such reckoning and every person who obstructs or interferes with such representative as aforesaid shall be guilty of an offence under this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is provided in the Bill that an employer shall make known to the worker certain particulars in respect of the work undertaken by that employer so as to ensure that the reckoning will be fair.  That does not seem to me to go sufficiently far in protecting the interest of the worker.  A worker may not be so intellectually equipped as to understand complicated arithmetical mechanism and he may not be in a position, in regard to some of these calculations for piece-work, accurately to ascertain how the calculation is arrived at or whether the elements that go to make the calculation are fair.  Trade union officials do not want to be obliged to make a constant pilgrimage from one employer to another to ascertain how they arrive at their calculation in respect of a ubiquitous Mary Murphy.  The question would only arise where there was a dispute in reckoning the amount of work done or in the calculation respecting the payment for the work done.  In that case, it should be possible for the trade union representative of the worker to go to the premises and ascertain the method of calculating the work done and the reckoning of payment for such work. In that way, the representative of the worker could ascertain the information at first hand and the worker would be assured of adequate protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment introduces no innovation. Many years ago &mdash; in 1887 &mdash; provision was made in a Mining Act introduced in Great Britain for the employment of a person known as a check-weigher.  It was felt that those who engaged in the mining of coal were getting a raw deal from those supposed to pay for the work.  So outrageous was the conduct of those who ought to pay honestly for the work that the British Parliament passed an Act which established the check-weigher system.  The purpose is to ensure fair computation in respect of the coal produced.  It is 50 years since that Act was introduced <Col N="181" /> and the miners have had the advantage of it since then in Great Britain and, I think, here, so far as we have miners at work.  When we ask to have a similar system introduced under this Bill, we are asking only for what is recognised as a valuable principle. The proposal can cause no inconvenience to the Minister's Department. It can cause no inconvenience to the employer.  If he feels that he has a good case as regards his method of reckoning, he ought to be willing to disclose that case to a representative of the workers' union.  These representatives would only investigate where it was evident to them that there was a good case for investigation.</P>

      <P>This question was discussed on Committee Stage on a similar amendment by Deputy Norton.  I have nothing to add to what I said then.  I do not think it is desirable that this amendment should be inserted.  I said so on Committee Stage.  I have reasons for my opinion and I have heard nothing from Deputy Norton to induce me to change my opinion.  Nor do I think that any analogy exists with the check weighers, to whom the Deputy has referred.  If there were known abuses prevailing generally throughout an industry or particular branches of an industry, it might be necessary to have special provisions in order to remove them but that is not the case. So long as it is possible for a worker easily to compute what he is entitled to as a result of his week's work, the danger of abuse is largely removed.</P>

      <P>No.  The section is intended to ensure that the worker will have little difficulty in estimating what wages he or she is entitled to as a result of a week's work.  It is intended to ensure that complicated methods of computation will not be used, to the confusion of the worker.  I do not think it is necessary to bring in anybody to check on the employer's computation of the wages unless abuses are reported, in which case the inspection should be done by a factory inspector.</P>

      <P>In page 9, Section 19 (1), to delete all words from and including the word &ldquo;employment&rdquo; in line 37 to the end of the sub-section and substitute the words &ldquo;complete employment year of such worker during which he has been continuously in the employment of such employer and has worked in such employment not less than eighteen hundred hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the problems which gave Deputies considerable concern, in relating to Section 19 of the Bill, as well as Section 20, and which was discussed for a considerable length during the Committee Stage, was the method by which continuity of employment was to be determined.  The Bill provides that a worker, who has had a year's continuous employment with an employer, is to be entitled to receive a minimum week's holiday with pay, and, also, provides that workers who have continuous employment for lesser periods will receive additional pay in lieu of the holidays which only becomes due if a year's work is performed.  Every Deputy saw circumstances, under which the continuity of a worker's employment might be interrupted, perhaps deliberately interrupted by unscrupulous employers for the purpose of evading the obligations of the Act.  At the same time, such difficulty in the way of providing a satisfactory definition <Col N="183" /> of continuity, which would preserve the essential principle that a year's work should be done, before the obligation to provide holidays arose, was very considerable, and no Deputy had a suggestion as to how that could be overcome.  I have given the matter very considerable attention since I believe the best way to meet all points of view is to allow a certain amount of latitude in the matter of determining continuity by defining a year's work as the performance within that year of so many hours of work; a number of hours which will permit a certain amount of broken time, to a certain extent interruption of the day to day continuity of the employment, but not of sufficient length to actually break that continuity.  We are proposing, therefore, to amend sub-section (1) of Section 9 in a manner which will impose upon each employer the obligation of giving one week's annual holiday, with pay in the case where the year's work has been performed, in each &ldquo;complete employment year of such worker during which he has been continually in the employment of such employer and has worked in such employment not less than 1,800 hours.&rdquo;  Deputies well know that in the other amendment continuity of employment would be periods as calculated in the same way; in other words, there must be 75 per cent. continuity in order to qualify for the week's holiday or a day's pay for a period of two months.</P>
    <P>The next amendment deals with the shorter periods.  That particular method of determining what constitutes continual employment is one that will cause less difficulty.  I do not say that there will be no difficulty, but it will be a case of less difficulty than in any of the other methods suggested.  If a worker is employed continuously by an employer for a year, he is entitled to holidays and by continuously employed is meant employed for 1,800 hours during the course of that year.  That, as I explained, will preserve the right of the workers to holidays even though because of slackness the work was interrupted during the year or because of reasons of one kind or another <Col N="184" /> the workers' employment may have been interrupted by a day or two, or a week in the course of the year.  It also will enable the worker to protect his right to holidays, though in periods of trade depression, such as certain industries have known in the past, that worker was only employed for a certain number of days in the week rather than a full week, and so forth. The amount of employment we think that should be required to enable the worker to prove his claim of being continuously employed, is 75 per cent. of the normal hours any worker might be employed under the other conditions of the Bill.  In the following amendment we propose to employ the same method to determine what constitutes continuous employment for the shorter periods, and in each case the same percentage is being observed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is attempting to do the best possible in the circumstances; but I am afraid the method defined here is not going to be as equitable as he, possibly, intends. I think a considerable section of workers who have 75 per cent. continuity may not have the necessary number of hours.  I am speaking of one section of workers with whom I am conversant.  There are others who will have only periods of 50 per cent. or three-quarter time, through no fault of their own.  Because of the exigencies of the work there will be considerable slackness through no fault of theirs.  I am talking of the engineering section of the Great Southern Railway, of which I am a member myself, and they have been on three-quarter time since May, 1935.  They work a total of 1,768 hours.  Their week consists of 34 hours for each of the 52 weeks.  Some of those men have 25, 30 or 40 years' service with the company.  There is no question of the continuity of their employment.  They have 75 per cent. of the available employment, but not the number of hours which the Minister specifies.  I presume that if this amendment is put in they will be definitely out of court for the week's holidays.  I am sure the Minister does not contemplate that, and I ask him to reconsider the position.  This is a <Col N="185" /> typical case I am quoting.  There may be others, but I can speak intimately of that one.  Those men will have a very hard case if the 1,800 hours are insisted on.</P>

      <P>47 hours.  They have been allowed to work only 34 hours since May, 1935.  Notwithstanding that considerable transport came to the railway since then, those men still work three-quarter time, finishing on Thursday night.  They have come to me in connection with this matter.  They have a total of 1,768 hours, and 1,800 hours would put them definitely out of court.  Even if there were only that one case in the country it would be unjustifiable to exclude them from the Bill. I might also remind the Minister that at the present time there is a tendency towards the reduction of hours.  I am sure we all contemplate a considerable reduction in the working week in the near future; in any case we are not contemplating an advance.  If we want to give consideration to the vast number of unemployed it seems that we must have a reduction.  That 1,800 hours is a very high figure to fix.  I certainly think that if the hours penalty is to be inflicted it ought to be less than 1,800; otherwise there will be considerable hardship to a great number of people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Keyes has given one instance, but I should like the Minister to consider another aspect of the matter.  I take it that this is a section above all others in the Bill about which there should not be ambiguity. It says here:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;....during which he has been continuously in the employment of such employer, and has worked in such employment not less than 1,800 hours.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Which is the Minister relying on?  I can imagine, under this section, a discussion between an employee and an employer on something like the following lines.  The employee presents himself and says: &ldquo;What about my annual holiday?  I have worked more than 1,800 hours.&rdquo;  The employer might say: &ldquo;But you have been out of my employment <Col N="186" /> for two months.&rdquo;  That might easily be the case.  In an instance such as that I should like to ask the Minister which he is going to rely on &mdash; the continuity of employment or the 1,800 hours?  I think this section has been drawn up by somebody who had his eye more on the question of reduced time in a factory, and that the idea he had in mind was that when a person fell below 1,800 hours he possibly was not entitled to the week's holidays.  I should like to ask the Minister what is the position of an employee who has over 1,800 hours, but has had definite long periods in which he has been in other employment.</P>

An employee, therefore, might have worked 1,800 hours and then stopped, and have left the employment of that employer.  He would not be entitled to the annual holiday with pay; but he would be entitled to receive from that employer one day's pay in respect of every two months during which he had been in the employer's service.  In other words, he would be entitled to receive, on termination of employment, that pay in lieu of the holidays.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  If there is no definite break, but merely interruptions in employment, then the obligation to give a week's holidays arises only if 1,800 hours have been worked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Minister stated that in fixing the period of what constituted the worker's right to a full week's holidays he had in mind approximately 75 per cent. of the normal time during which the workers would be employed in that undertaking, assuming they were doing <Col N="187" /> a normal week's work, and that, consequently, he came to fix the period at 1,800 hours, the normal period being 2,400 hours.  The point which Deputy Keyes has made is one which I think the Minister should make some effort to meet, and I suggest to him that he can do it quite conveniently if he does not fix the number of hours as high as 1,800.  In any case, 1,800 hours is a period something higher than 75 per cent., because many workers are on a 44-hour week.  If you fix 1,800 hours as the qualifying period for a full week's holidays, then, I think, you are fixing definitely more than 75 per cent. attendance at work.  The Minister's 1,800 hours period is arrived at by assuming a 48-hours week.  That is the legal maximum period provided for in the Bill, but the Minister has already given expression to a hope that when the Bill became law steps would be taken to reduce the hours worked below 48.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it will be necessary to have power to vary the provisions of this section which it is now proposed to insert, where such circumstances arise, but we must be careful about not going too far.  Deputy Keyes' complaint about the engineering staff of the railway is that they are getting too many holidays at the present time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Put it either way; they are not working enough.  As the working week is reduced, I think we could reasonably be expected to be either stricter in defining what constitutes continuous employment, but power to vary that number must be there, because conceivably we might, under another section of the Bill, make it illegal for a worker to work 1,800 hours in the year, if we were to reduce the maximum working week sufficiently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister undertake to meet Deputy Keyes' point by fixing the period of service to be rendered by the worker at something less than 75 per cent. of whatever is the normal week's work?  In this case where the men are working 75 per cent. <Col N="188" /> of their time, if the figure is fixed at something marginally less than 75 per cent., we would automatically have those workers brought within the scope of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be hesitant about taking the case which Deputy Keyes has mentioned and framing legislation on the basis of that case, because it is an unusual type of circumstance, but I think there should be power to have that figure of 1,800 hours reviewed in relation to the maximum working week permitted for the class of workers concerned, because obviously if the maximum working week is reduced that figure must also be reduced, if not proportionately, at least to some extent.  You might conceivably get, in relation to some industry, a maximum working week of, say, 36 hours; in which case that number would become meaningless, because that number of hours could not be worked by such a worker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment the Minister is providing for workers being employed for 1,800 hours in order to qualify for a full week's holidays, but he arrived at the 1,800 hours by assuming a normal working week of 48 hours, whereas if he would assume, and as is the case in many industries, a normal working week of 44 hours, he would get a much lesser total and might, to a certain extent, meet the point made by Deputy Keyes.</P>

      <P>That would be somewhat difficult.  It might be that a dispute might arise as to what was the normal working week.  It might be all right if the maximum working week was fixed, but if it was only fixed from district to district it would be a different matter.  I have power to vary down the hours fixed, but where regulations have been made reducing the maximum working hours I would like to consider the matter further.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the President was going to continue his rather long speech but as he has not seen fit to do so, I will content myself by making a few remarks on the motion.  I want it to be clearly understood, notwithstanding what the President says, that this is not a Party motion.  Speaking here last April the President said that it was an offensive motion, prompted by a purely Party desire.  I want it to be clearly understood that this is in no sense a Party motion.  It was sponsored by Deputy MacDermot and myself, as far back as 1932, and was re-introduced in 1933.  At that time the motion was tabled primarily to enable the President to clarify the political position for the great mass of the people on both sides of the Border.  Despite the length of his speech, I think everybody feels that the President has contributed very little of any material extent in making that position clear.  I want to make my own position clear.  It is this. If the majority of the people of the Free State should decide to set up a Twenty-six County Republic, personally I believe they would be acting not only unwisely but unpatriotically. I also want to make it clear that if they should so decide, I have no intention of standing in their way.  But it ought to be clear that nothing but heavy national sacrifices and national loss of dignity can follow from a continuance of the present position. What is that present position?  It is a position of remaining in the Commonwealth but, at the same time, carrying on an insincere flirtation with formal Republicanism.  It is for these reasons, involving as they do national honour as well as our material <Col N="190" /> welfare, that I have put my name to this motion.  If it was not stated in the long speech the President made, at least by his actions during the last three or four years, he has shown a tendency to adjust himself to the position of a Minister in the former Administration, whom, either unwittingly or deliberately, he misquoted. On the last occasion the President asked me a question.  I would like to draw particular attention to that question.  Speaking of the seconder of this motion, according to the Official Debates, Volume 55, No. 7, Column 2280, the President said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I would like to hear, when he stands up, whether he is going to say that, now the circumstances have so altered and so changed, he thinks that if we could now reach the Republic he fought for and very nearly died for at one period, it would not be worth, as one former Minister said over here, raising his little finger to get it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that statement he quoted a former Minister, and he knows that that Minister did not say anything like that; that what that Minister did say was that he would not raise his little finger to establish a Twenty-Six County Republic.  As I already stated, I am perfectly satisfied that the President now finds himself in the same position, and that he would not raise his little finger to establish a Twenty-Six County Republic.  The President asked me a question.  I would like to put this question to him. Can he give us an assurance, not only by one dying, but by thousands fighting and dying for a Thirty-Two County Republic, that we are going to obtain it; or, can he give us any assurance that having fought for it and died for it and not got it, that we could hold the position we now occupy, or the position that gave the President such pleasure and joy in Geneva?  I do not want to say too much on this, but I want to say that I am sick and tired of people talking of their Republicanism, and what they would do, and what they would not do, while not meaning one little bit of it.  If you do not agree with them you are an Imperialist, a pro-Britisher <Col N="191" /> and so on.  All I would like to say to them in that connection is this, that if this country ever requires the services of people like myself, we will not need conscription to get us into the field in defence of this country's honour.  So far as I am concerned, I stand where I have stood for the past 15 or 20 years serving this country and doing what I think is best for it.  I am satisfied that much can be done in its interests, but I do want to see an end put to one leg in and another out&mdash;joy in one place, sorrow in Ennis, and so on.  It is time for that to stop.  We should get to some definite position in which we can advance the interests of our country generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree in the main with Deputy MacEoin, personally I am against the motion.  I wonder has Deputy MacEoin thought of what might follow from the alternatives. I am sure he does not stand or never stood for a Twenty-six County Republic, and that is one of the alternatives asked for in this motion.  There is great trouble and confusion about republicanism.  We all know that republicanism is not the parent of Irish nationality.  It was the method of expression of Irish nationality.  I am sure the President will not contradict that statement.  Our fathers were national in this country before any man in this country ever thought of setting up a republic here, and if there were a better method of expressing the national will and determination to be free in 1916 than by the method of proclaiming a republic, I have no doubt that that method would have been adopted as against the method of declaring a republic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trouble is that republicanism has not only become synonymous with nationalism, but as comprising the entire national sentiment of the country.  Any man who was not a republican could not be a good Irishman, or a patriotic or national Irishman, until to-day it has come to this, that to express the high-water mark of patriotism in this country there is a competition in republican flag-waving, <Col N="192" /> one trying to go higher than the other.  But if real patriotism and love of country are to be judged by the standards of prosperity and comfort of the masses in a country, we find that those standards are going down while we are flag-waving.  On the other hand, I would be equally against a motion in this House, if it were introduced, to stop featuring Commonwealth patriotism and nationality in this country.  The sooner we begin to think of Irish patriotism and nationality in terms of what we can do for the well-being of the people and the advancement of Ireland, the nearer we will be to appreciating our duty as citizens and representatives of citizens in this country.</P>
    <P>I might say that if I appear critical of the Government in this, I frankly admit that the Fianna Fáil Party or any other political Party are entitled to fly any kite they like to gain popularity or votes for themselves, provided it is done within the law, and for that reason, if for no other, I do not think the time of this House ought to be wasted in discussing a motion like this. But the motion is here now and we have to dispose of it.  I think that it was a dangerous experiment to try to gain a monopoly of patriotism for any political Party by nailing to the mast of that political Party a form of government that had become associated with patriotism in the minds of the people.  It was quite clear that a time would come when that cry of republicanism to get control of the Government of the Twenty-Six Counties, and which helped largely, perhaps, to get control of the Government of the Twenty-Six Counties, might be the undoing of the Party that got control.  Personally, I think it is the best form of patriotism, and for Deputy MacEoin's Party the best politics to let the Government Party, which handled this two-edged weapon, now protect themselves from being cut with the back of the weapon.</P>
    <P>There is a cry as to why a republic is not established.  We were told that that was the only form of patriotism, and the head of anybody who did not wave that flag higher was in danger of being broken by wild men who had <Col N="193" /> been urged on to the cry, &ldquo;We and those behind us are the only patriots, and anybody who is not with us is an Imperialist.&rdquo;  Surely in this country, as well as in every other country, republicanism, which is only a form of government, cannot claim to have amongst its adherents everybody who is a patriot, and that anybody outside the fold of that republican organisation cannot be a patriot.  Of course, the confusion is becoming greater when we find after many centuries of enslavement that we have been told, and the people of the world have been told at the international centre at Geneva, that we now have our freedom.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not referring to the Irish Press.  I thought it was correct.  However, Sir, I think that nobody should be in a hurry to set up for decision in this country, in present circumstances, either the issue of a republic or of a Commonwealth; and certainly not while we have only 26 counties.  If there is ever to be a clear decision taken on the question of republicanism as against any other form of government, it can only be taken, or should only be taken, with the 32 Counties vote as one unit.  If the Government's policy is not to seek a decision on republicanism until that decision must be sought in the 32 Counties, then I would agree with it; but we want a clearer understanding in the minds of the people of what republicanism means; and while I have the greatest respect for the republican movement, or the national movement, rather, expressed in the form of republicanism from 1900 down to the present time, I am not one of those who think, or who would say or agree, that the leaders of the Irish people prior to 1916, who did good service and as good service in their day as any generation of Irishmen ever did in this country&mdash; I am not one of those who think or <Col N="196" /> would say that their successors, who believe in Irish freedom under another form of Government rather than republicanism, should be considered Imperialists, Commonwealthers, or any other odious term you like to call them.  I think that, even if we had the 32 Counties, a decision on the question of a Commonwealth or a republic should be postponed until the people of the whole 32 Counties have a fuller and clearer appreciation of what republicanism, as against other forms of government, means.  To me, republicanism is not necessarily patriotism.  You can be just as good a patriot and not be a republican. Republicanism is only a form of government.  Other forms of government might be equally as good to some people&mdash;even better&mdash;but the only thing that an Irishman should be concerned with is what is the fullest and best type of freedom for this country.  A day might come &mdash; I hope it will, and I should be glad to see it in our time &mdash; when a decision could be made in this country, but until we have an opportunity of making that decision, I think that this Government, or any succeeding Government of the Twenty-Six Counties, would be ill-advised, and would not be acting patriotically, in forcing an issue on a particular form of government here and trying to fool the people of the country that that form of government is the expression of real patriotism and love of country in this country. In conclusion, Sir, because I consider that it is inopportune to put the request contained in this motion into force by the present Government, or by any Government in present circumstances &mdash; for that reason, and for that reason only, if this question comes to a division, I am going to vote against the motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>The fatal defect in Deputy Belton's argument in favour of the postponing of a decision on the question of the republic until we have become a unit of 32 counties is this: that until we have got rid of republicanism there is absolutely no hope of our becoming a united country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion, as General MacEoin has said, is in no sense a Party one.  It was <Col N="197" /> first put down by me when I was an Independent member and here I am concluding with it as an Independent member again.  It is not a tricky motion.  The President has seen fit to suggest, because it happens to be one that is inconvenient to him, that it must be inspired by the basest partisan motives and that it is a tricky attempt to lure him into declarations that would be damaging to his Party, and lure the country into a position that would be damaging to it.  It is nothing of the sort; it is a straightforward motion.  It is an attempt to lead him gently and kindly from the world of phrases to the world of realities.  Take for example his contention that when I invited him to say whether he proposed to set up a Twenty-Six County republic in this country or not it was much the same as to ask him had he stopped beating his wife; that it was a question to which a straightforward &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; could not in the nature of the case be given.  Why is it that the President could justly complain if I asked him had he stopped beating his wife?  The reason that he could not answer &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; is because either &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; would imply an untruth to his discredit.  But he could perfectly well answer me the question about the Twenty-Six County republic without implying any untruth to his own disadvantage.  The reason he does not want to answer &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; to that question is not that it would imply an untruth but that the answering of it would reveal an inconvenient truth.  He knows he could not say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; to that question without displeasing a considerable section of his followers and supporters.  But the question is a perfectly fair one and it is one to which the Irish people have a right to know the answer.  Deputy Belton has suggested that this motion is an attempt to force the Government into declaring a Twenty-Six County republic. It is not.  It merely says to the Government: &ldquo;Declare your republic or give up your republicanism.&rdquo;  The time has come to do one thing or the other.  I say this motion deserves the support of every Deputy in the House who is desirous of putting an end to <Col N="198" /> shams.  I am not accusing the Government of being consciously insincere. I am accusing them of having an insincere policy.  I believe that the attitude of the Government on this whole national issue is cowardly and confused.  The time has come to clarify and elucidate the national policy.</P>
    <P>In one respect I have to confess that this motion has been a failure.  It has led to very little clarification and to very few speeches from any side of the House.  When the basic principles of Irish nationalism are the issue, there seems to be a general feeling that it is almost indelicate to talk about these things.  The tendency is to remain silent.  The President did not remain silent.  He could not do that.  He spoke at great length and, as General MacEoin pointed out, he succeeded in saying remarkably little. He dealt with this motion with his customary astuteness.  He talked long enough to talk it out in the session before last; he forced it into cold storage and poor General MacEoin and poor Deputy MacDermot have now the task of bringing it out, reviving it and breathing some warmth into what has been so long congealed.</P>
    <P>I did not succeed in getting anything to speak of in the way of clarification or elucidation from the President and I am going to take what revenge upon him I can.  I have submitted to a good many lectures from the President and the House as a whole has submitted to a good many lectures from him.  But from the present elevation in which I find myself on these benches I am now going to inflict a lecture upon him whether he likes it or not.  What I want the House to do is to face realities.  If there is any truth in the rumours going about that the Government are contemplating a new Treaty with Great Britain on the basis of what is called external association, it is even more important than it otherwise would be that we should be clear about our ends and that we should distinguish between what is superficial and fundamental.  Can we not arrive at some agreement in our minds on the question of what are the fundamental <Col N="199" /> aims which the statesmen of this country should be going after?  It occurs to me that one could sum them up in three words &mdash; peace, freedom, unity.  Let us talk a little about freedom first.  Deputy Belton and the President got involved just now in a little altercation as to whether the President considers that this country is free or not&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, as to whether the President had said this country was free or not.  Let us consider for a moment whether this country is free or not, and let us confine ourselves to the Twenty-Six Counties.  I will come to the question of reunion in a minute.  I perused very carefully the President's speech and many other speeches of his to see what evidence he could bring forward of the Twenty-Six Counties not being free. Any evidence he has produced boils down to this: that the Treaty position is what he calls a forced position and that we have not had from the British Government an acknowledgment of our right to decide for ourselves at all times whether to be members of the British Commonwealth or not.  I should like general agreement to be reached in this House and in the country that it is desirable to get from the British Government, or from some future British Government, an explicit admission &mdash; in view of the events and Constitutional developments that have taken place &mdash; that in spite of the Treaty (whether you regard it as under the Treaty in the course of natural development or as something that they ought to agree to in supersession of the Treaty) we are free at all times to decide for ourselves whether or not to be in the Commonwealth.  And I would go further and say that I think the Treaty, not only the actual Treaty of 1921 but any Treaty, is an unsatisfactory basis on which to rest the international position of this country.  I think the international position of this country should flow naturally from its own choice and the march of <Col N="200" /> events and not from an agreement with another country.  I would like while we are in the British Commonwealth that our constitutional position should be on all-fours with every other member of the British Commonwealth.  If we are to be outside the British Commonwealth, obviously no Treaty should be necessary for that purpose.  If we are a republic, whether for the Twenty-Six Counties or for the 32 Counties, I personally would prefer it to be a genuine republic, not concealed or disguised or modified by something that is called external association.  Honestly, I believe, that we can succeed, in the course of a comparatively short time, in getting an admission from the British Government that we are perfectly free to decide for ourselves at all times whether we are a State in the Commonwealth or not.  Now, if we do succeed in getting that, can there be any sense at all in suggesting that the Twenty-Six Counties are unfree?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President has commented a great deal lately on the ports.  I cannot help feeling that the presence of these little maintenance parties in our ports is something that would not occur to the minds of 99 per cent. of the population of this country if politicians did not go out of their way to stir them up about it.  But my personal view about the ports is this: I strongly suspect that the strategic importance of these maintenance parties is greatly overrated, and I wish the British would come to that conclusion and take the maintenance parties away so long as they irritate some people in this country.  But it seems to me that one should take one of two points of view. Either the British Navy is our navy, and should be regarded by us as our own navy, in which case there is absolutely nothing to resent about their presence in our ports.  If, on the other hand, they are to be regarded as an alien navy, I, personally, would wish them out of it, and even if it cost us, as Deputy Cosgrave said the other day, £300,000 a year to maintain those works ourselves, I would be in favour of doing it rather than that we should have in the country a force that we <Col N="201" /> considered alien.  Of course, I do not personally consider it alien.  Recruiting is going on briskly, even now, in the Free State for both the British Navy and the British Army, and if our Government have the strong views that they profess to have about the presence of a British force in our country, it seems rather odd that they do nothing to stop such recruiting. The nonsense about the ports is only one of the many anomalies in the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party and Government with regard to the whole question of our relations with the British Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>I think, therefore, that in the matter of freedom, as far as the Twenty-Six Counties are concerned, we have no need to strive for a further advance, with the solitary exception of an admission that we are free to go out of the Commonwealth.  It seems to me that with that exception we have just about as much freedom as any nation could possibly have.  We can set up Fascism; we can set up Communism; we can commit any folly or we can accomplish any stroke of genius in arranging our political structure without the smallest interference from across the water. The President said, in the course of his speech, that it was impossible for this country to feel really free until we had shown they were free by declaring a republic.  I suggest that such a statement as that is absolute nonsense. It is the same thing as saying, for instance, that a man who has just arrived at the age of 21 cannot feel that he has really attained the rights of his majority unless he has gone out and, shall we say, gone bankrupt.  A minor cannot go bankrupt; therefore such a one cannot feel he is of age unless he has gone out and proved that he can go bankrupt.  It seems to me that it is manifest that once our right to decide for ourselves whether to be a republic or to be in a British Commonwealth is acknowledged, there is absolutely no need for us to go the length of actually setting up a republic to feel free.  If there were, then it would be equally necessary, having set up a republic and in order to make sure that we were free, to become a Dominion again, so that no one could challenge our right to be a Dominion. <Col N="202" /> The whole thing is illogical and nonsensical.</P>
    <P>Turning to the question of peace, and when I speak of peace I include both internal and external peace, it will be universally agree that peace is a matter of the most intense importance to a country.  But you do not always get internal peace by surrendering to the clamours of a noisy faction.  In considering the question of internal peace, I suggest that it is our duty to consider peace in Northern Ireland as well as peace in Southern Ireland.  It would be a dereliction of duty for us, thinking of Ireland as a whole, to do something that might please a noisy minority in the Free State if the result of it was going to be to make serious trouble for our kith and kin across the Border.  As regards external peace, I do think that one of the most fundamental things for this country is to secure permanent friendly relations with the people across the water.  I think that a tradition of hatred is thoroughly bad for us in every way. I think that nothing is more belittling and degrading morally than continual hatred, and I think it should certainly be one of the most fundamental aims of Irish statesmanship to get rid of the feeling of hatred which has been common in this country, and which still is common in this country, in connection with the British.  Not only is that hatred something that is bad morally, but it is something that is horribly dangerous, because if you go on stoking up the furnaces of hatred for ever in political speeches, in the newspapers day after day, and in the national schools, the result ultimately will be an explosion, and perhaps a state of things between the two countries when there will be a reconquest of Ireland and a renewal of all the agonies of our history.</P>
    <P>Closely connected with this question of peace is the question of reunion with the North.  For me the question of Irish unity is the most fundamental of all.  I do not hesitate to lay it down as an axiom that Partition is absolutely intolerable.  It was lately said by Mr. Winston Churchill that Ulster was firmly anchored within the <Col N="203" /> United Kingdom.  I would say that so long as Ulster is firmly anchored somewhere apart from the rest of Ireland, so long is Ireland firmly anchored among the enemies of Great Britain.  I say that as a person who certainly, as much as anyone in this House, wishes to see the warmest and the most friendly relations with Great Britain.  I have had it suggested to me by some very prominent politicians on both sides of the House that the North would be an embarrassment to us rather than otherwise, and that we were better off without them.  Now, I simply cannot argue with people who hold such views.  For me it is a matter of instinct rather than argument, for every bit of Irish nationalism in my bones cries out against Partition. Whatever makeshifts or pretences embarrassed politicians may be ready to accept, I am sure that there cannot be contentment in Ireland and there cannot be good relations with Great Britain on the basis of Partition. Any agreement with Great Britain which overlooks this factor will prove a delusion and a snare.  Any measure of internal policy, any conduct of external relations, any propaganda, any philosophy which tends to widen the breach between ourselves and the Northern Unionists is, <i>ipso facto</i>, bad and anti-national.</P>
    <P>Now, let us turn &mdash; with those thoughts in mind concerning peace and freedom and a united Irish nation &mdash; let us turn to the remarks of the President, when last this motion was under consideration.  He takes as his sheet-anchor the General Election of 1918.  On that occasion, he says, the Irish nation decided in favour of a republic and he maintains that that decision still holds good.  Having taken such a decision the nation, he says, should not waver in its course. I would ask any member of the House to give me a reason why the verdict of 1918 should have this peculiar sanctity &mdash; a sanctity far exceeding that attached to the verdict of other general elections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>There is such a thing, the President said, as considering the matter calmly, quietly, fully and once and for all.  That is his description of the 1918 General Election &mdash;&ldquo;calmly, quietly, fully and once and for all.&rdquo;  I wonder if anyone with a straight face can say that is an accurate description of what took place at the 1918 General Election.  It is the commonest thing in the world for democracies to change their mind about important political principles. Sometimes they change them frivolously and without due reason.  Sometimes changing circumstances and new developments give them ample warrant for a change of attitude.  In any case, nobody has the right to label one particular election as transcending all others.  The people have as much authority to declare for the Commonwealth to-day as they had to declare for the republic in 1918, and, as we are certainly a thousand miles from having achieved the 32-county republic that was then desired, it is the part of a statesman not to profess himself tied hand and foot by an obsolete electoral decision, but to give the people the benefit of an unfettered judgment.  This is all the truer when you recollect in what conditions of exasperation that electoral decision was taken, and the violence of anti-British feeling that had been caused by the threat of conscription.  Consistently, from the days of Daniel O'Connell, the Irish people had accepted the idea of self-government within the British Empire.  I see no reason why the single decision of 1918 should outweigh all the decisions that went before it.  Why, the whole basis of the movement for Catholic Emancipation was that it was monstrous that the Catholics of this country should be debarred from asserting their loyalty to the British Crown at that time.</P>

      <P>I am not trying to exalt any one particular epoch more than another epoch.  I just want to expose the nonsense that is talked by many Deputies opposite when they suggest that the whole history of Irish national effort shows that it has been directed towards the establishment of a republic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have before pointed out to the Deputy, for the greater part of his life Wolfe Tone was not a republican.  If I had his works here, I could read the Deputy passages in which he expressed the most emphatic loyalty towards the Crown.  His republicanism started only when he was banished from this country.  He was not regarded as a genuine republican by the extremists in the North.  Why, I remember when even Patrick Ford of the <i>Irish World</i> declared that his aim was to see Ireland a contented portion of the British Empire.  You have a perfect right to differ from me as to whether we ought to remain in the Commonwealth or not on the merits, but what you have not a right to do is to throw the election of 1918 at my head and tell me that that ends the question. In truth the verdict of 1918 has no application to the problem of to-day. The choice before us and the circumstances surrounding it in no way resemble those of 1918.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>And for that matter the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party is hardly recognisable as being the policy of 1918. The President was querulous about my applying such a phrase as &ldquo;the profession of Republicanism&rdquo; to himself and his Party.  As a matter of fact, &ldquo;profession&rdquo; is a neutral word neither implying sincerity nor insincerity. I am not accusing them of <Col N="206" /> conscious insincerity, but, as I said before, I do accuse them of having an insincere policy &mdash; a policy by which they are deceiving themselves and deceiving the country.  What is that policy?  Nominally a 32-county republic. I ask them, as I have asked them before, to show how they have advanced one inch in that direction since they came into office, or how they propose to advance one inch towards it before they leave office. The maintenance of that formula of a 32-county republic merely serves to justify sedition in the South and to supply material for bigotry and intolerance in the North.  It creates a fatal barrier to reunion and to the integration and development of our nationality.  It holds out no promise of any sort of appeasement or spiritual progress.  My belief is that the President has no intention of declaring this republic and that, if pressed about it in private as to when it might be expected, he would say: &ldquo;Not for 15 or 20 years to come.&rdquo;  Meanwhile the turmoil and uncertainty caused by his policy are to continue and he is to have the gratification of putting himself on a superior plane of patriotism to those of us who are less skilled in deceiving ourselves.  Nor at the end of the period shall we be the least bit nearer to a 32-county republic. We may disregard the Treaty or abrogate the Treaty; we may have a new Constitution or a succession of new Constitutions; we may search out with a microscope everything that is suggestive of the British connection and banish it from the Irish Free State as St. Patrick did the serpents; we may remove the Lions and Unicorns from Dublin Castle, but at the end of it all we shall be no nearer to a 32-county republic.  All we shall have done is to exasperate still more the people in the North whom we ought to reconcile.  No Party in England, no matter how anxious it may be to make concessions, could obtain, or even look for, authority from the British electorate for overriding the desire of the majority in Northern Ireland to remain within the British Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="207" /> What then is to be gained by this policy of pretence, this policy of delay? What reason is given for not setting up whatever sort of republic is within reach? &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; says the President, &ldquo;the country is not economically strong enough to endure the deprivations that would follow from the setting up of a republic.&rdquo;  Were the people told anything of that in 1918?  If the same economic difficulties existed then, the people should have been told by Mr. de Valera, as he then was, that the sacrifices involved were too great and in that case their verdict might have been very different.  If the same economic difficulties did not exist, I inquire again what relevance has the verdict to present circumstances? Looking into the future in the optimistic spirit which causes the President to say that we can provide occupation for four times the present inhabitants of the Irish Free State, we may of course convince ourselves that in 15 or 20 years we shall be able to dispense with the trade advantages, the labour advantages, and the individual openings and opportunities which go with membership of the Commonwealth; but what about the North? Is there the faintest reason for supposing that the North will cease to require a market in Great Britain, not only for its agricultural produce, but for its shipbuilding and linen trades?  And can we contemplate with any sort of equanimity a condemnation of the Northern Nationalists to prolonged revolt, to prolonged estrangement from the Government under which they have to live, to continual feuds and hatreds between them and the Unionist majority?  These are the things to which they are condemned by the continuance of so-called republicanism.</P>
    <P>I can sincerely say, speaking for myself, that I would prefer an immediate twenty-six county republic outside the Commonwealth to the Government's present policy, but I am not asking the House to say so by this motion.  I should feel that we were making some progress, that we were starting on a road &mdash; even though a very roundabout road &mdash; which <Col N="208" /> would lead us in the end to our proper destination.  I should feel that the maintenance of law and order would be made somewhat easier, that the more fanatical republicans would have the ground cut from under their feet and that another and less respectable kind of republicanism, which is used merely as a cloak for selfish violence, would be shown up for what it is. I do not believe that economic disadvantages now would be any greater than 15 or 20 years hence.  I think the Irish people would have a chance to learn from experience whether complete separation from the British Commonwealth and the realisation of a republic were indeed so gratifying and so glorious as they have been led to expect.  The result of &ldquo;getting down to bedrock,&rdquo; as the President puts it, would be, I think, to cause us to revise and revalue our ideals or to cause the Northerners to revise or revalue theirs.  As the President says, there is no finality in any solution. That you cannot set bounds to the march of a nation is a truism, a somewhat bombastic truism.  The experience of a twenty-six county republic might lead us on to something better.</P>
    <P>What is that &ldquo;something&rdquo;&mdash; that something to which I wish I could persuade the Government to take a direct road and not a roundabout one?  If we had no racial question in this country, and no Northern question, I would honestly think it a matter of quite minor importance whether we were in the British Commonwealth or outside it, although I would still regard it as of fundamental importance that we should be on friendly terms with the British Commonwealth.  But we have a racial problem and a Northern problem, and I have no patience with those who would dwarf our country by excluding the Anglo-Irish element from our national make-up, just as they would exclude from our national records all the achievements of our people on the field of battle or in the richer victories of peace and constructive activity, except where such achievements have been in conflict and not in co-operation with our British neighbours.  It is, I suggest, an entirely new thing and an entirely bad thing in <Col N="209" /> Irish nationalism that the contribution of a large section of our people towards our civilisation should be despised and rejected, and that no sacrifices should be thought worth while for the purpose of conquering their prejudices or even of satisfying their natural and praiseworthy ideals.  I, for one, refuse to consider as invaders and intruders people whose ancestors were here in many cases before the first white men set foot in what is now the United States of America.</P>
    <P>The proper aim of Irish statesmanship is to make a harmony out of ancient discords.  At bottom, I believe that that is what all decent Irishmen have wanted throughout the centuries, even when they were most fiercely contending with one another.  The trouble in this country above all countries, I think, is that we have fallen into the common human frailty of judging ourselves by our highest ideals and judging our opponents by their worst acts.  In this country, men's acts have unhappily often been very far from giving a true impression of the ideals behind them.</P>
    <P>A purely Gaelic Ireland, even if attainable, would be a non-Irish Ireland. To take all the tragic and glorious memories of the past &mdash; those cherished by opponents as well as those cherished by ourselves &mdash; and to fuse them into one national tradition which would be the heritage of all of us; to make it possible for us all to look back on the bitter old conflicts as we might on our childhood quarrels in the nursery; to make it possible for us all to look forward to a free, happy and prosperous future which we shall build up by our joint efforts, without the sacrifice either of our liberty to shape our own destinies or of the special loyalties and the considerations of convenience and common sense which invite us into a full partnership with the nations of the Commonwealth &mdash; that is the vision which seems to me worthy of our devotion, and that is the task to which I suggest we should dedicate all that we have of strength and patience.  And it is because the policy, or lack of policy, of the Government &mdash;<Col N="210" /> the stale claptrap and the weary fallacies of Fianna Fáil propaganda &mdash; keep us grovelling in a slough of despond when we might be treading firmly the upward path, that I ask the House to accept this motion.</P>
    <P>I venture in conclusion to draw a moral from a recent event which has a more than superficial connection with the matters we are considering.  I mean the death of Lord Carson.  Lord Carson was not only the chief architect of partition; he was also the father of modern Irish republicanism. I believe he loved Ireland and also loved the British Empire; but the effect of his whole career was to inflict immense damage upon both.  In private life he was a kindly, sympathetic, lovable person, but his politics were of the kind that refuse to understand or to do justice to opponents.  Having once become a popular idol with a substantial section of our people, he could not bring himself to admit, even to himself, that the interests of his country required him to do anything that would deprive him of the least little bit of the halo with which fanatical admirers had surrounded his head. That tenacity must conquer in the end was his guiding principle and he forgot that such a conquest as he might thereby achieve could be worse than a defeat and that his desperate fidelity, in a changing and a growing world, to one narrow idea might commit him to larger disloyalties.  I think, if I may say so, that just as there is a great similarity in character and mental equipment between the late Lord Carson and the President of the Executive Council, so there is a similarity in the moral dangers to which each has been exposed, and that while the President may succeed in retaining his halo intact by persevering in the path he now follows, he may also be ensuring that his career, like that of Lord Carson, will be one that will have brought almost unrelieved disaster to Ireland.</P>
