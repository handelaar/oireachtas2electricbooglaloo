      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that the delay in determining applications for housing grants is very great, and that successful applicants have to wait upwards of six months before receiving their grants, and whether he will take steps to remedy this delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Owing to the abnormal number of applications received for housing grants, delay has occurred in dealing with some of them as speedily as I would wish.  Additional housing inspectors will be appointed within the next fortnight, and I feel confident that, with this increase in the staff, it will be possible to deal without delay with all applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister had regard to the latter part of my question in which I raised the case of persons whose grants have been sanctioned but who are unable to get the money out of the Department?  When one writes to inquire the reason for the delay in paying a grant which is admittedly due, one always gets a courteous postcard, and then one may wait from six to eight weeks to get a full answer to one's inquiry.  Surely such delay is indefensible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not on the certificate of the architect or engineer to the board of health that the Local Government Department sanctions the grant and pays it?  I cannot see how the appointment of more inspectors by the Local Government Department affects the matter, because Local Government inspectors do not go into the question at all.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that Commandant E. Cronin was fired at in Thomastown, County Kilkenny, at 2 a.m. on the morning of the 6th instant and that this shooting took place at a distance of about 100 yards from where a large number of members of the Gárda Síochána were stationed, but that those Gárda made no immediate effort to discover the perpetrators of this outrage; and further if he is aware that the Superintendent in charge of the Gárda Síochána on that occasion, when requested by Commandant Cronin to take certain steps calculated to lead to the possible discovery of the perpetrators of the outrage, refused to take such action.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that John Deegan, of 79 Annamoe Drive, Cabra, Class No. 485 (Hatch No. 28 U.A.) made application for benefit under the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933; that he received 6/- a week benefit, which has since been withdrawn, and if he will state the reasons why benefit has not been continued in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>John Deegan, 79 Anuamoe Drive, Cabra, made application for unemployment assistance on April 25th, 1934.  His claim was disallowed by the unemployment assistance officer on the ground that the applicant failed to satisfy the conditions of Section 15 (1) (b) of the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933, namely, that he was capable of work, and genuinely seeking but unable to obtain suitable employment.</P>
      <P>Mr. Deegan lodged an appeal on July 12th against the decision given on his application, and his appeal was considered by the Court of Referees, which sat on August 1st.  Mr. Deegan attended and gave evidence in support of his claim.  The Court recommended that payment of assistance be allowed. The unemployment assistance officer accepted the recommendation of the Court, and accordingly payment of assistance will be made to Mr. Deegan in respect of any period of continuous unemployment proved by him, subject to the fulfilment of the statutory conditions for the receipt of unemployment assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if, in view of the widespread depredations caused by rabbits in the country, whereby farmers and others have suffered severe losses in their crops of grain, roots, vegetables, etc., he will consider the possibility of countering this plague by the payment of a bounty on the export of rabbits so as to make it worth while for trappers and others to engage seriously on the extermination of these pests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the situation that has been created by the amount of damage that rabbits are doing, I think it is up to the Minister to come to a decision at once and not put it off with the words &ldquo;in due course.&rdquo; I think that he should tell the House if he is in a position to do anything which would be of help in connection with this matter.  I do not know whether there is a tariff on rabbits or not, but I know they were never so plentiful as they are at present, and the amount of damage they are doing is creating a desperate situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say if complaints had been received by him, before I put down this question, with regard to the abnormally extensive damage that has been done this year by rabbits, and if he has considered a scheme for dealing with it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will realise that this is a matter of very <Col N="2397" /> grave importance.  In some parts of the country land has actually been poisoned by rabbits, with the result that it has been rendered unfit for any sort of pasture.  The position has become desperate for market gardeners and others engaged in the growing of early vegetables.  The matter is really a very serious one, and the Minister should take steps to get reports as to the amount of damage that has been done throughout the country.  If the Minister makes enquiries as to the conditions that prevail all over the country, I think he will find that the position is a serious one.  I can only speak for the part of the country that I know myself, and the situation there is certainly very serious.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if, in view of the fact that the trade in periwinkles is an all-year-round industry with a great many poor people on our coast, he will consider the advisability of removing the time limits within which bounties will be paid on the export of periwinkles and continue to pay the present rate of export bounty as long as periwinkles are subject to tariff in the English market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood from the Minister when the question of a bounty was raised that this was looked upon as a sort of seasonal trade, the same as that for oysters.  I should like to point out to the Minister that the trade in periwinkles goes on the whole year round.  There is no limit to it, and there is no close season for them.  This is a matter of very great concern to many poor people who live along the coast.</P>

      <P>I have notified Deputy Mulcahy that his amendment is out of order, as it involves an increased charge.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three critical periods in the section: (1), the Easter Week period; (2), the period from the 1st day of April, 1920 to say, July, 1921&mdash;the pre-Truce period; and (3), the period from the 1st July, 1922, to September, 1923&mdash;the period of the civil strife here.  As regards the amendment which I wish to insert in the section, while as you say, Sir, it is out of order by reason of the fact that it would increase the public expenditure and, therefore, can only properly be inserted by the Minister, I would ask the Minister to give sympathetic consideration to the case which the amendment is expected to meet.  The Minister proposes by this Bill to bring service against the State in the period during which there was civil strife here into line with service for the State. The general idea of the Bill then is that persons who served pre-Truce, whether in the Easter Week period, or the subsequent period, or both, and who also served on any side during the period of civil strife, shall become entitled to pensions.  The Minister has put forward an Estimate which shows that there is a very considerable amount of money involved in the increased pensions which the Government proposes to give.  The Minister is aware that when there was a difference of opinion on the Treaty question in 1921, there were men who had served in the Easter Week period, some of whom had given additional service in the period during the Anglo-Irish struggle up to July, 1921, but who did not take part in any way, through various reasons, including disillusionment, in the civil strife which took place afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2403" /> The facts are, I am sure, known to the Minister.  He will be aware that there is a small number of persons who were out in Easter Week, and who now find themselves, through one reason or another, in very bad circumstances. There is no need to emphasise the effect of the Easter Week rising on the subsequent developments in this country, and no need to emphasise the smallness of a number of persons involved in that rising.  The amendment which I wish to put into this section would have the effect that persons who actually gave military service in Easter Week would get credit towards a small pension for the equivalent period allotted in this Bill to the Easter Week period; and that where men had been out in Easter Week, and had also given service in the Anglo-Irish war, such men would get the period of service allowable for those periods in respect of a small pension. It would be a small pension which the giving credit for that service would involve.  I do not think the matter need be pressed on the Minister, but I do suggest that the Government which has taken the additional steps in extending the Pensions Act in the way in which the present Government has done it, could very easily and without increasing the public expenditure in any serious kind of way do a service to a certain number of men who are of a deserving class, particularly when there is such an enormous amount of public money available.  It would be a gracious and as I say would not be an unreasonable act, in view of the extension that has been made in the Military Service Pensions Act.  I would ask the Minister to give the matter favourable consideration.  It simply needs the insertion by the Minister of this amendment on the Report Stage.  I think it would give satisfaction to all sides of the House and would bring a certain amount of assistance to a small number of people who require that assistance.</P>

      <P>In supporting the case made by Deputy Mulcahy, I wish to appeal to the Minister and the Vice-President to give a pension to those people who gave service in Easter Week, and up to the Truce.  In the Pensions Act of 1924 that service was recognised, provided it continued in the National Army after July 1, 1922.  The purpose of this Bill is to follow on the same lines, but, as a condition for a pension, in addition to pre-Truce service, the applicant must show that he gave service on some side in the civil war.  There was a certain amount of reason, considering the time, in not extending that Pensions Act to people who fought against the Treaty in the civil war, but now, as there is to be an obliteration of that in the form of a Pensions Bill liquidated at a cost to the State of £80,000 yearly, surely the people who gave service from Easter Week onwards, to the outbreak of the civil war, are better entitled to a pension than those who gave similar service, and fought against the people's Government from 1922 onwards, and for five or six years piled 6d. in the £ on the rateable valuation of property in this country.  No one will begrudge a pension to those people who fought against the Treaty if it is going in any way to allay bitterness and to help the people who went out and fought, even against the Government of the day, who believed they were doing something that was in the best interests of this country.  If we are going to liquidate the animosity that was bred at that period, and since, by £80,000 a year, I would not vote against it.  I do not regret the introduction of this Bill, and, I do not regret the Vice-President's change of front.  But we are told from the Government Benches that the authority the Government has for everything is the authority of the people.  I do not know that the Government ever sought authority for this Bill, and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a small number of these people in the City of Dublin, and I know that they are in very bad circumstances.  The Vice-President knows many of them, and knows that they are in bad circumstances.  He knows that a deputation from them went before Dublin Corporation to ask that a percentage of labouring work should be allotted to them.  They did the same before Dublin County Council. I understand from these men that they waited upon the Minister for Defence this week and put their case before him.  Why should the present Government refuse these people the paltry pensions they are asking for?  Why leave one little running sore if we are healing the two big sores.  One has been healed, and the Government now proposes to heal the other.  Why leave this little scratch festering?  Why not help these poor fellows, who were in the small little band of 700 or 800 men who went out to fight for Irish freedom in Easter Week, 1916, and who carried the torch of freedom until the leaders divided amongst themselves?  The men did not divide.  Why not close the ranks now and give those who followed the leaders something to save them from the workhouse or from starvation, and enable them to live decently with <Col N="2406" /> their families?  Many of these people lost five or six of the best years of their lives.  They can never make up for that.  The lives they had to lead prevented them settling down; the opportunity to do so was not given them. It is but a small recompense for the State to give such men little pensions. I would not have them too little, and for good service the least any of them should get should be £1 a week.  If the country is not able to afford that, it is able to afford nothing.  After all, it is a poor country that cannot look after the people who fought to secure its freedom.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle of this Bill was to even things up, and to see that those who fought in the I.R.A. during the civil war, and who had pre-Truce service, either in 1916 or during the Black and Tan War, were treated in the same way as those who fought against the I.R.A. in the civil war.  The principle of the Act of 1924, as announced by Deputy Cosgrave, who was then President of the Executive Council, was to compensate for the long interruption of a man's life.  I take it that the then Government looked into the question of giving a pension for 1916 service alone, both at the time they were drafting the Bill and in the following years during which they were in office, and I take it that they came to the conclusion it should not be done.  At least, there was no attempt to introduce a Bill to provide pensions for those who had 1916 service alone.  I was not out in 1916 myself, but I have certainly the highest regard for men who went out in Dublin and started the fight for independence in our day.  I met representatives of the 1916 men, and I asked them to give me a list of their membership, and some indication of the financial circumstances in which they found themselves, so that we might have a look at the extent of the problem.  I feel that if a Pensions Bill was brought in for the 1916 men alone, there would be a further demand from those who had Black and Tan war service alone, followed by a demand from those who had civil war service alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2407" /> The previous Government had to draw a line somewhere, and this Government has also to draw a line. No matter where any Government draws a line within the capacity of the taxpayer to pay, there are bound to be hard cases left outside.  There are a lot of things that we would like to see done for people who suffered in different ways during the war of independence. Their hardship, I think, should be relieved, not by Government action, but by some sort of voluntary action on the part of a body to be organised.  If any Government frames a law to deal with cases of special hardship, it is always found that within the law there are cases to be dealt with which, from a human point of view, need not have been dealt with.  It is only a voluntary body that can differentiate and pick out the people really deserving of relief and leave out the cases that are not.</P>
    <P>I think myself that some sort of a benevolent organisation like the White Cross, or the old organisation started after 1916, should be established, and I am perfectly certain that all the people interested in the war of independence would subscribe and that that committee could pick out cases of hardship that accrued from the war of independence and deal with them.  At any rate, the question of dealing with 1916 alone does not arise on this Bill and can be dealt with on another day. As I said, I have asked representatives of the 1916 men in the city to give me a list so that we can look into the problem and see what is the best way to meet it, if it is an urgent one.</P>

      <P>I should like to know if the Minister contemplates doing anythink for those people excluded from the Bill.  I am sure that there is nobody on either side of the House, if he agrees substantially with this Bill and the 1924 Act, but sees that an injustice is being done by leaving out the men who are left out.  There is no use going into contentious matters on this Bill.  As I said on Section 3, it is a Bill that we hope will heal old wounds.  I hope, therefore, that the Minister will reconsider the position and not leave that running sore there still in connection with the pre-Truce period, including 1916.  The Minister in reply to Deputy Mulcahy said that it would cost a large sum.  I do not think that it would cost such a terrible sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personally, I do not like the line of approach which the Minister took as to asking these people about their circumstances. They are either entitled to a pension or they are not, and it would be very humiliating for them to ask them to make the case that they are on the poverty line.  I would appeal to the Minister to be more generous and deal with it as a matter of principle and right as to what the nation owes these men.  If, in his opinion, the nation owes them nothing, then do not give them a pension.  If he considers that the nation does owe them something, then give them a pension. As the period was short, as it was the most dangerous period, and as it was really the only national period, the period when we were fighting to put the English out, it is the period which will get the greatest recognition in history.

      <P>You will let loose 120 inspectors to mark cattle.  What is the need for marking them?  What need is there in a country where you have a surplus of cattle to hold them until they reach a certain standard of maturity? Obviously the marking means that, before a fixed date, they cannot be slaughtered.  If it were the opposite, that before the fixed date they must be slaughtered, I could see some sense in it, in the case of a surplus.  If we had a scarcity of cattle, then I could see reason in the Minister's marking, that before a fixed date they should not be slaughtered until they would be thoroughly matured.  If the public taste is satisfied to have them before they are matured, is it not all the better, particularly when we have a <Col N="2411" /> surplus?  Two or three months ago the Minister found himself authorising the slaughter of 120,000 calves.  If he was right then, what sense is there in asking inspectors to mark cattle so that they cannot be slaughtered until after a certain date?  I do not see how that serves the purpose that the Minister would seem to have in mind; in fact, I do not see what purpose it serves at all.</P>

      <P>It is little use making a Second Reading speech in this House, apparently.  That matter was very fully dealt with.  I do not know whether Deputy Belton's memory is a bit defective or whether he is inclined to prolong this discussion.  I said on Second Reading that there are likely to be times when there may be too many cattle offered for sale, but they could be disposed of if they were carried forward for a period, as happened last spring.  The same thing may occur in September or October; we may have too many at one particular period, and by keeping them back we may eventually be able to deal with them all.  These marking provisions will only come into operation from time to time.  I hope they will not come into operation at all, but it may be necessary to bring this part of the Bill into operation at certain times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The marking provisions will be necessary in case there is a surplus or a shortage of cattle.  In the event of a surplus, it will be necessary to allow butchers to slaughter only the best and most matured cattle, so that we may inflict the least amount of hardship.  It will be our endeavour to take the best finished cattle off the farmers' hands, if there is a surplus.  If there is a shortage there is also power in the Bill to limit the number that may be killed.  I do not know if that provision will be necessary, but it may be.  That covers the case in relation to the necessity of marking.  Suppose there are 10,000 cattle that the farmers would like to sell for slaughter, and we find we can use only 7,000, is it not reasonable that we would pick out the best finished cattle and let them be slaughtered first?  The man with the <Col N="2412" /> best finished cattle will get out first, and the man whose cattle will improve in three weeks will be enabled to dispose of them at the end of that period. That is the reason for the marking.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated already that the 120 would be necessary for the other provisions of this Act.  That is to say, that they would have to look after matters connected with the fixed prices; they would have to examine, when called upon to do so, any complaints in that respect, and also complaints in connection with the free meat part of the Bill.  These are the principal headings under which the inspectors will be required, if the marking provisions are not necessary.  If the marking provisions are brought in we will probably want 300 inspectors.  This estimate is on the basis that we are not going to introduce the marking provisions&mdash;that marking will not be necessary.  I hope it will not be necessary to operate this part of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that if we take as an instance 1,000 cattle that are for sale, and we want only 700, it is only fair to take the 700 that are the most mature, and to kill them, and then carry over our surplus to another period.  The Minister knows well that we always have a surplus of fat cattle.  He knows also that under the operation of this provision, if it is carried out mathematically, every beast suitable will be finished in the last batch, and consequently the surplus will be increased.  The feeders will come under the operation of the law of diminishing returns, and they will be feeding at a loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, instead of solving the problem that he has persuaded himself he has set out to solve, is only making the problem bigger, and is not solving it at all.  I still cannot see what useful purpose the marking of cattle will <Col N="2413" /> serve.  Take 10,000 fat cattle, each of which is within two and a-half or three per cent. of being finished cattle. Obviously they will feed more people than 10,000 cattle which are little better than three-quarters fat.  The Minister's reason, as I said before, would be perfectly sound, and I would agree with it, if we were short of cattle. But we have a surplus, and the longer we keep the cattle the more surplus we will have.  Instead of getting rid of the cattle before they are heavy, and contain so much meat, the Minister wants to stop us by marking, and allowing nothing but the finished beasts to be slaughtered.  He is there increasing the quantity, lowering the profit, and increasing the problem that he is trying to solve, namely, how this country is to dispose of its surplus fat stock. The Minister need not think that I want to stop or delay this Bill, but I simply cannot see any reason in this section.  The explanation he has given only puzzles me still further as to the common-sense actuating the Minister in putting up such a provision in any circumstances unless there is a of a meat shortage.  If there is a danger of a meat shortage, then every beast standing on four legs should be fed up to the maximum so as to produce the maximum amount of meat. No beast should be killed while he is capable of being increased by another cwt. or even by 10 lbs.  In view of the existing surplus the Minister is trying to get rid of 120,000 calves, throwing them into a pit, and getting 6d. per animal for their skins.  This section is the most illogical proposal I ever heard put forward by any Minister.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Minister I do not want in any way to obstruct this Bill, but as one who will be affected I am very much interested in it.  On the question of marking of cattle, what is going to happen in the case of the second and third-class cattle?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="AlexHaslett" hpid="Mr. Haslett Mr. Haslett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>But &ldquo;finished&rdquo; does not constitute first-class quality beef; you may have a beast of which you may never make first quality.  I am <Col N="2414" /> merely looking for information in this matter.  When the butcher comes he will want the best, and will take the best.  Anticipating a surplus, the inspector says these may wait as they are second and third-class.  But the owner may not be able to improve those beasts so as to make the best out of them, and so he carries them over. Then something may happen as happened last winter when the restrictions came out.  A number of us had a number of fat cattle, and expected to get licences.  The result was that the cattle were, as they say in farmer's language, &ldquo;eating their heads off.&rdquo;  We had to dispose of them for anything we could get, and, indeed, practically gave them away.  If we are to have these cattle, and feed them, for another two months, we will have to carry them over, and we will be losing on them all the time.</P>

      <P>I am looking for information, and I am trying to understand this section.  I would be glad to see an end of the Bill, one way or another, and so would more than I.  But I cannot see while we have a surplus of cattle, the necessity for the marking of them in order to keep them up to the maximum limit.  Any attempt the Minister has made to clarify that does <Col N="2415" /> not convince me.  Does not the Minister agree that the longer you keep cattle and finish them the more meat there will be?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's problem is one of surplus meat.  Is he not increasing his problem the more meat he has?  When there is danger of an increased surplus any practical man will tell you that to get rid of your cattle before that stage will leave you with more money.  Why charge something upon the owners of that stock by making them keep their cattle for a certain period?  If they do so they are losing money and your problem is only made bigger.  I think that is quite clear.  I do not want to corner the Minister on it; it is a matter of business. There are two Deputies here with more practical experience of the live stock business than I have&mdash; Deputy Curran and Deputy Haslett.  I am sure they will corroborate what I am saying.  It is seldom the really finished article passes into the last stage here.  What better proof have you than this, namely, that beef was never as big an industry as store cattle. In many cases the stuff we were selling as beef here was bought by the Scottish buyers, kept for six or eight weeks, and then turned out on the market as best British beef.  Ask any practical man in this country who knows the English market and he will tell you the best Irish beef is sold before slaughtered. Opportunity and experience, locality and time to dispose of the article brings the feeder the most money. Now, the Minister is increasing his problem.  He is depriving the producers or the farmers of an opportunity to sell their stock at a time that, in their opinion, will pay them best. The Minister wants to force them, in some circumstances that I cannot visualise here, to keep them longer, so that they may put on more meat, whereas his problem is that we want to get rid of them.</P>

It is impossible for Deputy Belton to convince me that he is right, and I am sure that it is equally impossible for me to convince him that I am right.  However, if a man had 1,000 cattle and only 500 were to be killed this week, is it not only fair to allow a man the opportunity to get out?</P>

I want to set the producer the price he would ordinarily get for his cattle if the quota had not been brought in against us.  Previous to the quota being introduced there had to be deducted from the price that our cattle made in England the cost of transit and commission expenses as between this country and Great Britain; in addition to that there had to be deducted the difference between the tariff imposed by the British and the bounty we gave.  Bearing these things in mind, the price will be fixed at the export value of the cattle or at the nearest possible figure to the export value of the cattle.</P>

      <P>Let us take an example, if you like.  A beast sold in Birkenhead, say, at £16&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>Or so much per cwt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would rather take it the other way.  I am not quick enough that way.  Take it, say, at £16.  The ordinary expenses on that beast, previous to the tariff, were about £2. That was the difference then between the Birkenhead and Dublin markets. <Col N="2421" /> That brought the price of the beast down to £14.  Off that £14 had to be deducted the difference between the tariff of £6 and the bounty of 35/-. That was £4 5s.  So that that brings the price of the beast really down to £9 15s. to-day.  I will go back to the cwt. calculation, if you like.  We will take it that the £16 beast weighed 8 cwt.  Whatever price was to be fixed on the 8 cwt. beast would be roughly the price per cwt.  This price would not be fixed on one beast, but on a number.  In that way the person who has a licence would find that that licence is of no value to him other than the ordinary value of the exported cattle.  I believe that a man made, perhaps, 3/- or 5/- a head on the export of cattle, and he sometimes lost.  The person who has a licence will not be able to sell it then for 20/- or 30/-.  I do not know if that explanation will satisfy the Deputy or whether it makes it clear to the House.</P>

      <P>That is really the question.  Will not the producers want a fair price as well as anybody else? Does the Minister think that&mdash;taking the tariff and the bounty&mdash;that taking this £4 5s. off the price of the beast will leave the farmer a fair price?  I ask this, having regard to the fact that the Minister and his supporters in this House have been telling the people that the British have no use for beef any longer.  But now the Minister turns around and says that the farmers here should take £4 5s. for the beast less than they have been getting or that they would get but for the tariff.  In view of the fact that the British Government themselves have introduced a Bill to enable them to pay the producers of beef in Great Britain what they consider a fair price for it, does the Minister think that the farmers here are being fairly treated?  I tell the Minister that his calculation is not a fair calculation, and that it should be compiled on some other basis than <Col N="2422" /> the basis he has put before us this evening.  I am sure the Minister himself knows that too.</P>

      <P>I think it is unfair in a way for the Deputy to raise that point on this section.  I could argue against him.  If the Deputy wants the question of the £4 5s. 0d. remedied, what he should really do is ask for a higher bounty.  We can only operate this Bill by fixing the export price of the cattle. We cannot operate this Bill by fixing a higher price for export.  Take butter, for instance.  We could not fix a higher price for butter here for export than the price at home.  If you want to raise the price of cattle then the Deputy ought to argue the case by saying that the levy and the bounty is too low and ask that the bounty should be raised.  We are only discussing how this section should be operated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I can follow Deputy Curran's reasoning in this matter.  The home price will be determined by what the beast actually makes in the outside market.  If the home price is raised higher, then there would be no inducement to export the cattle.  Is the Minister sanguine about the operation of the export price and the carrying out of it?  It would be all right if there were a shortage.  But we have a surplus and we are likely to have a surplus for some time to come. Possibly the dealers and maybe the farmers are very ingenious.  I do not see that this section will be very satisfactorily worked.  Take, for instance, a licensed butcher who goes to buy cattle.  The Minister said in his Second Reading speech that the number of grades would be limited. He cannot have a whole lot of grades. Now, the butcher, the would-be purchaser, says to the farmer: &ldquo;Well, your cattle will suit me, but there is a number of them there that are not worth the price fixed to me.&rdquo;  Suppose, for example, that the price is fixed at 25/- and the butcher says they are not worth more than 22/- or 23/- to him and the farmer wants to sell the cattle at that price, what is going to happen?  What is to prevent the farmer saying: &ldquo;I will give you a certain figure as luck-penny&rdquo;?  That is <Col N="2423" /> one of the loopholes in the Bill and I am not very sanguine about how it will work out.  I put it to the Minister to say if he is hopeful of carrying out this minimum price satisfactorily.</P>

      <P>I followed the Minister's reasoning to-day and yesterday. I think he dealt with this matter at some length on the Second Reading.  I see his reasoning all right.  I see the two problems with which he is confronted. One is the fixing of a price and the other problem is the one that has been mentioned already&mdash;a thing that runs through the whole Bill&mdash;the surplus.  The Minister separates the two knocks that the trade has got. This Bill is only going to recoup the farmer for part of the second knock and does not touch the first knock at all.  The first knock was the British tariff.  I think I interpret the Minister aright when I say&mdash;I need only repeat his words&mdash;that he is not touching that at all.  He is not touching the loss inflicted by the British tariff but he proposes in this Bill to meet the situation that arises from the quota, but so far as I have read the Bill he has not dealt with the surplus.  We shall leave that aside for the moment and we shall deal with the price and the formula upon which the Minister is going to work to fix the price.  The Minister cannot fix any meat price, nor is any meat price fixed by any statistician in the world, except in relation to feeding prices, cereal prices.  He will find that back to the beginning of records on cereals and meats, that they go up and down together in double harness.  The formula that the Minister adopts for cereals, he must adopt for meat.  He is confronted with this, that if the <Col N="2424" /> farmer is going to get no remedy under this Bill or any other Bill for the British tariff&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>If he is not going to get it, then that position must be reflected in the price of oats and barley.  You cannot get away from that.  I quote the following figures from a reputable journal, perhaps the most reputable in the world, the <i>Economist</i>, dated August 4th, the current number.  Taking cereals and meat in 1927 at a price of 100, they rise and fall together, and on September the 18th, 1931, the figure is shown as 64.5, as against 100 in 1927. In April, 1934, the figure was 67.8; in July, 1934, 73, and in August, 1934, 73.3. The Minister is going to regulate his meat price, as he told us a moment ago, by taking the Birkenhead price, deducting from that £2 for the cost of shipping the beast and other sundry charges, and then taking £4 5s. off to represent the difference between the tariff and the bounty.  He is going to fix his price at that figure.  Why take the £4 5s. off, if you want to do justice? Is not the price, before that amount is deducted, the level of prices that would obtain here if we had no economic war?  Where is your moral right now to collect the annuities if you insist that the farmer must pay that £4 5s.?  The consumer, the butcher and all the rest, who are not producers of meat, must get meat at a rate of £4 5s. per beast of 10 cwt. live weight, roughly, less than the world market price.  The Minister knows my views on the question of rates and annuities.  We are not going to discuss that question now, but I am going to say that there is no man on these benches who will not go out and tell the farmers to pay their rates and annuities immediately&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in this way, a Chinn Comhairle.  The Minister, in fixing his minimum price for meat, through the sale of which annuities and rates can only be paid, should fix that minimum <Col N="2425" /> price at the figure that would rule here if there was no economic war&mdash;in other words, if England were not collecting the annuities.  If he can take the price at Birkenhead as his formula and deduct the cost of transit and sundry charges, and forget about the £6 tariff, he then would have the price that people would have to pay for meat if the economic war were not on.  If there are people in this country who want the economic war to go on, let it go on, but let this one section which is producing meat not have to bear £4 5s. per beast of a loss.  Fix the standard price with due regard to the world price, apart from any question of a tariff, and there is no man in this country has any moral right to withhold his rates or annuities from the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I challenge the Minister to show the equity of the basis on which he proposes to fix his prices now.  The economic war is there.  It is a fact that a tariff of £6 has to be paid on each beast.  True, the Minister comes in with a bounty of 35/-, leaving a net loss of £4 5s. 0d. per beast.  Why is that to remain?  Is not that reducing the level of prices here as regulated by the world market?  Is it not reducing, on the average, the wholesale price of ten cwt., live weight, of beef by £4 5s.?  The rest of the community get the benefit of that.  Why does the Minister not remedy that?  Why does he not take that into account in fixing the standard price?  Where is the equity in fixing a price which makes the producer carry that loss?  The Minister comes along and says &ldquo;Our one concern is to help the farmer, the producer.  The £1 per beast will be borne by the butcher.&rdquo;  Of course, it will not be borne by the butcher.  Then, the producer has to bear the £4 5s. to which I have already referred.  The Minister, coming along to help out the producer, fixes a price which perpetuates that fixed loss per beast to the producer and he makes no bones about it.  He makes no apology for standardising the price of that fixed loss.  Then he wants the butcher to pay £1 into the revenue.  This is the way that the problem is going to be solved. If the Minister wants to tackle this <Col N="2426" /> problem seriously and wants to start by fixing prices, let him fix a price based on world market prices and deduct the expenses that we must incur by sending our stuff into the world market.  Let him remember that if he fixes that price on anything else, everything grown must bear that loss of £4 10s. per beast.  It is attempting the ridiculous and the impossible to separate the price of feeding stuffs from the price of beef.  It is nothing more than saying that you will charge a high price for cloth to make a suit but that the suit will be cheaper.  You must transmit the loss due to that British tariff to your cultivated crops-oats, barley, feeding potatoes and roots. Their price must be reduced by that amount.  Unless the Minister is going to fix this figure at the world price, less the cost of getting into the world's market place, he is going to devalue the market price of every crop grown on Irish soil while the economic war lasts.  I do not want to discuss the economic war and I am not discussing it.  I am discussing its effects and those effects should not be ignored in fixing the price of our meat.  By fixing the price of our meat at the world price everybody will bear a fair share of the burden of the fight.  Nobody will have more right than another to squeal.  The Minister has admitted that the result of the British tariff is not dealt with under this Bill.  He suggested to Deputy Curran that the only way by which that problem could be tackled would be to increase the bounty. Increasing the bounty would not affect the case at all.  An increase in the bounty would affect the return from the beef we export but it would not affect the price of the beef for home consumption.  The price will remain that which the Minister will fix, according to his formula, but if the bounty is cut out altogether, if our Government pays the British tariff and fixes the price at the world price, less the charges of sending over, then the people who export will get the world price and the people who consume at home will have to pay the world price and no more.  In the case of butter, they are paying more than the world price.  There is no analogy between <Col N="2427" /> the two things.  What we want done is to have the price fixed at the world price, less the cost of sending our stuff into the world market.  In other words, to keep the level of the home meat market at the world level, less the charge of sending out our stuff.  If the Government want an equitable distribution of responsibility, let them pay the British tariff and fix their price at the world price.  If the Minister neglects to do that, the country must inevitably collapse.  It cannot carry on. I should like to have reasons from the Minister as to why he is deliberately refusing to fix the price at the world price, less the charges of transportation.</P>

We have to suffer speeches about world prices, primary products, raw materials, and finished products from a man who knows nothing about them.  A child going to school would understand these economic questions better than does Deputy Belton.  Why does not the Deputy sit down and study a Bill like this so that he will know what he is talking about?  How could you fix a price that would not be the same as the export price&mdash;whatever the export price may be?  Whether or not the export price is subject to a tariff or a bounty, we must operate this Bill at the export price.  I think that Deputy Curran understood me perfectly when I said that.

      <P>This section cannot be operated unless we fix the price at the export price.  If the Deputy wants to have export prices raised to what they would be if there were no tariff, then he should agitate for a bounty or a settlement of the economic war and do away with the tariff.  If the tariff were done away with, then we would operate this section at export prices, paying no tariff.  Suppose the tariff is increased, then we must operate this section at the price here, paying the full amount, whatever it may be.  What we pay in tariff and what the bounty is going to be is quite a different problem. That is a problem in itself and should be argued seperately.  It was argued very often here, and it should hardly be necessary to argue it on this section.  I wish the Deputy would understand that the question as to whether the farmer is going to get enough for his cattle or not cannot be raised on this section.  All that can be raised on this section is the question the Deputy has not raised&mdash;whether it is possible to operate the section or not.  Surely there is only one way of operating it.  That is to get the best export price that can be got after paying the tariff, if there is a tariff, and after getting the bounty, if there is a bounty.  If these factors are present, they must be taken into account in operating the fixed price.  Whether they should be there or not is a different question and should be argued on another section, if argued at all on this Bill.  The Deputy should not take advantage of every section of this Bill to make that economic speech, which I regard as the greatest nonsense but which the Deputy, no doubt, regards as being a very profound pronouncement from the Opposition benches.  We do not object to it, but we are sick of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with minimum prices.  I am in agreement with the Deputies, who contended that the minimum price, whatever it will be &mdash;I am not going to refer to it at any great length&mdash;will not be a fair price. I do not think that the Minister, by means of this Bill or any other Bill like it, can create that price, having regard to the cost of production.  The Minister is attempting in this Bill to fix minimum prices for fat cattle.  The question arises on this section how that is to be brought about.  If we were to arrive at a fixed price, at a price that would please everybody and that would put an end to the tariffs and all that, then there would be no necessity for this Bill as far as prices are concerned, because they would regulate themselves. But, unfortunately, that is not the case, and, therefore, this Bill is necessary.</P>
      <P>This section deals with minimum prices.  The question that agitates me is this: is the farmer guaranteed the minimum price, whatever it is?  Is there any certainty that the seller of cattle will get the minimum price?  To me it appears doubtful from my reading of this section.  Take the feeder of grass cattle.  The cattle will be marked by an inspector to be sold at various periods.  I do not grumble at that. There will at least be this disability in some cases: that a man will have his cattle marked for sale at a late date, possibly at the end of the grass season, but he will have no certainty under this or any other section of the Bill that he is going to sell them at any price, not even at the minimum price. Grass cattle may, at a certain date, have deteriorated to such an extent that when the winter season sets in no butcher will want to buy them, marked or unmarked.  In such a case, if cattle are marked for sale at a late date, the owner has no certainty that he will be able to sell them at the minimum price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take another case.  The minimum price is to be fixed on a certain basis, whether by weight, hand or otherwise. The Minister said on the Second Reading that it would be by weight where there were facilities for weighing them, but that in other cases it would be by hand, or, to put it another way, by <Col N="2430" /> guesswork, the inspector or supervisor to determine the weight of the animal in that way.  Some of us on this side of the House argued that to determine the weight of an animal by hand, in other words, by guesswork, was not a very easy matter.  There are very few men in this country capable of accurately determining the weight of a beast by hand.  I do not know if there is one.  Some of the most prominent cattle buyers in the country will tell you that they could not do it, but in this Bill, in the absence of a weighing machine, an inspector or supervisor is to be the determining factor as to the weight of an animal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 23 fixes the basis of whether it is to be by weight, hand or otherwise.  I am trying to argue what the consequences will be of fixing the weight by guesswork.  If, by any possible chance, the inspector was a superman, and in determining the weight of the beast by hand arrived at a figure that was fairly correct, there is still no guarantee that the farmer can sell the beast, because when the butcher comes along he might say that the weight put upon the beast by the inspector is not correct, and there is no compulsion on the butcher to buy.  If the butcher thinks that the weight of the beast has been overestimated, he will leave the beast severely alone.  There is no compulsion on him or on anybody else to buy. He will not take the beast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this section somebody spoke about collusion.  This leaves everything open to collusion.  In some cases, if a man is to sell, he has got to have collusion with the butcher, but I am afraid he will not be able to have that because the butcher, bearing in mind the provisions of this measure, will be afraid to trade with him by any underhand means, fearing that the consequences of his action, or of his good nature if you like, may fall on him six or eight months afterwards; that he may be prosecuted for buying a beast under the stipulated weight.  There is no guarantee whatever under this Bill that the owners of cattle are going to <Col N="2431" /> get even the minimum price.  I doubt if it could be arranged as a certainty that they would get it, even if it were possible for the Minister or anybody else to so arrange it.</P>
    <P>These are the two types of cases that I want to deal with particularly.  The first is that of the man with grass cattle which may be marked for sale at a late date.  He is not being given any security that he will be able to sell at any price.  Then there is the case of the man who sells cattle by weight, the weight being determined by the inspector.  It may be right or it may be wrong.  There is no compulsion on the butcher to buy and it is almost certain that he will not buy if the cattle are graded an ounce too high.  One thing is absolutely certain and it is this: that if a farmer does sell his cattle, the weight being determined by guesswork, he will sell them at a loss, because unless the beast is definitely graded at a less weight than it really is, no butcher will touch him, and if the error happens to be on the other side, the butcher will also leave the animal severely alone, so that the odds are against the farmer getting even the minimum price.  This Bill aims at getting a certain minimum price for the farmer.  What we want to see in it is the certainty that farmers will get that minimum price, but as the Bill stands there is no such certainty.</P>

The price which he is going to fix for beef and mutton is of great importance to the whole economic position of the country. Eighty per cent. of all the stuff that can be produced in this country must be consumed as food for live stock. Eighty to 90 per cent. of the produce of the soil of this country &mdash;whether you plough it or whether you graze it; whether you are a tillage farmer like the Minister, who does not till; whether you are a <Col N="2434" /> rancher, as I am accused of being, but I till all; it does not matter which type of farmer you are, or what you produce &mdash;must be fed as animal food.

      <P>How does the Minister expect to fix the basis by hand?  How can that be done?  I am sticking to the words of the section&mdash;&ldquo;fixing the basis, whether by weight, by hand, or otherwise, on which the price of cattle is to be calculated.&rdquo;  I take this section and this Bill as meaning that it is the intention of the Minister to use the powers which he has under the words which he puts in the Bill.  I am just asking the Minister how he is going to fix the basis by hand?  I do not see how the Minister can do it, and I should like an explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister replies I should like to say that I think the same thing is agitating everybody's mind.  The Minister was understood to say in introducing this Bill that, generally speaking, there is throughout the country very little facility of any kind for selling cattle by weight. Most of the cattle, as the Minister knows, are sold by hand or on foot. A bargain is struck between the buyer and seller, and a price is placed on the weight as they guess it.  Under this Bill they must either be bought by weight or by hand.  Otherwise there must be a standard arrived at as to the weight or the price of a beast.  I am sure the Minister had something in mind before these sections were drafted, and he might <Col N="2437" /> give us the benefit of the information. Deputies on all sides appear to be very much in the dark as to how this is to be done.  If the sale is by weight I presume it will be per cwt. according to the market quotation.  If by hand will it be by the height or girth?  The price must have some basis, and while the Minister has talked of a fixed basis, he has not given any indication of what it will be.  It is important that it should be known if there is to be a possibility of working the Bill.  Sub-section (3) prescribes that in any bargain made the buyer and the seller can act only on the basis laid down. It will not be sufficient for a buyer to offer £5 or £10 for a beast.  There must be a staple agreement based on something. I understand that some documents must be interchanged because a register of sales must be kept.  The time-honoured custom of buying in the open market and coming to a perfect understanding is going to be ended by this section.  In sub-section (4) there is a little matter introduced that might be made reciprocal.  If a butcher buys a beast from a farmer or a grazier and gives less than the minimum price, he is, in the first place, committing an offence in doing so and, in the second place, the farmer can recover the difference between the price paid and the fixed price, as a civil debt.  But supposing that the butcher paid too much, he is not able to recover the difference.  In equity, this section ought to cut both ways, and if a man pays too much there should be some power to get back the difference. The whole section appears to want clarifying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated on the Second Reading that in cities and towns where there are facilities available weighing will be compulsory in the sale of cattle for slaughter.  They will be sold by weight and the fixed price will be so much per cwt.  There are areas where we know scales are not available, and for these we will have to make other regulations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are available in most <Col N="2438" /> of the big towns and in other places. We know that in the Department of Agriculture because we got particulars. Apart from that there are two ways of dealing with the matter.  There is one way, letting an inspector go to the market and getting the butcher and the seller to agree to a certain weight. They will not have to make any bargain about the price.  There will be a fixed price.  The inspector will have to agree about the weight, or alternatively, he may wait until the beast is killed and have the deadweight, so that we would have a fixed price for dead as well as live weight.  In the end it works out that the price will be by weight.  We could not possibly have it by hand.</P>

How can <Col N="2439" /> he turn round and say that the provisions of the Bill are being carried out? Will not the whole thing be open to grave fraud, if they are so inclined, on the part of butchers?  What is to prevent a butcher saying that he had only two beasts weighing 6 cwt. each, when he might have one weighing 6 cwt. and another weighing 8 cwt.?  I cannot see how the section can be properly carried out unless an inspector is always present to see that a particular beast is the beast that he had seen previously.  I will give an example.  I happen to be chairman of a mental hospital committee which made regulations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am satisfied with the position, whatever the Minister thinks. I have nothing to regret in connection with my association with the position I occupy there, and I think the Minister would be well advised to leave these cheap remarks out when we are discussing the Bill.  I tried to keep to the section.  It would be well if the Minister would do the same thing.  I want to put the position to him as I see it.  Regulations were made by that committee so that every beast should be sent in for inspection and a mark was put on it for identification purposes. If that was not done, nothing could prevent a beast being exchanged after inspection.  The same thing could happen under this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of a beast being bought by dead weight, as far as I can see, it would be almost necessary for a farmer to be present at the weighing and killing.  Otherwise he would have grave doubts in his mind that he was being &ldquo;had.&rdquo;  In the other <Col N="2440" /> case it would be unfair to the inspector. I see the Minister's point, and I agree that there is something in it, but I cannot see how any inspector could fulfil the task placed upon him.  A sale may be by hand or by live weight.  Many farmers have 20 or 30 cattle, and many have more.  Men with 20 or 30 cattle will sell one or two at a time, and their neighbours will do the same, so that the poor inspector would be running day and night in order to carry out his duties properly.  It would be impossible for him to do so, as the number of inspectors specified would not be sufficient to do the work.</P>

If a flock of sheep come into Ballinlough how are you to know when these sheep stopped grazing along the roads, or how are you to know when they were taken off grass?  Unless they were taken off grass within the prescribed number of hours before they started on the road, there will be a conflict with the regulations, whereas if a butcher says to an inspector that it is unreasonable to fix the live weight price for a beast, because the animal had just got a huge feed, the inspector will say that the equivalent dead weight price is so much, buy it at the alternative prices, live weight so much per cwt., dead weight so much per cwt.</P>

      <P>The question was raised as to whether the restriction on the place of slaughter meant that you could not have a slaughterhouse on the same premises as you had a shop for retail distribution.  There is another section which makes provision that the business of slaughtering and distribution will not be carried on in the same place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <P>Section 9 (3) says: &ldquo;Premises registered in the register of slaughtering premises shall not be capable of being registered in the register of victualling premises&rdquo; and <i>vice versa.</i>  Is the Minister satisfied that the word &ldquo;premises&rdquo; there will not have a wider meaning than one apartment under a given roof?  I have no doubt whatever that licensed premises means any part of the building in respect to which there is a licence to sell alcoholic liquor and to which there is free access from the licensed part.  For instance, if you have a licensed house and a door freely communicating <Col N="2442" /> with the residential portion the whole house is licensed and the only way you could exempt the residential portion from the licence is to seal up the door and have two separate entrances.  I submit that in this case you will find, unless extensive structural alterations are carried out in most of the existing butchers' shops, that no butcher will be able to get registration as a victualler and as a slaughterer in respect of the premises which he at present occupies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance can probably give us valuable information in this regard.  I think I am right in saying that a licensed premises under the excise provisions is the whole structure under one roof which is accessible all through.  Unless you have two separate entrances for two different parts of one house the whole house is licensed if any part of it is licensed.  That will probably be the legal precedent followed in defining &ldquo;premises.&rdquo;  Sub-section (3) of Section 9 says: &ldquo;Premises registered in the register of slaughtering premises shall not be capable of being registered in the register of victualling premises....&rdquo; We know the Minister's mind and his intention and therefore I do not make a point on this, beyond saying that I think it is a matter the Minister should take counsel about between this and the time he will be dealing with this measure in the Seanad and, if necessary, introduce an amendment which will clearly define what is in his mind.  I take it what is in the Minister's mind is that you cannot slaughter a beast on the floor of the shop.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 20 says nothing about selling the meat.  It says you cannot slaughter unless it is marked when the marking provisions are in force.  If a beast breaks a leg, it can be brought in to the butcher to slaughter although not marked.  There is nothing to say that he cannot sell the meat.  There is nothing against that.</P>

      <P>This deals with the power of the Minister to prohibit the export of cattle to an external market, and the only market which he ordinarily could prohibit us from exporting cattle to is the British market.  It is true <Col N="2444" /> that he could prohibit us from exporting cattle to Germany, but I venture to say that it will require very little inducement to anybody who can sell his cattle anywhere else on the face of God's earth to refrain from selling cattle in Germany at the price Irish cattle command in Germany at the present time, and have commanded for the last two years.  What strikes me particularly about this section is the commentary it affords on the powers the Minister has in connection with the bacon trade.  We are told that this market, which he seeks power to prohibit us from exporting cattle to, is worthless, and at the moment he is telling us that he is sending us letters exhorting us to ship all the bacon we can during those months to the British market.  Why?  For fear we will lose it.  I saw a letter from the Minister about a week ago saying that he besought every bacon factory to ship every available cwt. of bacon during the months of June, July and August.</P>

      <P>I merely want to place it on record that while the Minister is explaining the steps that may be necessary&mdash;even the prohibition of exports to this market are, according to him, justified because the market is of trivial value&mdash;at the same time he is telling us in private correspondence that we must ship every hundredweight of bacon we can, irrespective of the effect on the prices to the home consumer, in order to preserve this market that we are to value at the snap of our fingers when we come to consider Section 26 of this Bill.  When you are face to face with a situation of that kind, when neither the Minister nor anybody else here knows what is in the Minister's mind, it becomes extremely difficult to evaluate a section of this character.  If there were any constructive scheme in the Minister's mind and into that scheme he could fit the alleged necessity for this right to prohibit exports, one could consider it on its merits; but when you find that such powers are exercised and diametrically contradictory according to whatever political wind may be blowing, then you realise that to place such powers in the hands of the present Minister is nothing less than suicidal. I can remember the Minister telling us repeatedly that he was going to build up a structure here behind the bacon tariff which would make us absolutely independent of all the markets of the world.  I have his letter before me now telling me that the whole future of the pig industry in this country depends upon that market.</P>

      <P>The Minister is now asking us to give him power to prohibit exports of cattle.  On Monday he will tell us he will prohibit all exports because the British market does not matter a rap; and on Tuesday he will be telling us that it is of vital urgency to ship every beast in order to fill the quota Great Britain is allowing us.  When you are dealing with a man of that kind, with a weathercock mind, who makes one declaration on Monday and <Col N="2446" /> declares it to be the only patriotic thing one can do to lend a hand in starving John Bull into submission, and on Tuesday says the only patriotic thing is to ship all of this commodity one can lay hands on, it is nothing less than suicidal to give him the discretion he seeks in this section.  If he wants to make orders prohibiting the export of cattle, let him get the consent of Dáil Eireann.  I venture to say that when he does come to Dáil Eireann looking for an <i>ad hoc</i> resolution to prohibit the export of cattle or anything else, he will not be able to tell the reason why except that President de Valera sent him a message that this was the correct political gesture to make at the moment and that there was an obligation on him to exhort people to export agricultural produce to the extent of the quota.  Unfortunately in this case the Minister had to send out a confidential circular and I am happy to be able to say that I have been able to expose it.</P>

We said that just the same as we say Cumann na nGaedheal has gone and Fine Gael has gone.  They are going, but we say they are gone, and that is only an expression.

When the British announced, on the 20th September last, that there would be a quota reducing the numbers of Free State fat cattle in the following three months that Britain would allow in as compared with the previous year, our Minister for Agriculture, playing the strong man, retaliated by saying &ldquo;We will give the British none.&rdquo;  Of course, that joke did not last long.  If it had lasted long, neither the Minister nor the Ministry would last long.  They had to give way because there was no outlet, and the decision come to was that the Minister had to introduce this Bill.  It is not in consequence of the tariffs, because on the preceding section he informed the House that this Bill was not dealing with tariffs at all, but with the quota position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has not given any reason why he should seek such powers. England would not want such powers to prohibit the export of her cotton trade.  France would not think of seeking powers to prohibit the export of wines or artificial manures.  The German Government would not think of taking power to prohibit the export of iron or of coal or various other articles.  Similarly, the American Government would not look for such powers.  The one thing that we have to export is cattle, and the way we solve our problems in connection with it is that the Minister for Agriculture asks the House, solemnly, to prohibit the export of cattle.  He told us in his speech on the Second Reading that what prompted him to introduce this Bill was to find a market for our surplus fat cattle, and then he asks for power to prohibit the export of fat cattle.  I do not think that outside Grangegorman Mental Home there was ever heard such a proposal.  However, <Col N="2451" /> it is all of a piece with the rest of the Bill.  The Minister said he wanted power to prohibit the export of cattle from certain areas and to encourage it from other areas.  The John Browns will be dug out, through his Bill, and the Attorney-General, who has just entered the House, will be able to supply whatever the Minister forgets, and the John Browns and the Paddy Killeens will again turn up.  Of course, it is a good way to use economic distress for political advantage.  If it were on the eve of an election, anyone that wanted to export cattle from Wexford or Wicklow would be facilitated.</P>

      <P>Speaking on the section: power is given under this section to the Minister, wherever an export prohibition order is in force, to issue an export licence, if he so thinks fit, to any person to export a particular animal specified in the licence to which such export prohibition order applies. The brazen effrontery of the Minister for Industry and Commerce has been used repeatedly here in this House to meet reasonable representations in respect of the setting up of a register of licencees.  That brazen effrontery has been used to assert that there was no good reason for the establishment of such a register.  Would the Minister for Agriculture venture to maintain that a considerable amount of public dissatisfaction has not manifested itself in regard to the administration <Col N="2452" /> of the export licences for cattle that he has been administering for some time?</P>

Thanks to the Minister, they have found their homes in the ranks of Fianna Fáil and have learned to expect everything from Fianna Fáil, and are getting it.  But the Minister will know that, whether his benevolence is being exercised on behalf of the bailiff or of his own political supporters, from a variety at least of his own supporters complaints have reached him about this.  Again and again the Minister's attention must have been drawn to the trafficking that is going on in licences.  He must be aware of cases where men sold those licences, for a consideration, to somebody else.  His attention must have been drawn to the fact that it has been manifest to everybody that persons, who were notoriously supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party, could get, <Col N="2453" /> over and above whatever licences they were entitled to, a very substantial share of that surplus of licences which remained in the hands of the Minister for Agriculture.  It is hardly necessary to explain that these individuals, who are getting that special consideration, did not come to me to tell me about it. The only source of information to which I can apply is the people who did not get licences.</P>

At present a man comes to me in Donegal and says: &ldquo;I have applied for licences again and again and have got, perhaps, two; yet I met So-and-So in the fair, who never shipped a beast, and he has got a dozen or twenty licences, and he was selling licences in the fair.&rdquo;  There is no use in my going and asking the person concerned if that is true or not.  I have no means of finding out.  The only possible thing I can do is to raise it here in the House.  I shall be told by the Minister that these are general charges, and I shall be asked to state the full particulars and they will be investigated; but the full particulars are not investigated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret, Sir, that I have been led into disorder by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I am simply asking the Minister for Agriculture to provide everybody with a weapon whereby they may allay suspicion or misapprehension in regard to those licences.  That weapon is to prepare and make public a register in which there would be a record of everybody's licences.  In that way, everybody will know what is being done, and if a man goes into the cattle exporting business he will know that that information will be available to everybody in the trade, and he will know, having gone into the business willingly, that there will be a public register of his transactions and that he is liable to have the matter of the licences granted to him raised, by name, here in this House, and that the Minister will be questioned as to why somebody got licences when his neighbour did not get them.  If that were done, the Minister would be able to say that if So-and-So wants additional licences, he has got to remember that if he gets them the matter, almost certainly, will be raised in Dáil Eireann, and his business thrashed out across the floor of the House.  The Minister also would have the added relief that anyone, who would attempt to approach him with a corrupt proposal for more licences than he is entitled to, would know that there was no use in asking him, because all the licences have to be recorded on a public register where everybody can examine them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have warned the Minister that so long as these transactions in connection with the issue of licences are hidden under a veil of secrecy, so long will there be public distrust and public suspicion; and that the only remedy and the only way to allay that suspicion and that distrust is to give full publicity to every licence issued and to the conditions attaching thereto.  This <Col N="2455" /> licensing provision under Section 28 is more drastic than any I have seen so far, because in this case the Minister may, &ldquo;whenever an export prohibition order is in force, if he so thinks fit, issue to any person a licence in the prescribed form to export a particular animal specified in such licence to which such export prohibition order applies, and may attach to such licence such conditions and limitations (including conditions as to the route by which the animal is to be exported) as the Minister shall think proper and shall specify in such licence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is it necessary to elaborate the urgent necessity of making the terms and conditions of licences that will be issued under that section public?  Suppose a shipping company gets into some labour trouble and their cattle shipments fall off for some entirely ulterior reason, the first thing that will spring to their mind is that the Labour Party have brought pressure to bear upon the Minister for Agriculture, to impose a condition that cattle will be shipped by another route and the Minister will be immediately put upon his proof; whereas if the conditions attaching to the licence are published in a public register, no such suspicion for such a thing could exist.  I throw that out as one conceivable occasion of misapprehension. There are thousands of such.  Passing this section, as it is, will breed distrust, suspicion and apprehension of corruption through the country.  I press the Minister most strongly that he should see that the fullest publicity should be given to the terms upon which these licences are issued.  In the event of such publicity being given the major objection falls to the ground.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister inform the House as to how he proposes to allocate those licences in the future? This matter was referred to by Deputy Dillon to-day, and I put it to the Minister yesterday that a register of these licences should be kept and that it should be open for inspection.  In January last the Minister agreed that it was demonstrated to him that it was possible and practicable to issue those <Col N="2456" /> licences to the feeders.  He agreed to give the licences to the feeders later on.  Will he agree now that in future under this Bill, when it becomes an Act, that the feeders will get the licences?  I do not see anywhere in this Bill where the price is fixed for export. I would be glad to know if any provision is made in this Bill for it?  I have not seen any.  Supposing the exporter, the dealer gets a licence as dealers get them now.  We know that licences are being trafficked in in County Armagh. Does the Minister deny that?</P>

Licences will be distributed with the same sleight of hand, the three card trick business.  Exporters will get them.  They are not buying cattle for sale and when they are not buying cattle for sale they are not bound by any conditions.  To buy those cattle the Minister accommodates them with licences and they can buy them at any price.  That is the position as I read the Bill.  That is not the end of it.  I would like if the Minister would point out where in this Bill is any control over the price except in the case of the price of cattle that will be bought for slaughter here.  Even though the beast is marked, that beast could not be killed until, say, the 1st of September next and not before.  It will be an offence to sell it to the butcher and it will be an offence for the butcher to buy that beef for slaughter before the 1st of September.</P>

I would like that an assurance from the Minister would be issued to the producers and to the producers only.  The Minister has no way out of that position but to issue them to the producers.  In order to have the thing done fairly and equitably, there should be a register kept in the Minister's Department, <Col N="2458" /> and that register should be open to inspection by anybody who wanted to inspect it so as to see who got the licences.  That will be a test of the sincerity and the anxiety of the Minister in administering the Act fairly to all citizens.  Will the Minister keep such a register?

      <P>The Minister agreed that it was the producer who should get the licences, and he put that into practice a month after.  When the summer came he said it was impracticable to give licences because it was impossible to take a census of the cattle on the land which were then fit for slaughter.  This Bill provides him with the machinery by which he will know at any moment the number of cattle ready for slaughter, the number of cattle permitted to be slaughtered, or the number of cattle fit for slaughter.  So the case is perfect, and there is no way out for the Minister but to give these licences to producers. Then if the producer sells for slaughter, that is controlled by the Act.  He must sell at the minimum price.  Anyhow it is his funeral to sell at any price he likes.  He will get the value of the licence, and in no other way is he going to be assured of a price&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is no use in making a statement as to why a certain thing should be done if I do not support it with solid reasons.  On the one hand, if the licence is issued to the dealer, there will be no control price for the dealer buying fat cattle for export.  He can buy them at any price he likes.  He is not controlled by the minimum price, therefore he is going to buy them by robbing the producer, and his instrument in robbing the producer will be the licence issued by the Minister.  He makes his extra profit by selling in the Birkenhead market from which the Minister starts to fix his price.  The only equitable way to allot licences is to allot them to the producer.  That licence gives the producer a permit to offer for sale for export, with the passport into the British market tied on the beast's horn, or he can export the beast himself to the British market, and he can get there the basic price on which the Minister builds up his price for the home market.  On any grounds you want to take this section, the continuance of the Minister's method of issuing these export licences to anybody but the producer, has nothing to sustain it.

The Deputy has got 25 minutes on this section.  The purport of his speech, I gathered, was to restrict the issuing of licences by the Minister to feeders only.  If the Deputy seriously intended that point to be discussed, he has had sufficient time, I submit, within the past four days to have put down an amendment to the section compelling the Minister to do that, but he has not done so.  On the last section nearly half an hour was occupied by the discussion, and at the end the section was not challenged, even though the Minister did not reply.

      <P>&ldquo;The Minister may attach to such licence any conditions,&rdquo; and Part II of the conditions may have reference to the price.  I can issue a licence to a man, saying: &ldquo;You can buy 50 fat cattle on this for export, but you must pay 25s. per cwt., and that is part of the conditions of the licence.&rdquo;  In any case it is not necessary to fix the price.  That is another thing.  If the home butcher is paying 25s. per cwt. for fat cattle, how is the exporter going to get cattle at a lesser price?  It is not necessary at all.  We come then to the point as to why we should go to the trouble of issuing all these licences to dealers other than the ordinary exporter who can do the business better.  The ordinary exporter has connections on the export market.  He can get a better price for these cattle than the feeder would.  If the feeder gets just as good a price, why should we give out the licences to the feeders?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The method of distribution will be as I explained last night.  The Consultative <Col N="2463" /> Council on the Export-of-Cattle Quota, in consultation with me, lays down a certain basis on which these licences are issued.  That basis will still be used.  Any member of that Consultative Council who has any complaint to make about the issue of licences to any particular person can find out what that particular person is getting.  At their meetings, they have a look at the register.  They bring in a list of the complaints they receive. They find out what the person concerned has got, and not one of them has yet found an irregularity.  They always find that the licences are given on the basis drawn up by them in consultation with me.</P>

      <P>The Minister said he can issue licences and attach to them any conditions as to price that he likes.  I question if he has that power and he is certainly not asking for it in this Bill. Why should he have power to fix a price below the minimum price paid here?  Does the Minister claim that he will have power under this Bill to fix an export price before he fixes a minimum price for beef in the home market?  He goes along childishly and says that there is no need to fix a price <Col N="2464" /> because when the home butcher will have to pay, say, 25/- a cwt., the exporter will have to compete with him and pay that price.  I think I am quoting the Minister with substantial accuracy.</P>

      <P>I have enough commonsense to read an ordinary document and discuss it.  The Minister is not going to get out of this corner with <Col N="2465" /> back answers.  He cannot point to any part of the Bill in which he has got this authority.  He will not give licences to the producers.  He will give them to the shippers, as he is doing at present.  Then the shippers can come in on a glutted market and pay any price they like for the surplus stock. That is the Minister's only solution of the quota problem, and no remedy is being provided in respect of the surplus fat cattle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing, on this section, with the issue of export prohibition orders, and are concerned only with licences pertaining to the prohibition period.  I do not anticipate that these prohibition orders will be put into force very often.  I think that the number of licences to be issued during the currency of these prohibition orders will not be very great.  There may be some point in what Deputy Belton said, that if the Minister is only going to issue an export prohibition order when it is necessary to keep the cattle in the country, he will issue licences to export only in exceptional circumstances.  The licences will not be general.  If that be so, there will be an advantage given to some person or persons.  It is obvious that the general run of exporters would not get licences in such circumstances or there would be no need for a prohibition order at all.  I do not know how that could be obviated.  There would have to be some discrimination. As regards price, when I first read the section I did not perceive that the Minister had power to fix export prices.  The section deals with the power of the Minister to issue licences for export when a prohibition order is in force and I took it that the section merely purported to regulate the manner in which these licences would be issued.  That is what the reading of the section conveyed to my mind, as I think it would convey to the mind of the ordinary man.  The fact that the provision as to specifying the route by which animals might be exported was put in parenthesis rather suggested to me that it was regarded as something extraneous to the provisions of the section, which had to do merely with the issue of licences.  As I am <Col N="2466" /> admitting that the Minister has power to fix prices&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He might think it proper to provide for the payment of certain prices.  I suggest that the matter should be made clearer and that an addendum should be made to this section so that it would be in this form: &ldquo;including conditions as to the route by which the animal is to be exported and the price to be paid for the animal.&rdquo;  If the Minister would make that addition, I think he would be making it clear that he was going to safeguard the price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <P>I take it that these people very often buy cattle here and do not know what price they are going to get in England for them.  They make sure to make up their losses the next time. The same thing happens in the case of men who buy pigs.  At the time that they come to sell the bacon on the British market the price of bacon there may have gone down.  In order to make up their losses they fall the price of pigs.  We are in the same position. We could not make up to a shipper for the losses that he would have on particular animals.  We would have to watch the British market closely, and if prices come down there we would have to come down in our fixed prices. We cannot make up to the shipper for the loss that he has sustained.</P>

They are being restricted in their trade as to what they may and may not do.  Under this particular section we are giving power to the Minister himself to do all the things that any ordinary trader may not do.  I just want to call the attention of the House to that: that the Minister himself is being empowered to do all the things that an ordinary trader is being prohibited from doing. The position, therefore, is that to-morrow the Minister may set up in various classes of business which traders are to be debarred from carrying on.  He is to have a monopoly of certain classes of business.  It is only fair, I think, that the House generally should understand that, and that Deputies should realise that they are voting definitely to place such powers in the hands of the Minister or of any future Minister.</P>

    <P>(2)  All moneys lent by the Minister under this section shall be so lent on such terms and conditions as to time and manner of repayment, rate of interest, security, and other matters as the Minister shall, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, think proper in each particular case.</P>
    <P>(3)  The terms on which money is lent by the Minister under this section may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, include a provision for the refund by the Minister out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, to the person to whom or the company for the promotion and formation of which such money is so lent of statutory fees thereafter becoming payable by such person or company.</P>

    <P>(5)  Whenever the Minister has lent any money under this section it shall be lawful for the Minister to do all or any of the following things, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to vary in any manner all or any of the terms and conditions on which such money was so lent;</P>

      <P>Under this section the Minister can lend money to any person engaged in any business to which this section applies.  He can vary the conditions of the loan after the loan has been made.  He can vary the rate of interest.  He can vary the time of payment.  He can vary the sum to be repaid.  He can remit the whole thing. I wonder is it good business to give up the credit of the State which we hear so much about.  General O'Duffy was taunted with being responsible for the failure of the National Loan.  If we are contemplating the issue of a National Loan is this the way to do business?  We borrow, and we lend the money to people on certain conditions. After the money has been lent &mdash;to very wild cat schemes too&mdash;on certain conditions, we can vary those conditions after the contract has been signed.  If we lend State money, at a rate even lower than we pay for the money, we can remit the interest altogether.  We can even remit the principal altogether.  This is the power which is sought in this section. It is a monstrous proposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chinn Chomhairle, the Deputy perhaps does not realise that when the Minister makes an agreement it is extremely difficult to make any alteration afterwards.  When a private individual or a banker makes a loan and the person comes along in 12 months afterwards and says &ldquo;I cannot pay on a particular date, but if you extend the period for a year <Col N="2475" /> longer I will be all right,&rdquo; the alteration may be made.  The Minister is in a very difficult position in regard to a variation like that unless he has the power.  That is really what the power is for.  We will not, of course, make the variation unless there is agreement between the two parties.  The agreement of course in all cases is likely to be for a relaxation, because the other party is not likely to ask for more severe terms.  If the other party asks for a relaxation or an extended period then by this section we have the power to make the variation.</P>

      <P>I quite see the difficulty which the Minister would be up against.  When somebody who has fallen on bad times comes to the Minister, he would like to help him out.  But let us see how this reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whenever the Minister has lent any money under this section it shall be lawful for the Minister to do all or any of the following things, that is to say:</P>
      <P>(a)  With the consent of the Minister for Finance, to vary in any manner all or any of the terms and conditions on which such money was so lent;</P>
      <P>(b)  with the consent aforesaid, to compound for or wholly release all or any part of such moneys or of any interest or other payment payable on or in relation to such moneys;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the power asked for by the Minister in this section is altogether too drastic.  As pointed out by Deputy Belton, he may vary in any manner the terms and conditions under which money is lent, after the arrangements have been made to lend that money.  As Deputy Belton also said, he is looking for power from this House to lend money, and at the same time he is looking for power from the House to forgive it if he wants to.  That is a power which the Minister, or any other Minister, should not seek from this House.  If the occasion arises that the Minister is not able to collect the money, he could seek for power then, but it is not right that he should look for power to lend money, and at the same time look for power to forgive it.  I cannot see why he should seek such powers, or why legislation should be so devised as to give the Minister the powers which he seeks under this section.  I certainly will not agree to it.  I will challenge a division if I cannot get any better explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I really cannot see why this section should be inserted at all. It is a section which is absolutely unbusiness-like, and I do not think it will ever be necessary.  I cannot see the Minister ever using it.  If there is any necessity to forgive or wipe out a loan there are ordinary channels through which it can be struck off as irrecoverable, or wiped out in some such manner.  The powers asked for are very wide, if they were interpreted strictly, and put into force strictly. I am not concerned so much about the forgiving part of it, because I do not think that would ever be put into operation, but I am concerned with the powers for increasing the rate.  Having lent somebody money at 4 per cent. for a period of ten years you might <Col N="2477" /> come along next day and say, &ldquo;I will charge you 6 per cent. and you must pay in three years.&rdquo;  I do not say the powers will be used.</P>

I should like to see some addendum inserted in regard to those varying powers&mdash;something to this effect: &ldquo;Other than increasing the interest or reducing the period of the payment.&rdquo;  I should like to see some safeguard in the section to satisfy me in that respect; otherwise I have no desire to change the section very much, because I do not think it will ever be used.  Even with the addendum I do not think it will be used, and the proper method would be to wipe out the section altogether.</P>

      <P>Whenever, under a scheme whereby compensation is payable out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas for cattle slaughtered or surrendered for slaughter in pursuance of such scheme, the Minister becomes possessed of any cattle (whether alive or dead), it shall be lawful for the Minister to dispose of such cattle in whatever manner he shall think proper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought there was power in the Bill to do this but it is doubtful if there is power to dispose of cattle under the circumstances.  I stated several times that old cows for making meat are worth very little in ordinary circumstances and naturally if we were to buy them we would have to <Col N="2479" /> give more than we could afford to give. The system we propose to work would be to buy these old cows from farmers at 50/- or £3 and sell them to the factory for very much less.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2480" /> (3)  The Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may at any time by order amend or revoke any order previously made by him under this section.</P>
    <P>This proposal arises out of a suggestion made by Deputy Cosgrave that we were confining free meat to two classes, recipients of home assistance and of unemployment assistance.  The Deputy stated that there might be other classes, so far unforeseen, which should be included and this amendment is to allow the Minister, by a future regulation, to bring in any other class that should obviously be brought in.</P>

      <P>I am very glad that the Minister has brought in the amendment to deal with what was an obvious blank in the Bill, so that benefit should be given to people other than those in receipt of home assistance or unemployment assistance.  This is an attempt to meet that position.  I do not know how the Minister is going to effect it.  He will have to put in some regulation.  Obviously people whose means do not amount to a certain sum would be included.  There are numbers of workers who are neither in receipt of home assistance nor unemployment assistance who are in necessitous circumstances but too proud to live at the State expense.  If there are privileges to be given to certain classes there should be machinery to extend them to others. The Minister should provide for that power in some other form.  There should be some local authority with power to give such people relief without any order or appeal to the Minister. Deputies will have in mind the type of cases I am referring to.  There are in every constituency numbers of these people.  While I am glad the amendment has been brought in I am not quite certain that any order made <Col N="2481" /> would not be bound up with such regulations as would debar many persons who have never been defined as necessitous persons, from benefiting. It should be within the discretion of some body like a county council or the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to give relief to necessitous persons, other than those receiving home assistance or unemployment assistance.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated on the Second Reading that we exported about 240,000 fat cattle in 1933 and consumed about 120,000.  I said that home consumption is about 180,000 and that export licences will account for 120,000, which brings the number up to 300,000.  If we dispose of 60,000 by way of free meat and some other schemes that we are providing for, for instance, tinned meat, we will dispose of as many cattle as in 1932 or 1933.  Our surplus cattle problem amounts to that.  We calculate that the free meat scheme can be made to absorb 78,000, if pushed to the limit.</P>

      <P>On the Committee Stage, on an appeal from Deputy Dillon, I kept this amendment over for further consideration.  I find that what I said last night was perfectly true, that this right was never exercised under previous Acts passed since 1924.  It is an unnecessary expense on the Department to keep a register for the public to inspect.  Otherwise they need only keep a card index.  Of course it does not prevent the citizen from getting any information he wants.  He can get it by post at any time.  It does prevent the citizen, however, from walking into the office and demanding to see the register.</P>

      <P>This also arose in the course of the discussion last night.  A person might alter, deface or counterfeit the mark which an inspector places on the cattle, or, in fact, might attempt to mark cattle which were not marked by an inspector.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are opposing the passing of this Bill for many reasons, but outstanding are the formulæ adopted by the Minister in fixing the minimum price.  From figures he has disclosed in the last stages in Committee he anticipates a consumption of 250,000 cows and cattle in the home market and he admits that the producer is going to lose, compared with the world market price, £4 10s. 0d. per beast, which is a loss to the producer on the home market of over £1,000,000. Then the Minister contemplates apparently giving the export licences to the traders instead of to the producers, and no provision is made in the Bill for fixing a minimum price at which these exporters are to buy the cattle.  Finally, he does not even touch the real problem which he set out to deal with, namely, to find a market for our surplus fat stock.  That still remains unsolved and in these circumstances I am opposing the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a section that provides for the exemption from stamp duty of documents and conveyances under the Bill, and it is not necessary as there are regular avenues for such procedure in existence.</P>

      <P>The House must be aware that this Bill has not received the consideration it ought to have received; and it ought to be put on the records of the House that it is leaving the House unexamined in a parliamentary sense.  We may feel grateful that we have the Seanad to do the work which this House ought to have done if the proper procedure was adopted by the Government. Legislation of this kind ought to have been introduced in time, and opportunity ought to have been given to the House to give it consideration under conditions which the House ought to enjoy when dealing with matters of this kind.  We are asked to appropriate, and have appropriated, enormous sums of money for the production of industrial alcohol from <Col N="2494" /> potatoes which, in the opinion of the best experts, will cost 3/- a gallon, and will have to be used in competition with a product that is purchasable in the world markets at 4d. per gallon delivered at the port of Dublin.  For that purpose large sums of money are being provided and elaborate machinery is being set up under this Bill.  All I can say is that the Industrial Alcohol Bill should form a suitable epitaph for the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <P>The procedure of the Government in relation to this Bill has been quite correct.  It is not by my wish that the Bill has not got more elaborate consideration, although I appreciate as much as any Deputy the fact that that enables an early adjournment of the Dáil to take place. The proposals in the Bill were debated on two occasions.  One of these was the introduction of a Supplementary Estimate last February, and the matter was again debated in the month of May.  The Bill merely gives effect to the decision recorded by the Dáil on both those occasions.</P>
