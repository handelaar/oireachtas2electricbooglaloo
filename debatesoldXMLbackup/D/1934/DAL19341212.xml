      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle (for Mr. Costello)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state on what date the County Dublin Board of Health forwarded to his Department the names of the persons to whom houses had been allotted in Shankill, County Dublin; the reason for the delay in dealing with eight of such houses for several months after his approval had been given in respect of the remainder of the houses; and whether as the houses in question have been vacant for at least six months and that the persons to whom they have been allotted are in urgent need of them, the Minister will give his decision without further delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward) Francis Constantine (Dr.) Ward">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward):</NameTxt>
      <P>The names of the 63 persons selected for the 64 cottages at Shankill were submitted to my Department for approval on the 14th and 22nd June last, and approval to the Board's selection was issued on the 26th idem.</P>
      <P>Subsequently seven of the persons so selected refused to take the cottages allotted to them.  The Board of Health then selected alternative tenants for the seven cottages and one for the cottage for which no previous selection had been made.  The eight names were submitted on the 29th August.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result, however, of representations having been received from other applicants for cottages in the Dublin County Health District the Board of Health, on 26th October last, was <Col N="882" /> directed to place all applications for cottages before the county medical officer of health for report.  The county medical officer of health is at present engaged in inspecting the existing accommodation of all the applicants, and a decision will be given at an early date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the usual procedure to override the decision of the Board of Health by way of referring the Board's decision to the county medical officer of health?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon:</NameTxt>
      <P>So the situation now is that the function of making those recommendations has been taken out of the hands of the local authorities, who represent the people and know the local conditions, and has been handed over to the medical officer of health? Might I ask the Parliamentary Secretary if this procedure is adopted what is the use of going through the form of asking the Board of Health to make any recommendation at all?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that an untried prisoner awaiting removal to Mountjoy Prison was, while held at Fermoy Gárda station, put into a cell which was subsequently condemned by a doctor and from which cell he was removed to hospital; and if he is further aware that after the doctor had condemned this cell another prisoner was confined therein.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received a report on the matters referred to by the Deputy.  The facts are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A prisoner, presumably the one referred to in the first part of the question, was detained in Fermoy Gárda Station from the 23rd to the 25th October, inclusive.  On the two nights of his detention he was kept in one of the two cells provided for the accommodation of prisoners.  While in the cell he was issued with four regulation blankets and four uniform great coats. He also had his own overcoat.  During the daytime he was accommodated, as far as could be found convenient, in the day-room or in the men's kitchen.  On the 25th October he was examined at his own request by a doctor, who certified that he was suffering from tonsillitis. <Col N="886" /> Within an hour he was released from custody and he entered Fermoy hospital the same night for treatment.</P>
    <P>On the 30th October the Gárda medical officer inspected the cells and recommended that their use should be discontinued.</P>
    <P>On the 7th November certain prisoners were being interrogated, and it was found necessary to keep one prisoner whose interrogation had concluded apart from the others.  He was accordingly placed in one of the cells, and was kept there for approximately one and a half hours in the middle of the day.  This apparently is the prisoner referred to in the latter part of the question.  On the night of the 7th-8th November he was given a bed in the day-room.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that several carriers who earn their living by carrying merchandise on their own trucks and who were registered as &ldquo;existing carriers&rdquo; for 20 cwt. vehicles, now find that when such trucks are worn out they cannot be replaced as the smallest commercial vehicle presently made is 30 cwt. capacity, and if he will, under such circumstances, permit the necessary plates and permits to be issued for such increased carrying capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass):</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been represented to me that certain carriers have experienced difficulty in replacing vehicles of the type and in the circumstances referred to in the question; but it is not correct to suggest that the smallest commercial vehicle now being made is of 30 cwt. carrying capacity.  I am informed that at least two types of commercial vehicle of 1 ton carrying capacity are at present being assembled in this country and sold complete with Irish-built body, whilst a 1-ton chassis of a similar type on which an Irish-built body can be mounted, is also available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where one lorry is replaced by another, the increase in a licensee's standard lorry weight permitted by the Road Transport Act, 1934, is conditional upon the carrying capacity of <Col N="887" /> both vehicles being substantially the same, and there is no power under the Act to authorise an increase in standard lorry weight in cases where this condition is not fulfilled.</P>
    <P>I may add, however, that I am considering the whole matter in the light of representations made to me from various quarters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state on what day unemployment assistance became payable in the Counties of Tipperary and Waterford, and whether he is aware that Mr. Denis Healy of Carrickbeg, Carrick-on-Suir, applied for unemployment assistance in May and again in July, that he was duly qualified to receive unemployment assistance pay, but that no payment was made to him, for a date earlier than the 18th October; and if he will state whether he will arrange to have the arrears of unemployment assistance due in this case paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to deal with Nos. 6, 7, 8 and 9 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="888" /> The preparation of replies to Parliamentary Questions about individual applications for unemployment assistance involves a considerable amount of labour and expense; and it diverts the energies of the staff of the Branch concerned from their normal duty of dealing with applications with a view to arriving at a final decision on them.  I would also remind the Deputy that the Unemployment Assistance Act provides machinery under which any aggrieved applicant has the right of appeal against the decision in his individual case.</P>
    <P>I have given the matter very careful consideration and I cannot in all the circumstances see my way to furnish replies to questions about individual cases.</P>
    <P>I may say, however, that in the cases referred to in Questions 6, 7 and 8, appeals made by the applicants to the Unemployment Appeals Committee are under consideration by that body.</P>
    <P>With regard to No. 9, unemployment assistance first became payable in the Counties of Tipperary and Waterford on the 3rd May, 1934.  No person is, however, entitled to apply for unemployment assistance until he becomes the holder of a qualification certificate. The applicant in question did not become the holder of such certificate until September and applied for unemployment assistance for the first time on September 29th.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran:</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the questions that have been put here from time to time, can the Minister say if anything can be done to expedite these appeals?  I have had to write to the Department and, like many others, I cannot compliment it on the punctuality or the courtesy with which it replied.  It is as hard to get any reply from the Department as to get a reply here.  The people concerned here naturally approach local representatives and ask them to try to help them to have their grievances redressed.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state (a) whether any temporary appointments to the post of Employment Clerk have been made; and, if so (b) if all those who received temporary appointments sat for the examination held on 21st December, 1933; (c) if any candidate who failed to pass the examination received a temporary appointment; (d) how many temporary Employment clerks are still employed, and how long it is estimated their employment will continue; (e) if the candidates next on the list to those appointed were given an opportunity of accepting temporary employment in order of merit, and if not why; and (f) if it is intended to make any further appointments from those who qualified, or if it is intended to hold a further examination to replace the temporary clerks appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>
      <P>No temporary appointments to the post of employment clerk have been made.  The post of employment clerk is an established post.  There is, however, a temporary situation of clerical assistant in the Employment Branch which the Civil Service Commissioners, on 29th January, 1932, added to the Schedule to the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1924 (No. 5 of 1924), as it is necessary for the Department from time to time to make purely temporary appointments in order to meet any volume of work for which the established staff may be inadequate. The temporary appointments in question are made by the Department from lists of applicants registered for employment at the employment exchanges. In making these purely temporary appointments it is not the practice of the Department, and it would not be feasible, to have regard to the examination for the permanent posts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the last part of the question, it is anticipated that a certain number of further appointments of <Col N="892" /> established employment clerks will be made in the usual manner from those who qualified at the examination held in December, 1933.  The number of appointments that can properly be made from that examination in respect of posts approved of by the Department of Finance is a matter for the decision of the Civil Service Commissioners. It is contemplated that when this limit is reached further appointments to the post of employment clerk will continue to be made as the result of competitive examinations to be held from time to time, but the nature of those examinations has yet to be determined, and it is not yet possible to gauge the Department's normal requirements in respect of established posts for employment clerks.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>1.  That a duty of excise at the rate of six pence the gallon shall be charged and levied on, and shall be paid by the manufacturer of, all mineral hydrocarbon light oil made in Saorstát Eireann which, on or after the 1st day of February, 1935, is sent out, on or for sale or otherwise, from the premises of the manufacturer thereof or is used by such manufacturer for any purpose other than the manufacture or production of mineral hydrocarbon oil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.  That, subject to compliance with such conditions as the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="918" /> shall impose, the duty mentioned in this Resolution shall not be charged or levied:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  on any mineral hydrocarbon light oil in respect of which it is shown, to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners, that</P>
    <P>(i)  such oil was sent out from the premises of the manufacturer thereof on or after the 1st day of February, 1935, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  the duty mentioned in this Resolution was paid in respect of such oil when it was so sent out, and</P>
    <P>(iii)  such oil was subsequently brought back to the said premises from which it was so sent out or into other premises occupied by the said manufacturer, nor</P>
    <P>(b)  on any mineral hydrocarbon light oil which is shown, to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners, to be intended for use in Saorstát Eireann in any process of dyeing or cleaning of textiles carried on by way of trade, nor</P>
    <P>(c)  on any mineral hydrocarbon light oil which is shown, to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners, to be intended for use as an ingredient in the manufacture of articles which are not of the character of mineral hydrocarbon light oil or not merely a mixture or blend of such oils with or without the addition of some ingredient such as colouring matter.</P>
    <P>3.  That a drawback, equal to the amount of the duty mentioned in this Resolution which is shown, to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners, to have been paid in respect of the goods in question, shall be allowed on the exportation from Saorstát Eireann or the shipment or deposit in a bonded warehouse for use as ships' stores of any mineral hydrocarbon light oil chargeable with the said duty, and on the loading into any aircraft of any such oil for use on a voyage to a place outside Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    <P>4.  That there shall, as on and from the 1st day of February, 1935, be <Col N="919" /> charged, levied, and paid, on a licence to be taken out annually by every refiner of hydrocarbon oil, an excise duty of one pound.</P>
    <P>5.  That the Revenue Commissioners may make regulations for securing and collecting the duty mentioned in this Resolution, for prohibiting the refining of hydrocarbon oil otherwise than by persons who hold a licence in that behalf and have made entry for that purpose, for regulating the issue, duration, and renewal of such licences, and for governing generally the manufacture of mineral hydrocarbon light oil and the removal of such oil from the refinery, and the Revenue Commissioners may by such regulations apply to the duty and the drawback mentioned in this Resolution or to refiners of hydrocarbon oil any enactment for the time being in force relating to any duty of excise or of customs or to persons carrying on any trade which is for the time being subject to the law of excise.</P>
    <P>6.  That if any person does any act (whether of commission or omission) which is a contravention of a condition imposed or regulation made by the Revenue Commissioners under this Resolution, he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to an excise penalty of five hundred pounds and any article in respect of which such offence is committed shall be forfeited.</P>
    <P>7.  That for the purposes of this Resolution the expression &ldquo;hydrocarbon light oil&rdquo; means hydrocarbon oil of which not less than fifty per cent. by volume distils at a temperature not exceeding 185 degrees centigrade, or of which not less than 95 per cent. by volume distils at a temperature not exceeding 240 degrees centigrade or which gives off an inflammable vapour at a temperature of less than 22.8 degrees centigrade when tested in the manner prescribed by the Acts relating to petroleum.</P>
    <P>8.  That the method of testing oil for the purpose of ascertaining <Col N="920" /> whether it complies with the provisions of the next preceding paragraph of this Resolution relating to the distillation of a certain volume thereof at a certain temperature shall be such as the Revenue Commissioners shall prescribe.</P>
    <P>9.  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect by virtue of the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Resolution is to assist in the establishment of a refinery for the manufacture of oil of this description in the Saorstát.  Only one firm is at present engaged in the manufacture of the oil in question, and the capacity of the plant in that case is limited to 3,000,000 gallons of petrol per annum.  The loss of revenue involved under the Financial Resolution now before the House will, consequently, be negligible.  The second paragraph of the Resolution provides for the exemption from duty of oil on which duty has been paid but which has subsequently been returned to the premises of the manufacturer, and of oil intended for use in the Saorstát in any process of dyeing or cleaning of textiles.  The usual provision is made for payment of drawback in respect of oil exported or deposited in a bonded warehouse for use as ships' stores.  As it is the established practice, when an excise duty is imposed on a commodity, to require the manufacturer thereof to take out an annual licence, provision is also made in this Resolution for the taking out by the refiner of hydrocarbon oil of an annual licence on which an excise duty of £1 will be payable.  The Resolution empowers the Commissioners to make regulations for securing and collecting the duty provided for in the Resolution and for prohibiting the refining of hydrocarbon oil otherwise than by persons duly licensed.  The Resolution also provides that a penalty of £500 may be imposed for the contravention of a regulation or condition imposed by the Revenue Commissioners under this Resolution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>
      <P>The development of oil refining is one of the objects which the Government has in view.  On that account, various discussions have been proceeding between representatives of the Department of Industry and Commerce and representatives of the various oil interests.  The position at present is that, if anybody were to undertake oil refining here, the motor spirit produced by them would be free of duty.  There is a Customs duty of 8d. per gallon on petrol imported, without any corresponding Excise duty. As one firm is now about to commence the refining of oil and the production of petrol here, it is necessary to impose an Excise duty in order to protect the revenue.  An Excise duty at the rate of 6d. per gallon is being imposed as against a Customs duty of 8d. per gallon, giving a preference of 2d. per gallon to the firm in question.  It is, however, contemplated that the comparatively <Col N="922" /> small development about to take place in County Cork will be the prelude to much larger development in the course of the coming year, as a result of which all the petrol required in the country will be refined here.  In these circumstances, the amount of the excise duty might have to be increased to 8d. per gallon if the Exchequer should require the same revenue from petrol in the future that it has obtained in the past.  In that event, the customs duty would be correspondingly increased, so that a margin of 2d. per gallon would be maintained in order to promote the utilisation of the spirit produced here.</P>
      <P>The difficulty which operated in the past against the development of the oil refining industry here was that our market was not quite sufficient to absorb all the by-products of the industry.  It is sufficient to absorb all the possible production of some of these by-products but an export trade would be required in respect of certain of the by-products.  The possibility of procuring that export trade was one of the matters to which consideration was given.  It seems now that no particular difficulty will arise under that head. The particular development which has taken place in Cork and which necessitates the imposition of this duty now, rather than at a later stage when more complete plans will have been prepared, is, of course, only a small-scale one.  The total production of petrol by that plant will be not more than 3,000,000 gallons per year.  One of the main products of the plant will be fuel oil, a market for which will be found amongst the shipping companies which are now using fuel oil to a much greater extent than they did in the past.  The plant at Haulbowline, with the fine harbour facilities there, will be admirably situated for the sale of fuel oil to merchant and passenger ships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The employment given by the industry is not considerable in relation to the capital involved in its establishment. If we secure that all the petrol and other oils required here are refined here from imported crude oil, the total employment involved will be not more than a few hundred men.  Of course, there are other advantages.  Considerable <Col N="923" /> indirect employment will be provided in the manufacture of the containers in which the oil is packed and so forth.  The fact that visible imports will be diminished and visible exports increased in value is also an important consideration.</P>
    <P>The effect of this duty, therefore, is not really to alter the position of the revenue to any appreciable extent.  It will alter the revenue to the extent of 2d. per gallon on whatever production of petrol takes place at Cobh; so far that is the only change achieved or contemplated here.  If, as we hope, we reach a position when we are able to produce the full quantity of petrol the country requires through our refineries here, then the revenue position will be whatever the Dáil is prepared to make it by variation of the Excise duty created by this resolution.  The company is known as the Cork Oil Wharves, Ltd.  It has been established there for a number of years, operating certain storage plants, but it has decided, for various reasons, to cease to operate as such, and to establish a refinery plant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say whether the Company which will manufacture these oils has any connection with any of the importing oil companies or manufacturers?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Minister has gone carefully into the economic aspects of this.  He indicated that if anything approaching our full requirements of this particular oil were produced here it would have a serious effect upon the Exchequer returns, and therefore this Excise duty will have to be increased.  I understood the Minister to say that; and that, to my mind, is threatening this new industry.  It is telling it: &ldquo;Keep small.  Remain a baby.  If you develop to be a man I shall put a duty on you that will crush you.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would continue a preference of 2d., and therefore you would probably increase both by 1d.  Suppose we produced all our requirements, then you would probably have to raise the 6d.  Excise duty to 8d., and I presume you would have to raise the Customs duty to 10d. or over. The Minister has worked out the economic details of this on that basis, and on that basis I presume he strikes this 6d.  Excise duty and leaves it as a headline.  If the revenue returns fall he will have to increase both the Customs duty on the foreign article and the Excise duty on the home article, still maintaining a difference of 2d. so that the Exchequer will not lose by the transaction.</P>

      <P>That is what it means. It is on exactly the same principle as the treatment of sugar.  The imported article pays a Customs duty and the home manufactured article pays a very much smaller Excise duty, and the imported article and the home-manufactured article are sold on the same footing.</P>

      <P>Not necessarily, but that is what happens.  In certain circumstances that course may be justified, but the House must remember that whatever sums we present to these manufacturers in Cork must be made up from some other source to keep the Exchequer in funds, and means the imposition of some other form of taxation. When we are going to impose taxation, I want to know what we are going to get for it.  The Minister gives us no estimate of how much money the Exchequer will have to give this Cork firm by way of reduced duties.  The Minister gives no estimate as to the number of men who will be employed as a result of this expenditure.  I think it is a bad practice to come to the House with a vague general proposition of this kind, which obviously is half-baked, and ask for what may be a very large sum of money without giving us any indication whatever of the advantages that the State may expect to derive from the transaction.  I think the Minister ought to let us know the nature of this company, and he ought to let us know the capital of the company; he ought to let us know how much petrol he will allow this company to refine on the basis proposed in this Financial Resolution.  These are three essential pieces of information that the House ought to have before being asked to pass this Resolution.  I asked the Minister for Finance whether paraffin oil, which is normally used in illuminating country houses, is exempt, <Col N="926" /> and he said yes, and that this only applies to petrol.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce says this applies to fuel oil.</P>

      <P>The third matter to which I want to draw the attention of the House is that it is an interesting commentary on procedure that here the imposition of an Excise duty is imposed by resolution, as is done under Financial Resolution No. 2, while the House will very well remember that an Excise duty was imposed on sugar not very long ago under the powers conferred under the Minister's Emergency Imposition of Duties Act.  It is an interesting thing that when the Minister can make the shadow of a case that there was going to be some great development in Haulbowline as a result of the imposition of an Excise duty, we have a financial resolution, but when it is the Minister's proposal to put a farthing a pound on sugar, which he made a great to-do about taking off&mdash;holding himself up as the Christian Minister for Finance when he took it off&mdash;it is done in the silent and discreet method provided by the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make it clear, in case any misunderstanding might have been created by Deputy Dillon's remarks, that this duty is not really being imposed because of the contemplated development at Haulbowline alone.  If the only development was to be the establishment of this refinery there, we probably would not have encouraged anybody to go into <Col N="927" /> the industry at all.  This duty is being imposed really as an indication to interested parties that in the event of petrol being refined here it will be subject to an Excise duty of 6d. as against a Customs duty of 8d., and that there will be a preference of 2d. per gallon to be enjoyed by such persons. I can say that in a neighbouring country it is 4d. a gallon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>
      <P>Great Britain.  The company that is proceeding with a small refinery at Haulbowline is an external company, and it will require to be provided with a licence under the Control of Manufactures Act before the business can be proceeded with. The capital, I think, is something in the nature of £150,000.  The output of petrol which will be undertaken there will not exceed 3,000,000 gallons per year.  Deputy McGilligan asked at what stage of development would the export market become necessary. That is a matter about which discussions are proceeding, because the products of any refinery vary according to the nature of the crude oil used.  One gets a certain percentage, high or low, of petrol, paraffin oil, lubricating oil, or any of the other products, and different crudes have different peculiarities.  I am told that it is, in fact, possible to get a synthetic crude which would provide all bye-products in the exact quantities we require them, but that is a matter upon which I am not in a position to express an opinion.  However, it does seem clear that by various arrangements we can procure the establishment of refineries here capable of giving us the whole of the 35,000,0000 gallons of petrol, or whatever is the amount per year, plus the other oil products, in the quantities in which we require them and, in addition, to secure an export market for whatever surplus by-products are produced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The employment given in the direct production of oil is, as I have said, not great in relation to the capital involved.  The capital is several million pounds, but it is mainly in <Col N="928" /> machine equipment, and the direct employment given is not great.  There is, however, indirect employment given in so far as the refining of oil here means that all the other industries associated with the petrol industry, including the manufacture of petrol containers and so forth, will be developed here.  In any event, the effect upon the trade of the country will be noticeable in so far as the value of our imports diminish and with the possibility of exports being secured instead.  The loss of revenue that will follow from the maintenance of the Excise duty at 6d. while the Customs duty is 8d., and while there is only refining at Haulbowline producing not more than 3,000,000 gallons per year, is comparatively slight, because against that loss of revenue there will be, of course, other taxes which will yield an increased return in consequence of that development. Should it happen, however, that our plans to secure the complete development of the industry succeeded to the point that all the petrol was refined here, then the loss of revenue would be considerable, and it is at that stage that the Dáil would be asked to decide whether the duty should be retained at 6d. or increased to 8d. so as to secure the same revenue.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  That is one of the points that have to be considered before a larger development takes place.  The 2d. preference that will be enjoyed by the Cork company may permit of its selling its product at a slightly lower price than petrol is being sold at now, and it may have to do that in order to secure an entry into the petrol market.  However, whether it is possible to secure a large scale development of the industry here on a basis which will mean that no rise in price will be necessitated, is a matter that is under consideration.  The refinery there is a small scale refinery and, to some extent, costs there will be higher than at a larger refinery, but whatever higher costs may result will <Col N="929" /> be offset to some extent by advantages in marketing the other products which that company will enjoy by reason of its location.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce told us that it may be necessary at a particular time to increase the Excise duty from 6d. to 8d.  I submit to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that he will be telling us in a few years' time at any rate&mdash;or he may be, or someone else will&mdash;that he explained that it would be necessary to increase the Excise duty from 6d. to 8d. and to increase the Customs duty from 8d. to 10d.  I submit that, in fact, the net result in the ultimate of the proposals he is making to us to-day is to impose an additional burden of £300,000 on the users of petrol in the country; that the Minister has no intention ultimately of losing any revenue in this particular way; that the revenue is not going to suffer, and that an additional £300,000 or substantially more than that, is going to be borne by the motoring population in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the answer to that is that no decision has yet been made in favour of any particular set of proposals other than this small-scale development at Haulbowline.  It is impossible to say, and I at this stage will not admit, that any larger scale developments should necessitate an increase in the price of petrol.  It may, in fact, prove that such an increase is associated with any such development, in which case we would have to balance the advantages to be derived from the establishment of the industry against the disadvantage of that increase in price.  On the information available to the Department from the experts with whom we have been discussing the matter, I am not yet convinced&mdash;and in that view I am supported by some of the experts&mdash;that the development of <Col N="931" /> the industry here to the fullest extent need necessitate any increase in price. On one point I want to make a correction on what has been said.  I said this duty applied only to petrol.  The definition of petrol in the Resolution, which is similar to the definition in the existing Customs resolution, covers white spirit, but that need cause no complication because white spirit is, in fact, refined here by certain firms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not say so.  A considerable amount depends on the nature of the by-products and the price at which they can be sold.  The prices for those products&mdash;which are international prices&mdash;are fluctuating <Col N="932" /> from day to day.  There is, as the Deputy will realise, a certain amount of speculation in this business.  I understand it is possible for them to vary the process of distillation at any time, so as to increase or decrease the by-products.

      <P>Not altogether, but it has varied undoubtedly.  At the present time, I think it is generally contended that none of the people supplying petrol to this country is making any profit out of it.  At the price at which petrol has been imported here for some time past it has been imported at a loss.  That fact has been the subject of comment in financial papers, and it is inevitable that at some stage there is going to be an upward movement in petrol prices, in which case it will be possible to contemplate a development of petrol refining here without any financial inducement to the firms undertaking it. However, under present circumstances it is necessary to give a preference of 2d. per gallon, a large part of which will be required to cover increased manufacturing costs in a plant of the size contemplated at Cobh.</P>

If it is you are going to give <Col N="934" /> this company only just sufficient to equalise manufacturing costs, and you are going to make them sell lower. They will bless you.  On the other hand, it is quite clear that they would not undertake to manufacture on that basis without getting some profit out of it.  There must have been some determining factor.  It may be a very loose estimate, but there must have been something in the way of an estimate as to how much of this sum is required to equate the difference in manufacturing costs.  If there was any consideration at all given to the matter of further development there must have been some consideration given to the point as to how much of the 1½d. or 2d. per gallon increased manufacturing costs will disappear when they are refining not 3,000 but 30,000 gallons.

Even if it is packed around with reservations, let us hear what was the figure in the Minister's mind when he thought of this 2d.  What was the figure?  What was the proportionate part representing the increased manufacturing costs?  I gathered on the last occasion that it was the whole 2d. or very nearly the whole 2d.  Let us say that came from 3,000,000 to 10,000,000 refined.  How does the 2d. disappear, and how does the proportionate part of the manufacturing costs go down? When will we get to the point that if 2d. is the manufacturing cost we will be getting ½d. profit on the 10,000,000 gallons?  There must be some calculation&mdash;I do not care how vague the figures are&mdash;for bringing in this 2d. instead of 3d.</P>

      <P>The Minister has clearly admitted that he is not clear in his mind as to what proportion will compensate the manufacturers for the increased cost of manufacture; and what part is going to tempt manufacturers into the business by the prospect of profits.  That is one aspect of the question.  The other aspect is that supposing a production of 35,000,000 gallons yearly is produced, and supposing it is true that a substantial part of the 2d. that he is giving to manufacturers now is compensation for the increased cost of production, we must assume that when manufacture is on the 35,000,000-gallon basis, they will continue to require some preference as between foreign petrol and their product. In any case, we have no guarantee that they will not.  If it be no more than 1d. the operation will cost the country £145,000 yearly.  We ought to know definitely what we are going to get, as a community, for the £145,000.  It might be justified if we were getting some very important consideration, and it might be justified if it could be demonstrated that we were going to drop revenue, unless petrol refiners were roped in to the tune of £145,000 or that it was going to come back to the Exchequer from some other source.  In making up our minds we should bear in mind that there is a very close analogy between this proposal and the proposal in respect of the white elephants set up by the Minister for Finance, to use his own term, at Tuam, Mallow and Thurles. We were told in the beginning that the expense of these operations was to be spread out among the consumers, by economies in manufacture and in a small increase in the price of sugar. Subsequently, we discovered that the Exchequer intervened and stated that having made its distribution of the added costs, it found it had to heap on ¼d. per lb. by way of Excise duty in order to assist the Exchequer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if Deputy Dillon were Minister for Industry and Commerce, would he be able to get all the information that he is asking the present Minister to supply.  I wonder would he find it easy to ascertain the actual cost of producing crude oil in Peru and Ecuador, the cost of transport from there to Haulbowline and finally the cost of refining.  Surely, if oil companies have not been given entirely a wrong reputation they are concerns which manage to keep their affairs pretty well to themselves.  In my opinion, they keep them so well, or are able to put such a false gloss upon them, that they can deceive anyone, so that even the Minister for Industry and Commerce believes that they are selling petrol in this country without profit.  I do not think there are many who, being familiar with the history of the oil companies, will agree with that opinion.  In this case it is evident that no oil company is going to explain its costs to a Government, and all the Minister handling a matter like this can do is to take approximate figures.  In my opinion, the Minister has done well to get this industry going at a concession of 2d. per gallon.  It will put the petrol position in this situation, that the companies supplying the product will not have the power over the country that they had previously; that instead of being merely trading <Col N="938" /> organisations without any fixed capital worth while and in a position at any moment to make any demands they thought well of on the community in this country, they will now have a much bigger interest in this country and will not have the same power to extort that they had previously.  Certainly the present position cannot be considered satisfactory by any means&mdash;that you should have, with regard to a commodity that is in such very general use, on which the life of the community depends so much, three or four concerns acting in close unison, with the power at any moment to put on 6d., 8d., or 1/- per gallon on the commodity, and no one with even the right to say: &ldquo;We cannot let you do that: you will have to sell it at a lower price.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore:</NameTxt>
      <P>As to all this talk about prices going up, as the Minister pointed out, there is no such thing as a regular price for petrol.  There is a purely arbitrary price fixed from time to time at the whim of the distributing companies. It is obviously a purely arbitrary price when petrol costs practically the same in Athlone as in Dublin where it arrives.  It is a purely arbitrary arrangement by which in Cork petrol costs 1d. per gallon more than in Dublin. Yet Deputy McGilligan insists that there is a price for petrol.  Who has ever been able to say whether the action of the distributing companies in raising the price at any moment was justified or not.  In regard to prices, the existing companies have the country very much under their control, and the one big benefit I would expect to arise from this new development is that the temptation will be less upon them to extort from the community in future than it has been in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one thing that I feel a bit dissatisfied about and that is the prospect for the export of by-products. The parent company of this concern has just finished a big refining station at Manchester with a capacity of 100,000 tons a year.  Obviously they will have a very large amount of by-products to sell, and it will be remarkable if they <Col N="939" /> do not first insist on selling the by-products of that concern before they allow the subsidiary company to sell any quantity in any market which they can control.  I do not feel altogether satisfied on that point.  Otherwise, I think the development is a good one.</P>

      <P>The last contribution is interesting as showing the state of the Deputy's economic mind.  There are three considerations that operate with him.  One is that petrol, he seemed to say, is governed by those who own the oil wells.  Do we change that by this?</P>

These people are going to sell from Haulbowline refined petrol at 2d. differential in manufacturing costs. How does that in itself affect distribution? <Col N="942" /> Deputy Moore says that is not going to affect the monopolistic control of the price of unrefined petrol, knowing, as he must know, that this will only mean that the people down there will get a little bit extra in the way of profit, that as far as the community is concerned petrol will be on sale at Haulbowline at very much the same price as it is on sale at present and that this means nothing to distribution.

      <P>The Minister does not purport to deny that the statement was made by Deputy de Valera, as he then was.  The Minister cannot deny that certain individuals in the State on the strength of that declaration by the President that this was the confirmed policy of himself and his colleagues undertook certain considerable expenditure after the Minister removed the duty on home-grown tobacco in the first Finance Bill in 1932.  He cannot deny that since step by step the Minister has fallen back from the position which he took up originally; he has fallen back from the position taken up by Deputy de Valera, as he then was, when on his own behalf and on behalf of the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Agriculture and his colleagues, until now we are back into the position almost exactly occupied by the present Minister for Finance's predecessor in respect of the attitude of the Revenue Commissioners to tobacco growing in this country. Now I very well remember the hurly burly that was started in this country when the Minister took off the duty in respect of tobacco.  I remember how the <i>Irish Press</i> sent out telegrams through the country to their various prominent supporters saying that the dawn of freedom had at last broken for the down-trodden tobacco growers of this country.  Everyone was excited.  A great new industry was set on foot. Tobacco fields were going to blossom all over Ireland.  Great fortunes were going to be made by farmers here, there and everywhere.  Slowly the unfortunate individuals who were deluded by Deputy de Valera's interview <Col N="948" /> in 1929 and by the gesture of the Minister for Finance in 1932 have discovered that, instead of walking forward towards a grand new development, they have been steadily walking backward.  This is another milestone on the road.  It is just as well that Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party should realise that this is another instance of the statements to which Deputy Dowdall referred here on one occasion.  It was made before the election for the purpose of getting votes.  A feeble, futile attempt was made to implement it after the election. Then the Minister for Finance got sense.  Since he got sense, he has been gradually falling back from the ridiculous position into which he got himself with reference to tobacco.  Now, the statement on the strength of which Deputy O'Reilly and many another Deputy stumped the country is being proven wholly and entirely false.  The poor, deluded individuals who invested their capital and who took considerable risks in starting the tobacco growing business on the strength of the word of Deputy de Valera and the Minister now find themselves in a worse position than they were before they put their hand to tobacco growing.  It is right the country should realise that and remember the distance we have travelled since the glorious days of insouciance when Deputies de Valera, MacEntee and Ryan, as they were then, were free to promise anything and everything to get votes, down to the day when they are all in ministerial posts and finding it more and more difficult to maintain the semblance of fidelity to the undertakings which they gave the people four or five years ago.</P>

    <P>This Resolution is designed to remedy a serious leakage of revenue, and to remove anomalies in the administration of the stamp duty law in its application to local authorities.  Under the provisions of the Act of 1838 and certain other Acts relating to local administration, certain documents such as road contracts, executed by local authorities in connection with local government administration, are treated as being exempt from stamp duty.  Originally the only documents which were exempt were those relating to funds in regard to poor law relief and such cognate purposes; but, owing to administrative action and the statutory application of poor rate machinery to the collection of other rates, the exemption has been extended far beyond the limit originally intended. For instance, the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1930, applied the poor rate machinery to the collection of Dublin and Dun Laoghaire rates, and a claim by the Dublin Corporation for exemption from stamp duty on these rates was upheld by the High Court and the Appeal Court.  More recently, it has been extended to the collection of rates under the management of the City of Limerick Act of last year. There is no reason why these three bodies should be in a privileged position as compared with other local authorities.  There is no reason why documents of one local authority more than any other should be generally exempt.  It is, therefore, proposed under this Resolution that in future stamp duty shall be paid by all local authorities in the same way as other bodies of persons.</P>

      <P>No; Dublin, Dun Laoghaire and Limerick.  They are the three most recent exemptions.

      <P>The Minister has just admitted to this House that the Revenue Commissioners interpreted the matter in one way and the Corporation in another way.  They joined issue on that&mdash;the ratepayers on the one hand and the Revenue Commissioners on the other.  The High Court gave a decision in favour of the ratepayers.  The Revenue Commissioners then went to the Supreme Court and they, again, gave the decision in favour of the ratepayers. Whereupon, the Revenue Commissioners said: &ldquo;You have forgotten that in litigation with us it is always a matter of heads we win, tails you lose.&rdquo;  The Revenue Commissioners, in effect, said: &ldquo;We have the Minister for Finance just where we want him and we will now proceed to put the screws on him; having failed to intimidate the judiciary and an array of legal talent, we will now apply a little more direct pressure upon the tender person of the Minister for Finance.&rdquo;  As a result, here you are now with the necessary decision handed <Col N="954" /> down, not by the courts of the country but by the Revenue Commissioners, to the Minister for Finance, who comes in and flaps his wings as they pull the string.</P>
      <P>I think the principle is bad.  I think that, when statutes are enacted by this House and citizens go into the courts and vindicate their rights before the courts, it is a bad principle to allow any Department of State to override by <i>ad hoc</i> legislation the interpretation of the courts of privileges designedly and consciously granted to bodies corporate or to others by statute of Dáil Eireann.  The sum at stake is very small&mdash;£2,000.  It cannot be of any material concern to the Exchequer, but it does mean this: it means a red light to every citizen of this country warning him: &ldquo;Do not avail of the processes of the law as against the Revenue Commissioners; do not go into the courts when the Revenue Commissioners are the defendants, because if you do, and even if you have the courts on your side, the Revenue Commissioners will squeeze the Minister for Finance into the introduction of the necessary <i>ad hoc</i> legislation to deprive you of the benefits of the decisions which the courts have given you.&rdquo;  For the sake of this sum of £2,000, I suggest to the Minister that he should not press this and that he should not be a party to the overriding of the courts by <i>ad hoc</i> legislation except where some grave public evil would ensue from the interpretation laid upon the statute by the courts of the country.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not stated whether or not this imposition affects Cork Borough or, in fact, any other borough which might wish to take the same steps as were taken in the case of the litigation which went on in the courts.  In the normal course of events, this is one of those matters which ought to fall for consideration at the time of the annual Budget, but, as Deputy Dillon has said, the case he has made against the Minister is patent on the face of it: that a citizen of this State or a corporation in the State, believing that they have certain rights and looking over the list of the <Col N="955" /> various statutes or sections of them which are being repealed, going back to William IV, Victoria and so on&mdash; back, in one case, to 1836&mdash;a citizen realises of what little avail it is to take a case into court and to win a case in court when, without notice to anybody, a motion is tabled here in the House and the citizens of Dublin will learn to-morrow morning that they have been mulcted, although they have won their case in the courts, to the extent of approximately £1,500 per anuum.  I take it that that would probably be the sum which would fall upon the City of Dublin by reason of this particular imposition.  In order to ensure that it is going to fall upon them, a section of an Act, passed 98 years ago, is going to be repealed.</P>
      <P>The Corporation of Dublin can say that when they were governed from Westminster 98 years ago, with the prejudice against this country that existed in the time of King William IV, they got some privilege by which they were enabled to evade certain stamp duties or some other instrument, which, in the normal course of events, but for the passing of that particular clause, would have saved them money.  In the case of an Act passed in 1838 the first section is removed, and, coming down along the line till you come to the Act of 1885, when the whole Act is repealed in order to make the Corporation of Dublin pay £1,500 a year more than they have secured by their access to the courts of the country.  It means actually what Deputy Dillon says: That no matter what protection you seek from the courts&mdash;and the courts, after all, have got to interpret the Acts of Parliament&mdash;they are going to be caught subsequently by this, and this is the motion by which the State seeks to recover the costs that it has probably incurred by reason of contesting the claims of citizens who claim their rights or of corporations that take steps to ensure that their ratepayers are not going to be mulcted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it has reference only to three corporations in the State&mdash;the Corporation of Limerick, the Corporation of Dublin and the Borough of Dun <Col N="956" /> Laoghaire&mdash;obviously, it is taxing certain individuals in this State by a special enactment, and, in order to do it, we have to go back practically 100 years to the clause of the Act that will enable the Minister to collect this £1,500.  What fault has the Minister to find with the citizens of these three areas?  They went to the courts and they won their cases in the courts, only to find that the Minister comes in here and ensures, perhaps, that he will get even more money than they contested about in the courts in order to save their ratepayers from the liabilities.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that Parliament, during the last 30 or 40 years particularly, has placed upon local authorities expenses which, 98 or 100 years ago, or even as far back as 1879, would not have been thought at all likely to have been placed on local authorities.  There were only three or four services for which local authorities were responsible up to about 60 years ago&mdash;water, roads, lighting and sewerage.  Since then, a whole list of liabilities has been imposed by statute upon them, and in the exercise of that work they do require to have stamps affixed to certain instruments, which arises out of their new obligations and so on.  Now we come in here, in the last few days of the winter session, and we occupy the time of the House in imposing a direct tax on the citizens of Dublin of approximately £1,500 a year.  I oppose this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett:</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add one word of protest to the case made by Deputies Dillon and Cosgrave.  This is a direct attempt on the part of this House to advance the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners in their interpretation of an Act of Parliament against the decision of the judges.  The only reason given by the Minister for the introduction of this motion is that it is unfair to the rest of the community that those two boroughs and one council should get this advantage. We have, I think, heard no protest from the rest of the country against the advantages that those councils got under this Act.  While in certain other directions there are almost universal protests about other matters the <Col N="957" /> Ministry have taken no action, but here in a matter which concerns only two cities and a local town the Minister brings in a special motion, as he says, to put the whole country on a level; in other words, to try to persuade this House that the rest of the country is objecting to the advantage that those cities get.  There is no evidence before the House that there is any universal protest against this, and it is unfair that the Minister should advance that argument in favour of this motion.</P>

      <P>We have heard what was intended to be a very learned speech from Deputy Cosgrave about the hard case of the citizens of Dublin. We were told they had enjoyed certain privileges dating from, I think, the year 1838.  Of course that does not happen to be true.  This exemption from stamp duty was conferred quite inadvertently by the Act of 1930.  This Resolution is not an attempt to reverse the decision of the High Courts but to express plainly what was the intention of the Dail when it passed the Act of 1930.  After the passage of the Act neither those who were responsible for the Act nor the Dail thought that it had made any change in the situation.  The law was held by the Revenue Commissioners to be as it had been before the introduction of the Act.</P>

      <P>In the Limerick Act of this year full advertence was made to the fact that the law would have to be amended&mdash;here I am going to answer Deputy Cosgrave's first question &mdash;if Limerick was to be put in the same position as the County Borough of Cork or the County Borough of Waterford or most of the other local authorities through the country.  It was realised then that a Resolution of this sort, withdrawing this exemption, should be brought in in order that the whole position should be put upon a uniform basis.  The exemption was accidentally&mdash;if I may put it that way &mdash;granted because of the fact that the poor rate machinery had been found to be a suitable and desirable machinery <Col N="958" /> for the collection of the general rates, and this exemption went with the introduction of the poor rate machinery. We have heard about the heavy burdens placed on the local authorities, but to assist them in meeting those burdens substantial help has been given by the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>If the Minister's statement were quite correct presumably one of the enactments that should be amended was the one of 1930 which he mentions.  In order to offset this particular enactment of 1930 he proceeds to say in the course of this motion&mdash;the very first Resolution&mdash;&ldquo;that the several enactments specified in the Schedule to this Resolution shall be repealed as on and from the 1st day of April, 1935, to the extent mentioned in the third column of that Schedule.&rdquo;  The first one that is mentioned is the Grand Jury (Ireland) Act, 1836.  The second is the County Treasurers (Ireland) Act, 1838. The third is the Poor Relief (Ireland) Act, 1838.  The fourth is the County Dublin Grand Jury Act, 1844.  The fifth is the Grand Jury Cess Act, 1846, and lastly, the Dispensary Houses (Ireland) Act, 1879.  There is no mention of the Act which the Minister says that this <Col N="959" /> particular Resolution proposes to offset. The second paragraph says &ldquo;that every exemption from stamp duty arising under any enactment (whether public, general, local or private) by virtue of the incorporation, application or extension by such enactment of any of the enactments to be repealed in pursuance of this Resolution shall cease to have effect as on and from the 1st day of April, 1935.&rdquo;  There is still no mention of this inadvertent clause in the Act of 1930.  The third paragraph makes no reference to it either.  In order to catch the particular inadvertence which took place in 1930 we have to go back 98 years, to ensure that this money is going to be got from the Corporations of Dublin, Limerick and Cork.  Only a short time ago this evening a concession was granted to a firm down in Cork.  If they read this they will know the value of concessions as far as this Ministry is concerned.  If they have a dispute with a Department of State the Minister can make himself a court over and above the Supreme Court when and if he comes into conflict in the court with any citizen, corporation, company or anyone else.  We should like the Minister to give us a little more information about the Act of 1930, which is not mentioned here, and why it is necessary, in order to catch it, to rope in Acts passed 80 or 90 years ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon:</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle at stake is not as to whether one corporation will pay taxes and another corporation will not.  The principle at stake to my mind in this Resolution is whether or not the writ of the Supreme Court runs in this country.  Is it the intention of the Fianna Fáil Administration to notify all cumain that there is no use embarking on litigation with the Revenue Commissioners, because, if any advantage is enshrined in the Statutes of the Oireachtas in favour of the citizen as against the Revenue Commissioners, the vindication of those rights or privileges will immediately be dealt with by the introduction of <i>ad hoc</i> legislation to withdraw them?  That is the principle at issue here.  To my mind, it is the only fundamental principle at issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="960" /> The Minister may have other highfalutin' intentions at the back of his mind, but the popular interpretation of this Resolution will be that litigation with the Revenue Commissioners is not going to be allowed except in those cases where the Revenue Commissioners win.  We have here a Schedule of Acts which have been repealed, or I should say, parts of which have been repealed.  The Minister does not bother to inform the House what the effect of each of these repeals is going to be, except in so far as they apply to the County Boroughs of Dublin, Limerick and Dun Laoghaire.  I take it that the Grand Jury (Ireland) Act, 1836, had general application all over the country; that the County Treasurers (Ireland) Act was similarly of general application; that the Poor Relief (Ireland) Act, Section 96, was of general application; and that the same applies to the County Dublin Grand Jury Act, the Grand Jury (Cess) Act and the Dispensary Houses (Ireland) Act.  This system of legislation by reference is extremely confusing, because the House will remember that these Resolutions were placed upon our desks after the House had met today.</P>

      <P>I have reason to complain that the Minister has come to the <Col N="961" /> House with a message, the full significance of which was, I think, understood to repeal only a section which the House does not at the moment understand.  If the Minister searches amongst his papers, in all probability he will find a brief informing him what the effect of the repeal is.  When he has given that information to the House we will be in a position to judge whether, in fact, the application of this Resolution is wider than he has led us to believe.  Remember he has told us that it applies in the case of three county boroughs.  My statement is that repeal of the Resolution will have a far wider application.  I oppose this Resolution on the ground that it amounts to an overruling of the Supreme Court of the country; that generally it notifies citizens that they may not litigate with the Revenue Commissioners; and also on the grounds that we have here a large Schedule of repeals of statutes which the Minister does not understand and which the House does not understand.</P>

      <P>The Minister more or less took exception to Deputies endeavouring to find out what the position is, and he suggested that an elaborate discussion might be more satisfactory, if it took place at another stage.  That might be quite so, but one of the things which drives Deputies to the kind of question Deputy Cosgrave asked is the fact that the Government put these Resolutions before the House with absolutely no explanation as to what they are about. Not only that but Ministers approach the House with an air of resentment if they are questioned with regard to them.  One of the reasons why that <Col N="962" /> resentment on the part of Ministers grows is that for a long time they have taken the attitude, to a considerable extent, of paying no attention to the House or to those wanting information. The Minister put Resolutions before the House to-day without going to the trouble of finding out what their effect will be on the County Boroughs of Dublin, Cork and Dun Laoghaire or on the county councils.  He gave the explanation that this measure was brought in to undo an amount of injustice inadvertently done to the revenue when the consolidated rate was made in Dublin.  He would hide from the House the fact that he is by Resolution taking certain rights from the County Boroughs of Cork and other local authorities that they had up to the present.  The Minister shakes his head.  The Minister could have explained if that was so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>The House listened attentively to the few words of the Minister and heard in his subsequent explanation of the Limerick Bill that a change would have to be made.  The Minister put the Limerick Bill before the House, giving a new light on the court decision on certain privileges and powers of the Limerick Corporation, without indicating that they would have to be withdrawn for any reason at any particular time.  If the Minister shakes his head and says that neither from Cork, Waterford nor any other local authorities, except the County Boroughs of Dublin, Limerick and Dun Laoghaire, no rate held by them already is being withdrawn, I should like to hear the Minister explicity saying so.  On the other hand, if there are some local authorities as well as Dublin, Limerick and Dun Laoghaire which will lose some rates, what are they, and what is it going to cost them?</P>

I do not say that no local authority will be <Col N="963" /> affected other than Dublin, Limerick and Dun Laoghaire and other local authorities that collected their rates by the poor rate machinery, but there are others to which it does not apply.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Resolution, we are told that it is a passion for uniformity which, in relation to a matter of £2,000, to date from 1st April next, drives the Minister to bring in a Financial Resolution which we have to take in the ordinary way of Financial Resolutions, that is to say, debate in this way without a <i>prima facie</i> case really being made, and wait for the Bill for further information. That procedure is usually adopted where there is some principle at stake or some urgency about stopping people from going into court with similar cases.  But the Minister tells us that the whole matter of this exemption will amount to £2,000.  What we are repealing is phrased very vaguely&mdash;&ldquo;every exemption from stamp duty arising under any enactment, whether public, general, local or private...&rdquo; Has the Minister passing before what he calls his mind a flare of these Acts, public, general, local or private, containing these exemptions from stamp duty by reason of the enactment of the matters now being repealed?  At any rate, he puts himself on record in this House as saying that £2,000 is the full amount.  It is not quite clear that it is not a passion for uniformity, it is not the money, it is not the question of urgency; that it is none of these things that is irking the Minister, but clearly this: that a case was fought and that a case was won by the ratepayers and the Minister must go into court at a fairly early opportunity in order to declare that the version adopted by the Supreme Court of the particular <Col N="967" /> resolution passed here is the wrong one, and that people may see that, even if the Revenue Commissioners were adjudged to be wrong in a particular matter, he thinks it right to come at the earliest possible moment and give them their justification?</P>
      <P>I should like to know what was the sum involved in costs in the particular case fought and won by the ratepayers on which this whole matter turns.  The Minister, I hope, will do that on the next stage.  He says the Supreme Court have found a particular thing; but that the Supreme Court clearly did not realise the intentions of the Dáil when passing the particular measure he referred to&mdash;the 1930 one. The Supreme Court never would pay any heed to what would be described as intentions; they look at what is before them and interpret it.  The Minister might, at any rate, have given us an indication of, say, how clearly it could be demonstrated that there was inadvertence in respect of which we have this series of six statutes flung at us dating from 1838.  We are told, first of all, that these are the pivotal matters.  Then we are told that really they did not matter; but only the 1930 Act and something later.  Does it not start out from the whole circumstances, the infinitesimal value of the sum involved; the fact that there is no urgency&mdash;none revealed to us; and, in making the case, the fact that the High Court judgment and the Supreme Court judgment played some part in the Minister's opening remarks? Is it not clear that the whole thing is intended as a warning: Do not take the Revenue Commissioners to court, because, if you do, you may cause greater damage than you know; you may get a particular enactment repealed in a particular way; that something of this general nature of exemption from stamp duty arising out of any enactment&mdash;public, general, local or private&mdash;by reason of the incorporation of these things we are now repealing, ceases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, if he wanted to pay some respect to the Supreme Court, if he wanted to show that this was not <Col N="968" /> deliberately or definitely aimed at them, that this was not a driving forward by the Revenue Commissioners, zealous in their duty, and wanting to be justified for what they have done, would have explained to us that there was inadvertence and how it arose, and given to us the text of the measure which would clearly demonstrate the inadvertence.  Instead of that, he says that we know what the wishes of the Oireachtas were on these occasions. Personally I do not know what the wishes of the Oireachtas were on the occasion of the 1930 Act, or whatever Act is being talked of.  We have no reference to the circumstances under which it was passed; no reading of the text that would demonstrate clearly that we, who have the right to look at intentions, could now say: &ldquo;That is a good case; we did mean something else; the Supreme Court not looking at intentions, which they are not asked to do, have found that the law incorporates something else, and we have to amend that.&rdquo;  But for the sake, mind you, of preserving the institution of the court system, and for the sake of preserving also this right of the citizen to go to law even against a powerful corporation like the Revenue Commissioners, we oppose this.  I think in a matter of £2,000, there is indecent haste in rushing in here with a finance measure to amend the Act when in the ordinary way the change will come into operation on the 1st April next.  Why did not the Minister amend the original Finance Act?  That would be the ordinary way of doing it.  There is a way in which it could be done with dignity.  That would demonstrate that the court system was right.  We also would have the right to say here that that is not what it is to be in the future.  That would have been the way in which the matter should have been approached.  Instead of that, we have this thunderbolt in a matter of about £2,000 and then we have this justification of the Finance Department acting through the Revenue Commissioners while it is quite clear that that is what it means.</P>

    <P>1.  That Section 11 of the Finance Act, 1930 (No. 20 of 1930), shall not apply or have effect in relation to duty under Section 13 of the Finance Act, 1920, as amended by the Finance <Col N="971" /> Act, 1926 (No. 35 of 1926), paid in respect of any year or part of a year subsequent to the year 1934.</P>
    <P>2.  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    <P>This Resolution proposes to repeal Section 11 of the Finance Act of 1930. That Act granted a rebate of 25 per cent. of the annual motor licence duty to be paid on private cars which were registered in Saorstát Eireann on the 30th April, 1930, and were, on the 1st January, 1931, five years' old and upwards. The concession was originally introduced as an experiment and was limited to cars which, at the date of the concession, were five years' old and upwards.  By the terms on which it was granted, no concession was given to cars which became five years' old in the subsequent years.  The concession involves a loss to the Road Fund of about £15,000 per annum.  It is difficult to administer and it is quite illogical. The proportion of cars over five years' old now which are not receiving the concession is growing.  As I said, this concession was originally introduced as an experiment.  It is now proposed to withdraw it.</P>

      <P>This, apparently, is the ingenious way in which the Minister proposes to find money for the financing of operations under Financial Resolution No. 1.  We discussed earlier to-day the ultimate effect on motor users of the proposals contained in Financial Resolution No. 1.  We suggested that the Minister was not going to allow the revenue to suffer any loss and that motor users would be called upon to pay, over the running expenses, a sum substantially more than £300,000 a year.  The first cost of the Minister's experiment is now, apparently, to be met by withdrawing certain concessions given to persons who run old cars.  These are to be called upon to provide £15,000 a year as the first step in developing the <Col N="972" /> Ministerial proposals under Financial Resolution No. 1.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did most of the &ldquo;supposing&rdquo; in those days.  He &ldquo;supposed&rdquo; a lot about the benefit which would accrue from this concession and he wept over the misfortunes of the people who had to use cars with old engines.  I should have thought that in the Fianna Fáil paradise there would not be 7,000 cars with engines as old as the 1st January, 1926. These must be near breaking-up point. Will not this particular section run itself out very soon?  Is there not a possibility that there will be definite unfairness worked if the section is amended as proposed?  I do not think that it was intended that these cars should only get the rebate if they remained in the hands of the same possessor.  The engine had to be of a certain date and it had to be registered here, but there could have been <Col N="973" /> a change in ownership.  People may have bought secondhand cars of this type because of the rebate.  That type of sale may have come off recently and now the purchasers are to be charged this 25 per cent.  That is only one side of the question and I think the section might as well be allowed to run itself out.  It is not going to do a great deal of harm.  In the present circumstances, surely there is some relation between the necessity for free beef and an ancient motor car.  The Minister for Agriculture boasted here the other night that the population of Dublin was now divided into classes.  Whereas there used to be a certain percentage which bought beef which they ate, the percentage now getting beef free is one and a half times that which used to eat the beef which they purchased.</P>
      <P>Surely we ought not to deprive the unfortunate owners of cars dating before 1926 of the little bit of rebate they are getting.  Would the Minister answer the question as to whether this is accidentally joined to the Financial Resolution dealing with oil refining?</P>

      <P>It seems to me a very trifling matter; it was supported by the then Opposition.  It may not be trivial in the sense of working wrongly from the Minister's point of view.  I suggest that equity demands that some better notice should be given than to come in at this time of day with a Finance Resolution that may involve certain hardships upon <Col N="975" /> people who bought second-hand cars believing that they would get this benefit.  There is no great case made for taking this remission away.  The Minister appears to think that the effect on the Exchequer is of no moment.  If that is so is it worth while to go on with this proposal? Should the Minister not reconsider it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that this remission is illogical and he wants to take it away because of its lack of logic.  But could he not provide a way to make it logical other than by removing this concession. The real logic would be to charge the owners of all cars a low rate of duty, and to extend that concession to include cars that are less than five years old.  Here is a proposition by the Minister which hits definitely the major part of 7,000 people who, owing to their circumstances have to run old cars.  These are people less able to bear the tax which is now going to be put on them.  This cancelling of the remission will have a considerable effect in a great many cases in deciding whether people will continue using their cars or whether they will have to give them up.  The Minister comes along and really says they will have to give them up.  A great many of these old cars will be practically unsaleable in the condition in which they are.  The Minister is doing a real hardship to a great many motor owners who are unable to afford the extra taxation and who are even now running old cars at considerable expense because their running charges are higher on these old cars.  These people were only partially able to stand the cost of running these cars because of the remission.  It is most illogical for a member of the Government to come along and say he aims at being logical by removing this concession. If he wanted to be logical he should extend the concession to all other cars.</P>

      <P>I should like to join in pointing out the extremely fallacious logic of the Minister for Finance. He desires to remove an anachronism whereby certain cars which are now <Col N="976" /> nine years' old will cease to enjoy benefit that they were first scheduled to enjoy.  He says it is illogical that one body of cars should enjoy this privilege on the ground that they are more than five years' old and in addition to have a further number of cars that are now five years' old having no benefit.  The Minister proposes to remove that anomaly by depriving everyone of the benefit.  Of course the logic would be for Oireachtas Eireann to decide that a certain privilege granted to cars manufactured before 1926 should now be enjoyed by all.  I agree that the same treatment should be meted out to cars that are now five years' old as was meted out four years ago to cars that were five years' old when the general conditions of the country were much better than they are now. There is an added element in the Minister's argument which invalidates it still further and it is this that whether the Minister thinks it was well to take this course in 1930 or not the course was taken by Oireachtas Eireann attaching certain exemptions to those motor cars.  Hundreds of people bought these cars in the knowledge that their upkeep would not be so expensive as modern cars because of this tax rebate that they were to enjoy.  It is quite conceivable that many people paid a little more for cars of this description because they knew that they were buying cars that were to be subject to tax exemption as well.  Now, without any reference to those contracts of sale which have taken place in large numbers, where the parties to the contract were probably people in straitened circumstances, we are going to withdraw that benefit arbitrarily and impose upon them what will be, for them, quite a substantial additional expenditure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting the case of the people who acted on the word of this House and who are now being betrayed in a way that no private individual would dare to betray them because he would render himself liable to an action for damages.  We are proposing to do by legislation something that is mainly contrary to equity and contrary to common justice, because we are altering an essential and important term in a contract entered into by persons in straitened circumstances who probably went to the limit of their resources in embarking on a conflict with the law.  The third case made by the Minister is absurd, because the evil he purports to correct here is not a continuing evil; it is a diminishing evil. It is an evil which will eliminate itself in a comparatively short period of time. There are at present 7,000 cars which were built prior to 1925.  They are now nine years old, and I think we can safely say that with the exception of perhaps a dozen they will all be on the discard heap in another five years.  Let us give them an average term of five years.  So that the net effect of this Financial Resolution is this: We are going to put a tax of £12 10s. per head on 7,000 persons who are admittedly in straitened circumstances, because they could not afford a new car and had to buy or keep a very old car in order to get this concession.  We are going to alter the term of their contract, which they regarded as vital when they entered into it and considering their capacity to keep it, and we are going to secure for the Exchequer a sum of about £15,000 per annum, which is going to be a diminishing asset&mdash; steadily diminishing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking into consideration the advantages that are going to accrue from this course of conduct, and the serious individual hardship that this is going to give rise to, and the rotten principle that we should by legislation alter the term of a contract, I suggest to the Minister that the sensible thing and the decent thing to do is to drop this Financial Resolution.  There is no question of a continuing evil.  There is a fixed period to the continuation of this impost, and I urge strongly on the <Col N="978" /> Minister that it would be a sensible gesture&mdash;I might even say, to tempt him, a generous gesture&mdash;if he dropped this Financial Resolution and let things go on as they are in the certainly that time will achieve his purpose far more effectively than anything that this Resolution can do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 7,000 cars or owners of cars, the Minister said, to be affected by this Resolution.  These 7,000 cars are held mainly by people who purchased second-hand cars in recent years because, obviously, they could not afford a better car.  Some of them, perhaps, are held by men who originally were in a position to buy some sort of a motor-car but who, very probably, are in the position latterly that once the car they now possess disappears they never will own another. Conceivably, some of them might have been purchased by farmers.  There were a few farmers in 1926 who were in a position to buy a motor-car.  I should think that none of them is in a position to buy one now.  But there are a few of them that are held up by farmers and driven once or twice a year and kept in some sort of condition in case a possible purchaser might come for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are very few farmers who possess any sort of car, even one of those old bone-shakers. However, there are a few.  There are, conceivably, some members of the working classes also who possess some of these old cars and take out their friends for a drive on a Sunday.  Conceivably, they might even take for a drive the class referred to by Deputy McGilligan&mdash;the recipients of free beef. I daresay that an odd jolt in a motor car of this description would be very good for the livers of these people and <Col N="979" /> I think it would be a shame to deprive them of it.  Mainly, I want to convey to the Minister that the real reason for the introduction of this motion is that he hopes to get £15,000.  It is a very vain hope.  I warn him that if he passes this, although the life of these 7,000 cars may possibly be prolonged for a few years, the date of the conveyance of most of these motor cars to the scrap heap will be considerably advanced; most of them will reach the pit within the coming year and the Minister's chance of getting a very small part of his £15,000 will have vanished.</P>
      <P>I would seriously advise the Minister that, for his own sake and for the sake of the Treasury, he should drop this Resolution because I, for one, believe that if this motion is passed a great deal of the revenue from these old cars will disappear.  That is, I think, the best argument one can offer against this motion, outside of the sentimental argument that poor people who chanced to come into possession of one of these bone-shakers should not be the people for the Minister to select in order to deprive them of some of the advantages that previous legislation gave them.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That it is expedient that a tribunal be established for inquiring into certain definite matters of urgent public importance, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the grading, packing and marking of fruit and vegetables by the producers thereof;</P>
      <P>(b)  the facilities provided by local authorities or otherwise afforded for the marketing of fruit and vegetables, and the conditions under which those commodities sold;</P>
      <P>(c)  whether the conditions under which fruit and vegetables are prepared for market and are subsequently marketed are such as to affect adversely the returns obtained by the producers of those commodities;</P>
      <P>(d)  whether the sale of imported fruit and vegetables should be prohibited unless sold in packages or other containers marked &ldquo;imported&rdquo;; and</P>
      <P>(e)  the steps, if any, which should be taken&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  to require producers to grade, pack and mark their fruit and vegetables in a manner to be prescribed by law,</P>
      <P>(ii)  to provide marketing facilities which will secure to the producer an equitable return for fruit and vegetables, either by regulation of existing markets or by the provision and subsequent regulation of new markets or by a system of direct dealing between producers and consumers, whether individually or collectively, and</P>
      <P>(iii)  to require that the sale, whether by wholesale or retail, of imported fruits and vegetables of specified kinds should be prohibited unless the packages or other containers thereof are marked &ldquo;imported.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been alleged for some time past by wholesalers and retailers of vegetables and fruit, that home-grown <Col N="986" /> fruit is neither packed, graded nor marketed in as good a condition as it should be and, for that reason, considerable difficulty has been caused to those concerned in the marketing of home-grown fruit.  On the other hand, it has been alleged by the growers that they are not getting the facilities for marketing fruit and vegetables hitherto afforded to imported fruit and vegetables; and it has been complained by growers, and, to some extent, by consumers, that the difference in prices between the price the producers receive and the consumers pay is far too wide and is not justified. Of course, it is extremely difficult to decide all these matters, and to know who is right and who is wrong; whether complaints are justified, partly justified, or not justified at all. With the approval of the Government, it appears to me that the only fair thing to all interests concerned is to get a tribunal to inquire into these matters.  As Deputies are aware, a tribunal can call evidence and can call for the production of documents, and will then be in a position to find out whether the allegations made by producers, wholesalers and consumers are true or not.  It is accordingly proposed to set up this tribunal of inquiry. There are a few other matters which it would be well to have investigated while the tribunal is sitting.  With regard to imported fruit, complaints under that heading have been few, but there have been some complaints that, for instance, imported tomatoes are sold as home-grown tomatoes.  The tribunal will be able to find out whether that is true or not.  The tribunal can investigate all the charges and allegations, can report upon them, and can make recommendations for dealing with the fruit business in future.  The tribunal to be set up will have much the same power with regard to the taking and compelling of evidence as the High Court.  On the whole, I think, that is a better form of inquiry than say the ordinary commission.  I recommend the Resolution to the House.</P>

      <P>I find myself in regard to this Resolution in the most extraordinary <Col N="987" /> position, because I agree with almost every word the Minister for Agriculture has said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is something wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon:</NameTxt>
      <P>I almost feel as if there is something wrong.  I agree that a great many of the allegations made in regard to the fruit trade require investigation and that it is extremely difficult to satisfy one's mind as to whether the allegations which are made of abuse in respect of the wholesaling of fruit are true or false.  It will undoubtedly be in the public interest to have the fullest possible inquiry into the whole question to establish definitely what would be a fair proportion of the price to go to the producer and to the distributor.  I think the Minister will probably find that there is foundation for the allegation that foreign tomatoes are being offered for a sale as home grown; and I think that is an abuse that ought to be rigorously dealt with.  I am glad that the commission will be instructed to inquire as to the best means of securing differentiation in marketing between the home grown and the foreign article.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other matter that I think the commission might have been invited to examine, and that is, the most effective means whereby the cultivation of fruit and vegetables might be promoted, because, as the House is aware, there is an enormous industry in the North of France and in the Channel Islands in both fruit and vegetables, which are cultivated there on the intensive system and for which there is an enormously remunerative market in England, and indeed in our own cities. Intensive cultivation of that kind is not being carried on so far as I am aware in this country and, of course, it does require a high degree of technical skill and a comparatively large investment of capital.  I believe it would be well worth having an expert examination of the question as to how capital might be made available to comparatively small farmers with a view to making it possible for them to engage in this <Col N="988" /> intensive form of market gardening; how best to ensure that persons who would make this investment and embark on this particular kind of trade would be provided with the technical education which is absolutely essential if it is to be successfully undertaken. I want to emphasise that, because if this intensive market gardening were undertaken by our people in a haphazard way it would involve these people in heavy losses.  It is not at all like ordinary farming or, indeed, like ordinary market gardening.  It is a highly technical and extremely difficult operation which, when carried out efficiently, is very remunerative and which has a number of by-products, if I may call them that, which can be turned to very profitable account.  One such byproduct is the spent manure.  In this high pressure-market gardening you have to use enormous quantities of fresh manure.  It becomes unsuitable for the intensive work after it is cool manure; but it is invaluable for ordinary topdressing purposes.  So that the industry is one of great value. This matter is closely associated with the Terms of Reference set out on the Order Paper, and I suggest to the Minister that he might think it desirable, either to set up a departmental committee in the Department of Agriculture to look into that question, or to add that question to the Terms of Reference of this commission, and invite them to make suggestions to him whereby to promote this very desirable branch of agriculture in the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the proposal of the Minister to set up this tribunal because, unlike these long-winded commissions that sit for years and hardly ever submit a unanimous report, I think this is the best way to get the facts from the people who are able to furnish the facts to the Ministry and, therefore, guide the Ministry in organising the people concerned upon proper lines.  It is rather unfortunate that the growers of fruit and vegetables in this country are completely unorganised, unlike other countries which are in a position to export fruit and vegetables to this country which <Col N="989" /> need not be imported if our own growers were properly organised and had some Department of State to guide them and some better means than are at present available to enable them to dispose of the produce to better advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose I may assume that the individuals who will compose this tribunal are the members of the present Tariff Commission.  At any rate, I should like to hear from the Minister if that is so.  If not, I hope that people who are regarded as real experts, outside the Government Departments, will either be asked to sit on the tribunal or give evidence before it.  If the tribunal is to consist of the three members of the present Tariff Commission, I think the Minister, if he thinks it advisable, should say something as to the policy of the Government from the point of view, for instance, of whether they agree that a marketing board for internal purposes is essential in existing circumstances.  In the case of a large body of people&mdash;fruit growers and those who grow vegetables for sale&mdash;I think it is much more desirable, where these people are unorganised, that you should have some kind of State organisation like a marketing board to enable them to dispose of their produce to better advantage and at a profit instead of the present haphazard way of getting a market here and there for what they produce.  There is no organised idea in the minds of the fruit growers here as far as I can see, especially when one considers the way in which the small farmers or fruit growers in some of the small Continental countries are catered for and the way they are able to organise their business.  There is a clear case, in my opinion, for the establishment of a marketing board, and if the members of the tribunal are to be those comprising the Tariff Commission, I think it is absolutely essential, in view of the fact that they are civil servants, that the Minister should express some view or convey his view, if not through the medium of this House, certainly by way of memorandum to the individuals concerned, before they start the work <Col N="990" /> that is now being given to them by this motion.</P>
    <P>I have been told that foreign apples imported here&mdash;and there is a considerable quantity imported&mdash;hardly ever come here direct.  They are landed in another country and are subject to charges which would not have to be imposed if imported direct. The consumer is naturally the person who has to pay for disadvantages of that kind.  I do not know if this tribunal, whether it consists of civil servants or outsiders, is going to be in a position to find any way out of that difficulty.  At any rate, if apples are to be imported in future it is desirable that they should be imported direct, if it is possible to have that done.  Deputy McGilligan may have some useful advice to tender to the Minister in regard to the work of this tribunal.  At any rate I should like to hear what he has to say in connection with the matter from the experience which he has had as Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <P>I am not exactly accepting that invitation.  At any rate, I never remember an occasion on which it was proposed to set up a tribunal on which Deputy Davin was not the first in the field with vague complaints as to prices and conditions and facilities, or the absence of them.  But in his usual way he put the cart before the horse.  The Minister asks that there should be a marketing board.</P>

That is the trouble where people rush in with a motion with preconceived ideas.  The Minister gave the Deputy a good lead <Col N="991" /> in the matter of prices.

The Minister is attempting to get this House, this deliberate Assembly, to pass a resolution &ldquo;that it is expedient that a tribunal be established for inquiring into certain definite matters of urgent public importance.&rdquo;  We should hear the case made for that motion.  Complaints were made by Deputy Davin and others, but &ldquo;it is hard to decide whether the complaints were justified or not.&rdquo;  That is what the Minister said.  Later on he said they had a few complaints and he asked us to establish this tribunal to inquire into certain definite matters.  Deputy Davin will agree, of course, that they are matters of urgent public importance.</P>

It is clear, if we are going to get the results about which the Minister talks, that it must be on a different basis from the existing Prices Commission.  The Minister talked about this being established under some Act of 1925.  Is it not the Act which is called the Tribunal Evidence Act?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says he wants the fullest possible inquiry. That will entail publicity.  It will entail that there should be some better method of eliciting information than what we have got at the Prices Commission.  There, we have only the chairman allowed to ask questions and, if he likes to close down on a particular matter, nobody else can open that.  I would like to have it assented to here by the Minister that when this question is going to be discussed we should say that the evidence, if it is to be properly collected, will require that the chairman should be a man who understands what evidence is and the method of eliciting it.  There are serious matters to be considered&mdash;the grading, packing and marketing of fruit and vegetables by the producers thereof.  That is a matter in which the chairman will have to rely on the evidence given by the producers and the corresponding evidence by those who buy.  Now we come to the facilities provided or otherwise afforded by local authorities for the marketing of fruit and vegetables and the conditions under which those commodities are sold.  That happens to be a biggish question.  Next we come to the third matter: whether the conditions under which fruit and vegetables are prepared for market and are subsequently marketed are such as to affect adversely the returns obtained by the producers.  That is a matter the calculations on which can only be arrived at after the proper evidence has been given.  The more accurate the report we get the fuller and the more searching it will be.  The last matter is to be determined by another body, but it it relevant that this particular body should deal with it also, that is whether the sale of imported fruit and vegetables should be prohibited unless sold in packages or other containers marked &ldquo;imported.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Referring to recent examples given us by some meetings of the Prices Commission which was set up under the Tribunal of Inquiry Act, this tribunal has amongst other powers the power of authorising representation before it of any person seeming <Col N="993" /> to be interested, by either solicitor or counsel or other person speaking on that person's behalf.  It has also power to refuse to allow such representation. I wonder if the Minister would consider that this is a matter of sufficiently big importance to necessitate the appearance before that tribunal of people who will be able not merely to elicit information from the witnesses on their own but also to get from them in cross-examination additional evidence.  This is the type of tribunal before which it is desirable that there should be cross-examination of the witnesses.</P>
    <P>I submit that the evidence will not be properly got if the precedent set up by the Prices Commission will be followed&mdash;in which the chairman only can ask questions.  If it is left to the witnesses concerned before that commission to make their own case, what will happen is that as soon as they give their evidence they will fade out. That is as soon as they have got rid of whatever information they have to give they will fade out.  I am sure Deputy Davin will agree that it is desirable that the whole thing should be as searching as possible.  The individual market gardener or tradesman cannot present a case or give us the information that we would look for afterwards.  This is going to fit into the frame of the Tribunal of Inquiry, and the phrase I have quoted is from that.  Such a tribunal set up under this Act may, or may not allow representation of the type to which I have alluded.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to indicate to us that it will be his advice or instruction to the commission that such representation should be allowed and a method of examination and cross-examination other than the examination by the chairman should be in practice.  I think it is only when we get a report from the commission like that that we will be able to determine whether or not the setting up of a marketing board is essential.  Deputy Davin has the feeling that the people who produce fruit and vegetables in this country are entirely unorganised.  Even if they are the immediate reaction to that is <Col N="994" /> not to say that we must have a marketing board.  It will be far better if these people organised themselves than that they should be organised by a Government Department. It would be much better to have them organise themselves than to have some other body of the type that has been suggested pushed in and interpose in organising them.  With these reservations in relation to examination of witnesses and representation, I am entirely in favour of the tribunal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that this tribunal would not be the proper body to examine the point as to intensive cultivation of fruit and vegetables. A different type of body, consisting of experts from that point of view, would be required for that task.  I am of opinion that the tribunal required in the present case is a tribunal in the habit of looking at things from the judicial, rather than from the expert, point of view.  On that account, it is intended to ask members of the Tariff Commission to compose the tribunal.  If they consent to act, we shall have a tribunal which has carried out two investigations under the Tribunal (Evidence) Act&mdash;the investigation which took place about 1931 into the mixture of maize with home-grown cereals and the investigation that took place last year into the pig and bacon trade. The chairman of that tribunal on both occasions will, if he consents to act, be chairman of this tribunal and I do not think that anything in the nature of what Deputy McGilligan mentioned is to be feared.  I remember that on, at least, one occasion before this tribunal, people were permitted to be represented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  At the time, I was somewhat surprised that representation was allowed.  I was told, at that time, that the tribunal did not intend to refuse to allow representation except where it was sought to put forward trivial evidence to hold up the <Col N="995" /> work of the tribunal.  I do not think the tribunal would refuse for any other reason.  I think we may assume that the chairman who conducted these two investigations will permit fair representation to anybody who has a case to put forward.  Deputy McGilligan made the point that this does not appear to be a matter of urgent public importance.  It is necessary under the Act to use those words.</P>

Even though it was not tackled for the last ten or twelve years, it is still as urgent as it was in 1921, and there is no doubt that it is of public importance.  The difference between a commission and a tribunal is one of powers.  Though the personnel might be the same, there is a difference as regards powers and that is why we have chosen this form of tribunal.  Members of the Tariff Commission will be asked to act.  I have no reason to think that they will refuse. If they consent, we shall have at least two members who acted before on these tribunals, and who will have had experience of conducting this type of investigation.</P>

      <P>What I put to the Minister is that whatever policy actuated him in treating these bodies of merchants differently at different times, he ought, at the earliest opportunity, to take such steps as are necessary to right the matter, if he can do that, by inducing his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to introduce such legislation as may be necessary to authorise the Revenue Commissioners to pay back to those merchants the duty on bootlaces or so <Col N="999" /> much of it as they had paid.  So far as I am aware, there is no satisfactory authority for the Revenue Commissioners to pay back revenue once it is collected.  What they can do, under the existing law, in regard to collected revenue which the Minister decides should not have been collected in equity, is to give the merchant the information and say we will excuse you from payment of revenue in future in a sum which will be equal to what we would wish to remit now but for the fact that we have no statutory authority to do so.  Of course the Minister can get around that difficulty by introducing <i>ad hoc</i> legislation to deal with the matter.  I suggest to him that having himself created this situation according to his variation in the effect of his treatment of different citizens, it is for him to remedy that matter, and the only effective way to remedy it is to repay, in one way or another, to the consignee those duties or so much duty as the Revenue Commissioners calculate they ought to have.</P>

      <P>I am indeed astonished that Deputy Dillon should have the audacity to refer again to-day to the charges he made here last week.  Last week he took me by surprise; he gave me no intimation of his intention to raise any matter arising out of this or any other duty.  He made allegations to the effect that applications for licences were either granted or refused which I had no direct means of verifying.  I stated the general situation but made no reference to individual cases.  Since that I have had the opportunity of ascertaining the facts in individual cases, and have realised how scandalous was the whole of the attack that Deputy Dillon made here upon the administration of the Department of Industry and Commerce. I discovered that not merely were the things stated by him misrepresentations, but that he was aware, and had been officially informed by my Department, of the position in respect of the issue of licences for the goods in question.  Deputy Dillon said here his firm was refused a licence to import those goods, and he implied that the <Col N="1000" /> refusal was based upon political corruption.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>
      <P>It implied the Government was politically corrupt and gave preference to one firm that it refused to another on political grounds.  The Deputy mentioned his firm and stated that they were refused licences.  He did not mention that a week or ten days later he received from my department an official communication informing him that the policy in consequence of which the original application for licences had been refused had been brought to an end; that the situation was thus changed and that the Department was prepared to consider an application for a licence sent in from his firm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>
      <P>You did nothing of the kind.  The Deputy said that our policy was changed in consequence of the fact that he had sent me a letter stating that he was going to raise the matter in the Dáil.  I am quoting from col. 580 of the Official Debates, 5th December, vol. 54.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There was a change of policy after the Minister had got my letter notifying him that I was going to expose him in the Dáil.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I interrupted him and said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I got no such letter, and in fact I had been expecting a letter from the Deputy.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon then said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Fortunately I have got a copy of my letter and the answer to it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I said that no such letter was sent or acknowledged by me.  He did not get any such letter, and he could not have got a copy of such a reply from me.  I challenge him here now to produce a copy of any such letter sent out to him or a reply to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon:</NameTxt>
      <P>Here is the letter in page 453 of the Official Reports, No. 3, volume 4.  I wrote to the Minister:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We have received your letter dated August 14th informing us <Col N="1001" /> that you are not prepared to recommend the issue of a licence for the free importation of elastic as supplies are available from Messrs. So-and-So, No. 12 So-and-So Street in Dublin.  We have received a letter from Messrs. So-and-So to-day offering us foreign elastic, and stating they would not be in a position to supply elastic of Saorstát manufacture for at least two months.  Speaking in Dáil Eireann recently you emphatically repudiated the suggestion that while traders were refused licences to import certain commodities free of duty other individuals who held themselves out as manufacturers were given such licences and were allowed to offer for sale that merchandise in this country.  We have been importing elastic regularly for many years and would be glad to know from you now why Messrs. So-and-So are entitled to import elastic on terms more favourable than those available to us.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I signed that letter with my own name and addressed it to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Government Buildings, Dublin.  To that letter I got a reply saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to refer to your letter of the 22nd instant ....and to inform you that the general question of the issue of licences for the free importation of elastic has been under consideration and that the Minister is now prepared to consider the issue of licences on receipt of the following particulars.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In fact I wrote and said that the Minister had given certain undertakings in Dáil Eireann and that his action was a repudiation of this undertaking.  I got a letter by return stating that the Minister had changed his mind and was going to do something else.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1003" /> And so forth.  Do these words convey to the Deputy an intimation that he was going to expose me in the Dáil and that these words were a notification to me that I was going to be exposed?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon:</NameTxt>

      <P>The direct implication is that unless that matter is cleared up I shall proceed with it, and I got an answer from you that you had changed your policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Deputy said that he had that letter in front of him, and that my version was not correct. That is the basis on which his case was built&mdash;imagination.  It is not the first time that the Deputy has tried in this House to spring something on the Government by raising a case, without previous notification, and by making wild assertions as to the facts and then running away from the facts when the Minister has had an opportunity to check them up.  The Deputy will remember how all this arose.  There was an allegation by him that there was this political corruption, as he called it, and he undertook to produce evidence of it in two weeks.  He failed to produce the evidence in two weeks. When I raised the matter again, he said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is true that I did not produce the evidence in two weeks, but I have it here now and the Minister will have it in two minutes.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not get it in two minutes.  Then came the long-talked-of case.  It consisted of the reading of a letter to the effect that his own firm had been refused a licence to import certain commodities, and an allegation that other individuals were given licences.  He was not giving us particulars of the granting of these licences.  He would not even mention <Col N="1004" /> the date upon which this supposed granting of licences took place.  There was no information whatever forthcoming from him which would enable me to check up the facts. The reason that the information was not forthcoming was because there were no facts.  The Deputy was drawing on his imagination and trying to find something to justify his monstrous charge of political corruption.  Then he tried to misrepresent the position even in the case of the one licence that had been refused.  He knew why it was refused.  It was refused because at that particular time, in pursuance of the policy decided upon by the Government, an attempt was being made to canalise the importation of these goods into this country, and one particular concern, a concern which had no previous associations with commercial trade here, a concern which was at the moment building a factory for the manufacture of these goods, was permitted to import into this country, during the interim between the imposition of the tariff and the coming into production of the new factory, up to the normal requirements of the country, on condition that they were distributed to those ordinarily engaged in distributing such goods without profit, at the same price at which these people could have secured them if the duty had not been imposed.  I agree that that system did not work and when we found that it did not work we terminated that system and notification of that termination was sent to the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>
      <P>I defy the Deputy to produce evidence of a single case, after the date of that notification, where anybody entitled to a licence was refused such licence.  I defy him to produce evidence to me of a case before that date where anybody, except one concern to whom the concession had been given, was granted that, or except in the case of a trader who actually had these goods in transit on the day that duty was imposed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, they got licences.  I stated last week that they got licences except only, in certain cases, where the quantities were abnormal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is necessary, of course, that each individual application should be examined on its merits and with a view to the requirements of the country.  There is a whole section in my Department, staffed by a number of senior officers, with no other function but to examine these applications. The Deputy throws out his charges of political corruption with great generosity.  He has got so much mud around him that he does not hesitate to sling it on the least provocation. The charge is, I suggest, to anyone who knows the system of administration in the Department of Industry and Commerce, a preposterous charge.  The Deputy tried to convey the impression of a corrupt Minister sitting in his office with a whole sheaf of licence applications coming to him one after another and deciding &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; on one application and &ldquo;No&rdquo; on another, because one application comes from a supporter of the Government and the other from an opponent.  In actual fact, the Minister rarely sees an application, and then only sees it when the officers are in some doubt as to whether it comes within the particular instructions issued by the Minister&mdash; borderline cases, in other words.  It is even much more rare that the Minister for Industry and Commerce goes into the facts in sufficient detail to enable him to dispute a recommendation sent to him by the responsible officer of his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, there are a number of senior officers in my Department, in a newly created section, dealing solely with that work, and the allegation that there is political favouritism in the issuing of licences to import goods, of course, an allegation that these officers are deliberately accepting instructions from me to exercise such favouritism.  Nobody believes it, and I do not think that Deputy Dillon himself <Col N="1006" /> believes it.  He works, however, on the old American principle that the more mud you throw the more mud is bound to stick, and he comes in here spouting out his slanders and allegations about corruption, his groundless charges against the administration of Government Departments, in the hope that some fool somewhere will believe him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, Sir, who is well known to be the most notorious bluffer and evader of issues and who finds it extremely difficult to get down to matters in hand and discuss them fairly, has lost sight of the important question we are discussing, which is whether at the eleventh hour he is prepared to restore equality between the different applicants and arrange for the refund of the duty paid by those to whom he refused a licence.  We have listened to a great deal of rhodomontade and tub-thumping about the purity of the Minister and the purity of his Department, which is largely irrelevant.  I hope at a later date to open up the whole question of the administration of cattle licences in his Department; to go into that at great length, and to reveal what I consider to be a most unsavoury and undesirable state of affairs.  I have never fully entered into that whole question of the licence administration system in connection with this Bill.  What I have endeavoured to do is to demonstrate clearly to the House that the treatment meted out to different citizens of this State under this Act has not been in conformity with equity and justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>
      <P>Produce a single case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have produced for the edification of the House the admitted case that there are a number of merchants who imported the goods referred to by those orders and paid up to 100 per cent. duty on them, while there are other merchants who imported the same goods shortly afterwards and were allowed to import them free of duty.  Accepting the Minister's explanation at its best, there are some men who have paid 100 per cent. duty and some who have not, <Col N="1007" /> for the simple reason&mdash;accepting the Minister's explanation again&mdash;that he wobbled; that he jumped in and started floundering around, according to himself, in a business which he did not understand.  Having created chaos and confusion, he eventually had to yield to the angry protests of the trade, and reverse his own policy. That is his own explanation.  All I am asking for, if this explanation be true, is that he will not allow his incompetence and folly to be the cause of grave material loss to a number of merchants who have got to earn their living, and who have a hard enough time to do it. All I ask the Minister to do is to give back or arrange to have given back to those merchants such moneys as his incompetence involved them in paying. That is a perfectly simple thing to do. There is a record of every penny that was paid by way of Customs duty on elastic and laces.  I ask the Minister to take such steps as may be necessary to get that money refunded, and then, when he has determined that he will give no more licences, let everybody pay whatever duty the Oireachtas has put on those particular commodities. Now, I invite the Minister to deal with that aspect of the situation.  On another occasion we can deal at greater length with the general question of the way in which the licences in his Department and in the Department of Agriculture are administered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not an aspect of the question at all.  There was no necessity for anybody importing any of those goods to pay duty on them unless he wanted them in abnormal quantities for the purpose of forestalling the active operation of the duty.  There was a means by which everybody could get those goods free of duty.  We merely changed the means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon:</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister has just said that there was a period when he gave nobody a licence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.  I said there was a period during which nobody got a licence except one concern <Col N="1008" /> which was going to manufacture, and that concern was charged with the responsibility of importing all that was required to supply them on demand to the firms ordinarily engaged in that business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon:</NameTxt>
      <P>Bootlaces.  The Minister will remember that when dealing with this matter before he said that those two items&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>
      <P>The same thing applied to bootlaces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon:</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister will refer to his Department he will be informed that a considerable body of merchants applied for licences, did not get them, and paid the duty.  The Revenue Commissioners are aware of that.  All I want is that such persons as have to pay that duty under the instructions of the Minister will get the duty back, so that equity and justice will be restored as between one merchant and another.  That is as clearly necessary as anything could be.  It is not fair that one man should pay 100 per cent. duty and that his neighbour, who is in competition with him, should have a stock of goods upon which no duty has been paid.  Will the Minister look into that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no power to repay a duty.  In any event the Deputy misses the point.  Negotiations for the establishment of this factory took place with the representatives of many firms.  When one particular project was encouraged to proceed, those associated with the other firms and their agents here knew quite well that a duty upon laces and elastic was coming at an early date.  Orders for abnormal quantities were solicited and placed.  The duty was imposed by an Emergency Order so as to catch those abnormal quantities coming in.  A number were caught, and duty upon the consignments had to be paid.  It is obviously <Col N="1009" /> undesirable that they should now be released from that penalty, which arose out of their utilisation&mdash;in order to forestall the action of the Government &mdash;of the knowledge they had attained through being in contact with the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon:</NameTxt>
      <P>Observe now the situation which is created! Now it is not a tariff; it is a penalty.  The Minister imposes a penalty on four or five firms in Dublin whom he consulted.  He says they used their information to forestall his whole policy and he determines that there will be a penalty. He unfortunately forgets that, in addition to imposing a penalty on those firms with whom he had entered into confidential negotiations, the penalty also hits a hundred firms that heard nothing about the negotiations&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and had no desire to embark upon them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>
      <P>No firm need have been hit.  Normal quantities came into this country free of duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon:</NameTxt>
      <P>Mind you, it is perfectly true that the two commodities concerned are of trivial value.  The amount of money involved in any case would probably not be more than £5.  It is the principle that is at stake.  I read out to the Minister a case under reference TID/1294/3046, in which a merchant sought to import bootlaces, and asked for the requisite licence. According to my information there was nothing abnormal in the order; there was nothing exceptional about it.  The Minister's Department made an inquiry as to whether the bootlaces were in transit when the order was made, or whether they were ordered subsequent to the imposition of the duty.  The merchant replied to the effect that the goods were in transit when the order was made.  The first correspondence passed on the 24th July.  On the 7th August a letter arrived to say that the Minister had considered the case in the <Col N="1010" /> light of the second letter, and was determined that he would not grant the licence.  All I want now is that equity should be done as between one person and another.  The Minister says now that he wanted to impose a penalty on four or five merchants who betrayed his confidence.  He had no right to impose that penalty on the whole commercial and mercantile community in the country, who had nothing to do with the betrayal of confidence and knew nothing about it. We have heard a number of different stories.  We have heard that there was a definite change in policy at a given time; that there were no licences before that, and licences for everybody afterwards.  Then we heard that there was a change of policy; that before that some got licences and others did not.  Lastly, we heard that the line of conduct pursued prior to the change of policy was that we would make those who betrayed our confidence sweat for having tried to forestall the order.  The Minister, in coming to that decision, makes a hundred or more perfectly innocent parties down the country, who knew nothing about his negotiations, sweat at the same time.  That is not justice, and that is not the purpose for which those powers were given to the Minister.  He was not given power to inflict penalties or punish anybody under the Imposition of Duties Act.  He was given power solely to protect industries, or take such measures as might be necessary to retaliate on Great Britain for any fiscal action she might take against this country.  He had no warrant or authority under this Act to penalise citizens of the State, and abrogate to himself the right of indicting, trying and condemning citizens of this country.  The principle is wrong&mdash; fundamentally wrong.  I put it to the Minister that he ought to take the earliest possible measures effectively to cure what has been done by restoring all the merchants of the country to a common footing of equality.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has again run off on a side wind and is trying <Col N="1011" /> to play with what I said in order to produce an entirely wrong impression in the minds of those listening to him.  Nobody in the country doing an honest trade in an honest way need have paid one penny out under any of these Acts.  In fact, more than the normal quantities imported over these periods of the year were imported free of duty.  The reason why abnormal quantities were kept out was not for the purpose of penalising individuals so much as to keep them out because the bringing in of supplies in abnormal quantities was going definitely to delay, for a very long period, the development of the industry here and keep our own people out of employment.  I am not going to stand for a few get-rich-quick individuals utilising whatever information they may get of that kind in order to make abnormal profits, at the expense of keeping a larger number of our own people out of employment.  These powers are utilised to protect the market, and to prevent it being flooded by abnormal importations, until we get our own production and they are going to be continued for that purpose.  Surely Deputies will admit that it is essential in modern conditions in this country that there should be such powers possessed by the Government so that we should not have any speculation in fiscal changes undertaken by a few individuals regardless of the national interests.</P>

      <P>The Minister was asked on December 5th for some information that would enable us to discuss the proposals contained in this Bill intelligibly in relation to the intention that he apparently has in mind, the development of Irish industry.  We are discussing in connection <Col N="1012" /> with this Emergency Order a duty of 80 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> on elastic coming in here.  The Minister was asked for certain information, and was asked if he could give any information with regard to the revenue arising.  He stated that the duty was a new one and that he was not prepared to give any other information. The information he was asked for was: &ldquo;The total number of persons employed in the manufacture of this article, and whether in fact, the duty was operating at the present time.&rdquo;  In justice to the whole subject &mdash;the development of Irish industry&mdash; the Minister should adopt a certain formula in connection with the imposition of duties.  He says that he discussed the development of elastic manufacture with a number of firms beforehand, and that one particular firm was selected.  I should like to know on what ground a particular firm was selected; what capital was going to be behind the firm; to what extent it is Irish capital; and to what extent the management will be in Irish hands.  What is the general line of goods going to be produced in this factory, and what employment does the Minister anticipate will be given?  At present, there is apparently a great deal of trouble about licences for imports.</P>

      <P>If there is none now, I should like the Minister to tell us whether there is any reason why the cost of elastic or the cost of laces, which are being made by the same firm in the same place, are at the present time higher than they were before the imposition of the duty?</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to have that information, together with information regarding the amount of employment, and the extent to which the industry is going to be developed. I take with a grain of salt the Minister's ready statement that prices have not risen.  If the Minister's insists that prices have not risen, will he say how <Col N="1013" /> long he anticipates the duties he has imposed will run, and when will he begin to refuse licences of any kind, even in a limited way?  If elastic is not being made now when will it be made?  If laces are being made, to what extent is the Minister holding up the import of laces by 50 per cent. of the normal quantity, or is going to establish a quota with regard to laces and a quota with regard to elastic, diminishing gradually as the industries develop?  He has put before us a measure which on the face of it is intended to develop a certain number of Irish industries in different parts of the country.  In a general way, he ought to give some information about them. Upto the present, he has in fact, denied any information.  On the Second Reading on December 5th, the Minister said in column 596 of the Official Debates:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The various points on which the Deputy wants information have, I think, all been dealt with more or less in the explanatory statements which were issued to the public through the Press when the various duties were imposed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The only explanatory statement I can find with regard to elastic was the simple statement:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A duty of 100 per cent. on boot, shoe and similar classes of laces, with a duty of 1/6 per gross when imported in bulk, and with a special minimum duty of 6d. per pair when imported along with footwear or articles of clothing.  A duty of 80% on braid and loom elastic not exceeding one inch in width, and on cord elastic.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the only reference to the scheme that I can find in the Press.  I submit that no statement published as a news item issued to the Press can take the place of a formal statement to the House as to the industrial plans of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the question concerning the capital or the directorate of the company or similar information about companies, I take the point of view that the Legislature has decided that it is in the public <Col N="1014" /> interest that certain information upon these points in relation to every company should be made public. There are means by which that information can be ascertained by any member of the public.  It is undesirable that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or any other Minister should utilise special knowledge that comes to him from his contact with industrial firms, to give additional information or to provide alternative sources of getting it. Information concerning the capital of the company, the shareholders, the directorate and similar things can be obtained through official channels in the ordinary way, and I do not think I am called upon to supplement that. In this particular case, the company concerned is an external one, requiring a licence under the Control of Manufacturers Act, which licence will be issued to them.  The factory which it is proposed to erect is being built at the present time but has not yet come into production.  I am not in a position to say with any precision at what date it will come into production.  A new building is being constructed, and there have been certain unforeseen delays in connection with some part of the work to be done by sub-contractors.  I have no reason to believe that the factory will not be completed and in production early in the new year.  It will not come into production completely at once.  As in the case of other industries, it is one in which the directors prefer to come into production by stages, starting off with a certain process of manufacture, working semi-manufactured materials, and gradually coming to the point when complete manufacture will be reached. The information concerning this particular concern, when complete manufacture has been reached, is that something more than 100 or 150 people will be employed in production.  From the nature of the industry I should imagine that a proportion of these people will be women unless, as a result of legislation or regulations made under any existing enactment, there is any restriction upon women being employed in such a factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1015" /> As regards the prices now being charged, the position is that all persons ordinarily engaged in the business of importing either laces or elastic are entitled to receive from the Department of Industry and Commerce a licence to import free of duty the quantity of such goods which it would be normal for them to import at this time of the year.  As in the majority of cases, I think we exercise those powers with a certain amount of generosity and allow a margin for error, so that the quantity which comes in is slightly in excess of what we had estimated the normal quantity to be.  In view of that fact, there is no justification for any higher prices being charged in consequence of the duty.  I could not say that prices have not risen for some other cause, but there should be no increase in price in consequence of the duty.  The issue of these licences will cease when the factory comes into production.  I cannot say off-hand whether it will be possible to stop them entirely and turn all inquirers to the new factory for supplies; or whether it will be necessary at that stage to regulate imports for a period until production in the factory has grown to its maximum.  In that event, the machinery of the Control of Imports Act will be utilised.  That is a matter which will arise for consideration when the equipment of the factory has been completed and early production can be contemplated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained earlier that during the initial period after this duty was imposed it was decided to confine free imports to the firm that was about to commence manufacturing on certain conditions arranged between the Department and them; that the goods would pass through them, so that importers would get them at the same price at which they would have obtained them if the duty had not been imposed.  At the same time, licences to import free of duty were given to persons who had goods in transit in normal <Col N="1016" /> quantities; licences were refused to persons who had goods coming in in abnormal quantities; and for that period of a month or so all inquirers for licences to import free of duty were referred to the particular firm that is going to manufacture and who were the channel for importation at that time. Whether duty was paid or not, I cannot say.  Presumably, some was paid; but, in any event, that situation ended at the end of August and we decided to change the system of utilising one firm as the sole importer, and from that date all persons entitled, as I said, have received licences.</P>

      <P>The Minister has been most unsatisfactory.  He has been given every possible power by this House to stop imports, to put on quotas and emergency duties&mdash;everything practically for which he asked for the purpose of developing a certain range of industries here.  In this instance, and in many other cases that he will be dealing with under Emergency Duty Orders, we are dealing with a type of industry for which only <Col N="1018" /> one firm will be set up to produce the article contemplated, because the supply necessary for the country will be only an economic supply for one firm.  You will not have room, I think, for two.  In the case of elastic, you are dealing with a commodity that, in the end, will probably be a reserved commodity, the whole market here being reserved for one firm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>
      <P>It could not be done. We have not power to make an article a reserved commodity after they have commenced manufacturing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister took power to make a commodity a reserved commodity even when the thing was being manufactured here.  If the Minister is not going to make any of these a reserved commodity, he ought to tell us plainly.  He is developing an elastic industry here and he comes in a haphazard way and gets the House to discuss the passing of an Emergency (Imposition of Duty) Order.  He should, in my opinion, having asked the House for the power to safeguard everything he wants to safeguard here in the developing of that industry, give us the fullest and frankest statement with regard to the people setting up the industry here&mdash;what their capital is, what their tradition in the manufacture of the article is&mdash;so that we can have some idea of the class of establishment it is going to be and of the type of management that is going to be in charge of the firm.  We ought to have some kind of statement as to the range of work that is going to be done by the firm, some kind of estimate of what the market in the country is for the products of that firm, as well as the general amount of employment that it is going to give and the reaction on prices.  There must be some unsatisfactory reason on the part of the Minister, or on the part of the Department, when the country does not get that information.  Personally, I want to oppose the imposition of duties in this particular way.  When large duties are put on certain articles we are told it is for the purpose of developing an industry here.  But we do not get in a systematic way a statement under a <Col N="1019" /> certain number of headings as to the position of the particular industry and its markets, or a statement as to the particular product and the effect these duties have on prices.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister must be moving in a situation in which he has no real knowledge or understanding of the position, or he is chancing his arm.  It is either that or he would come before the House and give us a reasonable statement.  No one would quarrel with the Minister if there were blanks in that statement.  But the fact here is that the Minister does not make any statement at all.</P>

I do not <Col N="1020" /> know whether I misunderstood the Minister or not.  But if the Minister did say that he is not serious.  I have no more peculiar knowledge of this than the Minister has.

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete in page 2 the reference to &ldquo;The Emergency Imposition of Duties (No. 34) Order, 1934.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Again, I ask the Minister what type of industry he anticipates will develop as a result of this Order.  Is it the type of industry that will completely meet the requirements here for buttons of all kinds?  The duty imposed is 75 per cent. ad valorem.  Is that operating at present or is it merely there as a threat?  Are the people who were importing buttons in the past getting their normal supplies under licences to import?  What sort of selection board selects the people who get these licences?  I take it that the company concerned is working under licence. What are the traditions of the company in the industry and what capital is involved?  What volume of employment will be given?  Have any special conditions been introduced into the licence dealing with wages or conditions of work?  Have aliens been brought in and what proportion of the employees do they constitute?  Generally, I ask the Minister to give us the type of statement I have outlined.  I think that is the type of statement we should receive when the Minister is trying to persuade the House that his proposal is going to develop a secure and necessary industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>
      <P>I should, perhaps, make clear at the beginning that there is nothing to prevent anybody who is prepared to do so from engaging in the manufacture of these goods without getting facilities from the Department of Industry and Commerce.  The duty was imposed when we were satisfied that one firm was going to undertake their manufacture on a reasonable scale, with the necessary competence and under circumstances which appeared to be satisfactory.  I heard quite casually that, since then, another firm had been formed to manufacture these goods.  It may, in fact, be doing so at present but I cannot say that with any certainty.  The Irish Button Manufacturing Co., with which officers of the Department of Industry and Commerce had discussions, has been established and I understand that production has commenced&mdash;but barely commenced&mdash;within the past few days. It is certainly not yet supplying anything like the requirements of the country in the classes of goods it is producing.  Before that, licences were being issued to persons ordinarily engaged in importing buttons.  Licences are still being issued, though the quantities may be subject to stricter <Col N="1023" /> supervision than was the case previously. As the firm comes into production, applicants for licences will probably be required to produce evidence that they are unable to get their requirements supplied in the quantities needed or within the time necessary from any concern within the country.</P>
      <P>The industry is of a nature similar to that established in Great Britain in so far as the materials for the manufacture of the commoner variety of buttons are imported from Italy in a somewhat manufactured condition.  In other words, there is a nut used, which is roughly cut and imported in that shape from Italy.  Other buttons are manufactured from casein and the casein is at present being imported.  At a later stage, the manufacture of casein may be commenced here, in which case the firm would be required to obtain its requirements of that material from the firm producing it here.  The industry is, of course, a comparatively small one. With modern equipment and organisation, one medium-sized concern could supply practically all our requirements in these goods.  Of course there is another firm which has been manufacturing horn buttons for a number of years past and is still continuing to do so.  All these buttons here are made from nut and casein.  The duty does not cover buttons of wood, glass, leather, mother of pearl or imitation mother of pearl.  It is confined to the ordinary buttons used in men's ready-made clothing.</P>

People going into the production of goods make their own estimate and on that basis decide to risk their money. Their assumption may be right or it may be wrong.  They have often been proved to be wrong in the past by estimating for a market smaller than proved to be there.  Much, of course, depends on the size of the market. But that is a matter upon which no figure of any kind could be given that would amount to anything better than a guess.</P>

I presume he discussed the matter with them and discovered the amount of people that might be covered by the establishment of the button industry. I expect that the Department of Industry and Commerce, issuing an Order in these circumstances, would prepare a formal statement as regards the whole position, as to its hopes and the benefits accruing and upon what it was basing its hopes, when asking the House to pass an Order on the strength of formal representations made.</P>

      <P>No, but a manufacturer going into the business would want to know what his output would be likely to be.  The Minister comes down here with a proposal for a very big tariff.  Previously he had people running this business on licence.  One man might be importing for the last 12 months and another for a year and a half.  The Minister could inquire from such people, for instance, as to what extent buttons are used in this country.  Surely the ready-made clothing people could make a case as to the number of suits they turn out.  They would put so many buttons on every coat, so many on every waistcoat and trousers and they could calculate from that, roughly, the quantity supplied to the market.  Surely that would afford an easy estimate of what the community requires.  On the other hand, only the Minister knows the prospects in regard to machinery and cost of labour, and can form a judgment as to the employment likely to be given and whether the industry will or will not prove profitable.  Again, taking it from another angle, he would be able to estimate the price to be paid by the community.  The Minister talks as if somebody informed him about the raw material to be provided in the shape of button nuts.  Is there any account of the quantity of this raw material that has been imported in the last 12 months?</P>

      <P>We do not want the individual figures here.  We want the addition of the individual figures, but the only way the Minister can get an entry on the total returns is via the individual firms.  It is mere deluding of the House to pretend that there is no touch with individual firms.  The Statistical Department, when sending out inquiries as to production and so on, do not send these inquiries to a group of firms; they send them to the individual firms.  There is not merely a promise but definite legislation to the effect that individual returns will not be published as such.  But the Minister knows that he can get individual returns and present us here with what we want.  What we want is not what the individuals are using, but what the whole industry uses.  Of course, that information can be got.  If anybody is going to discuss seriously whether an industry, such as the industry we are talking about, is necessary, they want information as to the products of that industry.  For instance, here we want information as to the number of buttons used&mdash;the commonest type of buttons.  We want to know what is the best estimate that can be got of the numbers used year by year, and after that we want some information of the capital involved and the amount of machinery that will be brought into play.  The Minister knows enough about the business to be aware that machines are playing a great part and that human labour is going out.  We want to see to what extent human labour is being replaced by machinery and we want to know what is going to be the return to the community, because the only justification of these tariffs depends on whether or not a wages fund is being created, and whether the purchasing power of the community is being renewed, and if there is a likelihood of an increase in price, as would seem to be indicated by a 75 per cent. <Col N="1029" /> tariff, then, of course, the whole thing is fatuous.</P>

I move the amendment with a view to ascertaining from the Minister what he expects in the way of industrial development in the manufacture of tape, the employment that he expects to accrue from the setting up of that industry, and whether he thinks that the imposition of this duty will result in an increase in the price of the commodity and, if so, what value he expects to get for it.

      <P>A company called the Irish Driver Harris Company, which is a branch of the American Driver Harris Company, has been formed for the purpose of manufacturing electrical wiring and cables here.  They have established a place at New Ross, but production has hardly commenced there.  At present they are only doing a small part of the process of manufacture.  It will be some time before complete manufacture can be attempted, because the machinery has not yet been installed nor have the workers been trained to undertake it.  It is not possible to state with any precision the market for the particular classes of cables that are covered in the Order, but the firm concerned are satisfied that it will prove to be such as to make economical working possible, and to give them an output from the factory established here not very far short of the output that they have secured for their factory in Great Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is a disgraceful way to treat the Minister's own proposal.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce was asked a few days ago to give information with regard to the amount of oils and fats imported, to give some information as to what revenue was being received as a result of the present duty, and whether, in fact, licences were being issued at present for all of the fats and oils coming in.  He was also asked to give some information concerning the firms that would be engaged in the manufacture of these products, and the number of persons to be employed. His answer was that he had no information.  I suggest to the Minister for Finance, what I suggested to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that he has got all the powers he can possibly want in the way of quotas, prohibition, and imposition of duties of any kind to help him in the development of Irish industry, and that when he puts this Imposition of Duties Order before the House, as an instrument which he wishes to have for the development of Irish industry, with all the safeguards he has, he ought to make a full and frank statement of the whole position; the market it is intended to supply, the market available here, the type of firm setting up the industry, its tradition in the industry, the amount of capital that will be involved, the amount of employment that will be given and information as to the general conditions imposed in granting a licence, both as regards wages, the number of aliens introduced or any other conditions implied, as well as the extent to which the proposal will actually raise <Col N="1042" /> prices here.  No attempt has been made to make any such statement and the way the Minister for Finance has replied to the questions put to him make me say that it is a disgraceful way to treat the House and, in so far as we can possibly do so, we are going to oppose propositions brought before the House in this particular way.  We are seriously interested in the development of these industries here, if it is possible to develop them.  The Minister has been refused no reasonable powers that he might wish to have, and we expect, when he sets out to use them, that he will come and make some reasonable statement as to what he is doing and what his hopes are for the development of the industry contemplated.</P>

      <P>Any person who has sat in this House since 3 o'clock this afternoon will be surprised to hear that the Party opposite are anxious to foster Irish industries in any way. In relation to this particular industry, I was asked to state the status and the reputation of the firm proposing to undertake this new project, and I stated that it was a firm of repute, which had supplied a considerable part of the Irish market. I was asked to state what the capital was.  I do not know what that has got to do with it.  I do not know what the capital involved in this venture will be.  I was asked to state what increase in price would follow from the imposition of this duty.  I have already explained to the House that a guarantee has been received that the f.o.r. price, Drogheda, would not exceed the c.i.f. price, Dublin.  I was asked to state the amount of employment that would be given.  It will be considerable.  It will at least exceed 100 persons, and, if we can employ 100 persons here, without involving any increase in the price of the commodities this firm manufactures, surely no Deputy anxious to see the establishment of industries that can be established here, should take up the attitude that has been taken up with regard to this and the other Orders.  I am quite sure that Deputy Mulcahy is very anxious that Irish industries should be established <Col N="1043" /> but, the only thing I can say is that for ten years he had it in his power to establish industries like this, and did not do so.</P>

      <P>The Minister thinks it a satisfactory disposition to say that the firm used to supply a considerable part of the Irish market.  From where?  Apparently from outside the country.  Therefore with part of an establishment outside the country they supplied some portion of the Irish market.  It was carrying the overheads of its Irish trade, so to speak, against its trade elsewhere.  We are told, at any rate, that that is the beginning of all the information we are getting.  The firm will become known soon if it is going to establish a place in Drogheda, and we might as well be told the name now.  It might save a lot of trouble with regard to inquiring as to what the particular standing of the group is. As to capital, the Minister says: &ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo;  He goes on to say that somebody asked and the firm had told him that they will guarantee that the f.o.r. price at Drogheda will not exceed the c.i.f. price at Dublin. As to employment, we were told that it was considerable, that considerable meant considerable, and now that it means a little over 100.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another thing as well as establishing an industry here.  There is the Parliamentary institution; there is what is called in this country government by deliberative assembly&mdash;an assembly which meets to decide on matters after arguing the thing back and forward and getting at the best which the clash of various minds can bring out of the subject.  The whole object of government by Parliamentary representation is to have the thing discussed before the measure is passed. If we are to take the Minister's easy way with industry, then if a firm, not named to the House, says that it will guarantee a particular price, that it will employ 100 people, but apparently does not state what <Col N="1044" /> capital it is going to run on and, therefore, does not allow the House to decide whether it will have that capital or would get a return on that capital from the business to be done, we are supposed to accept it.  That may be running an industry, although I think it will not be successful even in doing that, but it is not treating the Parliamentary institution properly.</P>
      <P>I am assuming that before any Minister, who knows his business, would come into the House to propose a tariff of the type talked of here he would know something more merely than that this business used to supply a big part of the Irish material.  He would have made inquiries about the firm.  Firms may have been big at one time and may be coming to the end of their day.  It is a simple thing to make a banking inquiry and to make commercial inquiries.  There is no firm big enough to despise people doing business with it if these people proceed to make proper inquiries, because then they will know that they are dealing with people who know the business, and that they will be treated in a businesslike way. The House which is to vote the tariff is simply told that the firm used to supply a considerable portion of the Irish material.  There is many a firm in England supplying a portion of Irish material and, if it was cut off, if it had to try to run its Irish business as a separate concern, put a limited amount of capital into it, and charge full overheads on its Irish business against its Irish capital, it could not carry on.  We want to know these things; they are the essence of business considerations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister thinks it is a proper and fair way to treat the House to say: &ldquo;I do not know anything about the capital.&rdquo;  Does he know what capital they have as a group?  Does he know whether they are segregating the capital for use in Ireland or does he know if the overheads on the Irish business are still going to be charged against whatever is the full capital of the firm?  Does he know what are their other ramifications?  Have they a big trade elsewhere, and has it been <Col N="1045" /> going down?  Is the firm as strong as it ever was?  Of course, this guarantee is not worth the paper it is written on, and nobody would take it as worth anything more than simply a statement which any firm looking for a concession would give, unless there are further points elucidated.  Is the guarantee capable of being carried out?  The Minister knows very well from the records of the Departments of Finance and Industry and Commerce that there were 15 or 20 guarantees given about prices to the one which was ever carried out.  Everybody looking for a concession will give a guarantee. Most of them will give it with the best possible intentions.  Most of them are optimistic enough when starting to think that the business will go well.</P>
    <P>The only way you will get people to put their heads down to business and give facts and figures upon which you can get a reliable judgment is to put up the difficulties, to make them face up to their overheads here; that there may be a long period in which they will have to suffer heavy promotion expenses before getting any return; get them to look into the condition of the country as they can see it in a detached way and form their own judgment, and then come to you with their tale.  The easier the guarantee is given the easier it is thrown before the House, the more objectionable it is, the more delusive it is likely to be, and the more definitely this House should reject anything of the sort.</P>
    <P>The Minister believes that the guarantee can be carried out.  If it is not a belief founded merely on the fact that certain people have told it to him, if it is properly based, it must be founded on a consideration of the trade to be done, the capital to be put into the trade, the return likely to be got, and the lasting nature of the business. Have we been told any of these things? Even if the Minister has the view that the House is not anything more than merely an association to carry out certain formalities we have to comply with certain conditions.  There is a certain regulation which says that these emergency imposition duties must be passed. Anybody who understands Parliamentary <Col N="1046" /> procedure, who has any idea of government by representatives, knows that &ldquo;passed&rdquo; does not mean merely walking through the Lobbies and getting a majority.  It means debating, getting people's minds quiet on the matter, getting argument brought to bear to convince people.  If the whole thing was plain as a pikestaff it should be so demonstrated.</P>
    <P>We were told at the start that employment will be considerable, and as the Minister had not time to go into his brief on that occasion when pressed for numbers, he said &ldquo;considerable&rdquo; meant &ldquo;considerable.&rdquo;  Now we are told it will be more than 100?  Was How much more than 100?  Was his 100 an easy-going estimate by people who, in an easy-going fashion, will guarantee anything at this moment and say: &ldquo;Let us get the factory up; when we have our capital invested and when we have 50 or 100 men tramping about the factory, then will be the time to meet us and talk business; then we can say: `If you stop anything on us we will close the factory and you will have 100 people extra on your hands.' &rdquo; It is the easiest thing in the world to speak in that sort of facile way, but it carries no conviction.  The Minister must have a conviction when he comes here with a proposal like this.  Why cannot he demonstrate the reasons for his conviction to the House?  A statement as to what the people are going to do is no good.  Their statements to him as to what they are going to do is worse than no good.  It should engender suspicion if given easily.</P>
    <P>If we are going to get industry started and people to go into it in the belief that they are really going to do business and that we are not flinging tariffs around in a topsy-turvy way; not industry springing up like a mushroom and people being deluded by the thought of employment and finding that they are only getting it for a little bit and then thrown out, there should be facts and figures given.  If the Parliamentary assembly is going to be carried on as an assembly for deliberation then the facts and figures ought to be put before us.  If it is not, then say that it is not <Col N="1047" /> say you believe that there should be no questioning of this matter.  The Minister almost suggested, in the usual fashion of the political speech that a person was a traitor who said anything hostile to the present Government, that you are against Irish industry because you want to know what this entry into Irish industry is based upon.  We have a right to know.  If a Labour Deputy was worth his salt before he would let a single man walk into a factory under these conditions he would badger and press in the interests of the people who are going to get employment to find out whether this is solidly based or whether it is another of those mushroom growths.  It may be a very good thing, but we have no evidence it is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>We have not, but the case has to be made affirmatively. If people are getting a tariff of so much against goods coming in surely that is a consideration.

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee:</NameTxt>
      <P>Time brings many surprises.  But to hear the former Minister for Industry and Commerce in this House reminding us that the Dáil is the place where matters are intended to be discussed is possibly the greatest surprise of all.  The former Minister for Industry and Commerce introduced the practice in this House of not speaking to his Estimate.  He was a member of a Government who, frequently pushed measures through this House under the guillotine and carried business by the operation of the closure when matters relating to the rights and privileges of this people were under discussion.  The then Minister for Industry and Commerce did not regard the Dáil, at any rate, as a deliberative assembly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has been the whole point of the Deputy's speech?  That inquiries have not been made.  Inquiries have been made which satisfied the Minister who is responsible to this <Col N="1048" /> House, the Minister who will have to answer on his Estimate for the discharge of all his responsibilities as Minister for Industry and Commerce, that this is a reputable firm that will carry out what it undertakes.  Does the Deputy expect that any firm with a reputation to lose would even consider the starting of an industry in this country if confidential information about its status, its banker's references and the constitution of the firm were to be made the sport of the Deputy's tongue in this House as the honour and reputation of members of this House were made the sport of his tongue when the Deputy was occupying these benches?  The thing that would prevent a new industry being established here would be the possibility that those who were responsible for it were going to be made the cock-shies of Deputy McGilligan's vituperation.</P>
    <P>At any rate, as I have said, the credentials of this firm have been examined by the responsible Department. They are taken by us as satisfactory and the factory which is to manufacture these products is now being erected in Drogheda at the risk of the particular company concerned.  So far as the Irish people are concerned, they do not risk anything in this venture.  We have a guarantee that the prices in Drogheda will not exceed the c.i.f. price in Dublin of the products they manufacture.  The firm are risking their capital in it.  We are not asking the Irish people to invest one penny piece in the firm.  The Irish people are not asked to do so either by the firm concerned. When the industry is established the Irish people may be asked, because we are anxious that Irish investors should interest themselves in these undertakings.  But at present, the risk in this venture is carried entirely by those who have undertaken to establish the factory.</P>
    <P>There is no point, therefore, in the speech delivered by Deputy McGilligan.  There is no risk in the matter.  There is not going to be any increase in the price consequent upon the establishment of the factory or the <Col N="1049" /> granting of this tariff.  Possibly the people who supply now a large part of the Irish market look to the fact that ultimately they will supply the whole of the Irish market, to make good any increase in the present overhead charges which are now borne only by that part of the Irish market which they supply.  It is quite reasonable to expect that businessmen knowing the industry would find in the fact that they were going to have an enlarged market here reasonable ground for anticipating that the gross profits which they would derive from supplying the whole of the market would cover them against any increase there might be in their present overhead charges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I leave it to the good sense of the people listening to me as to what is the ordinary meaning read into the phrase.  Now, we have got it that somebody did examine the credentials, and they are responsible; but up to that particular point we had not got that information.  As to the banker's inquiries, the Minister is afraid that if the banker's inquiries <Col N="1050" /> were made, and the results promulgated to this House, there might be criticism.  That makes it very suspicious.  The ordinary firm about whom banker's or commercial inquiries are made should not fear criticism if the results are good. Apparently, these inquiries have been made, though that has not been very clearly stated.  Remember, I did not object in the main that no inquiries had been made.  I objected that there were no revelations to this House that inquiries had been made or what was the result of the inquiries. I still consider myself as having a grievance in that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of capital, we were told that the Minister did not know. The phrase used was &ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo; But now the House has been told that there is no Irish capital risked.  I thought there was a policy adopted and that it had been carried through&mdash; that in the main there had to be involved Irish capital in any venture. Apparently, we are going away from that now.  This is a concern completely financed with capital other than capital belonging to citizens of this country.  We have no risks.  Have we no risk?  We have a guarantee.  Was it examined?  Were there facts and figures brought before the Department concerned?  Maybe the Minister knows now.  But the Minister knew nothing more than the parrot phrase, the phrase he has repeated parrot-like. &ldquo;We have a guarantee.&rdquo;  Was there an investigation made as to whether the guarantee was reasonable and what it was founded on, and what trade it was based on?  I asked the same question previously about another of these impositions about price.  I was told that the price would not exceed the price at the moment.  I asked did that hold in relation to the firm getting five per cent. or getting 100 per cent. of the market here.  I was told it held equally.  That is ludicrous. That does not happen in business.  If that is the situation then, undoubtedly, the people who were supplying the markets here were grossly overcharging. The Minister has a guarantee.  He knows what the guarantee is worth.  I <Col N="1051" /> do not care whether he is disposed to put figures and facts before the House, but if he says that the guarantee, when made, had about it a sufficient complication of detail to allow it to be seen that the calculation was a right one and likely to be carried out, then we are in a fairly good situation.  The Minister says what, in the end, gets back to derision of Parliament as an institution&mdash;that there is no point in making speeches about these matters. There is really very little.</P>

Even at the risk of annoying one or two Ministers and occupying 20 or 30 minutes of Parliamentary time, that is quite a good use of such time, particularly when, as now, you are carving out a certain portion of the industrial market here and handing it over to English people.  There is no Irish capital in this venture.  This portion of the market is being handed over to aliens &mdash;at any rate, to non-nationals.  There is a small promise given with regard to employment and an easy-going statement is made that a guarantee about price has been given.  Deputies opposite are pleased with what the Minister has said.  I do not think he has treated the House fairly.  There are other people to be convinced and there should be arguments to convince them.  The Minister says there is a guarantee.  I want to know a little more about it.  What are the facts surrounding the giving of the guarantee? Has anybody considered them? Does the guarantee apply under all conditions or only under certain special conditions?  Who has subscribed the capital?  Is anybody in Ireland risking capital in the venture?

After a little bit of pressure he mentioned the figure 100.  That is too obviously a round number to be accurate.  It is merely a guess.  There must have been somebody doing this business previously. This firm was, apparently, doing some part of it.  It could have given an estimate of the part of its factory which it believed was engaged in the supply of some portion of the Irish market. Some man with a slight turn for figuring could have arrived at a conclusion as to the number of men likely to be employed, and at what cost to the community.

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete in page 2, the reference to &ldquo;The Emergency Imposition of Duties (No. 38) Order, 1934.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Again, complaint is made in respect of this Order that a tariff has been imposed in the first place upon razor blades, and, in the second place, upon unsharpened blanks.  There is a duty at the rate of 5/- per gross.  I should like to know what is the industrial hope for the Minister behind this, and what exactly is the effect the Order is having at the present time.  A factory has been established in Enniscorthy, and is, I understand, paying miserable wages. Is this factory of a kind that can supply the razor blades for the whole of this country?  If that is so, it is all the more reason why we should hear from the Minister what exactly he hopes for from this Order in the way of industrial activity and employment here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of employment given will be small.  The industry will be a very minor industry in any circumstances, and the concern in Enniscorthy, I think, is not contemplating supplying our full requirements of these blades.  The manufacture there will be only of a cheap class of razor blade.  There are other parties interested in the development of the manufacture of these blades which may supply other classes of them.  The only thing I would like to say is that the statement made concerning the situation in Enniscorthy should be accepted with reserve.  I have no information as to whether the allegations are true or not, but experience has shown that statements of that kind, if untrue, can do considerable damage.  If true, there is an obvious remedy for that situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>
      <P>Organisation of the workers to ensure that the situation is set right, or else through an application under the Trade Boards Act.  The industry, as I have said, is a small one, and the amount of employment which would be given, even if the industry were fully developed, would not exceed 100 people.  Even on that basis it would involve processes of manufacture probably less elaborate than those which are adopted in countries where the markets are much larger and where machinery is utilised to a much greater extent than would be possible here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy:</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be ground that the Minister knows very well.  He has looked at previous factories in his day, marked them down on his paper as a factory here and a factory there, and then repudiated them when he knew more about them.  I am not relating what I am saying now to this particular factory in Enniscorthy, but it is remarkable that the Minister is prepared to tell us here that there are no aliens connected with that factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should explain that the term &ldquo;alien&rdquo; has a double significance here&mdash;either a non-national or a person who is an alien under the Aliens Act.  I have no means of knowing whether any person employed in any capacity in this country is an alien, who is not subject to the Aliens Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, at any rate, it shows us the amount of information the Minister is prepared to give us. He tells us that this razor blade factory in Enniscorthy will not supply all the blades that the people of this country want annually; that it will only supply the cheaper ones.  Is the duty that is stated in this Order being collected on any razor blades coming into the country at the present moment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy:</NameTxt>
      <P>So that, for purposes of the uniformity that the Minister for Finance was talking about earlier in the day, a factory <Col N="1059" /> is set up here for the cheaper class of razor blades, and then a tax of 5/- per gross is put on all the razor blades coming into the country. Will the Minister say what is the value of the total market in this country for the cheaper razor blades that, he anticipates, will keep 100 persons working in Enniscorthy?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>

      <P>Is it a fact that members of the Free State Army are shaving themselves with razors stamped &ldquo;Made in Britain&rdquo;, which are supposed to have been either manufactured or sharpened, or polished, or blunted, or something, here?

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I might as well let him hear the story as I have heard it.  The story I have heard is, that a certain firm did get into <Col N="1060" /> this particular production&mdash;whether sharpening or manufacturing I do not know&mdash;but they had a contract and managed to sell, at one-third over the contract price to the unfortunate soldiers of this country, razor blades supposed to be of Irish manufacture or finish, but all bearing the stamp of &ldquo;Made in Britain&rdquo;, and that stamp, despite other sharpenings or whatever it is that may have been put on, has not come off yet.  The people concerned, the Minister told us, are a Belfast firm.  I do not know who is registered in the companies office.  I will see one of these days, but again I am told that the people who operate it are two, in the main.  One is a gentleman who came to this country from Palestine <i>via</i> Great Britain and the other is a man who came from Belfast <i>via</i> Tanderagee&mdash;and they are a fairly good combination to manufacture Irish razor blades.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>
      <P>I know this much about it, that there are people associated with it who have as good a claim to be called Irish people, and a much better claim upon the respect of the people of this country than the Deputy.  I would advise him to be more careful before he avails of the privileges of this House to abuse anybody.</P>

      <P>I speak as a native Irishman without any tinge of foreign blood in me at all.  I am prepared to tell the Minister afterwards the information that was conveyed to me about this firm.  The Minister has the right to tell us on his own about this firm and not hide behind such an item of legislation, so that when he is asked a question about it his reply is that it would not be in the public interest to publish any information except in so far as publication is provided by the law.  The Minister says there is publication provided by the law under the Companies Acts.  Surely when we are asked to give 5/- per gross on these blanks the Minister, at any rate, should tell us what one can get in the company's office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan:</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister thinks that anyone believes that the reality is revealed by what is published in the Companies office, then he is a long time out of business.  He is not in touch with reality at all.  In connection with some of the hundred pound companies that have come into the country in the last eighteen months or two years, does the Minister believe that the people who have been put down as being the providers of the £100 capital are the real people who are running the industries or any of the manufacturing concerns that are supposed to be hiding behind these hundred pound companies?  The Minister knows that is not the case.  The Minister talks a lot about the information that he can get and the results that he can achieve, but we hear very little of it.  At the beginning several pieces of legislation that we opposed were passed here, but what has been got out of them?  If the Minister is not in a position to be able to tell us, with regard to a particular company whose operations have been brought to his notice, certain bits of information <Col N="1062" /> about it, how can he expect that a proposal to give 5/- a gross on blades is going to be discussed at all?</P>
      <P>What about the old matters that we discussed here&mdash;guarantees as to price? Suppose that they have been given; are they as clear-cut and as convincing as the ones that were given in relation to the three or four other matters that we discussed here to-night?  What capital is in this business?  What is the amount of it, not the nominal amount but the real amount that is employed? If the Minister thinks that this Enniscorthy factory is not now employing a hundred people but may eventually, what proportion of the market does this factory then hope to supply?  What are they at now?  They have been in operation long enough for the Minister to be able to tell us that, or is this one of the points on which we will get the same information as we got before on some of the other matters, namely, that they have only started producing? When they do get going, can the Minister say what proportion of the work is going to be done here?  Apparently the blanks are always going to be imported, or is that so?  Are the blanks always to be imported, and what stage of finish are they to be in?  Is it to be simply a matter of a few rubs of something or other and the packing? The packing, of course, will always enter in.  This packing is a great industry.  Is that what we hope to get out of it?  Is there going to be a very strong demand from the public for these things, or is there going to be worse material supplied at the old price, and will there have to be more frequent changes of blades?  I understand from a lot of people that there has been deterioration in blades for many months longer, I think, than the Enniscorthy people can be regarded as having started operations.  There has been that deterioration noticed.  These people have been long enough in operation, I think, to tell us what they are doing and when they propose to begin operations on a proper scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked the Minister previously whether he would give me a guarantee that facilities, if any facilities are being granted, will be such as to be restricted to citizens defined as such in <Col N="1063" /> the Citizenship Bill or ranking as such. The reply I got was that all applications for facilities would be considered on their merits.  I presume one of the merits would be whether or not a person was a citizen ranking as such in the proposals that are before us, but that is not stated.  In fact, the suspicion has been engendered in my mind that that is one of the things that have been neglected.  We are in the same mess as before in regard to these matters.  We are not given any information.  We are not told that the failure to give the information is because it is not available or procurable, but simply that it is not thought wise, that it is not the proper thing to put before the people who are being asked to vote this particular duty at this time.  That is not treating the House fairly.  The information should be procured.  I am sure that it is procurable, and it should be made available to the House.  It should be sufficient, in the hands of the Minister, to enable him to make a case for asking the House to vote this particular duty.  That case has not been made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received complaints from the County Wexford with regard to the terms of employment in this Eniscorthy factory.  These complaints are not confined to the question of wages, which I raised this afternoon. They also affect other matters connected with the terms of employment, such as the company's violation of the ordinary practice in operation in that part of the country.  For instance, it is the practice there that people should not be forced to work on Church holydays of obligation.  That practice, I understand, has been violated by this company rather to the general disapproval of the people down there.  There are some other matters also that they complain of.  It seems to me that if the people of this country are to be asked to allow themselves to be taxed for the benefit of this factory the Minister should have made arrangements, before deciding to ask the House to make this Order, to get some guarantees from this company, particularly with regard to the terms of employment.  I do not know if it is now too late to do that.  The Minister has a great capacity for bringing in Orders and getting the House to make them law.  In my opinion, he has invested himself with sufficient authority to enable him to make an investigation into the terms of employment which are in operation in regard to this industry.  I do not think that he would be in any way overstepping his duties.  He objected some time ago to a suggestion of Deputy Norton, when Deputy Norton drew attention to the terms of employment in factories, I think, in Kildare.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin:</NameTxt>
      <P>On Thursday last I addressed the following question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce if representations have been made to him by the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company and by the railway trades unions requesting a continuance this year of the Government subsidy paid in previous years towards the maintenance of this line; whether in response to these representations he has declined to consider the payment of any subsidy for the current year, and, if so, whether he will state the grounds upon which he made his decision; further, whether he has indicated to representatives of the company, in reply to suggestions that in the absence of a subsidy the line might have to close down, that such a development would be favoured by the Government, and, if so, whether he is aware that the closing down of this railway line, or parts of it, would not be in the best interests of the travelling and trading communities in the districts affected.</P>
      <P>The Minister in reply stated:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Representations of the nature indicated in the first part of the question have been made by the railway trades unions but not by the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company. As regards the second part of the question, the grant of a subsidy to this company in respect of the year 1933 was conditional upon an undertaking that no further application for a subsidy would be made, and that steps would be taken forthwith under the powers conferred by the Railways Act, 1933, and the Road Transport Act, 1933, to effect such a reorganisation of the undertaking as would obviate the necessity for further subsidies. Until the economies in working, possible under such a reorganisation, have been fully explored, the question of any further subsidy does not arise.  The answer to the third <Col N="1066" /> part of the question is in the negative.</P>
    <P>I want to say, on raising this matter on the adjournment, because of the unsatisfactory nature of the Minister's answer, I have no desire whatever to interfere with the affairs of the constituency of County Donegal.  I am raising this matter principally because it affects roughly about 151 railway workers at present employed on the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway, some of whom are colleagues of mine in a trade union.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon:</NameTxt>
      <P>You would not oppose the Minister's action when I opposed it here before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have an opportunity of saying something on this matter later.  Sixty out of the 100 miles of this small railway, which runs throughout the county, was constructed under the Railways (Ireland) Act, 1898, and was built by the Board of Works out of State funds provided at the time. I think it is fairly obvious to anybody who has studied the history, particularly the financial history, of the working of the company, that it was never intended that this State-built section of the line should pay.  The last year for which the subsidy was granted, made up as it was by the Government of Northern Ireland and the Free State Government, it amounted to the figure of £9,000.  I think it is quite true, as the Minister stated in his reply, that payment of the subsidy for that year was conditional, so far as the company was concerned, upon no further application being made by the company for a subsidy.  The company say, as far as I am informed on this point, that they gave that undertaking under duress. As a result of having given the undertaking, under duress or otherwise, they have not, as the Minister has stated, asked for a subsidy for the present year.  The case made for the subsidy, as far as I know, was put up by the trade unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is, I believe, in possession of figures to prove that the financial condition of the company is very serious at the present moment.  He is in possession of figures to prove, I understand, that the overdrafts and <Col N="1067" /> other debts of the company are only secured to the extent of about 50 per cent. by the present Chairman of the Company, the Directors and other friends of the company.  He is also aware that the rates of wages now received by the 151 employees of this company are 25 per cent. lower than the wages received by men employed in comparative grades under the Great Southern Railways Company.  The reductions agreed to by the men&mdash; agreed to mainly for the purpose of making their contribution to the continuance of this railway system&mdash; imposes a very great sacrifice on the men concerned.  I can state positively that the men who have made this sacrifice&mdash;32½ per cent. on the existing standard rate of wages&mdash;are not prepared under any circumstances to bear any further cuts.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his reply stated&mdash;and I am not quite sure whether the company agree or not&mdash;that part of the undertaking was that the company would proceed to take advantage of the benefits of the Railways Act, 1933, and of the Road Transport Act, 1933, for the purpose of reorganising the railway service as a whole.  I want to ask the Minister how it could be possible for a railway company, in the financial condition in which he knows this company now is, to take advantage of the Railways Act and the Transport Act? It requires money to enable this company or any other company to purchase lorries.  If, as is supposed to be the case, the Minister favours the idea of closing down the railway line and of operating lorries over the roads that run parallel to the present railway system how could this be done without financial assistance, either from the State or from some other source? Personally I cannot imagine the company in its present financial position being able to find the necessary money from any private source.  Therefore, if advantage is to be taken of the Railways Act, 1933 or of the Transport Act of the same year, the State will have to come to its assistance.  I am not, however, advocating financial assistance for that particular purpose.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1068" /> The most important question of all is: Does the Minister definitely favour the closing down of the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway or that portion of it which was built out of State funds?  If so, does he believe and will he give the House an assurance, that the roads over which this traffic may be carried in future, are capable of bearing the heavy traffic now borne over the railway line?  If so, does he believe that the ratepayers of the County of Donegal should be made responsible for the increased road maintenance which will naturally arise, if the traffic now carried by rail will in future be carried by road?  That is a very important point which the Minister should bear in mind before he comes to any definite decision as to whether any further subsidy will be provided for the railway line.</P>
    <P>I have reason to believe that the railway company has not been giving the service for passengers or goods which would induce the traders of the county to patronise the railway.  For instance, I am informed that what is supposed to be a passenger train leaves Derry about 4 p.m. and reaches Burtonport about 10 or 11 at night.  It takes, roughly, about seven hours for this great, mysterious railway company to run a passenger train from Derry to Burtonport, a distance of 67 miles.  It would seem, therefore, that the company does not make proper provision for the carrying of passengers apart from the fact that they do not make proper provision to retain the limited amount of goods traffic they have on the line at the present time.  The total staff at present employed on the railway numbers 151, and 115 of these are residents or citizens of the Free State, while the remaining 36 belong to Northern Ireland. It was suggested to me that before the Minister takes this final and, perhaps, fatal decision which will tend to close down this railway line perhaps for all time, he should have some kind of searching inquiry instituted into the system of administration, the finance and the assets of the company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin:</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a Commission which investigated some time ago important matters affecting the development of the ports of Donegal. Perhaps it might not be out of place if the Minister would let us know whether the members of that Commission have given him any information as to the possibility of carrying on this railway line, or what their views are with regard to the future of the London-derry-Lough Swilly Railway Company. I quite agree that that may not have been included in the terms of reference of the Commission, but perhaps the members were asked to furnish the Minister with their views in that respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking mainly in the interests of the people who will be affected by the closing down of this line.  Suitable alternative employment cannot be provided for the men who will be thrown out of work if the line is closed down.  I ask the Minister, now, seriously, to consider the question of providing a further subsidy towards the maintenance of this line until such time as he is able to go into such matters as the administration, the financial position and the assets of the company.  I would very much regret the closing down of what might be regarded as a main line railway.  I <Col N="1070" /> hope the Minister is not going to take the final step in a hurry.  I trust that on further consideration he will be prepared to provide financial assistance to enable the line to be carried on until he has a better opportunity of investigating the whole question.  I will now give an opportunity to Deputy Dillon, who has appeared so anxious to interrupt me, to say whether he supports the request I am making to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not followed Deputy Davin's remarks sufficiently closely to be able to know whether he contemplates this particular railway line at any time in the future working on an economic basis and without the aid of Government subsidies.  If he does not contemplate the possibility of this line getting itself into a position in which it will be able to continue working on a paying basis, what does he contemplate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin:</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, I understand the people responsible for the working of the line at the present time have expressed the view that it is possible to work the line without a subsidy inside about two years.  I did not make that statement before, because I could not prove it, and I have not had access to the figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>
      <P>Nor do I think that any responsible person could make that statement in the light of the experience of past years.  We gave them a subsidy last year, a subsidy which they undertook would be the last of its kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the duress? We said: &ldquo;Here is a subsidy.  Use that money we are putting at your disposal to reorganise your system, to eliminate unnecessary expenses, to reduce working costs and to get the system on a paying basis; but if you do not succeed, do not ask us to subsidise you again.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy apparently does not understand the position.  It would seem that his idea of the reason we gave the subsidy was to enable the company to purchase lorries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>
      <P>Then why did the Deputy interject that remark?  If there is any basis for his remarks here it must be a belief held by him and those for whom he speaks that the railway system can be put upon a paying basis despite the experience of past years.  Is it conceived by anybody that this system, burdened by debt, unable to provide for a wide part of the County Donegal the cheap, speedy and frequent service both for passengers and goods that modern conditions require, could in any way establish itself upon a basis that it will be able to continue operating indefinitely in the future without Government subsidies, or does he ask us frankly to recognise that this is a losing proposition, that the railway is unable to pay its way, that the public will not use it in such a manner as to enable it to cover its expenses but, for the sake of the men employed on it, we should vote £3,000 or £4,000 a year to keep it going?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon:</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the people in West Donegal?  What is going to be done towards accommodating them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment the Deputy is not entitled to speak, because I happen to be in possession. I am not saying that any question of financial assistance to the company is ruled out of consideration, but certainly no such question of financial assistance will arise unless and until there is evidence that the company and those associated with it are facing up to the problem in a realistic way, contemplating the transport needs of that area, the basis upon which the transport needs can be provided on a paying basis and setting out ruthlessly <Col N="1072" /> to effect whatever reorganisation is necessary to do that, even if it means the scrapping of the railway.  We are not committed to railways as a means of transportation if they cannot be made pay and if other means are obviously more profitable and can be conducted more cheaply and can be organised on a basis that is going to yield some return on the capital invested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin:</NameTxt>
      <P>Revenue should by right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing to prevent the company deciding to-morrow to get out of the business of running that railway, and in that case the ratepayers of Co. Donegal would have reason to realise what the decision would mean for them, because the ratepayers have guaranteed the payment of the interest upon the debentures of that company.  In any event the Deputy can take it that road transport can be made to pay.  I appreciate that the scrapping of the railway line in West Donegal is going to involve the construction of new roads in that area and that it would be unreasonable to ask the County Donegal to bear the cost of the construction of these new roads entirely.  There is no reason why County Donegal should not be asked to maintain these roads, when constructed, assisted, as they would be assisted in the ordinary way, by grants from the Road Fund, which is produced by the taxation of motor vehicles; and in so far as the motor vehicles operating on these roads would increase in number, the revenue of the Road Fund in consequence would be inflated, and the Road Fund would make whatever contributions it deemed reasonable and fair to the County Donegal County Council, to assist them in maintaining the roads of the county used by these vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1073" /> The construction of new roads is a different problem in so far as the question of providing proper transport in that end of the county is concerned. It seems to me a matter of re-organisation to an extent that will ultimately mean the elimination of the railway and its substitution by road services. At the present time, the position, as I understand it, is that the omnibus services operated by the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company are, in fact, maintaining the railway. The profits realised by that company from omnibus services are helping to meet the loss on railway working.  If the railway was not there, if the company could by some means get rid of the railway and of the liabilities attaching to the railway, it would be in quite a comfortable financial position. It is because the railways are there, and because the problem of even getting rid of the railway is going to impose new charges on the company, that it finds difficulty in effecting the change over to the roads which involves the purchase of new vehicles for the transportation of goods and the new omnibuses for an extension of its passenger service.</P>
    <P>That is a matter in which they might possibly look to us for assistance, and I am prepared to consider the affording of that assistance if I am satisfied that the plans of the company are prepared with a full realisation of the facts, with a full knowledge of what is contemplated and with all the various difficulties faced up to and solved, so that we can point to a date, with some degree of definiteness, on which all question of State assistance for transport in County Donegal can be ended, and the services, whatever they are, then operating, maintained on a paying basis.  The railway employees are part of the problem. The railway company, as the Deputy knows, is obliged, under the terms of the Railway Act, 1924, to provide compensation for its employees if they lose their work, in consequence of an order made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce terminating any of their railway services.</P>
    <P>That is one of the problems.  The financial burden which the provision of <Col N="1074" /> that compensation imposes on the company is one obvious reason why it is finding difficulty in procuring the finances to effect the re-organisation which we contemplate, but that has got to be faced, and the responsibility of deciding that a certain number of these railwaymen are going to lose their employment and get their compensation will have, at some stage, to be taken.  A number of them, possibly a majority of them, can be provided with employment in the substituted road services.  Some of them, because of age and other considerations, will be unsuitable to take that employment, and for them, under the terms of the Railway Act, compensation has got to be provided, and that compensation is going to impose an annual charge on the company for a number of years to come.</P>
    <P>The question is: Can the new services of the company, the reorganised services, the road services, meet their own working expenses and meet the charges on the additional capital which has got to be secured, in order to provide them, plus these charges which will be inherited from the railway system, the uneconomic railway system now working, because not only will these charges arise in respect of compensation for workers, but the existing load of debt which the railway is carrying will have to be shifted, to a considerable extent, at any rate, on to the backs of the new transport organisation that succeeds it? These are all parts of the problems, and I agree that the company might, with some show of reason, look to the State for financial assistance for the purpose, and only for the purpose, of effecting that change over which will obviously put Northern Donegal transport on an economic basis, but if the only question that arises is one of providing a subsidy from State funds to keep going an uneconomic system, which is bound to collapse some day, no matter what subsidies we continue to give it, I think it is a waste of time providing money for the purpose.  In fact, we extracted, as the Deputy says, from the company, a promise, when we gave the subsidy last year, that they would not approach us again for that purpose nor have they done so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1075" /> This matter is, of course, not merely one for us.  In the past, the subsidies given to that company were contributed, one half by the Government of the Free State and one half by the Government of Northern Ireland, and if financial assistance for the reorganisation of the services provided by that company in order to release it from its difficulties, is to come from State funds, presumably the Northern Government must be expected to contribute <Col N="1076" /> equally with the Free State Government to that end, but, in any event, the position, so far as the Free State Government is concerned, is that its assistance is conditional upon the company's plans being based upon a realisation of its position, and on a determination to put its services on an economic basis, no matter what is involved in that.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state the gross total, and the total number of acres in each county, under tobacco in each of the years 1931, 1932, 1933, and 1934.</P>

      <P>There is no information in the Department of Agriculture with regard to the quantity of tobacco grown in Saorstát Eireann in the years 1931 and 1932, but the Revenue Commissioners may have particulars of the area planted.  I understand that about 750 acres were planted with tobacco in 1933, but I am not in a position to say how this area was distributed among the various counties.  The information asked for in connection with tobacco grown in 1934 is being furnished in reply to another question asked by the Deputy.</P>
