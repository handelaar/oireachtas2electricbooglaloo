      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will state why ships registered at Saorstát ports and engaged in trading outside the Saorstát have to fly the Red Ensign on the high seas and in foreign ports, and if he will take steps to have international recognition secured for the Tricolour as the National Flag of the Saorstát.</P>

      <P>No objection has been taken by the Government of any country to the flying of the Tricolour on the high seas or in foreign ports by ships registered in Saorstát Eireann. The flag to which the Deputy's question refers has, however, been flown by such ships in accordance with the temporary legal position created by Article 73 of the Constitution.  A Bill is in draft, and will be introduced in due course, terminating this position and declaring the Tricolour to be the national colours to be flown by all ships registered in Saorstát Eireann.</P>

      <P>In page 2, line 18, section 1, to delete the word &ldquo;geese.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The definition of poultry in the Bill includes domestic fowls, turkeys, geese, guinea fowls and pigeons.

      <P>The Minister was asked to explain the reason for this Estimate.  He used some of his time last night in making an offensive observation in respect of an ex-Minister of State.  He said in respect of Deputy O'Sullivan that he had dipped his hand in the Secret Service pot, referring to the period from 1922 onwards.  It so happens that Deputy O'Sullivan did not become a Minister of State, having collective responsibility with the members of the Executive Council, until 28th January, 1926.  If the observation were meant to be offensive <Col N="855" /> it is regrettable.  That it was baseless is evidenced by the historical fact that the Deputy did not take office as a member of the Executive Council until the 28th January, 1926.</P>
      <P>The Minister was asked last night to give an explanation of the increase in this Vote from £10,000 to £25,000.  He gave no such explanation.  Bearing in mind that the previous Government spent only £951 in the last year for which returns have been issued, the House is certainly entitled to know what is the reason for the increase. The Minister was asked whether or not any of this money was devoted, or was intended to be devoted, to political purposes.  He gave no answer.  He contents himself with a criticism of the previous Administration, going back as far as 1922&mdash;a long period.  I have had on many occasions to complain of the obsession which appears to press so heavily on practically every member of the Ministry&mdash;the inferior idea they have got about themselves and their Administration which induces them always to go back and criticise what has happened before, and evade, in so far as it is possible for them to evade, any explanation or justification of their own policy.  Twelve years ago, we happened to have just as little experience as they had during the last couple of years.  It is interesting to note the explanation given to the House in respect of the Secret Service Vote on behalf of an Administration which had much more to do than this Ministry has had to do during the last 12 months or two years.  There were then no police outside the city of Dublin.  There was, properly speaking, no army.  The Civil Service had to be taken over and reorganised. New services had to be inaugurated. Notwithstanding all that, explanations were given to the House in connection with the various Votes.  Deputies can peruse, at their convenience, on columns 2210-2211 of the Dáil Debates of the 16th November, 1932, a statement made by the then Minister for Finance in introducing this Vote. He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Not a penny of this money has <Col N="856" /> been or is being spent on espionage or in connection with the present police force or military operations. This money was required for a particular Service which has now been brought to an end.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further, to the Chairmen of the different Parties in the House at that time there had been a full and complete statement made regarding the expenditure of that money.  There were three or four Parties in the House then.  There were the Independents, the Labour Party, and the Farmers' Party, in addition to the Government Party.  The Chairmen of these Parties were assembled in one of the rooms in this building, and told the purposes for which that money was spent.  In that first year, a sum of £220,000 is inserted in the Estimates for Secret Service.  In the following year, the sum put down was £50,000. This was the statement made by the Minister for Finance to the House at that time:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I will undertake to give in confidence to the Deputy&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I think that it was the Leader of the Labour Party who had been speaking&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;or to any member of the Dáil all reasonable information in connection with this Vote if they apply to me personally.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A member of the Labour Party (Deputy O'Connell) asked: &ldquo;Would it not be advisable to consider postponing this Vote so that Deputies who might apply for such information would have it before them.&rdquo;  The answer was: &ldquo;I am perfectly willing to do so.&rdquo;  The Vote was postponed from the 25th June, 1923, until the 19th July, 1923.  The main question for discussion at that time was the amount involved.  A statement was made to the House as to the amount that had been spent since the 1st April. The amount was £6,050.  Can we get from the Minister how much of this £25,000 has been spent since the 1st April?</P>
    <P>This statement appears in the Debates of the 19th July, Column 1135, from the Minister proposing the Vote:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="857" />&ldquo;I should like to say that there is not any of this money used for political purposes, as intimated by the Deputy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>More than once the statement was made that the money was not used for political purposes.  To come down along the years, while considerable sums were asked from the House, only fractions of the money so voted were spent.  The information in connection with this expenditure was put before the House by the ex-Minister for Finance, Senator Blythe.  Of the £50,000 voted in the year 1923-24, £39,000 was spent.  In the following year, 1924-25, £19,000 was spent, and in 1925-26, of £20,000 asked for, £5 3s. 6d. short of £9,000 was spent.  The real reason for the drop there was that some of this money went on Army service, and the Ministry then came to the conclusion that that was a service which could be dispensed with.  I ask Deputies to mark the period&mdash;1925-26&mdash;not very long after the Civil War, and not yet at the time when the Deputies opposite who are now in ministerial positions had given up their nonsense and posturing in this country about a rival and usurping government, calling themselves republicans, and calling their institutions a republic.</P>
    <P>I ask Deputies to mark how that sum came down after that nonsense had been disposed of.  In the following year, although the Dáil voted a sum of £14,000, the expenditure was short of £3,000.  A still more remarkable circumstance in connection with it is this: that although the Dáil voted practically £10,000 annually&mdash;on one occasion giving a Supplementary Estimate of £10,000 after the murder of the then Minister for Justice&mdash;not £20,000 had been spent in the last six years of the late Administration. Now, is it unreasonable to ask, in connection with this Vote, that some explanation should be given to the House with regard to this increase from £10,000 to £25,000?  It was stated here in the House more than once during all that period that this is a Vote which does not lend itself to that sort of detailed criticism which other Votes do, but there are certain items in connection with it which the Dáil <Col N="858" /> is entitled to have.  It is certainly entitled to an answer to these questions: Is any of this money being utilised for political espionage?  Is it being devoted towards the detection of crime?  Is it being devoted towards the prevention of activities on the part of those who seek to upset the State by military force or otherwise?</P>
    <P>In the course of the discussion on this Vote last night, the Minister for Finance devoted practically the whole of his time to a criticism of his predecessors in office.  I have dealt with that. If the Deputies opposite had been in the House 12 years ago, if they had not been going on with their political nonsense, they could have been invited to share that confidence which was extended to other Parties in the House.</P>

      <P>No, you did not want to know about it.  You had no desire to know about it.  Your efforts and your activities were devoted towards an entirely different objective.  The information was there for members of this House.  It was given to them in the formative stage of this State: in the first decade, in the first year.  Could anything have been more candid?  Why it was even urged on the Labour Party at one time, but the then leader of it said that they did not want this information because he would then be in the position of having to share responsibility, but, fortunately, he was not an Irishman.  I say &ldquo;fortunately,&rdquo; because I would be ashamed of an Irishman if he put forward that particular explanation of his conduct.</P>

The Minister has said that he would give as much information as it was reasonably possible to give to the Deputies if they would make enquiries from him, and more than <Col N="862" /> other Ministers may be willing to give.  That is not satisfactory either. Deputies obtaining information of that kind are thereby precluded from raising the question of any matter which may be divulged.&rdquo;</P>

He is trying to wriggle out of voting for this Vote now.  Let him; he is perfectly welcome to do so.  He wriggled for these 10 or 12 years.  He objected to the money being spent, and now I have given how the money was spent&mdash; £20,000 in six years.  He now wants an excuse to vote for this.  Let him have it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked for some information as to what this money is to be used for.  I have stated how the practice started in the earlier years. When you come down to the question of the expenditure of £1,500, £2,500, or £2,400, it is not necessary to give information to the members of the Dáil in the same way as it was when large sums were being disbursed.  When those large sums were being disbursed, the Dáil was informed that they could have all reasonable information.  We do not even go so far as to request that, but the Ministry spends £1,000 in 1932-33&mdash;£1,000 or less; they asked last year for £10,000, and they are asking this year for £25,000, and we want to know, having regard to what we have read in the newspapers about cases that have been in the courts, what are the purposes for which this money is required.  On the President's Vote, I asked whether or not there had been a departure from precedent in that a member of the Gárda Síochána, in giving evidence, said that he was not bound by the codes of honour which would bind a grocer.  I wanted to know whether that Guard was speaking from the book or whether he was merely speaking for himself.  I would venture to express the hope that he was only speaking for himself and that the Ministry still hold that Guards, in the exercise of their duty, should be honourable persons and that they should not try to countenance the commission of crime.  I think, in all the circumstances, we are entitled to the <Col N="864" /> information about this Vote which has not been given to the House.</P>

      <P>In moving the Estimate, on 16th November, 1922, Deputy Cosgrave, then President, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I beg to move this Estimate, amounting to £220,000.  Before moving it I should like to make a short statement, as questions have been asked and allegations have been made as to the purpose of this Vote. I wish to make it perfectly clear that not a penny of this money has been or is being spent on espionage, or in connection with the present police force or military operations.  This money was required for a particular service which has now been brought to an end.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Mark that statement on the 16th November, 1922&mdash;This money was required for a particular service which has now been brought to an end.  If it was not being spent on espionage or in connection with the present police force or military operations, the question will naturally arise as to what was the particular service for which it was necessary to ask the Dáil to provide £220,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The general purpose of Secret Service Votes is espionage. It is to secure information which is necessary for the safety of the State, but which cannot be secured through any channel other than secret service channels.  The question which Deputy Cosgrave will have to answer is, if it was not for any one of these purposes, why did he want the £220,000?  The detailed expenditure of moneys out of this Vote does not come under the purview of the Comptroller and Auditor-General. Instead of that, the Comptroller and Auditor-General has to accept a certificate signed by the Minister who has requisitioned any <Col N="865" /> sum from the Secret Service Vote in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I hereby certify that the amount actually expended by me or under my directions for Secret Service in the year ended 31st March, was £... and that the balance in my hands on the said 31st March, was £.....; and I further solemnly declare that the interests of the public service required that payments should be made out of the Secret Service Vote and that they were properly so made.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Secret Service Vote is, as I have said, the obtaining of information which is requisite for the security of the country, and which cannot be obtained openly.  Deputy Cosgrave, in putting the Vote before the Dáil, expressly disclaimed that the purpose for which they wanted that sum of £220,000 was to secure information. What other purpose did he want it for?  He said that the service for which this money was required had been brought to an end in November, 1922.  Was it brought to an end?  He had spent, out of the Secret Service Vote for the year ending 31st March, 1923, the sum of £118,000.  When the matter again arose&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On a point of order. The question here is a Vote for £25,000 for this year.  I have no objection whatever to going into those matters that the Minister is raising, none whatever, but there is a time and a place for everything.  We have not yet got an explanation for this increase from £10,000 to £25,000, the Vote now before the Dáil.  That explanation has not been given to the Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that in a moment.  In moving the Vote on 25th June, 1923, the President said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I beg to move: That a sum not exceeding £25,000 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the charges which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1924, for Secret Service.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>£25,000 had been voted on account.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Deputy Johnson: I would ask the Minister whether the same remark that he made last year on this Vote applies to-day.  There is a decrease of £170,000.  Is this Estimate to be a normal Secret Service Vote?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The President: I should say not, but I will undertake to give, in confidence, to the Deputy, or to any member of the Dáil all reasonable information in connection with this Vote, if they apply to me personally. It is a matter that could not well be discussed in public, but I think I will be able to satisfy them that it is a sound policy to adopt, and as long as the information is taken in confidence I would be prepared to go <Col N="867" /> into any particulars of details and to give members any information which would be accepted in confidence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is Deputy Cosgrave speaking on the 25th June, 1923.  Let us see how this undertaking was fulfilled.  That is what the Deputy has failed to tell the Dáil.  On 19th July, 1923, when this debate was resumed, the then President said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have answered questions put by Deputies in connection with this particular item, and I explained the last day that I would answer any such questions.  I think they are satisfied with that.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Cathal O Shannon: I do not know that the Dáil ought to be satisfied about this matter.  Deputies who inquired did get a certain amount of information, but I do not think it went very far.  When the Vote came, on a previous occasion, an explanation was given which everybody, I believe, was quite satisfied with, but I do not think that is the position now, not by a long way.  Certainly no such explanation was forthcoming this time as the last time, and it is necessary I think in justice to the Dáil and to the citizens that we should have some further explanation, and I would urge the Minister to give that explanation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We see now how far Deputy Cosgrave's undertaking to consult responsible Deputies in this House, and to give in confidence the details of the expenditure on this Vote, went.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

In the particular case that the Minister has brought up now there were three Governments, practically speaking. There were the old Dáil, the Provisional Government and the Government elected by the Dáil in December, 1922.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put this to the Chair in fairness to my colleagues whose names were used: it was alleged by Deputy Cosgrave that Deputy O'Connell asked for certain details. Deputy Cosgrave knows very well that the money paid out on that Vote was paid out to people in whom Deputy O'Connell was particularly interested. Does Deputy Cosgrave deny that? Therefore Deputy O'Connell was entitled to ask for certain information to satisfy himself as to the genuineness of certain payments.  I am quite sure Deputy O'Connell would be anxious to oblige Deputy Cosgrave if he wanted to reopen it but I would say that for the personal advantage of Deputy Cosgrave he should not do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not, because if he had it might be necessary to refer to the political espionage which has been carried on out of the Secret Service Vote.  It might be necessary to explain why a man was put into the office of the Fianna Fáil organisation when it was being established&mdash;a man who, it was subsequently admitted before a court of inquiry set up by this House, had been in the employment of the police as a police agent, and who was paid out of the Secret Service funds.  And the Deputy asks us to believe his statement that during the period his Party were in office they did not utilise this money for the purpose of political espionage. There is the Harding case.  There was the case of that unfortunate boy, Carroll. These two instances alone are fresh in the public mind, and they show how the Vote was utilised in years gone by, and that the Dáil, when voting the money, knew the purpose for which it was utilised.  We are not saying there has been any departure.</P>
      <P>I should like to make it quite clear that if people came to us and stated that, as members of the League of Youth movement, they had been asked to join a reprisals gang in this country, we should first of all persuade them it was their duty to go and disclose the facts which they alleged they had in their possession in relation to a movement of that sort to the police, to the people responsible for the administration of justice.  Nobody wants to see a reprisal gang in this country on one side or the other.  We have had enough of political murder and political assassination in this country.  But we are not fools.  When we see, occasionally, within the precincts of Merrion Street, a man who, until the present Government came into office, was a fugitive from justice, coming out of the Cumann na nGaedheal rooms, do you think we are fools?</P>

We would rather we had not got to do it.  We would rather it was not necessary.  We would rather that every citizen who had information of the subversive activities of any individual or organisation in the country would convey that information to the authorities, who are entitled to receive it as a matter of civic duty and civic responsibility from every honest man and woman in the country.

      <P>If they do come we will tell them what their duty is&mdash;that their duty is to report to the Chief Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána or to the nearest policeman any information they have in their possession.  As I say, when people make statements of that sort, when we see the organisation that is springing up around us, and when we read in the official journal of that organisation that one of its aims is to build up an intelligence system in the country to which they will recruit members of the public service, it is our duty as members of the Government, charged with the preservation of public peace, with the maintenance of order, and with the obligation of protecting the citizens, to see that if we cannot get information given to us voluntarily we will get it some way or another; that we, at any rate, will be as well informed about the things which are going on in this country as the Leader of the Opposition Party, General O'Duffy, who claimed to be well informed about what was going on inside the public service and what was going on inside other organisations in this country.  That is the purpose of the Vote.</P>
      <P>I guarantee to the House that when the Dáil votes us this money, as it has voted successive Governments moneys for this service within the past 12 years, the money will be spent strictly for the purpose for which the Dáil provides the money; that is, for obtaining the information which is requisite for the security of the country, and which cannot be obtained openly.  The expenditure must be sanctioned and no sanction for that expenditure can be given without the approval of at least two members of the Executive Council, one of whom is the Minister for Finance.  When the Minister who is charged with the disbursement of these moneys gives the certificate he gives it in the form in which I have already recited to the Dáil, and which I will again repeat:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I hereby certify that the amount actually expended by me or under my directions for Secret Service in the year ending 31st March was £... and that the balance in my hands on the said 31st March was £...; <Col N="873" /> and I further solemnly declare that the interests of the public service required that payments should be made out of the Secret Service Vote and that they were properly so made.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When that certificate is given it will be given without reservation and without qualification and, certainly, the moneys out of the Secret Service Fund will not be used by our Administration to defray expenditure that should have been brought publicly before the Dáil and paid out of another Vote.</P>

      <P>The Minister has just made a number of insinuations. I want to ask him a plain question.  Is this increase in the secret service expenditure due to fears of the Government with regard to supposed sinister activities on the part of any branch of the Opposition?  Is that the reason for the increase?  Will he answer &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;?  If so, I should like him to do it before I go any further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to give any further information.  The Government, having considered the whole position, are satisfied that it is necessary to ask for a Secret Service Vote of this amount.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government, having considered the whole position, has come to the conclusion that it would not be in its own political interest to disclose any part of that position to the House.  I do not think it is much use wrangling about words. I am not interested in the question as to whether secret service can or cannot be carried on without something called espionage.  Personally, I do not think it can; I think secret service implies espionage; but the question is whether that espionage is directed against political opponents because they are political opponents, or whether it is directed against people who threaten the peace and security of the State.  That is the thing that really matters.  The Minister has insinuated that certain citizens have been coming to him or some of his friends and informing him that they were invited to join a reprisals gang within the League of Youth and that they advised them to go and give that <Col N="874" /> information to the police.  I do not want to run counter to the rulings of the Chair by referring to matters already ruled out of order, but perhaps I can say this much, that if the Minister is referring to the author of the document that was attempted to be read out here last night, he might consider that, even putting the best face on the matter from his own point of view, the conclusion he should reach would be this, that the person who comes to him with that type of information is not a person to be trusted, when he sees that such a person goes out afterwards and makes a statement that is in flat contradiction of the statement the Minister alleges he made to somebody on his own side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to put this question to the Deputy: which version of the statement made by that man would the Deputy believe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to form any opinion on that subject, never having seen the man and never having read either version.  But I do say this, that the members of the present Government have shown over and over again their eagerness, their childish and at the same time malicious eagerness, to grasp at any straw, to take hold of any discreditable piece of information that they hope will do damage to the Opposition, and they show very little disposition to examine the question of the authenticity of such information.  I shall not delay the House by quoting examples of that, but I am quite sure examples are present to the minds of all of us.  When people come to members of the Government with stories of that kind I suggest that if members of the Government do wish to preserve the peace of the country or to preserve even the decencies of public life, they would do well to take at their face value the declarations of the Leader of our Party, General O'Duffy, and they would do well, however sceptical they might be in their hearts, or however sceptical they might have professed themselves to be, to test the truth and value of those stories by giving him information of that kind and letting him examine into the question of <Col N="875" /> whether there is anything going on that ought to be stopped.</P>
      <P>My own belief is that the Government are not really convinced by these stories that reach them; that they are willing to wound but half afraid to strike; that they half believe the stories but that they do not want to follow any course that would really put the accuracy of the stories to the test. If they believe what they profess to believe, that a large portion of this Party is corrupt and is following all sorts of sinister and subversive activities, and at the same time that there is a portion of this Party which consists of poor, innocent fools, then it would appear to be even to their own Party advantage to cause a first-rate split in the Opposition by enlightening the poor fools as to what is going on by putting the matter to the test, as it could be very effectively put to the test, by reporting such allegations to General O'Duffy or indeed to any member of this Party and having them investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have tried to look at this matter impartially, but I have the impression that the secret service money is being thoroughly badly spent.  I know suspicions are entertained, which are groundless, about the activities of our Youth organisation; that suspicions are entertained by members of the Party opposite, and I believe those suspicions are being bolstered up by secret service agents who report to them the kind of things that they think the Government want to believe.  I think the Government ought to accept this point of view, that we are, all of us here, equally interested in maintaining the peace and security of our population; that we are, all of us, interested in maintaining the authority and dignity of the State, and that we are all willing to co-operate against any sinister or underground activities that might be going on.  If the Government would confine its secret service operations to keeping within bounds, or bringing to an end organisations that are definitely and explicitly directed against the order of things in this country, then it is possible that the people of this country <Col N="876" /> would be getting some value from this money.  As it is, I feel honestly that there is no alternative for anyone who is unprejudiced in this House but to oppose the granting of the money for which the Minister is now asking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate, and I would not have done so were it not for the insinuations contained in Deputy Cosgrave's speech.  Deputy Cosgrave quoted, and I admit correctly quoted, a question asked and a brief statement made in this House in 1923 by Deputy O'Connell, in which he suggested that for certain good reasons, then and now known to Deputy Cosgrave, the Vote should be postponed.  Deputy Cosgrave did, I understand, on a certain occasion shortly prior or subsequent to the time I mention, invite either the leaders or representatives of different Parties to a meeting, but he took very good care that he did not tell the House the purpose for which he required the representatives of the Parties then in the House to meet him. Is the Deputy prepared to tell the House the reason why he invited the representatives to go to a meeting? He summoned them to hear certain statements from him.  Is he prepared to tell the House and the country the nature of the statement that he made to the parties who attended that meeting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell did not attend that meeting.  If there is still anything good left in the mind of Deputy Cosgrave in connection with this matter I would ask him to refresh his memory and say whether or not my statement is correct.  A Deputy who was then a member of this Party, but not Leader of the Party, was present at the meeting.  A Deputy of the House, who is now dead, was present at the meeting, and the object of the meeting was to explain to the representatives present the special reasons why payment of a particular character, not normally paid out of the Secret Service Vote, had to be made.  I am sure the Minister for Finance has sufficient records in his Department to verify my statement.  Deputy Cosgrave is generally very fair in his criticism of the activities of this Party, and he <Col N="877" /> very seldom, except in the case of one member of the Party, resorts to personal abuse.  He engaged in a little of that to-day, but I am sure the individual he had in mind, and practically mentioned, would not make the insinuations that Deputy Cosgrave made against members of this Party, namely, that they asked for the postponement of a Vote in order that they might get information as to the purpose for which secret service money was being spent.  I knew then and I now know the purpose for which that money was allocated, and it is not a purpose for which, either before or since, money has been allocated.  I understand that the Deputy, who was then President, had a meeting with another distinguished politician, as a result of which he gave an undertaking that no further moneys would be paid out for the particular purpose for which they were paid out on that occasion.  Does he deny that, or is he prepared to tell the House, and to tell the country, that there was a little more in it than these insinuations of his?</P>

He does not mind that, however, so long as it would injure Deputy Cosgrave.  He knows that his proposal that that information should be given is a dastardly proposal, and one calculated to injure a great number of people about whom, of course, the Deputy does not care.  We heard the Minister's insinuations and all the rest of it, in which he was trying to imply something which he knows is not true, just as in the same way I heard the Minister speak about a man named Murray&mdash;I do not know who he is&mdash;as a fugitive from justice as long as we were responsible for government in this country but who, apparently, felt it safe to come back here when the present Government came in.</P>

      <P>The point is that £25,000 is being voted for secret service, and I can quite understand that that might be a justifiable Vote. If it could be used usefully it should be voted, but one must consider whether it will be used for a purpose that will be for the common good and whether it is adequate or too much. Yesterday a number of people tried to judge what use will be made of this money by referring to things that happened last year.  They were ruled out of order or, at least, the Minister for Finance, with his Jack-in-the-Box habit, was up and down all the time wanting to know whether a thing that happened last year should be referred to, inasmuch as this refers to money voted for this year, but this afternoon I found him back to 1932 and referring to the murder of a man named Carroll. Somehow or other he correlated that with the present case of having members of the police force going about trying to induce people to commit a crime.  The Minister knows perfectly well that, as regards the expenditure of this money, members of the Government do not necessarily know how it is spent.  As far as I remember, when I was a member of the Government, nobody was commissioned by the Government or by the Government's agents to try to get other people to break the law.  What I said at the time was that a man who was a member of an organisation whose method is murder, and whose end is criminal, gave information to the police.  I believe also that he was actually warned by the police that he was in a dangerous position, because the police knew that the members of that organisation used the method of murder.  Now we are asked to vote £25,000 to the Government for secret service methods.  As I said, I think we might all get up and say &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; if we were satisfied that it was going to be used for the common good.  We know that in this country, now more than before, there are secret <Col N="882" /> organisations who believe in the method of murder, who believe in corrupting justice by perjury, and endeavouring by threats to get other people to commit perjury.  We know that the Minister for Justice assures them that he understands them and has great sympathy with them.  It is the sympathy of co-naturality.  Now we are going to vote money.  Every right-minded person in this country knows that you have here organisations whose tradition during the last ten years has been the corruption of justice in this country through perjury, and whose method of attaining their ends has been diabolical crime.  Certain people, whom I will not mention, were partners by sympathy with them over a great number of those years.  The man who we must presume is going to be responsible for the expenditure of this money is the man who assures the gangs standing for the overthrow of this State and who have been responsible for murder, the so-called Minister for Justice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I hope that statement is true, because I should be very sorry to think that there was a majority of people in this country whose instincts were so diabolically criminal that they also had some sympathy and understanding with them.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose discussing the administration of the Department of Justice.  We are voting money to the Executive Council.  They have collective responsibility.  A Minister of that Executive Council, who is the mouthpiece of the views and ideas of that Executive Council, got up a fortnight ago and stated that he had sympathy and understanding, and more so than most people, with certain people in this country.  I take it that, as there is collective responsibility, that is a statement of the point of view of the Executive Council.  This money is being voted for the purpose of getting information for the good of this State, and for the putting down of forces which would be inimical to the wellbeing of this State.  My point is this: we are now going to vote money and to put it into the hands of agents for certain purposes for the promotion of <Col N="885" /> the common good.  We are justified in considering whether that money is likely to be used for purposes for which we would be justified in voting it. When we have the people who are going to be responsible for the administration of this money, either directly or collectively, getting up and announcing, with regard to organisations responsible for murder, for attempting to overthrow all order in this country, for attempting to prostitute justice through the promotion of perjury, that they have sympathy with and understanding of them; when we have the people to whom we are voting this money explaining that those are their principles, and calling upon the criminals of this country to support them because they use their power to protect crime from outraged justice, then we should consider whether we will not actually do injury to this country and its people by putting money, which gives power, into the hands of such people as that.</P>
      <P>We have here organisations whose declared policy is the overthrow of the State, who deny the right of the Government created by this Dáil to exist as a Government, who state that there is some other hidden body outside which has legitimate authority and the power of life and death in this country, and we have the people who now come to ask us to vote money, asserting that they have understanding and sympathy with those organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has a great deal of power, and while it has power for getting information from illegal organisations, you have one known as Sinn Féin which asserts that somewhere in its own organisation are the powers of government; that the Government here is merely a usurpation; that loyalty to the State requires that the Government in this House should be disregarded, and that these unnamed people outside should be accepted as the Government.  You have another illegal organisation which says it is the Army, that it, somehow or other, has power or authority, and refuses to recognise this State.  These organisations, by their very nature, by the end they <Col N="886" /> seek to attain, and by the methods they propose to employ, are essentially unlawful organisations.  Some time ago I referred to one of these organisations as an illegal organisation, and the Minister for Education got up and questioned or challenged my calling unlawful an organisation that questioned that the legitimate Government of this country existed somewhere outside this Dáil, that this Dáil was a usurpation, that allegiance to this Dáil was treason, and that to support the hidden criminal body outside was true loyalty.</P>
    <P>When I suggested that these organisations were unlawful associations, the Minister for Education got up and challenged that statement.  By the laws operative in this country the Government has power to arrest any member of an unlawful association, and charge them with that membership. It has power to do that.  Every member of the I.R.A. and every member of Sinn Féin are members of organisations seeking to overthrow this State.  With regard to one organisation they have sought to procure perjury, and have been responsible for murder.  They are clearly by definition an unlawful association, and the Government and police have power to arrest any members of the organisation, and to demand of them to make available to the Government or its agents any information they have.  The Minister for Justice said that not a thing happened in the I.R.A. but is reported to him within twenty-four hours.  That is a desirable and a normal circumstance in an ordinary, civilised country.  That would be a desirable situation where the Government would be aware of the machinations of these organisations, in order that justice be put into operation, and that society should be protected.  What have we here?  The G.H.Q. of the I.R.A. are known, they go around and they hold public meetings and public brawls at Wolfe Tone's grave.  They announce what their policy is.  They assert the rank they hold, but the Government refuses to make charges against these, and the Minister tells them that they should support the Fianna Fáil organisation <Col N="887" /> because if a Government prepared to establish a reign of justice and order was to enter into possession of authority these criminal organisations would be mopped up within twenty-four hours.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Vote is being increased from £10,000 to £25,000.  I think that normally that would be eminently justifiable because the growth of criminal organisations in this country and the spread of subversive organisations is such as to make it more necessary than before. The Government should be in a position to get after these operations. This money should certainly be voted normally to enable the Government to put down these organisations, and to save society, and incidentally to save the unfortunate poor, ignorant members of these organisations from being brought into paths of crime by the criminals who lead them. The Government, which is bound by law to rule and punish, has refused to punish.  On the other hand, we have the Minister for Finance, who gets up and waxes gelatinously rhetorical about the Blueshirt organisation. If the Government has any information with regard to the Blueshirt organisation as an organisation or with regard to individual members of it they have ample power to bring these people to justice.  As far as I am concerned, if I had information which justified my believing that the Blueshirt organisation was an organisation out for the overthrow of the State, or for the overthrow of society and the protection of crime, I as a citizen should feel bound to give information to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance talks about people who came to him with information.  If he is not certain that they gave it to the police he should certainly put the police on the track of these people.  Presuming <Col N="888" /> that they would have information that it is necessary and desirable the Government should have, I think the Minister would be failing in his duty if he did not take every possible step to see that the proper authority would be possessors of that information.  We have increased the amount of this Vote from £10,000 to £25,000.  I can see that a very good case could be made for that increase, but we are going to put this money into the hands of men into whose past we need not go, beyond pointing out that they were parties to crimes that happened. We know how the Minister for Justice asserted, with regard to diabolical criminal organisations, that if his Government went out of power justice would operate, and they would be mopped up in twenty-four hours. He appeals to them by submitting that he has refrained from acting against them.  He assures them of his sympathy.  Would the House be justified in voting money for putting down crime that threatens the nation, and handing that money over to people who, by public announcement, stand for crime and for all the subversive operations going on?  It would be like trying to put out a fire by turning on a petrol hose.  The Minister for Finance made all sorts of insinuations, as to how money had been paid previously, for getting information about political opponents.  He knows perfectly well that Ministers did not necessarily know how the money was used.  The police have agents, and they certify for the payments.  I know personally that as far as the Executive Council is concerned, it was unaware of any money being paid for getting information against any constitutional political party.</P>
    <P>In yesterday's debate, I think, the Minister for Finance got up and talked about injustice and expropriation by taking possessions from people, or taking jobs from people opposed politically to the Government.  No one was dealt with except for a breach of the law.  We are politically opposed to the Government, and we venture, in spite of the thunder of President de Valera&mdash;who assures us that a word against him is high treason&mdash;to indicate <Col N="889" /> that we disagree with the Government's policy.  The Minister for Finance considers that identical with the case of people who went out with guns and shot and murdered people for the purpose of overthrowing the State.  He says they were political opponents.  It is political if you deal with men going around destroying the country, taking the lives of people if the people who do it are politically opposed.  The Government assumes that it has the right to use all its power and to make use of the money voted by the Dáil to treat constitutional opponents as we necessarily treated the campaign of murder and outrage that occurred in this country. It seems to me to be clear that we are asked to vote money into the hands of a Government who are not going to use it for its legitimate purpose.  The Minister for Finance may get up and say it is for the purpose of getting information.  The question is: what information?  They know perfectly well&mdash;and everyone in the Dáil knows, whether they pretend to or not&mdash; that it is necessary to have information about certain organisations. Presumably the Government had information beforehand about a meeting that was to take place in Parnell Square.  It is clear that they had from the fact that the police came and occupied the building belonging to us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is renewing the debate on the Department of Justice.  He must confine himself to the Vote before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no desire whatever to transgress your ruling, but I assume the Government at that time, either through the secret service or by other means, got information that a meeting was to take place at Parnell Square that was of such a nature that it was desirable that the police should watch to see the persons who would attend.  We know that the police watched, and we know that as a result nobody was arrested.  We know that the Government which prides itself and boasts to the criminals of this country that they are using the power they have to protect crime will use the power to support those seeking <Col N="890" /> to overthrow the State.  That Government, whether it took the oath or not, is oath bound to protect the State, and we are told we must increase the amount of money required by 250 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Minister gets up and talks about the money voted in 1922 and 1923.  I can quite understand that the Government might want to have more than £25,000.  As far as the Vote in 1923, was concerned the Government of that time in making use of that money felt called upon to let other Parties in the House know what it was being used for.  To the best of my memory&mdash;I admit it is rather vague on that point at the moment&mdash;the other Parties agreed with the Government that the money could be rightly spent in the way the Government proposed to spend it.  Though it was such a payment as commended itself to every Party in the House, at the same time the Government felt it its duty to make it known to the other Parties in the House.  I do not expect the present Government to make known to us in any way why they propose increasing this sum of money because we know from their own statements that they are not going to use it against those people who are essentially the enemies of the people of the country. We have very good reason to believe, both from our own knowledge and from the statement made by the Minister for Finance, that this money is to be used against those who are law-abiding citizens in this country.  The real crime of these people, first of all, is that they dared to disagree with the Government's policy, that they have dared to refuse to be terrorised, and that they have dared to stand up against the criminals who support this Government which protects them from justice.  The Government clearly wants this money not to spend it in the interests of the people, but to use it in the interests of those who are not only enemies of the country, but are the enemies of what every right-minded man and woman must necessarily stand for.</P>

      <P>It may be peculiar to be honest now-a-days, but I am proud to enjoy that peculiarity.  It is a characteristic of the Party to which I belong.  I was at a case to-day in connection with which one of your own agents agreed that a penalty was imposed upon a man because he was honest, and told the truth.  I want to know, and to get some answer from the Government Benches on the matter, what is the particular danger confronting the State to-day that makes it necessary that the Secret Service Vote should be increased by 150 per cent. and that the expenditure on Secret Service should be increased fifteen hundred times?  Is there any particular emergency?  We had an insinuation from the Minister for Finance with regard to the Blueshirt organisation. Surely to goodness that organisation has given enough pledges, and hostages of their desire to live within the law to be at least saved from the attention of <i>agents provocateurs</i> and to have their movement safe from espionage. They have lived for two years as an open political organisation, yet we have the unmanly hint from the Government Benches that there is something sinister and menacing to the State in the existence of this open Blueshirt movement.  The world knows and the Government knows that that particular organisation is a straightforward political organisation whether its members are in shirts or out of shirts.  Is that any reason for mulcting the taxpayers and bleeding the people for another £15,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Greenhorns, wearing green shirts, met President de Valera in Letterkenny the other day but that is no crime.  Greenhorns in green shirts met the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in Roscommon but that was no menace to the State.  It is a crime against the State to wear a blue shirt and it is an excuse for blistering the taxpayers in the expenditure of public money, to find out who wears a blue shirt and who does not.  Is that the condition we have come to?  Have we reached that stage that the taxpayers must be bled, and money spent to find out who is in the Blueshirt organisation and who is not?  If anyone walks up to <Col N="897" /> No. 3 Merrion Square, any day of the week, they can find out who is in, even if they do not find out who is not in. There is nothing secret about the matter. One can see any agent, any officer or any representative of the Blueshirt organisation here in Dublin, or through the country and you can get the full roll of all the Blueshirts, and of every section, and company and district.  Yet we find little touts going round drawing their £2 10s. per week inquiring who is a Blueshirt and who is not.</P>
    <P>The members of this organisation have no reason to feel ashamed.  There is no one of them whether beaten or not who is either ashamed or afraid to proclaim membership not only to the Government but to the whole world, and yet mixed up with this reference to the Blueshirt organisation we have an increase in this particular Vote of 150 per cent. and an increase in expenditure from a sum of £900 per annum to £25,000 per annum.  Is this country going to allow all these touts to exist and is it going to allow the expenditure of all this money, which has to be paid by the community, on these people?  The Government has spent an extra £9,000,000 a year by their majority in spite of the protest of the minority.  Is that not enough to buy political support for them without this subterranean expenditure, increased by over £24,000?  Must we always be blistered by providing for touts at the top, touts in the middle and touts at the bottom?  Can nothing be done now to open matters up and let in daylight on what is going on?  Are we always to curry favour with this peculiar organisation which is opposed to the law, and have we always to victimise those whose only desire is to live within the law.</P>
    <P>We have organisations, unfortunately, in this country, whose proclaimed aim and object is to overthrow this State by force of arms.  I do not care who rules this State, any organisation that says its object is to overthrow the State by force should be met by all the force of the State.  It was so met in the past.  What have we got now? We have one of the men who are expending this money saying:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="898" />&ldquo;he wants to tell the members of the I.R.A. that if there is a change of Government they would be mopped up in 24 hours.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those were the most truthful words he ever spoke.  That is a political argument that makes Deputy Donnelly laugh&mdash;if there were an alternative Government, they would deal with organised crime and mop it up in 24 hours.  How much of this money is being expended on the mopping up of an organisation which proclaims to the world that its immediate object is to upset this State by force of arms?  A man with all the responsibility of a Minister, with the peculiar responsibility of a Minister for Justice, charged with the safety of this State, goes on to tell his audience that he was appealing to them to realise their position. Appealing to them! There was not a thing that happened at an I.R.A. meeting that he was not informed of within 24 hours.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not act on it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On what is the money to be spent? For what purpose is this extra £15,000 being called for from the taxpayers? Is it to procure information upon which the Government will not act?  Is it to supply information to a Minister for Justice and to a Government who have the streak of the poltroom running from top to bottom and who will not act on the information they get?  They are faced with an organisation pledged to upset the State by force of arms.  They are spending the money and they are getting the information.  The Minister for Justice says that when they get that information they will not act on it.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;And you, boys, know the reason.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is an election next Tuesday.  Of course, the boys know the reason. There will be an election after that, and the boys will know the reason again.  But the men want to know the reason why they are paying the money; why the taxes are being sucked out of them.  The boys know the reason. You know the reason.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We will not act on the information we get, and we want you to remember that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>You cannot lie down with dogs, Deputy <Col N="899" /> Donnelly, and escape fleas.  The fleas are hopping all along that Front Bench. You cannot touch pitch and escape black.  You cannot fraternise with the foe and carry on a war.  Yet, the Secret Service Vote in every country is for the purpose of safeguarding the State&mdash;to get information for the purpose of acting on it.  I want the Dáil to realise that, from an expenditure of £951 12s. 10d. in the year 1932-33, this Vote has gone up to an estimated expenditure of £25,000 for the year 1934-35.  At the time that you are asked for that increase of £24,000 you have a pledge from the Minister for Justice, made in public, that any information with regard to organised crime and organised criminals will not be acted upon.  Let the Dáil vote in the light of that.</P>

      <P>There may be a kind of subtle humour in that remark but I do not appreciate it.  As I was coming into the House yesterday evening, my ear caught the voice of Deputy McMenamin, who was holding forth on this Vote.  &ldquo;There is £25,000,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;being voted and that money is being voted for the encouragement of spies.&rdquo;  We all know that spies have always been hated in Ireland.  Personally, I detest the word &ldquo;spy&rdquo; and I detest anybody who is a spy.  That hatred of spies of any sort comes, I think, instinctively to any Irishman. We do not want spies.  We do not like them.  Spying is repugnant and revolting to any decent Irishman.  We have had enough examples of it and enough object lessons.  Knowing all that&mdash;I presume the Leader of the Opposition knows it better than I do; I speak now of people going into political movements for the sake of <Col N="900" /> espionage&mdash;I was surprised to hear from the lips of Deputy Cosgrave himself that from November, 1922, political espionage had practically come to an end.  There was no political espionage after that date, according to the Deputy.  One unfortunate date which he gave was the 19th July, 1923.  That was just prior to the dissolution of the Dáil.  He seemed to get quite excited about it.  If I know anything about the history of that time, when Deputy Cosgrave and his Government were in office, every street and townland in the country was teeming with political spies.  Deputy Mulcahy ought to know about that. I should like to put one pertinent question about political espionage.  A fortnight after that date the present President of the Executive Council went to Ennis.  How much of the Secret Service Fund was spent in trailing the President when he went to address a political meeting in his own constituency?  We know what occurred.  I am sure that Deputy Mulcahy has a very vivid remembrance of that incident.  A week or ten days afterwards Deputy Cosgrave went to that very same town and gloated and gloried over what took place there and boasted of how the population were dispersed by rifle fire, paid for, I presume, out of the same fund.  If it was not paid for out of the Secret Service Fund, then it was paid for illegally out of some other fund to disperse illegally an election meeting to be addressed by President de Valera.  Deputy Cosgrave had the audacity, nevertheless, to come into this House this evening and make the statement he did.  Possibly he was in the dark as to what was taking place. He may not have known what his lieutenants of the type of Deputy Mulcahy were doing at the time.  He may have been kept in ignorance of some of these facts and of the expenditure of Secret Service money at that time. He made that boast in Ennis after the arrest of President de Valera.  What amount of Secret Service money was spent in that town?  I was astounded when I heard the statement that was made here to-day by the Leader on the Front Opposition Bench.  When I was director of organisation in the <Col N="901" /> offices of Sinn Fein I was handed a note from one of their Secret Service agents: &ldquo;Put on your hat and coat and come quietly or else,&rdquo; and then there was a dash.  We all know what occurred when I arrived in custody at the headquaters of the then Government to be &ldquo;put through it,&rdquo; as they said in those days.  It was easy to tell the amount of money that was being spent on political espionage in those days, and yet Deputy Cosgrave says that he invited the Leaders of the other political Parties to meet him at that time.  He said that we knew nothing about it because we were not in the Dáil then, but I can tell him that individually we were made to &ldquo;go through it.&rdquo;  Large sums of Secret Service money were expended at that time to persecute members of this Party, who are now members of this House, to hunt them and physically to disable them, yet Deputy Cosgrave says that the money was not used for political purposes at that time.  I am surprised, if Deputy Cosgrave knew, that he should have said that.  The idea has come into my head since I heard him speak that it is quite possible that he did not know.  Deputy Mulcahy may smile.</P>

      <P>I do not know, but I certainly know this: that the statement is false.  It is an unfounded statement. If ever there was a lie stated in this Assembly, that was one: that no money was ever used for political espionage from November, 1922.  So far as I am concerned, that statement will not go uncontradicted on the records of this House.  There is another matter that I want to refer to.  I have not the documents with me at the moment, and on this I speak subject to correction.  Did the previous Government&mdash;the Cumann na nGaedheal Government led by Deputy Cosgrave&mdash;ever refuse the Comptroller and Auditor-General access to these accounts?  When some of the Deputies on the opposite side are speaking I would like them to give an answer to this question: In 1927 was the Comptroller and Auditor-General refused permission to examine these accounts so that he could see how <Col N="902" /> Secret Service money was being spent? I can fully understand the attitude of Deputy McMenamin and Deputy MacDermot. They do not know.  I can quite well understand, too, the attitude of Deputy Cosgrave the leader of the Opposition, in not wanting us to go back to 1922 or 1923, and in characterising our action as nonsense.  Some day Deputies of the type of Deputy McMenamin and Deputy MacDermot will read, possibly, in some historical records that will be vouched for as to their accuracy how Secret Service money was spent by the Government that preceded this Government.  When they have read those records they will have a better knowledge than they have at present of the character of some of their colleagues in the Party they belong to to-day.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins, as usual, suggested that the increase in this Vote was for the purpose of waging war on or to get after an open, constitutional political organisation called the Blueshirts. I am not so sure that this organisation is just so open and so constitutional as Deputy Dr. O'Higgins alleges.  In my opinion that organisation is less anti-Fianna Fáil than it is anti-President de Valera.  That is the way in which, from some of its angles, that organisation appeals to me.  I was in a certain area yesterday, and from what I saw at a public meeting I feel that the Government are perfectly entitled and would be wanting in their duty if they did not keep a close eye on an organisation, judging by some of the elements that compose it.  To anyone professing Irish Ireland ideas it must be clear that no good purpose is going to be served by bringing together such elements.  I saw there ex-captains and ex-colonels of the British Army, the Hancocks and the Warrens&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was referring to the fact that Deputy Cosgrave made a statement that political espionage had stopped in November, 1922.  I simply want to refute that statement and to have it on the records of the House that that is not the case.  I introduced my remarks on this Vote by saying that instinctively every Irishman hates and detests this thing of espionage.  In this House one hears in speech after speech disrespectful remarks made about the President of the Executive Council.  They are made in provincial newspapers by people who never saw him.  They are made a mouthpiece for hurling personal abuse at him.  Only yesterday I heard that kind of thing myself, and Deputy Keating heard it. These are the circumstances under which the President has to carry on. In my opinion the Government are quite justified in increasing the Secret <Col N="904" /> Service Vote, and in keeping a careful eye on quite a lot of these gentlemen. This is a matter on which Deputy Mulcahy is not too innocent.  There was something, perhaps, in what Deputy MacDermot said that there are two lines of division on the Opposition Benches.</P>

      <P>I certainly could not reconcile all the elements that are in it, and I am not going to try.  The money asked for in this Estimate does not represent such a huge sum.  It does not follow that, because a certain sum is voted, every penny of it is going to be spent.  We had not one constructive word of criticism from the Deputies on the opposite benches. They did not make one suggestion as to how the task of the Government could be made easier, or where possible savings could take place.  Deputy MacDermot smiles.  Surely the Deputy could tell us where savings might take place.  The Deputy could easily say: &ldquo;Our Party is prepared to co-operate with the Government in the tasks that they have on hand; we are ready to advise our people to be quiet and to obey the law.&rdquo;  Instead of that we have parades and marching and countermarching and all the rest of it. There is such a thing in this country as giving provocation by going to a place where you know your presence is not welcome.  There is such a thing as that to which Deputy McGuire referred in the debate on, I think, the Estimate for the Department of the Minister for Justice, of going to an area where quarrels may arise.  The Opposition should co-operate with the Government in this respect and keep away from such places.  When they will not co-operate, certain things undoubtedly have got to be done in advance, and undoubtedly the Government have to make preparations in advance.  Deputy <Col N="905" /> Mulcahy knows that.  The Government are only doing what you did when you were in office.</P>

      <P>Well, not exactly in that respect but in taking steps to see that no disorder takes place.  Much has been made by Deputy Dr. O'Higgins of the fact that the Minister for Justice delivered a warning to a certain organisation in the country.  If he had not given that warning and if he had gone down and made a speech on something else, that would not do either.  He has often been taunted in this House with being lax in the performance of his duty with regard to that organisation, but he warned that organisation and it is much better to do that sort of thing, even if he is taunted with it here, and see what results will accrue from the warning. Do co-operate in some way and make these things unnecessary.  We have, however, your Leader reported in the papers the other day as saying, in some place or other, that his patience is nearly exhausted.  I wonder what that means?  I wonder what you intend to do with this peaceful, lamb-like organisation&mdash;the League of Youth or whatever it is?  What does he mean by saying that his patience is coming to an end?  What does it foretell? What is going to happen in the future?  We are not going to wait very long.  This Government does not know the law&mdash;the courts are getting plenty of practice in it&mdash;but the Government does not know it and they will be made to keep the law by your Leader, whose patience is nearly exhausted.</P>

I saw personal and vulgar remarks posted up about colleagues of mine, and, indeed, about myself, long before I ever saw any about the President of the Executive Council.  These facts, so far as they are facts, are totally irrelevant to whether this money ought to be provided by the Dáil or not.

      <P>Deputy Donnelly says that the necessity for secret service money would disappear if the Opposition would co-operate with the Government in everything they do. That is a lovely solution of our difficulties ! There is only one matter in which Deputy Donnelly has any right to call upon the Opposition to co-operate with the Government in relation to the expenditure of secret service money and that is in the maintenance of law and order, and, in that, we are co-operating.  It is easy to talk of provocation arising from marching and counter-marching.  There was that sort of provocation going on, rampant all over the country, before the League of Youth came into existence.</P>

      <P>Let us get back to the main point.  All that has proceeded from the mouths of Deputies opposite in relation to this particular Vote shows that they regard the money as money well spent&mdash;for what purpose? For the purpose of injuring, if they can, their political opponents, and for the purpose of furthering their own political interests, if they can.  Not a single word has been uttered by anybody over there as to the dangers that surround this State in connection with the existence of people who proclaim their desire to overthrow it.  No defence has been made of Secret Service expenditure on that ground&mdash;at least, if it has, it was not made in my presence.  This House is being asked to add £15,000 to last year's £10,000, and no excuse has been given for it except the suspicions and insinuations in which the Deputies opposite so much love to indulge in connection with the supposed sinister intentions of this Party.</P>

      <P>Take the matter about which the Minister for Finance was talking to-day&mdash;the allegation that somebody had been asked to join a reprisals gang.  I will grant this much: that has not been invented as a sort of counterblast to the document produced last night, because I heard that at the time.  That statement was reported to me at the time, in a voice of horror, by Erskine Childers, who, I am glad to say, is a personal friend of mine, and in whose honour I place implicit reliance.  I told him then, as I would tell him now, that it was tommy rot, and the whole trouble with Deputies opposite is that they will swallow any sort of tommy rot and accept any evidence, however tainted, as long as it reflects on their political <Col N="909" /> opponents.  That is why they are spending more and more Secret Service money and getting rottener and rottener information all the time.</P>

      <P>The Minister, by way of innuendo and suggestion, told us to-day what the Vote that is now being voted is intended for.  It is to carry out an espionage plan on his political opponents. The Minister has said that persons have come to him and stated that they have been asked, as members of the League of Youth, to join reprisals gangs, that he has sent them to the police, and has asked them to tell the police what they told either him or the people who were associated with him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Well now that &ldquo;if&rdquo; was born after the Minister had gone on for a number of paragraphs. I would suggest to the Minister that he would do what I propose to do in similar circumstances in the interests of getting at the facts&mdash;and what I have done in previous cases&mdash;get them to make a sworn statement to the Minister, and however narrowly they may be within or without the rules of order in this House, I will undertake to the Minister not to raise the slightest objection on a point of order to any affidavit on any matter like that which he proposes to bring into this House as a testimony of the statements he has made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has attempted to make a statement here to-day similar to that which I was proposing to make last night by way of sworn affidavit.  The Minister thinks that he can get away with the suggestions that he made in this particular way on his part where he can stop on a point of order the putting of an absolute sworn testimoney before this House.  I am quite satisfied from what the Minister has told the House that the information that is already available to us is true &mdash;that is that the members of the Government have no information that <Col N="910" /> the League of Youth is an armed organisation; that they are anxious to get that information; and that for the purpose of getting that information by hook or by crook, by manufacture or otherwise, they are increasing their Secret Service Vote to £25,000. That is the position clearly with regard to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin dragged a lot of extraneous stuff into the remarks that he had to make here.  The Deputy said he would not have spoken but he expected that there was a lot of extraneous stuff to be dealt with.  But Deputy Davin has made it a habit to speak on the Secret Service Vote.  I would draw the attention of the House to his remarks as reported in column 84 of the Official Debates of the 2nd June, 1925:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...that no case can be made out to warrant a Vote of this kind, and that no case can be made out by the Minister responsible for the spending of this money to show that any good work, or useful work, or any information of a useful nature, has ever been conveyed to the Government that would warrant this particular Vote.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is certainly the position to-day as far as the spending of this £25,000 by the Minister is concerned.  It is a handover to some of his followers.  It is a bribe to some people that he wishes to turn into spies.  He is not going to get anything from them, except that he may get this as part of the general publicity campaign carried out with the greatest and most modern assistance in ideals in a publicity campaign, to get the League of Youth stigmatised as an armed organisation.  The performances of the League of Youth can be relied upon to answer that charge in any county in this State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather regrettable that this matter was not debated in the spirit in which Deputy MacDermot approached it.  Quite obviously it is the sort of Vote that can breed a great deal of misunderstanding in the public mind and a great deal of unpleasantness between Parties in this House.  it is a distasteful thing to any man of normal sensibility who is called <Col N="911" /> upon to accept responsibility as a member of the Executive Council, to have to make himself responsible for the disbursement of moneys for a service of this kind.  But it is an unpleasant duty that has to be undertaken. Secret Service is common to every State.  Probably the manner in which the Secret Service money is used in this country is less objectionable than in most countries.  As I have already indicated, while the details of the expenditure are not surveyed by the Comptroller and Auditor - General, nevertheless, a very specific certificate has to be given by the Minister directly responsible for the expenditure of the Secret Service money, and as to the manner in which it has been expended. I am sure that no Minister would lightly give a certificate of that kind affecting his own personal honour.  The expenditure of this money is a distasteful duty.  We and our predecessors&mdash; and in this matter I make no distinction between them and ourselves&mdash; recognise that it is a distasteful duty.  In the course of years they reduced the Vote from a very considerable sum in 1922-1923 to an insignificant figure in 1931-1932.  When we came into office we were even more averse than they were to spending money on a service of this kind.  In 1931-32 the expenditure had been reduced to £1,512, and in the year 1932-33 we actually brought it down to the sum of £952.  We should possibly have reduced it even further in 1933-34 if it were not for the fact that we saw growing up before us in the country a movement of a militaristic type.  I think the word &ldquo;militaristic&rdquo; was used in relation to that movement by one of the people now holding a responsible position in it.  That is a movement in which people band themselves together as an army.  Such a movement is one admittedly in relation to which all information possible ought to be secured, because it is obvious from the pronouncements made by some of the people responsible for that movement that ultimately they were going to rely, not upon the suffrages of the people, but upon combined and organised force to give them <Col N="912" /> power in this country.  The people who were originally responsible for that movement incited their followers to fit themselves for operations as soldiers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am explaining why it is necessary to ask for money for the Secret Service.  Military titles were adopted in connection with this organisation.  I am not speaking of the existing organisation at the moment.  I may possibly have to come to that later.  Military titles were adopted by members of this organisation and by the Party opposite before Deputy MacDermot was associated with it.  In the course of their earlier proceedings, at any rate, they set themselves out to organise an intelligence service in this country&mdash;an intelligence service which would cover every field of life in the country and extend itself even into the ranks of the public service.  Documents came into the possession of the Minister for Justice and are on the records of this House establishing that fact.  The official organ of the movement did not hesitate openly to encourage the members of the movement to form an intelligence and espionage service.</P>

      <P>As I say, this was going on.  It is quite obvious that we had growing up in this country a new private army.  I object to private armies in any form&mdash;I do not care what ostensible reason those who are <Col N="913" /> associated with them may give for their maintenance.  At any rate, if it be difficult to deal with one in existence, it becomes much more difficult when there are two.  After a time, the people who were originally associated with this movement found it convenient to put on over their militaristic appearance the cloak of constitutionalism, and they proclaimed, as Deputy O'Higgins stated in this House, that they were an open organisation. But, once again, documentary evidence came into the possession of the Government, and is on the records of this House, showing that, within the open organisation, members who belonged to a certain section were being incited by the original founders of the new movement to constitute within that movement inner circles. In fact, we are having an open organisation being used as the cover for a secret society.</P>
      <P>Just as they had proclaimed that they were an open organisation, the original leaders of the militaristic element in it stated that they were an unarmed organisation.  But cases which have been brought before the courts and the convictions which have been secured in the courts show clearly that, while Deputy O'Higgins may profess that this is an unarmed organisation, at any rate it is an organisation of men, a great number of whom are in the possession of arms.  I am not going to retail to the House the specific instances which prove that fact.  But, at any rate, the fact that there are within the organisation a great number of people who have arms is well known to the gentleman who is the head of that organisation&mdash;I refer to the late Commissioner of Police, General O'Duffy&mdash;because in a report, part of which is again on the records of this House, he stated that Colonel Jeremiah Ryan and a number of other active members of the League of Youth belonged formerly to that section of the National Army which mutinied and which, in 1924, took a considerable quantity of arms from Templemore Barracks.</P>

      <P>At any rate, it is quite clear that here we have a movement which was militaristic in its origin, which has since assumed the cloak of constitutionalism, and which has within its ranks a considerable number of men who have arms and who make no secret as to the purpose for which they are going to utilise those arms.  I could refer the House to a disgraceful statement which was made by a Deputy of this House from a platform in Enniscorthy when he referred to the President of the present Executive Council as &ldquo;Public Enemy No. 1.&rdquo; I could refer to the statement which appeared in the organ of the Opposition Party&mdash;<i>United Ireland</i>&mdash;referring to this Government collectively as a gangster Government.  I could refer to the statement made by Commandant Cronin in which he pledged himself to Blueshirt supporters around that if they ever returned to power in this country there would be a wholesale proscription of the present leaders of the majority of the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacDermot, I am certain, is quite sincere in the statement which he has made that he would not stand for this sort of thing.  Deputy MacDermot, however, has not lived as long with his present colleagues as we have.  He has not seen, as we have <Col N="915" /> seen, a Minister for Defence, in breach of his constitutional duty, actuated by the grossest disloyalty to his colleagues in the Executive Council, attempt to form within the Army of this State a camarilla which was going to make him the Napoleon of the 20th century.  We have seen that.  We have realised how a secret organisation was utilised before in this country in 1921-22 to bring about a <i>coup d'état</i> and overthrow the existing Government.</P>
    <P>We are here as members of a Constitutional Government bound to fulfil our mandate to the people, but, at the same time, bound to preserve representative government in this country so long as we operate under the Constitution.  We know that there is in existence an organisation whose leaders have attempted to bring democracy into discredit; who talk about representative government as kangaroo democracy; who talked about something that they refer to as a Corporative State, which is only a euphemistic way of referring to the movement of Fascism.  We feel that the one thing that the common people of this country do not want is Fascism.  They have indicated twice already&mdash;they have indicated I might say in 1923, at any rate, that the one thing they want to ensure in this country is that the Government elected by the majority of the people will rule and will not be overthrown by force of arms.  As a Republican I accept the verdict of 1923.</P>

At any rate, as a Republican I have accepted the verdict of 1923, and that is that henceforth, whatever political issues arise in this country, they are to be determined by the votes of the people, and not by the arms of any minority or any faction in this country.  It is clear to me, at any rate, that there is a faction in this country of which prominent Deputies in the Opposition are members, of which prominent Deputies and Senators are members.  There is in existence a faction which, if it had the opportunity offering, would suppress representative institutions in this country and enthrone a junta, a hand-picked junta, as a dictatorial Government.  We are entrusted with the preservation of order and the duty of preserving representative government.  It is our duty and our responsibility to get, by whatever means are available, the fullest information about any subversive movement in this country, whether it be Blueshirt, Communist, I.R.A. or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had hoped that the circumstances which existed in 1932 would have continued in 1933.  That when, we had reduced the expenditure on secret service to the insignificant sum of £952, we would have been able still further to reduce that amount last year, and we also hoped we could look for a further reduction this year.  But owing to the circumstances which I have detailed to the House, it would be folly for us to expect, in view of the attitude which has been taken up by certain organisations in this country&mdash;more than one of them&mdash; that our wishes, our hopes, in that regard would be fulfilled.  We can only anticipate with distaste and with abhorrence that it will be necessary for us to provide a larger sum of money this year in order, in the words of the brief which was read by Senator Blythe in this House in 1927, to obtain information which is requisite for the <Col N="917" /> security of the country and the people which cannot be obtained openly.  That is our justification for putting this Vote before the House.</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is familiar with the purpose for which the Tariff Commission was established.  It was to investigate applications for tariffs which were referred to it by the Executive Council and which were made under the provisions of the original Tariff Commission Act, 1926, and the subsequent Tariff Commission (Amendment) Act, 1930.  The applications made under the Tariff Commission Act, 1926, related to the following commodities: margarine, rosaries, flour, down quilts, fish barrels, woollen and worsted tissues, which have been fully investigated by the Commission and about which printed reports, containing the fullest information, have been published. Subsequent to the passage of the Tariff Commission (Amendment) Act, 1930, the following matters were referred to the Tariff Commission: oats, bacon, hams and other pig products. With regard to these commodities also a full investigation has been made by the Commission and printed reports have been published.  In addition to these, the Commission have also been asked to inquire into the present position in this country concerning the printing and binding of prayer books, vegetable and animal oils and compounds thereof, and also casks and barrels.  Investigations in these matters are pending at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to acting as a Tariff Commission, the members also act as a Commission under the Merchandise Marks Act, 1931, and in that connection the Commission has considered, I think, during the present year, the question of the application, for restriction on sale and importation orders, made by the National Amalgamated Furnishing Trades Association, in relation to wooden furniture.  The Commission have reported in this case in favour of imported goods of the description in question being required to bear an indication of origin.  Applications are at present under examination with regard to books, playing cards and <Col N="920" /> manilla tags.  There were also applications lodged in respect of men's and boys' ready-made clothing and overcoats, suits, hats and caps and the component parts thereof, and also rosaries.  These applications have been withdrawn since by the applicants in April, 1934, and June, 1933, respectively.  I do not think there is any further information necessary.</P>

In connection with the matter of prayer books, however, public sittings have been held and visits made by the Commission to factories on the Continent (France, Belgium and Germany) and in London. The Deputy is aware that a very substantial business in the printing and binding of prayer books exists in Belgium, and it would be necessary for the Commission to visit that country, and also to visit Germany and France. The report, I understand, is now in course of preparation, and I think in connection with the present matter preliminary statutory notices have been issued.  As to the other matters, relating to edible oils, statutory notices have been issued, and statements received from parties interested in the application.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact of the matter is, the Deputy is under a misapprehension if he thinks that the Tariff Commission is not used.  It is used.  The nature of the investigations which the Tariff Commission is bound by statute to undertake, in relation to any matter that may be referred to it, is so comprehensive that, as Deputy <Col N="922" /> Lynch indicated, a great deal of time necessarily elapses before investigations are completed and the report available.  In present circumstances we have had, in order to push ahead with our industrial policy, to forego reference to the Tariff Commission, but, in regard to tariffs which the Government decided to impose, we are fully satisfied before they are brought to this House that they are practicable, and are in the interests of the community at large.  In that connection may I remind the Deputy that in the Finance Bill which went through the Committee Stage this week, there was included for consideration by the House a number of impositions of new tariffs, as well as modifications, and there was virtually, in relation to the number of commodities included in the Schedule, no discussion upon them?  The House accepted it that tariffs were necessary, desirable and beneficial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that they went through the House without discussion does not prove that the economic effects will be perfect.  Here is a whole-time body called the Tariff Commission. It should have some function, either to consider a tariff before its imposition or to watch over its operation when imposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>What function has it? That is what I am trying to get at. What are we to vote £4,000 for?  If the Commission has not that function, then if it has other functions it should be christened by its proper name.  If we call it a Tariff Commission, and if its function is not to deal with tariffs, either before they are applied or afterwards, how is it a Tariff Commission? The Minister stated that in order to carry out the Government's industrial policy they could not wait on the Tariff Commission.  There is an implication in that, that if the Tariff Commission could investigate and report they would be called in to advise the Government. If the Government want to put over a policy that the Tariff Commission was not able to keep up with, why is there not post examination of <Col N="923" /> big tariffs that very largely affect the community?  If there is no need of that what need is there for a Tariff Commission at all?  Either it has a use or it has not.  It is either advisable to investigate tariffs or it is not. If it is advisable to do so, and if the other exigencies cannot wait, why not have an investigation after a tariff is imposed to see the economic effects? Some day the Minister and his Government will find the economic ill-effects of tariffs imposed by them, which, if scientifically imposed, and in different volume, would be of decided advantage to the country, but which throttle the country when incompetently imposed, by having an overdose of tariffs pushed on it without any investigation as to the effects of these tariffs operating around the whole economic field.  I do not see what is the use of this Commission. I do not know what it does in connection with merchandise marks. Let it be a Merchandise Marks Commission if it has to deal with that question.  If you have a Tariff Commission use it.  If you do not want to use it, scrap it and save £4,000.  You can find some other use for it.  We get Orders here frequently, giving a list of duties that have been imposed.  They are in operation in a few days.  After six months they can be reviewed by the Dáil.  No expert advice is brought to bear on them.  We have it now from the Minister that the Commission does not investigate these tariffs.  The Minister talked about fish barrels, as if it mattered very much comparatively whether they were made here or not.  Other tariffs have been imposed more for revenue purposes, I am afraid, than to help industry.  If the Government's policy is thoroughly industrial, then the Tariff Commission should investigate all tariffs, either before or after application, not from the revenue point of view, but purely from the industrial point of view.  If that is not done, I think it is waste of money going on with this Tariff Commission, when it has really no function for tariffs.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £450,489 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1935, to increase the Agricultural Grant (No. 35 of 1925 and No. 28 of 1931).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total amount to be provided out of this Vote, and already provided by a Vote on Account, will amount to £900,989.  The Estimate now before the House is for the same amount as last year, and is drawn up in precisely the same form.  In addition to the £900,989, of which £450,489 is the second moiety, there will be given from the Central Fund a sum of £599,011, under Section 48 of the Government of Ireland Act, 1898, making a total under these two heads of £1,500,000.  In addition to this, however, there is, of course, the amount which will be provided under the new scheme for distribution of the agricultural grant which is to be put in operation in the current financial year. Briefly, the intention under that scheme is to allow the maximum rate of relief, which is the same rate of relief as was allowed in 1933-34, on the first £10 of valuation to occupiers of holdings not exceeding £20 valuation, and on the first £20 of valuation to occupiers of larger holdings.  Additional relief will then be made available to the occupiers of holdings exceeding £20 valuation in proportion to the number of male adults in full-time employment on their holdings.  Legislation validating this arrangement and repealing the existing statutory provisions governing the distribution of the agricultural grant, will be introduced by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health in due course.  The comprehen- <Col N="925" /> sive scheme which consists of three parts&mdash;the present Vote, the Central Fund Charge, and the additional grant under the new legislation&mdash;will bring the total amount granted in relief of rates on agricultural land up to £1,970,000.  That is to say, in addition to the amount which we provided up to the present, it will be necessary for us to bring in a Supplementary Estimate for an additional £470,000.  Provision for this additional expenditure was, of course, included in the present year's Budget.  This provision of £1,970,000 represents an increase of £220,000 on the amount provided last year, and is an increase of almost £22,000 on the peak provision made by our predecessors in office, namely, £1,948,000.  It is £22,000 more than the amount provided by them in 1931-1932.</P>

Having regard to the fact that the Dáil will have an opportunity of discussing all these proposals regarding the distribution of the agricultural grant, in 1934-1935, on the proposed Bill&mdash;in which the finances of the agricultural grant will be largely reconstructed&mdash; and again on the Supplementary Estimate which will follow that, I suggest that no very useful purpose would be served by occupying the time of the House in discussing the question at the present moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ministry, on the occasion of the introduction of the Vote of £750,000, was in opposition, and suggested that that Vote should be increased to £1,000,000, that is, an additional £250,000.  In the first year of their administration they gave that £250,000, but in the following year, which was last year, they apparently repented of their extravagance, their generosity, or the validation of their undertaking, and they deducted £448,000 from the grant last year on the plea that they were going to devote £450,000 to unemployment and insurance. That £450,000 was not so employed.  It was earmarked, set apart, and provided for, but it was never employed.  The Agricultural Grant, therefore, suffered a loss of <Col N="926" /> £448,000.  Assuming that that was the position last year, the position this year is that the Ministry has come to the conclusion that it was not wise to give that £250,000 which they fought so valiantly for a couple of years ago, and they satisfy their consciences now by giving £22,000 more.  That is the sum and substance of the whole story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I noticed that the Minister, who is by no means weak in the lungs, spoke in an inaudible tone when he was giving these figures, and, somehow or other that I could not follow, he got a figure of £1,970,000 and told us that it was £22,000 more than his predecessors gave in 1931-1932.  While the present Estimate is for £450,489, the Minister told us that from the Central Fund there will be paid a grant of £589,000 odd.  I think he must have got a dose of Government of Ireland Acts on the brain, because he referred to the Government of Ireland Act of 1898.  I think he meant the Local Government Act of 1898.  The Minister will not get away with his juggling of figures so easily as that.  The Minister is giving nothing to agriculture out of the Central Fund that was not an inherited obligation not only of this Government, but an inherited obligation of the previous Government. The original grant that he talked of, of £599,000&mdash;call it £600,000&mdash;was a grant of right to the landholders of this country, rooted in their title on their land.  The Local Government Act of 1898 was passed, and the Grand Jury system abolished, as a protection for the landlords at that time who previously paid half the local rate.  It was a section of that Act which provided that the Government would pay a grant in relief of local rates, standardised at half the rate on agricultural land for the year 1898.  That grant was in no way a relief of the burden then or hitherto borne by the farmers of the country, but a relief of the burden hitherto borne by the landlords of the country.  When we have Ministers going down the country telling the people what &ldquo;We, the Government,&rdquo; are paying in rates&mdash;as for example, the Minister for Education in Longford last week swelling his chest and saying that <Col N="927" />&ldquo;We, the Government, pay more agricultural rates than the farmers of the country&rdquo;&mdash;it shows how much that &ldquo;We, the Government,&rdquo; know about farming conditions and rating conditions in the country.</P>
      <P>The Minister wants to get some kudos out of this.  I think when it is analysed there will be very little kudos for him and his methods in reference to this £600,000.  It was in the year 1924, I think, that the previous Government that neglected industry in this country, if we are to accept the statements of the present Government, by not utilising the physical powers that they had at their command, found themselves in the possession of about £600,000 realised from tariffs.  They recognised that the farming community were large contributors, and another £600,000 was given to them.  That was the position when the Budget of 1931-32 was introduced, and when a motion was put down by Deputy de Valera, as he then was, as Leader of the Opposition, that there should be an increase in the relief of rates on agricultural land of £1,000,000.  That motion was defeated, and ultimately it was agreed by the House to give an additional £750,000.  That £750,000 was raised by the taxation then imposed and which is still functioning or producing. That sum was raised by a tax of 4d. a gallon on petrol and a 1/2d. per lb. on sugar.  The previous Administration only allowed £750,000 for the produce of this taxation, because it would not be producing fully for 12 months, but in the year ending March, 1932, it produced a yield of about £750,000.  As a matter of fact, the yield was between £800,000 and £900,000.  These taxes are producing since, and have produced £1,000,000 for the full year they have been in operation.  I put it to the Minister for Finance to contradict that.  The whole million of money advocated by the Party opposite, when they were sitting on this side of the House, has been found out of taxes imposed to give relief, out of rates, to agricultural land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The grant which is proposed for the coming year is substantially the same <Col N="928" /> as it was in 1931-32 at a time when, in the cool, deliberate, calculating judgment of the Fianna Fáil Party when they were on these benches, agriculture could not survive if it did not get £1,000,000.  We have now the Minister who was then the shadow Minister for Finance swelling his chest, and telling the House and the country how agriculture could not survive under the conditions that then existed, and that an immediate advance in the agricultural grant of £1,000,000 was essential, bringing the whole agricultural grant up to £2,200,000, or within a very few pounds of that.  What has the Minister to boast about these days?  We are now £220,000 short of what he said agriculture could not survive without three years ago.  Is agriculture in any more flourishing condition to-day than then?  Of course, whenever there is any discussion here on agriculture the one Minister who religiously makes it a point to be absent is the Minister for Agriculture.  The Government leave a Minister here who can simply sit down and smile, because he knows that the House and the country do not expect him to know anything about agriculture; and they are not deceived.  We are £200,000 short of what the Minister said we should have three years ago, and that £200,000 is being produced by taxes imposed to produce money for the relief of rates on agricultural land. When the Minister replies, I challenge him to deny that the tax imposed by the late Government to produce an extra agricultural grant in 1931-32, has produced £1,000,000 every full year since that tax was in operation; so that on the matter of this grant of £750,000 the Government to-day is making £220,000 out of the transaction. Three years ago there was a free market.  We could sell anything we produced.  The general level of prices, all over the world, was, perhaps, 20 or 30 points higher than to-day, yet when prices were better than they are to-day and when agricultural conditions, in the opinion of the Government, required £220,000 more to keep it alive than the same Government is offering to-day&mdash;that shows the difference between the politician in office and the politician out of office.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="929" /> As I said at the beginning, in the year 1924-25 or 1925-26, I am not sure which, the agricultural grant was doubled when the Government of that day found themselves with a surplus of £600,000.  The tariffs then imposed produced a surplus beyond anticipation and the Government had about £600,000 on hand.  They decided to devote that to the relief of rates on agricultural land.  Their surplus approximated very closely to the old agricultural grant, so that they decided to double the agricultural grant that year.  Now if we examine the position of the case&mdash;I was so informed at the time and I know it to be so&mdash;the Government doubled the agricultural grant because they considered the incidence of the tariff fell heavily upon the agricultural population, so they devoted this surplus out of the proceeds of the tariff to the relief of agricultural rates.  If that principle is carried out by the present Government I wonder would they be here boasting that they gave £20,000 more last year than their predecessors in office?  I have already shown that the £750,000 that in 1931-32 was given for the relief of rates was given out of the produce of taxes imposed on sugar and petrol.  Those taxes were not producing for a whole year but they produced a little over £750,000.  For a whole year they produce over £1,000,000.  Instead of the claim of the Minister for Finance that the present Government are giving, in relief of rates, £20,000 more than their predecessors gave during the last year they were in office, the present Government is, in fact, giving £220,000 less than their predecessors not actually gave, but could give, if the taxes had been producing for the whole year.  The two learned agriculturists we have on the Government Benches smile.  Nobody who knows anything about agriculture will come into the Government Benches when there is a debate affecting agriculture proceeding.</P>

      <P>The Minister was going to school later than I, but I do not think he learned as much as I did.  If the Minister gets into a more involved calculation and finds himself entangled, I shall help him out.  If he looks up a publication of his own Department dealing with imports and exports he will find that a 4d. per gallon tax on petrol imported for 12 months, with a 1/2d. per lb. tax on imported sugar, would produce about £1,100,000.  Those two taxes were imposed in 1931-32, and they produced a sum which should be devoted to the relief of rates on agricultural land.  The Government that went out that year imposed those taxes, but the taxes were not producing for a full financial year, up to 31st March, 1932.  From 1932-33, they have been producing fully, and they leave in the till of the Minister for Finance over £1,000,000 a year.  The previous Government devoted all the produce of these taxes to the relief of rates on agricultural land.  Previously the taxpayers did not pay these taxes.  I could give instances, which would be superfluous in this debate, where agricultural communities lost heavily by these taxes in comparison with the grants they got.  The agricultural taxpayer was, perhaps, more heavily hit than any other taxpayer as regards the increased tax on petrol and sugar.  He had not paid, so he could not expect the full benefit during the year of imposition, but the following year, and this year, he is paying and, while he expects to get the benefit, the Government will not give it to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister for Industry and Commerce would try his skill at a bit of arithmetic in regard to that taxation deliberately imposed for the relief of rates on agricultural land.  If he examines the produce of these taxes, he will find he will have the sum of £600,000 twice, and £1,100,000 on top of that.  That is £2,300,000.  The Minister for Finance has just boasted <Col N="931" /> that, in the present financial year, more will have been given for the relief of rates than was given by the Government's predecessors in 1931-32.  But there will have been taken from the community £350,000 more in taxation which was earmarked originally for rates on agricultural land.  The position is that we are getting, roughly, about £300,000 less relief than the previous Government gave during their last year of office.  Let the Minister for Industry and Commerce try his skill at arithmetic on that and see if he will smile.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about the farmers; I am talking of agriculture. The Minister, and his colleagues, always want to use the word &ldquo;farmer&rdquo; in order to give a sectional and class tinge to a discussion on agriculture here and, particularly, on a platform. They want to drive in a wedge and they talk of the small farmer, the big farmer, the grazing farmer, the tillage farmer, the nationalist farmer and the planter. They want to split up the country in various sections.  I am not troubling about the farmer, as such, in this matter, because, if all the farmers were obliterated, somebody would have to go and work the industry of agriculture. It is the industry of agriculture that should concern this House and not the individuals who may be responsible for sectional operation of that industry. It is the rate on the agricultural industry with which I am concerned. If the Government to-day were to deal honestly with agriculture and were to carry out the policy of devoting these taxes to the relief of rates on agricultural land, they would be giving £1,000,000 for that purpose instead of £770,000.  In doing that, they would be only carrying out the policy of their predecessors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are £230,000 short of what should be given if they carried out the policy of their predecessors.  That is only on the basis of that grant.  But their predecessors had another policy which was enshrined in their decision in 1925 to double the agricultural grant. <Col N="932" /> That policy was this: that as industrial tariffs imposed a burden on agriculture the surplus left from them should be transferred back to agriculture by way of doubling the agricultural grant.  I support the industrial policy of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, but not the method or manner in which he handles it.  He has a litany of new tariffs for us nearly every week.  Now to make a comparison between the returns from customs in 1931-32 and the returns in the last audited statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that it is relevant in this way.  The agricultural grant was doubled in 1924-25 by the previous Government.  It was doubled because of the surplus from tariffs, a surplus which approximated very closely to the original agricultural grant.  The previous Government doubled the agricultural grant at that time on the principle that industrial tariffs imposed a burden on agriculture, and they held that in doing that they were recouping agriculture in some way for the burden that was imposed on it by the Government's industrial policy. I am suggesting that the present Government should adopt a similar policy as regards the produce from customs.  If the previous Government were right in the principle that they adopted it shows that there is now an increased burden being put on agriculture without any <i>quid pro quo</i> for agriculture.  It is in that way that I want to bring in this question of the produce from customs.  If the policy adopted by the previous Government were carried out by this Government there should be a large increase in the agricultural grant, and agriculture would have nothing to thank the Government for doing that, apart altogether from the depression in prices, the economic war and other things.  I think it is substantially correct to say that the difference between the customs returns for 1931-32 and for last year&mdash;God only knows how many tariffs have been imposed since and how many we are likely to have to face this year&mdash; is about £1,500,000.  Now, if agriculture were given that sum of money it is <Col N="933" /> entitled to it in equity.  It would have nothing to thank the Government for, because who contributed it?  The man following the plough and the man milking the cows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it clear that I am not arguing against the Government's industrial policy, but I am arguing on the equities of the case.  There is the fact that the sum of £1,500,000 has been put up by agriculture.  That is an imposition that was not on agriculture three years ago.  It is fair, I submit, to make a comparison between the money grants given to agriculture in this year, 1934-35, and those that were given in 1931-32.  Owing to tariffs, agriculture is this year paying £1,500,000 more than it was paying two or three years ago.  That is the extra burden it is now bearing, and it would be only meeting the equities of the case if agriculture were recouped that sum, or, we will say, £1,000,000.  The sum of money left for agricultural purposes by the previous Government to the present Minister for Finance was £2,200,000.  If the Minister for Industry and Commerce questions my arithmetic let him disprove my statement.  That was the sum that was left available every year in the till of the Minister for Finance for the relief of rates on agricultural land, and on top of that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has in the last two years increased the burden, so far as Customs are concerned, by £1,500,000.  It would be making a liberal allowance if one were to say that £500,000 of that was contributed by people other than the agricultural population.  It would not be meeting the whole case for agriculture if instead of the sum of £1,970,000 for the relief of rates on agricultural land, £3,200,000 was given, because the money provided by the previous Government was £2,200,000, to which should be added another £1,000,000 as a set-off against the increased burden on agriculture due to industrial tariffs. That gives a total of £3,200,000.  If instead of that sum of £1,970,000 the sum I mentioned was given, it might go near fulfilling the promises that Fianna Fáil made before they became the Government.  It would go near the cost of derating agricultural land, and <Col N="934" /> with that even the Minister for Industry and Commerce might be induced to jump the fence of derating agricultural land.</P>
    <P>So far as this Vote is concerned, there is nothing in it but this appointment for the agricultural community. No varnish brush that the Minister may use can put a good face on this question of the grants.  The Minister for Finance endeavoured to-day to boast that he is giving £20,000 more than the previous Government.  Play was made by Ministers and by Deputies opposite that the amount given in 1931-32 was subject to deductions for arrears of land annuities.  That is still the position, because the amount of arrears of land annuities will be deducted from this grant.  All the county councils have been advised to that effect by the Minister for Local Government. If the Government, and, particularly the Minister for Industry and Commerce, above all Ministers of the Government, not excepting the Minister for Agriculture, were to give this matter the consideration it should be given&mdash;the Minister for Industry and Commerce puts on a tariff to increase industrial production, and it is the easiest thing in the world to increase production, to make an article, but the whole trouble is to get a market for that article&mdash;and were to advance a policy that, out of the proceeds of these tariffs, the burden on agriculture would be lightened, he need not bother about the interests of agriculture for the moment, but about the industrial interests that will be served by improving, by lightening the overhead burden, the industrial market, which is the agricultural population of this country.  I would not think that the Minister was doing any more than his duty if he came in here and, instead of refusing to give all the money the previous Government provided, or providing machinery to produce that money for him for the relief of rates on agricultural land, he obliterated all the rates on agricultural land.  He would not, in my opinion, be giving any more to agriculture than the equities of the situation demand, on the basis of the increased burden of tariffs.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the fall in <Col N="935" /> the general level of prices; I do not want to go into the loss sustained by agriculture through the economic war; I do not want to go into the loss sustained by agriculture through the quota system and the limitation of the fat cattle market in England.  I would, perhaps, test the patience of the Ceann Comhairle on these matters but for the fact that they will arise on other measures, and it is when they arise fully on such measures that they can best be dealt with, and more effectively than they can be dealt with by raising them on a subsidiary matter like this.  I desire finally to emphasise that even if there were no economic war, if that market over there remained as it was, and if there was no quota system imposed by the British, and no fall in world prices, the Government would be only giving to agriculture what agriculture is entitled to if they derated agricultural land, because of the increased burden they have put on agriculture since they came into office by the imposition of industrial tariffs, namely, a sum approximating to £1,500,000.  I wish to express dissatisfaction at the amount of this Agricultural Grant.  The Government have nothing to congratulate themselves on, and, in fact, they have deliberately betrayed agricultural interest in the matter of these grants.</P>
    <P>There are some details of these grants on which I should like to speak. Last year we were allowed, I think, 2/- in the £ on our valuations up to £20.  That meant that we were allowed £1, and we had more annoyance sending in forms for that £1 than the £1 was worth.  There is another newfangled proposal this year&mdash;the Minister for Agriculture is heartily welcome &mdash;that there shall be relief at a certain low rate on the first £20 of valuation and that in respect of each adult employed full-time there will be an allowance at the low rate of £12 10s. 0d. The working farmer who has a son or sons, of 17 years of age and over, employed full-time on the land, will be allowed to regard these as full-time employees and to get the allowance in his rate at the low rate of £12 10s. 0d. of his valuation for each adult workman <Col N="936" /> employed.  If it is right to adopt that principle, would it not, if I may use the phrase, be more right to give the allowance to working farmers who have six or seven children, none of whom is 17 years of age?  Under this arrangement, a man with a big family, the members of which are under 17 years of age, gets no allowance for that family, but a man whose family are over 17 years of age and who are worth something to him will get the allowance.  The man who is hardest hit, with a young family who are unable to work, gets no allowance, while the man with a family who are able to work will get the allowance.</P>
    <P>If that principle is to be introduced at all, I would rather support a proposal that the man with the family under 17 years of age should get the allowance in his rates rather than the man with a family of 17 years or over it, because the older family is a help while the younger family is a burden. The most difficult time for parents, whether they are farmers or not, is when the oldest child is 14 or 16 years of age and the ages of the others range downwards.  They are an expense and they have to be minded. They are going to school and are no source of help, but when they are over the age of 17 and become a help, the allowance will be given in respect of them.  I do not think that is an equitable way of dealing with the matter. That is only a detail in the application of this, but I think the county councils would gladly welcome the brushing aside of all these little things and the giving of a grant for the relief of rates which would be applied all the way through.  It will come to that yet because of the difficulties of administering the Act on these lines.</P>
    <P>Those, however, are only the details. The main principle is standing out, and no camouflage can conceal it, that the present Government inherited a sum equivalent to £2,200,000 for the relief of rates, and they have added to the burden on agriculture, £1,500,000 since, while all they offer out of that pool for the relief of rates on agricultural land is £1,970,000.  The Minister for Finance says that that is £20,000 more than their predecessors gave them, while the Minister for Industry and <Col N="937" /> Commerce said it was a question of arithmetic.  I should like to hear some arithmetical solution of his of this matter.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that I did not hear the Minister for Finance when he spoke introducing this Vote.  It would be well if Deputies, in discussing the Agricultural Grant, cast their minds back to find out where it originated.  What is the history of the Agricultural Grant?  The history of the Agricultural Grant&mdash;I presume, Sir, I am in order?</P>

      <P>This a Supplementary Agricultural Grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, a Supplementary Agricultural Grant.  The history of the Supplementary Agricultural Grant dates back a long time.  The reason of the Agricultural Grant at all is that in the past the landlords were liable for half the rates.  I do not know whether the Minister for Industry and Commerce or even the Attorney-General knew this thing to be a fact. Sometime in later years, the powers that were took a certain year's rate and they said they would give the equivalent of that as an Agricultural Grant.  I contend that half the rates only should be borne or should be a burden on the individual farmers. After the Agricultural Grant was given, the expenditure went up.  But the Agricultural Grant remained the same. I always contended even in the days of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government that the farmer or the landholder should be asked to pay only half of the local services.  The landlords had got away with their portion of it.  I have here the figures for the amount of the grant in my own constituency and the net amount which was levied.  During the year 1931-1932 they bear a very close comparison to what I argued. They are mathematically on a fifty-fifty basis.  In 1932-1933 they still bore a very close comparison, but since then the amount levied on agricultural lands has been considerably increased.  I notice in a part of my constituency that a sum of £34,000 was deducted from the Agricultural Grant the other day.  That is a very regrettable state of affairs for the farmers and it is <Col N="938" /> about time that this whole question of the Agricultural Grant towards rates on agricultural holdings should be faced up to.  We believed, in the past, and we believe it now, that we are entitled to derating on agricultural land.  That question was talked about on every platform in the country by the Government Party, who said that when they would get into power they would derate agricultural land.  What has happened?  The fact really is that it is the Government who are defaulting in connection with the local rates because they reduced the Agricultural Grant, thereby pushing on the burden to the farmers.</P>
      <P>I remember not so very long ago the railways, who were large ratepayers, went into court and applied for relief. They based their case on the fact that their paying capacity had gone down and that they should get a certain amount of relief in their rates.  Under some law or other they got this relief owing to the fact that their earning power was not as good as it had been. But then the whole thing was pushed on to the farming community.  The same thing has happened with regard to the Capitation Grant for the Mental Hospitals.  The original idea was a 50-50 basis of expenditure.  The expenditure went up, but the Capitation Grant remained the same, with the result that it was pushed on to the ratepayers, who are principally the agricultural community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the distribution of the Agricultural Grant for the coming year, I take the view that it is no credit to the Government.  Their action is only bearing out what is said on platforms all over the country&mdash;that the Government are out to smash the farmers and take their lands from them.  We may as well have it out straight.  Take a farmer with a poor law valuation of £100.  He would not be a very extensive farmer in my county.  That man is allowed the increased Agricultural Grant on the first £20, and £12 10s. for each male worker he employs.  Assuming that he has two male workers that will mean £45.  He will get a relief of 6/1 in the £ up to the £45 valuation, and then you are going to charge him 10/6 in the £ from £45 up.  Of course, <Col N="939" /> this is only bearing out the Government policy.  They have made it and they are making it impossible for the moderate or for the fairly extensive farmer to carry on.  Does not every one know what is at the root of this policy?  It simply is to smash every extensive farmer.  I take the view that the fairly extensive farmer has as good a right as anybody else in the community. If by hard work and energy he has increased his holding, does not that show that he is a class of man that should be encouraged?  The man who goes out and increases his small or moderately-sized holding by the purchase of an adjoining farm is generally the most progressive man in the community. But that is the man that the Government is out to smash, and they are getting about it in a very efficient way through the operation of the distribution of this Agricultural Grant.</P>
    <P>The other day I brought some facts in my constituency before the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  I asked the Minister if his attention had been called to a statement made recently by the Commissioner. The Commissioner, of course, is their own.  He was put there by the Government.  What does he say in connection with the whole problem?  He said that in his opinion the time has come when the annuities should be separated from the question of rate collection. It is idle to say that they should be mixed up any longer.  It is unjust because annuities are not being paid that you are going to turn around and collect them by a deduction from the Agricultural Grant. That is what is happening.  You are collecting these annuities from the ratepayers who have already paid their own rates and annuities.</P>
    <P>A question was asked here some time ago as to the amount of rates that were unfunded in South Tipperary.  It appeared that £4,000 were not funded. I presume that amount was blotted out. In the County Kerry the amount that was blotted out was £38,000.  That is exactly the position.  I have been a member of the local bodies in South Tipperary, and the ratepayers there always faced up to their responsibilities <Col N="940" /> while they were able to do so. Now owing to circumstances which I, like Deputy Belton, do not want to go into, they are unable to pay.  We do not want to drag in the matter of the economic war.  When things have gone against the farming community, and they are unable to pay, we are told by the Government and their supporters that it is a case of a &ldquo;No Rate Campaign,&rdquo; and so on.</P>

I want to say plainly that when the Derating Commission was sitting everybody expected that there would be derating of agricultural land.

      <P>I put figures before the Minister and the Attorney-General. As I said in my opening statement, the Agricultural Grant has its roots in history.  It is time to face up to the responsibility and see that the agricultural community get a square deal in connection with the grant.  I pointed out before that in the past the landlords were liable for 50 per cent. of the local rates.  That was the history of the Agricultural Grant.  Governments in this country are very good when they want to get into power and will promise the farming community everything and anything; but when they get in the farmer is left where he always was.  As I said, the fact that the Cumann na nGaedheal Government did not give full derating is one of the reasons why the present Government is in power.  But that is nothing in comparison with what is happening now.  In 1931-32, in South Tipperary, we got an Agricultural Grant of £85,000, and the net rate demanded from the agricultural community was £78,000.  In 1932-33 we got an Agricultural Grant of £85,000, and the net rate payable by the agricultural community was £89,000.  I have not got the exact figures as to the present situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say, however, that if you do not want to give full derating a fair and reasonable basis for the agricultural grant would be a fifty-fifty one.  Any Government which is in power should realise the history of the agricultural grant.  The deduction of the unpaid annuities from the agricultural grant is making the position more serious for everybody.  The Government have a responsibility in connection with the local rates and the agricultural grant, and if they evade their responsibility and do not give the amount which they should give as an agricultural grant, what is the position?  It is the Government who are defaulting.  Certainly under present conditions rates cannot be paid as they were formerly.  As I said, the increase in rates last year was equivalent to the total rates in my county in 1914-1915.  That was due <Col N="942" /> to the fact that the board of health accepted a responsibility which they should not have accepted, and that is for paying home assistance to able-bodied people.  I do not know what the position is now or will be, but certainly the Government have not covered themselves with glory as regards the agricultural grant.  They have been chopping at it and keeping it from the various county councils.  As Deputy Belton said, there has been an increase in everything that the farmer has to buy.  The Government ought to realise the position and try to remedy it.  If they do not, I cannot see how local services are going to be carried on under present circumstances, with the deduction in the agricultural grant and the inability of the farming community to meet their obligations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to join in the protest against the inadequacy of this supplementary grant.  The original policy of the Ministry opposite, before they became a Ministry, was to relieve agricultural land altogether of rates. Some of us have a vivid remembrance of the promises made in that direction. I need not go further than the debates in this House when the late Government brought in a proposal to give an additional £750,000.  Government Deputies who were then in opposition pleaded whole-heartedly for an extension of that grant.  Some of them almost went as far as advocating full derating.  I do not know that any of them went quite as far as that, even at that stage.  However, they were only a short time in office when they began to rat on the question of full derating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before they became a Government one of the arguments put forward by the President himself was that the £750,000 additional grant proposed by the late Government was no good; that £1,000,000 was the least that should be given, and that even £1,000,000 would not be any great relief to the unfortunate farmers in those days.  Having put forward his argument on that line, he pointed out the kindred ailments that the farmers were suffering from besides that of rates, and made the <Col N="943" /> remarkable allusion that the burden of tariffs fell more heavily perhaps on the farmers than on any other section in those days.  They were suffering not only from the burden of the rates, but the burden of the tariffs, and that was under the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  I should like to ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce if the farmers suffered from the burden of the tariffs in those days, how much are they suffering from the burden of the tariffs now?  Nobody ought to be in a better position to answer that than the Minister for Industry and Commerce. If, as the President maintained, the relief given then to the rates was inadequate, because the farmers were suffering from the imposition of tariffs, what sum would be necessary by way of relief now, in view of the imposition of additional tariffs? If I was to put forward no other argument for an increase in this grant now than the imposition of tariffs, I venture to say that the Minister for Industry and Commerce would agree with me that there is more necessity for an increased grant now than there was when an additional £750,000 was given. We are debarred from going into the economic war, and I have no intention of referring to it.  We cannot, however, get away from the fact that the farmers' position now is infinitely worse than it was when the additional £750,000 was given.  Many circumstances have made his position worse. His income has been depleted.  In fact, I might say it has disappeared, and his ability to pay taxation of any kind has lessened, particularly his ability to pay rates.</P>
    <P>I was not in the House when the Minister made his opening statement, but Deputy Belton stated that the Minister said he had increased the grant.  We are only concerned with this supplementary agricultural grant at the moment.  We have here added to the original amount a sum of £150,989.  I presume that is what one might call the mutilated remains of the £600,000 grant originally given.  The Minister at another period docked off £448,000 from the agricultural grant. We were under the impression that it <Col N="944" /> might have been restored in full instead of in part.</P>
    <P>No argument has been offered from the Government Benches as to why the amount of this grant should not be larger.  There is more necessity now for a large grant than even when the original grant was introduced.  When the present Government were sitting here in Opposition they told us that £750,000 was an inadequate sum, and it should be, at least, a million, or more. When they took up office they proceeded to make it a million, and I give them every credit for that, but shortly afterwards they robbed us of a sum of £448,000, and they left the position worse than it was.  The result was that nearly all the county councils were placed in a difficult position.  The announcement of the reduction of the agricultural grant was made subsequent to the striking of the rates by most county councils, and considerable difficulty ensued.  I believe that one or two county councils got into trouble because of the action they were obliged to take.  Nearly all of them were placed in the position that they had to strike a higher rate than the farmers could bear.  Almost every county council found it difficult to get in rates this year, firstly, because the rates were too high, and, secondly, because the farmers were unable to pay.  Possibly they would have been unable to pay even if the rates had been reduced because of the conditions in which they now find themselves.  That is one of the principal reasons why we demand an increase in this supplementary grant.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce adopted his usual line of argument when his Party find themselves in a hole.  He asked one Deputy here, across the House, &ldquo;Are you in favour of full derating?&rdquo; I am not going to satisfy the Minister by telling him whether or not we, as a body, are in favour of full derating.  I will, however, remind him that his Party declared not once, but a hundred times, that they were in favour of full derating, and now we want you to live up to your promises.  We want you to go as near as you can to keeping the promises that you have made.  It is <Col N="945" /> no argument to ask us are we in favour of derating.  Deputy Curran, who was asked that question, is, and so is Deputy Belton, but why should you ask them to answer for the whole Party?  I am not going to tell the Minister whether I am in favour of full derating or not.</P>

      <P>I leave it to the Minister to find that out for himself. The Fianna Fáil Party definitely tied themselves to derating when they were fighting the last election; it was one of the main planks on their platform.  The Government partly won their election on it, and one would expect they would make an attempt to live up to their promise.  One would imagine that instead of decreasing grants they would add considerably to them.  We did expect that in regard to this grant there would be a considerable increase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Ministry do not find it possible to redeem their promise in full they might at least have made a serious attempt to provide more money than they are now providing. The agricultural community are frankly disappointed with the action of the Ministry.  There can be no possible case made for lessening the grant.  The Minister is full of declarations.  Take the President's argument in regard to the original grant.  He told us, at one time, that tariffs bear more heavily on the farmers than on anybody else.  They certainly bear very heavily on the farmers now.  They have been added to considerably, and, bad as they were some years back, they are now a doubly heavy burden.  The Fianna Fáil Partly in the last election declared themselves openly to be a derating Party, and the agricultural community expected them to live up to that.  Of course, the Minister does not mind disappointing us here, but perhaps he will mind disappointing the country.  The country people are disappointed at the niggardly way the Government have attempted to live up to their promises to relieve the rates.  There never was a period when such relief was more needed.  It would be idle to advance <Col N="946" /> any further arguments than I have advanced.  I presume, at this stage, it would be useless to make an appeal to the Ministry.  I can only, in the name of my colleagues in the agricultural community, make the strongest protest possible against this very inadequate supplementary grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexHaslett" hpid="Mr. Haslett Mr. Haslett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>The very name of this supplementary agricultural grant suggests that there is a need for it.  I will just put forward some of the factors which make up that need.  We have had this supplementary agricultural grant for some years and I am rather disappointed that the Government have not embraced the opportunity that this grant would afford them of making a generous gesture towards agriculture.  They have been telling us how interested they are and what they are doing for the farmer.  Of all the grants, this is the most direct relief that the farmers can have.  I suggest there are a number of factors which ought to have weighed with the Government in making this grant larger.  I do not think any of us will vote against this grant, but I think that the Government could, with wisdom and with prudence, have made it much larger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, we have not yet discovered what our rates will be this year.  Owing to the new system of relief towards the rates that we have in operation, the returns are not yet in, and I do not think there is any secretary of any county council in a position to say yet what our rates will be. Then, there is a second factor which I would mention, and that would be the increased cost of seeds, implements, and certain manures this year.  It has been a heavy year from the point of view of meeting expenses.  I am speaking now as a tillage farmer, and I know that spring brings its own trials to the farmer, and that the matter of providing the seed for the land and meeting his other commitments at that time is a very serious thing.  Taking all that into consideration, together with the meeting of the rates, I think it was an opportunity for our Government to consider the <Col N="947" /> case of the farmer and come to his aid more generously in this grant.</P>
    <P>Then we have the question of the increase in the cost of feeding stuffs. Those of us who have been carrying on and feeding our stock have discovered that what we are trying to produce costs a lot more than it did a few years ago.  In a manner, perhaps, I would agree with Deputy Belton in this respect&mdash;that I do not object to a country raising all the feeding stuffs it can produce; but the Government in its wisdom has instituted a system now of supplying us with mixtures for feeding stuffs that raise the cost of feeding stuffs unnecessarily.  You are confronted to-day with that question and it is a serious one.  Perhaps its seriousness is more apparent to one such as I who knows the other side of the case.  At the present time we are paying about 14/- a bag for meals; that is, 14/- for a two-cwt. bag that can be purchased at 10/- where there is no mixture of meal.  That is a very big increase in the cost of feeding stuffs. Of course, then, it turns to the other side, which is the other factor I would mention, and that is the loss in the market or the decreased value of our stuffs in the market.  I am not trying to make any political propaganda out of this.  I am stating cold facts, as a tillage farmer, with the object of showing why the Government should have been in a more generous mood and have made a more generous gesture, especially towards the tillage and the feeding farmer.</P>
    <P>I was interested to see in Monday's paper a speech by our Minister for Agriculture&mdash;I think it was in Muinebheag&mdash;where he said, in connection with the arguments he put up in regard to the Vote for Agriculture:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With the single exception of cattle, the Irish farmer is to-day getting more for his produce than if the &lsquo;free market,&rsquo; so much talked about, existed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Well, now, when we take cattle out of the farmer's income, it seems to me like taking the salary out of the civil servant's income and leaving him the bonus.  It means, I would say, three-fourths <Col N="948" /> of the average farmer's income. Yet, even the length that the Minister goes in that respect is not enough. Taking the last three years' returns for cattle, we find that they have been falling by about one-third, or 33? per cent., each year.  In 1931 we had £12,000,000 odd worth of exports of cattle.  In 1932 we had £8,000,000 odd, and in 1933 we had £6,000,000 odd.  Put together, it averages a fall of about 33? per cent.</P>
    <P>Turning from cattle, there are other things to which the farmer looks to pay his rates and to meet his commitments which have fallen off too.  So that, these things altogether&mdash;I do not want to labour the point and I only want to put these few facts before the Minister &mdash;all go to show that there is really a good case for a more generous grant than we have got here.  I do not take the attitude of always crying for more, but the agricultural problem that exists to-day is largely of the Government's making, and it is their duty, I think, to come more generously to our aid in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHolohan" hpid="Mr. Holohan Mr. Holohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Holohan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make my protest against the smallness of this Supplementary Grant of £150,000, especially at such a time as the present moment, when there is such a large amount of depression amongst the farming community through no fault of their own.  I look upon this amount as altogether inadequate.  I think that, if it was meant to give relief to the farmers to anything like the extent that is required or necessary at the present moment, it would require the doubling of the whole Agricultural Grant at the present moment, not to speak of this amount of £150,000.  The condition of agriculture throughout the country was never worse than it is at the moment, and the allowances and assistance that we are getting to help the industry mean very little considering the amount we are losing through other burdens that we cannot help having imposed upon us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amount of £150,000, in addition to what is already granted, is welcome, but I venture to say that, in <Col N="949" /> distributing this £150,000 amongst the agricultural community, the amount that the owner of land will receive will be very small.  Last year, when things were somewhat better than they are now, the Agricultural Grant was reduced by £448,000.  That put an additional burden on the rates in the country I represent of about 1/8 in the £.  Therefore, it was very much harder for the rate collectors to collect the rates owing to the high rate that was fixed for the county last year. Many of those ratepayers have been brought to court and decreed for the amount.  I know of certain cases where people have been brought to court and decreed for their rates.  They are forced to pay, and they are leaving their homes practically without food or without sufficient for themselves and their families to live on.  If any relief is to be brought about by this Agricultural Grant, the amount of £150,000 is only a trifle, and it should be doubled in order to bring about any relief.  I am not now going into the fact that the agricultural community is in a bad way.  We have pointed that out on a few occasions, and perhaps there will be other occasions for doing so.  I am altogether dissatisfied with the amount of this Agricultural Grant, and I believe it will be of little use.  If the Government was any way decent the least they could do would be to double the grant in order to give some relief to the farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to join in the protest against the amount of this grant.  I was not here for the Minister's opening statement, but I understand that he said the Government had increased the grant.  Reading through it, I cannot see anything in it, except a reduction of well over £300,000, and that at a time when the agricultural community is not able to pay its way.  The small farmer is singled out as the type of man that this Government is inclined to bolster up.  Speaking for a constituency which consists 90 per cent. of small farmers, I can tell the Government that their position is very bad.  They have to bear the burdens imposed by tariffs. These are heavy items.  Agriculturists <Col N="950" /> have also to face the loss of their markets.</P>
      <P>There has been no increase in the price of agricultural products as a result of the industries that the Minister for Industry and Commerce says he has established in this State. There has been no increase in the price of butter, bacon, eggs, beef or anything that the small or the big farmer produces.  As a result of tariffs on agricultural machinery farmers have to bear big burdens.  I may say, without decrying native industry, that it will be necessary for someone to look into the quality of machinery made here, such as plough parts, spring tooth-harrows, forks, spades and shovels.  Speaking from experience, I say it would be cheaper for me to pay the tariffs on the imported article than to purchase the home-manufactured articles.  I am not saying that to decry native industry, but our manufacturers need to be reminded that their products are not up to the mark.  When they got protection, at the expense of the agricultural community, they should rise to the occasion and should produce articles as good as any coming on the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government has been recalling what the previous Government did.  It does not matter to the agricultural community what the previous Government did.  This Government has run away from promises made at the election that put them into office.  They promised full derating of agriculture but they have not given it.  Agriculture is now in a much worse position than it was.  Deputy Belton mentioned a very important matter concerning the new scheme to utilise the Supplementary Grant.  He referred to farmers with families, whose sons over 17 years of age will get an allowance.  These sons have reached the age at which they are useful and a help, but farmers with families of seven, eight or nine children where the sons have not reached 17, are not to get relief.  They will get nothing under this scheme.  To put it mildly, it is not right to discriminate in such a case, either in the case of a big or a small farmer. <Col N="951" /> Farmers want assistance when their families are young and if State assistance is given at all, it is then it is most needed.  I hope the Government will reconsider that matter.  There is little good in dealing with this grant at any length.  I suppose farmers will get no more relief.  No matter how farmers suffer, the policy is to wipe them out and to make room for another class that does not know anything about agriculture.  If this Government is in office when that time comes I do not know how they will face the problem of providing Supplementary Grants, or of dealing with rates and the collection of rates.  Do they mean to live up to the promises they made at the election?  As I am going to deal with that question, I am sorry to observe that there is not a single representative of agriculture on the Fianna Fáil Benches.</P>

      <P>Deputy Curran said that the increase in the rates between last year and the previous year in the South Riding of Tipperary equalled the entire amount levied in rates upon that area in the pre-war years, and that the tendency in that part of the country for a number of years was for rates to increase.  It is true that in most counties the rates have been moving upwards for a number of years, since the boards of assistance undertook the responsibility of providing for able-bodied destitute persons. Deputy Curran forgot to remind the Dáil that the charge for maintaining <Col N="952" /> able-bodied unemployed persons has now been taken on to the Central Fund, and to the extent that that charge increased the rates in any part of the country, the operation of the Unemployment Assistance Act, when it is in full operation, will effect a considerable reduction in the rates, particularly in county council areas. In urban areas, and in county borough areas, there is a levy on the rateable valuation to provide portion of the Unemployment Assistance Fund. There is no levy on the county council areas.  The full benefit of that Act in these areas should take the form of a substantial reduction in the rates. Deputies also forgot to remind the Dáil that, despite the fact that the Unemployment Assistance Act in its operation will mean a reduction in the rates in county council areas, we are, nevertheless, increasing the Agricultural Grant in this year by £220,000. Deputies opposite have been speaking as if we were reducing the grant.</P>

The sum provided for the relief of rates is being increased and the rates themselves are being reduced in consequence of the transfer to the Central Fund from local funds of the one charge which was causing the most substantial rise in the rates for years past.  The rates in many counties are still too high. They are high due to the mismanagement of local affairs by inefficient councils.

No doubt, in their own minds, they are the most important section in the Party but there are 55 who will vote against it and who used their votes at the Party Convention when the question came up for decision.  There are Deputies opposite at the moment who considered this question of derating, who had before them, as a Government, the report of the Commission on Derating, and who brought forward in this House arguments against derating which had considerable weight behind them, arguments which they considered justified them in refusing to carry out a policy of completely derating agricultural land.  There would be consequences direct and indirect of such a policy which would make it very unwise for anybody to adopt it without knowing clearly where it was likely to end.  So far as the farmer is concerned what really matters to him is a reduction of his total charges.</P>

      <P>When we had available a sum that would have derated agricultural land entirely we decided to avoid the undesirable consequences that might have arisen from the adoption of a derating policy and to give the farmer the same relief, in fact greater relief, in another way. The whole position of local government, the whole system of administration, is bound up with this question. That matter will be discussed here, no doubt, this year when the Bill dealing with the local government system, which has been promised, is introduced and at that time it will be open to Deputies to advocate any particular policy they like in that regard, but they cannot get away from this: that the annual amount required to derate agricultural land, if provided, would have meant a smaller cash benefit to the farmer than the single benefit of the reduction of the land annuities which he has already received.  He has got, therefore, in respect of his total charges that 50 per cent. reduction in his land annuities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In addition, he has got, as the result of Government action in relation to the relief of unemployment, the prospect of reduced rates in future.  Over and above all that he has got the prospect of securing efficiency in local administration and economy in local expenditure by his own efforts if he uses his head in the present elections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister apparently was rambling a little bit in his statements, one of which certainly intrigued me.  He, in effect, said that if there is a reduction in the land annuities coming to the farmers during the year it is by means of the Land Act passed here last year.  The Minister is not a farmer or a Land Commission annuitant. I do not think anyone of the nine members on the benches opposite at <Col N="958" /> the present moment is.  Looking round me here, I suppose five-sixths of the Deputies on those benches are annuitants.  What are the facts?  The May and June annuities were paid, or they had the responsibility for them in full last year.  Anybody who did not pay them has to pay 4½ per cent., 1 per cent. over what the Minister pays, and ½ per cent. towards the principal; that is 5 per cent.  That is what the Minister calls an advantage.  What does the State gain?  It gained £1,000,000 in November and December. They got £1,000,000 which they had not to pay out; they were ignoring the Hogan Act.  The State had £2,000,000 funded last year that is owed in land annuities.  The Minister told us that the farmers got off with 50 per cent. of the land annuities last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

I will take 50 per cent. in cash that is the other £2.</P>

      <P>We will give the Minister four and a half.  He is paying three and a half and charging four and a half for a debt which is not his, and which he has no right to, and which the State has no right to.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce went on to say that when the Unemployment Assistance Act was in full operation it would reduce the rates.  In answer to a question from Deputy Broderick in reference to the Unemployment Assistance Act when the Deputy wanted to know whether if the local body in Cork paid out they would be recouped when the Act came <Col N="959" /> into operation the Minister said he had no such power.  Last year when they stopped £440,000 out of the Agricultural Grant the Government pleaded that they were going to spend £450,000 on unemployment assistance.  So far as the farmers were concerned they allowed them one-quarter of last year's annuities.  Some of the farmers paid the May and June instalments in full and if they did not it was put down against them and they will have to pay, and the sheriff sent out to collect the amounts from them very probably. The land annuities have been halved, we are told.  What would it have cost the Ministry to derate last year? Probably £1,500,000 or £1,750,000.  Did they expect to collect the land annuities last year when they were imposing something like £3,000,000 upon the people at the same time?  The Minister says that there is £22,000 more granted this year than in the peak time of the last Administration.  I looked up the returns, for 1932-33, in respect to tariffs placed upon goods which farmers have to buy.  There was no way out of it.  The farmers had to buy goods, such as harness, phosphates and things of that sort, and I counted up £50,000.  So that the Government collected at least £50,000 on this class of goods and they are handing back £22,000 and yet they tell us that the farmers are doing well.  As far as the farmers are to benefit by the operations of the Unemployment Assistance Act the sooner they get it the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know whether the case in Kilkenny is an exceptional case.  The county council there, with its Fianna Fáil chairman, has been abolished.  That is the old county council; no opportunity was offered to the new county council which would be elected at the coming elections. What are the facts?  They raised a rate that came within £3,873 of the amount they raised in the previous year, but the contribution was less by £57,000 from the Government towards the Kilkenny County Council. The county council collected within £3,800 of the previous year but they lost £57,000 in Government grants compared to what they had the previous <Col N="960" /> year.  In other words, they were expecting to get £60,000 more.</P>
    <P>This Vote is getting into the position of other Votes.  There is a nominal Vote for £1,750,000 but how much are the county councils going to get out of that?  How much was there deducted last year from the agricultural grants through the nonpayment of the land annuities?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, the Minister does not like that point mentioned.  What counts with the farmers and ratepayers on agricultural land is what they are going to get. You talk of £2,000,000 but we soon find that only £1,500,000 is all that counts.  From the time the Land Commission was taken over from England, and we went out of office, it will be found that in the whole of the ten years the sum of £20,000 was deducted from the Guarantee Fund and added to the unpaid instalments due to the Land Commission, and consequently liable for deduction for the Annuity Fund.  So that as between 1922 and 1932 the actual deduction from the agricultural grants annually and the consequent loss of assistance to agriculture was £20,000. How much does it differ now?  Out of £1,750,000 how much is to be paid in relief of rates in the country and what is the sum that is likely to materialise out of that sum?</P>

      <P>It comes very badly from a Ministry who, when in Opposition were always telling the people about the advantages and rights of democracy now, when they are slightly intoxicated with autocracy, to be crying out &ldquo;let us dissolve the incompetent county councils of the country.&rdquo; How many Ministers opposite ever sat on a county council or know anything about the working of county councils? How many of them know anything about the position of farmers or their losses.  Deputy Curran told us a few days ago about a farmer who had £960 of savings, two years ago, and has not a penny to-day.  Look at the papers <Col N="961" /> this afternoon and you will see the depression in the prices of cattle in Dublin to-day.  Last year when there was a successful sale at the Royal Dublin Society Show Ministers boasted of our high-class breeding stock, and of the good prices they got.  But follow the sales of stock in the country and there you will see a drop, and for what reason?  The reason is that no industry in any country has suffered as much in two years as the agricultural industry in this country has suffered.</P>

When men are pushed for money, must they not cash in their goods?  Those who have reserves may hold on, but the man who is pressed all along the line cannot hold on, in face of a visit from the sheriff.  The sheriff was never more busily employed than he has been during the last 12 months.</P>

Is it not well known that the present position cannot continue?  You are endeavouring to get from people what they have not got.  You are endeavouring to get from them money which they cannot make out of their industry.  It is no pleasure to have to make that case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We ought to be able to deal with political questions separately. Economic questions should not form the subject of baton charges or revolvers and this is almost entirely an economic question.  If it be an economic question, pick out any 12 Fianna Fáil farmers and compare their position with what it was 12 months ago or two years ago.  Get the facts from them if you are so prejudiced that you will not take them from those who speak with knowledge <Col N="962" /> from this side of the House.  I am hearing, day after day, from various parts of the country of the position of affairs.  The people here in Dublin, I am told, do not know anything about the conditions.  In certain parts of the country, they are eating potatoes three times a day because they have not got the money to buy flour.  This is not a laughing matter; it is a very serious matter.</P>

      <P>I shall give the names of the two counties privately but I shall not mention them here.  I had the information from a man who has come to-day direct from one county and I received the information about the other county last week.  Could it be otherwise having regard to the colossal drop in the export trade of the country?  It is nonsense to say that the only phase of this industry that is suffering is the cattle trade. Deputy Bennett knows a great deal about the horse trade.  He can tell the House of the number of men with saleable horses who have to sell them at a sacrifice if they sell them at all. To my own knowledge, two men have had to part with animals at half the price which they would, in other circumstances, have received.  Consequently, in my view, the Dáil is not in possession of full information regarding the value to the agricultural community of this Vote.  I think that the Minister might inform the House of the sum actually paid out in cash in relief of rates last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Curran mentioned that the object of the Government seemed to be to put the big farmer out of existence.  Whether intentional or not, I think that the same thing applies to the small farmer.  The Government have taken great credit for the increase in the Agricultural Grant.  In the West, the increase in the Agricultural Grant is practically counter-balanced by the increase in home assistance, caused also by the policy of the Government. In that way it is of no benefit whatsoever. The Minister for Industry and Commerce tells us that in future <Col N="963" /> the rates will decrease owing to the operation of the Unemployment Assistance Act.  I should like to remind the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance of the resolution passed a short time ago by the Connemara Comhairle Ceanntair Fianna Fáil condemning the Unemployment Assistance Act as demoralising the people of Connemara and creating idleness there.  That is the Act the Minister for Industry and Commerce cites as giving relief to the ratepayers.</P>
      <P>Some people entitled to assistance under that Act will receive as low as 10d. per week.  A sum of 10d. per week is going to save the able-bodied unemployed, after cycling seven or eight miles to an employment exchange.  I came across a man in my own constituency not long ago who had one of these forms to fill up for a farm of a valuation of £20 or over.  He asked me to assist him in filling it.  He told me that he had one brother who was partially disabled and he did not know whether he would put him in as employed on the farm or not, as he was not able to do anything.  In filling the form, he said that it was quite possible that he would not come under the Unemployment Assistance Act and that he could not get home assistance. The boy referred to is disabled in one hand.  He was in the Post Office service for some time.  Since then, I asked this man if he had received any word from the authorities and he said that he had not got a halfpenny under any of the three headings&mdash;relief under £20 valuation, unemployment assistance or home assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government state that they are giving great relief to farmers with holdings under £10 valuation.  That would, certainly, be a relief to farmers in the West who have very small holdings. But the relief they get is a credit docket for 19/9 on a £10 valuation.  To receive that credit docket, the farmer must have his rates paid before July. That means that they have to be paid before the coming month.  That is impossible at present because, though the rates on these little farms are <Col N="964" /> small, the farmers find it practically impossible to pay them.  I know several farmers who had up to ten or 12 breeding sheep and who had to dispose of those, with their lambs, in order to pay their second moiety this year and their annuities.  In several cases which I know that has happened. It may be said that there is an increase in the price of breeding sheep and of lambs.  There was, certainly, a bit of an increase but the prices have fallen back again.  The worst feature of the position is that breeding sheep and lambs were cleared out of Galway to meet the second moiety of the rates and the land annuities and there have been no replacements on that land. That is the position down there and this increase in the Agricultural Grant is of no benefit whatsoever.  That is counteracted by the increase in home assistance.  When the grants were reduced some time ago by the Government it meant an increase in the rates in County Galway of in or about 1/5 in the £.</P>
    <P>There is another point.  It is said that the people are only hit in the case of big cattle.  The people in the County Galway are being hit just as badly in the case of their young cattle as they are in the case of the big cattle.  As regards the slaughtering of calves, would it not be a much better policy to send to the West of Ireland the calves that they are slaughtering in the South of Ireland? The position in the West of Ireland at present is that you have to pay up to £2 for a three-day-old calf while the policy of slaughtering calves is being carried out in the South of Ireland.  I paid that sum myself for three-day-old calves in Ballygar, where Deputy Killilea comes from.</P>

      <P>We could make a deal with Deputy Bennett if the Minister for Agriculture had not interfered and introduced this policy of slaughtering calves.  We are now paying in the West of Ireland £2 and £2 5s. for these three-day-old calves, while we have two and two-and-half-year-old cattle selling at £4.  We are told that the farmers are prosperous and that agriculture is paying.  I have given instances to show that that is not so. As long as that position continues, no matter what relief you give, it will not help the farmer and leaving out altogether the additional burden that has been put on him by the tariff policy of the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFinlay" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>As a representative of the farming community, I want to protest against the unjust and unfair position in which the farmers of the country have been put by the policy of the present Government.  I have been a member of the Leix County Council for the last 18 years.  It has now been abolished.  Last year our rate was up by £32,000.  The collection was £84,000, which was very good. This year, out of a rate of £136,000, we have collected £96,000.  I think that was a very good collection.  Was it because of dissatisfaction with the rate collection that the county council was abolished?  I do not think I would be doing my duty if I did not protest against the way the farming community is being treated by the Government. I was in the Dublin market to-day and had five beasts to sell.  They only made £8 5s., or about 17/- per cwt. It is very hard to expect farmers to pay rents, rates and taxes out of the prevailing prices for cattle.  The Government alone is to be blamed for the present state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government say that they have reduced the land annuities.  The position is that the farmers are paying the land annuities twice and three times over.  It is the Englishman and the people across the Border who are <Col N="966" /> making money out of the present situation.  The Government tell us that the charges on our land have been reduced by about £2,500,000.  I say that is not so.  The losses in connection with horses are as great as they are on cattle.  If I have a wellbred colt, that would be worth £70 or £80 to sell, all I can get for him is about £40.  Someone across the Border buys him and gets £80 for him, so that I lose £40 on the animal.  I am ashamed to say that it is the Government is responsible for the present position of the farmers.  Last year the grant to Leix County Council was £16,000.  This year we got nothing.  As a matter of fact, this year, before we struck the rate, we had no information from the Government about the grants.</P>
    <P>The £448,000 which used to be given in relief of rates has, of course, been cut away by the present Government. We were told that we were getting that money in another way&mdash;through a reduction in the land annuities.  That is not so because we are now paying our land annuities three times over. The farmers have been reduced to this position that all they can get for a 10-cwt. beast is £8 5s.  Will any man tell me how a farmer is going to stock his land with such prices prevailing? The prices farmers are getting for their cattle now are not sufficient to enable them to buy clothes for their families, leaving aside the other demands that are made on them.  I am sorry the Minister for Agriculture is not here because I wanted to tell him that the farmer is not getting fair play.  I do not want to say anything against the Minister for Agriculture, but I think that I have forgotten more about farming than he ever learned.  Deputy Briscoe said something yesterday about the growing of tobacco.  I want to tell the Deputy that I grew and sold more tobacco than he ever will.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The absence from the House of the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Agriculture during this discussion is very remarkable.  Deputy Cosgrave has pointed out that the Minister for Finance did not indicate the amount of money that is to come to the relief of rates on agricultural land during the coming year.  Both for the farming community and those responsible for the administration of local government that is the important thing. Deputy Cosgrave has referred to the position of the County Kilkenny. Last year in that county the county council there raised a rate that came within £3,873 of the amount they raised from the ratepayers in the previous year, while the grants from Government sources were £57,493 less.</P>
      <P>The Kilkenny County Council is gone on the ground that their financial position was not properly looked after.  The Waterford County Council is gone, too, and the position with regard to the Waterford County Council was that last year the county council paid £25,969 less than they paid the year before, but from Government sources they got £55,856 less. The Waterford County Council is gone, after, I think, about five hours' inquiry, on the ground that their financial position was not properly looked after and safeguarded.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance has been threatening the county council in Cork that, if the result of the coming elections does not give them a different county council from that which they have at present, the Cork County Council will go the way of the Waterford and Kilkenny County Councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has been complaining to the Cork County Council that the collection of rates was making very unsatisfactory progress and the chairman of the Cork County Council, in a very reasonable and a very calm <Col N="968" /> way, pointed out that, by the end of March last, the Council had collected £46,000 more in rates than last year. There was no information as to the amount of money less paid by the Government in grants&mdash;road grants, agricultural grants, or any other grants&mdash;but we may take it that if the Kilkenny County Council suffered a deduction of £57,000 and the Waterford County Council a deduction of £55,000, the deduction in the case of Cork County Council must have been very considerably more, because the relative amount normally spent by the Cork County Council, both from its own resources and from Government grants, is very much bigger than the amounts spent in the smaller counties of Waterford and Kilkenny and they are to go if their financial position is not better.  Will the Minister tell us in what way the Government is going to assist these county councils to put their finances in a better position during the coming year?  It must be perfectly clear to him that the ratepayers in Cork, Kilkenny, Waterford, or any other county, are not going to be better able to support the burden that will fall on their shoulders for the cost of local government this year than they were last year.  In fact, there is plenty of evidence to show that they are going to be in a worse position.</P>
    <P>The Minister is perfectly aware that the sheriff is active throughout the country and that rate collectors are now being forced, against their own judgment, and against the judgment of the courts they have gone before, to distrain on people who are unable to pay their rates.  There have been several declarations by district justices recently and, I think, a few of the declarations will be indicative of the very widespread condition of distress.  At Dundrum, in County Tipperary, in the middle of April last, the district justice who was dealing with the cases of persons who had been brought into his court for arrears of rates, is reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 13th April, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. A. O'Donohoe, D.J., dealing with the cases said that the evidence <Col N="969" /> disclosed a pitiable condition of things which was crying out for some alleviation from some source or another.  He thought the local authority ought to be in a position not to bring these cases at all.  The collector could do nothing because if he did not take action there was some peculiar machinery by which he was held responsible for the debt.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There you have a district justice, sitting in court, hearing all the evidence, having all the facts put before him, and looking at it in a detached and judicial way and that is what he says with regard to the cases of a certain number of Tipperary farmers.  On that occasion, there were 25 Tipperary farmers before the court in Dundrum where the rate collector had taken them directly to get an order in respect of their rates, and that was the opinion of the district justice. Deputy Cosgrave has pointed out that, day by day, we see a jolt down in the prices the farmers are getting for their produce and the Minister knows very well, as I say, that the farmers of South Tipperary, where there is a commissioner working at present, are not going to be in any better position next year to provide their rates than they were last year.  He put this Estimate before us and Deputy Cosgrave points out that there is no information as to whether the county council in Tipperary is not going to be in as bad a way, from the point of view of Government grants, this year as they were last year, or whether they are not even going to be in a worse position.  Limerick County Council protested, some time in March last, that the total amount of money being withheld from the county council, to meet default in annuities, was £88,000.  The Minister has had the Wexford County Council deciding not to strike the rate of 7¾d. in the £ required to raise the sum equivalent to the amount deducted from the Agricultural Grant for the year ended March, 1934, in respect of arrears of land purchase annuities.</P>
    <P>The condition of the farmers has been commented on by a district <Col N="970" /> justice in Edenderry as well, and by a district justice in Clonmel.  The district justice in Clonmel, dealing with the matter in April, said that he had given the people as much time as he possibly could to pay their rates but that now the situation had gone to such a point that he would not enter into the question of giving them time any more, but that he would leave it to the rate collector to carry out, without reference to him or the courts, and that any order the rate collector asked for he would give it, apart altogether from the merits of the case.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;I gave all the time I could to people who were unable to pay.  Now I have made up my mind to leave it in the collector's hands to deal with the people who are willing, but unable, to pay.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is, he takes even his court out of the situation and says, I am not going to have my court used to examine these facts.  It is no use, and I am going to give any decree I am asked for, even though the person is unable to pay, if he express willingness to pay.  I have to leave it to the rate collector to deal with his own particular statutory responsibility, and the rate collector will be responsible.</P>

      <P>Nevertheless, the Minister sitting on his seat here, or in his office in Government Buildings, cannot put his own interpretation on statements.  The statements do not affect the facts, and the facts are that in the various courts throughout the country, the district justices, examining the cases, have declared that a pitiable state of affairs exists.</P>
      <P>The only comfort that District Justice Troy seemed to have in his own mind is that the line of action he was taking in withdrawing even whatever power he had to order a period for repayment was:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I cannot see the majority of the farmers without the necessities of life, considering that they have land they can produce.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He comforts himself, at any rate, that they can have a few potatoes, a drop of milk, a bit of butter and a couple of eggs, if they cannot have what the rate collector has come to seize.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture completely keeps out of this picture.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health completely keeps out of this picture; but the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is so busy that he cannot tell where the 100 individual factories that he has are, can spare the time to come into this House and argue about the position of the farmers and their position with regard to local government.  It is a nice commentary on the line of approach the <Col N="972" /> Executive Council are taking generally as a reasonable examination of what the position is.  The Minister should tell this House how much greater the grants from Government sources are going to be to each local authority during the coming year than the grants that were got last year.  Unless they are substantially greater then we are going to have the position that many of the county councils will be found to be unsatisfactory by reason of their financial position, and, perhaps, awkward public representatives are going to be cleared out of their representative positions.  If the district justices are fading out of the picture as people who are prepared to review the facts and state their opinions about them, or if they are being pushed out of the picture, there will, in a certain number of counties at any rate, be a certain number of county councillors who will be prepared to do that.  But the Minister is preparing for the removal or the suppression of county councils on the ground that their financial position is not properly looked after.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is so busy with his factories that he does not know where they are, comes in here on this Vote to cover up the flank of the Minister for Finance and to hide the Minister for Agriculture, and asks what is our policy with regard to derating.  Our policy is that the Government should make such financial arrangements for the agricultural community that neither the rates on agricultural land nor the land annuities should be collected from them.</P>

      <P>I have been listening to this debate for some time.  It is just one long recital, jeremiad after jeremiad, a wail of woe repeated by every Deputy who has got up to speak from the Opposition side.  Certainly, the most attractive suggestion, the best suggestion and the best remark during this debate was made by the Leader of the Opposition.  It was the best remark made here for a considerable time, in my opinion, if he does not mind my saying so.  That was when he said this evening that the economic question is one and the political question is another.  There is no one <Col N="973" /> on these benches who would not agree with that.  We do.  Look at this from the economic standpoint and look at it leaving out any political issue and any other issue.  We have heard from the Opposition Benches the cure and the panacea for all the woes of the farming community summed up by Deputy Belton in the words &ldquo;Settle the economic war&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

But the economic end is one and the political end is another.  It is an awful pity before Deputy Cosgrave made that statement that some Deputy from the Opposition could not get Mr. Chamberlain to have said that the other night and Deputies on the Opposition seem to have influence there.  Mr. Chamberlain does not think that the economic and the political issues should be separated and he said so. Deputy Belton, who is so fond of quoting figures, says: &ldquo;Settle the economic war.&rdquo;  His cure for all these questions is to settle the economic war.  It is a pity he could not get Mr. Chamberlain to settle the economic war.  It is a pity that the figures given by Chamberlain did not agree with the figures given by Deputy Belton.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  Deputy Belton is fond of quoting figures but he did not mention that Mr. Chamberlain said it was not a question of cash. Deputy Belton says &ldquo;Settle the economic war.&rdquo;  He gave us figures, too.  Mr. Chamberlain said it is not a question of money.  There are very big political issues involved.  We have been asked by Deputy Cosgrave to separate the political issues from the economic issues.  If I said that Deputy Belton was not thinking on the right lines owing to political excitement I could give an instance of that. Deputy Mulcahy came along on the question of annuities and rates and made a number of points.  Is there any sane man who can stand for one moment in defence of the Laoighis County Council?  Is there any Deputy here, knowing the circumstances, the arrears of rates, the maladministration and knowing everything that has occurred, would stand for a moment and keep a body of that kind in office?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not a majority of our supporters.  Fianna Fáil was not in a majority on that council, if that is what the Deputy means, and <Col N="975" /> they refused to accept any responsibility for it.  Its suppression was due to nothing else but incompetence and maladministration by the county councillors and there is no doubt about that.  There is no doubt that the County Council of Laoighis has suffered for years because of the action of that body.  We know why Waterford and Kilkenny County Councils have been wiped out.  In Kilkenny only 50 per cent. of the rates were collected.  That certainly could not be looked upon by anybody as satisfactory.  I am surprised that Deputy Mulcahy, who was former Minister for Local Government and Public Health himself, could defend a body like that being kept in existence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of rates collected was only 50 per cent. of the total sum levied.  Is not that so? Deputy Cosgrave singled out the chairman of the county council as a butt for his criticism.  He said the chairman was mainly the responsible person for the Kilkenny County Council.  He said a Deputy of this House is the chairman of that county council.  I could not see the point of a remark like that.  Take the case of the Tipperary and Waterford County Councils. I say that there is no use in Deputies on the other side of the House disguising the fact that the reason things in these counties are so bad is because there was a conspiracy not to pay rates there.  I hope and trust sincerely that the Government will insist on the payment of rates.  Take the case of County Mayo.  Deputy Mulcahy did not refer to that county. How can the people there have a 99 per cent. clean sheet&mdash;practically the whole of the rates paid?  Take many other counties.  How do those farmers pay the rates?  There are not such big farmers in Mayo as in Tipperary and other counties and they have their rates paid.  I know that in Laoighis and other places there are farmers who have the money and do not pay <Col N="976" /> their rates.  That is my information from these localities.  They openly boasted that they would not pay the rates or annuities.  As the extern Leader of the Opposition said, coming up to the time of the local elections, they would make life intolerable for the members of the Ministry and make government impossible.  That is your local government policy.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy wants to know where is the Minister for Agriculture, and where is the Minister for Local Government and all the rest.  He says there is a kind of conspiracy on these benches to lead up to a certain position for the express purpose of scrapping other councils.  It is no pleasure to any Deputy to sit here and listen to the wails of woe from the Opposition; to listen to the contributions that come from this alleged Farmers' Party that crept into this House under proportional representation, and would not get one seat in all Ireland if proportional representation were not in existence.</P>

      <P>He wants to represent the farmers on the Dublin County Council in a week or so.  I do not know what particular section of the community he represents on the Corporation. He certainly does not represent a rural constituency in the Dáil.  He is the most cosmopolitan Deputy here. I do not know what particular section of the community he really does represent. Every time he stood for an agricultural constituency outside County Dublin&mdash;and he was only successful there once&mdash;he failed.  I think that he lost his deposit in Offaly when he stood there.  I was speaking the other day to a big farmer there, and he asked how Deputy Belton was.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>If all this is true about the terrible sufferings of the farmers, how much truer must it be of other sections of the community in Deputy Belton's constituency in Dublin?  I read in the paper the other day that for an empty house in Dublin the total contribution in the shape of rent by four families was £249.  You would get a fair-sized farm for that, and the annuity would hardly be £249.  You have half the annuities wiped out, and bounties and subsidies and every enticement to farmers to carry on.  They are the spoiled children, as somebody said, of the whole community&mdash;at least any of them that I see in this particular Assembly.  We have all these wails of woe about the farmers.

      <P>I did not attempt to take part in this debate prior to your taking the Chair, but I was interrupting the Minister for Industry and Commerce with regard to a statement he made about the county councils.  I tried to get the name of a particular county council but, in respect to the Chair, I desisted.  I do not know whether I was wrong or not, but if I had persisted as a matter of protest I might have been removed from the House.  However, that is over now.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce told the House that through the incompetency of the county councils the rates have been increased.  That was his contribution to the debate.  He told us that these men were incapable of carrying on the business and that it was through their incompetency the rates had risen.  There have been many slanders uttered in this House but that is one of the foulest ever uttered.  It is quite easy for the Minister, who draws a salary of £1,000 with a free motor car, to slander a body of men, some of them the ablest men in this country, who voluntarily give their services in the administration of their respective counties.  I think it is a scandalous thing that the Minister should, under the protection of this House, make a statement of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How did the rates increase?  Was it through the incompetency of the county councils?  Anybody who knows anything about the state of the country and what has happened knows that the Government are responsible <Col N="979" /> owing to the state into which they have brought the agricultural community and the working classes in the agricultural parts of the country.  They have so reduced them and put them out of employment that outdoor relief has had to be given wholesale up and down the country.  The principal business of the county councils in administering the affairs of the counties has been the giving of outdoor relief as a result of this.  Then the Minister has the audacity to slander this body of men.  That position of affairs was brought about not through any fault of theirs but through the fault of the Government.  Deputy Donnelly speaks about a body of men who crept into this House under proportional representation. That is what we hear from this great democrat, this paragon of democracy, who represents a constituency whose basic industry is agriculture. He says that half-a-dozen of the representatives of that industry crept into this House.</P>

      <P>What a tragedy! They have no right to be here.  I wonder does this House ever deal with the administration of agricultural affairs?  It does not.  Hence there should be no representative of agriculture here.  The Deputy spoke of the wails of woe from the farmers because they cannot pay their rates and their rents.  It is obvious that Deputy Donnelly knows nothing about the basis of rent and rates when he makes that statement.  What is the basis for rents on land in this country? How were rents fixed?  I think Deputy Donnelly is not doing himself justice when he dabbles in this thing, more particularly when he represents an agricultural county.  Rents were fixed under the Land Acts by the Judicial Courts on the value of the prices brought in by what was produced on the farms.  These courts sat from 1880 to 1886.  I have the report of the time, but, unfortunately, not here.  I wish I had it here for the <Col N="980" /> edification of Deputy Donnelly.  One of the Commissioners submitted a report in 1886, and stated that if he had then to fix the rents that he fixed in 1881, he would have halved them.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce said the reason they did not derate land last year was because the land annuities were halved.  The Minister takes absolutely no interest in the general conditions in the country and he has little knowledge of what is happening. All he does is to come in here and make reckless statements and then clear out.  What are the liabilities of the farmers with regard to annuities? They come to £3,000,000.  A sum of £4,552,000 was collected in tariffs and £2,000,000 was collected off the farmers by way of land annuities.  In addition, there was a sum of £448,000 deducted from the Agricultural Grant.  That makes a total of £6,900,000.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce tells us the farmers are well able to pay their rates because the land annuities are halved.  If this were a debating society, some academic society, it would be interesting and one could smile, but here we are dealing with realities and, in the present conditions of the country, the whole contention of the Government is absolutely ridiculous.  I wish to join in the general protest against the reduction of this Vote.</P>

The Government said to John Bull&mdash;I beg your pardon, to the British Government&mdash;&ldquo;We will not pay you the £5,000,000 a year.&rdquo; The British Government, speaking through their Ministers, said, &ldquo;We will get it.&rdquo;  Is there a man over there who can deny that the British have got it?</P>

Add to that the £1,000,000 for the 1923 Act, and that leaves £3,250,000&mdash;and we paid £4,500,000.  Now, is it not the limit of audacity for any Minister to come in here and say that we got relief last year because the land annuities were halved, when in reality we paid the British £1,500,000 more than the land annuities and we were sued for our annuities, and the annuities were collected by our own Government as well to the extent of one-half?  Is not that the position?  Is not that what every man and woman on the land of this country, of years of understanding, knows to be the position? And still we have Ministers getting up here and saying: &ldquo;We reduced the agricultural grant last year because we halved the annuities&rdquo;&mdash;entirely ignoring what the British got.  We have it even in the words of the President, where he said: &ldquo;It has nothing to do with our Government what an outside Government is collecting from the people; we must get the annuities.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would allow me to intervene for a moment.  I do not want to interrupt him but, assuming that his argument is right, what does he suggest should be done to rectify all these matters?  Can he put up some constructive suggestion to rectify these things, more particularly in view of the fact that Mr. J.H. Thomas insists on recognition of that document which the Deputy saw produced in this House&mdash; that thing of shreds and patches?</P>

      <P>We are not discussing what Mr. Thomas said on political or economic issues.  I know <Col N="986" /> that I allowed Deputy Belton to ramble a good deal from the point at issue, simply because he stated that the Minister for Industry and Commerce had suggested that the annuities were halved and Deputy Belton wanted to demonstrate that we were paying more than half.  I allowed him to demonstrate that, but now we have got to get back to this Vote and not pursue that question of the land annuities any more or the question of whether or not we are paying them to Britain.</P>

      <P>When I was speaking on this matter before, Sir, I kept right on top of this Supplementary Agricultural Grant, but the Minister for Industry and Commerce came in and religiously kept away from that matter and talked about other things.  He wound up by a political appeal for the local elections that are coming off next week, when he said that the people would have an opportunity next week of changing their councils.  That is what he was leading up to all the time.  The point he endeavoured to make was that we got relieved of half the annuities and, consequently, we could afford a reduction of £448,000 in the agricultural grant last year.  Now, when we had to pay the land annuities nearly twice to Britain, that should have liquidated the land annuities at least.  But no!&mdash;we have to pay half to our own Government and, in addition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Well, I hope that Deputies, and Ministers in particular, when they come in here, will be more restrained in their language and will speak to what is before the House. Again, I challenge any of the Ministers opposite, or any member of the Party opposite, to meet the case I have put up, which is the only case in connection with this matter. Firstly, when you took office&mdash;leaving the whole economic issue out of it or whether we are paying the land annuities at all, once, twice, or three times, and taking the Agricultural Grant alone and talking within its limits&mdash;had we not, as part of our title to our lands inherited from our fathers, the right to a remission of half the rates that were payable in 1898?  If equity had it, we had a right to a remission of half the actual rates, but we will leave it that our claim to the original Agricultural Grant was £600,000.  The Cosgrave Administration gave double that out of profits which they found in their hands in the form of surplus arising out of tariffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They doubled that Agricultural Grant.  A policy was adopted by the predecessors of this Government of returning to agriculture some of the charges that were placed upon it by the development of industry. Recognising that agriculture was entitled to something out of tariffs they gave £500,000 a year from 1924.  This Government inherited taxation that produced a revenue of £600,000, in addition to another £600,000, making £1,200,000. There was also other taxation that produced over £1,000,000 for the relief of rates on agricultural land.  The revenue produced for that purpose was, at least, £2,200,000.  The case then was that agriculture wanted <Col N="988" /> more money.  I am not going to refer now to what happened to agriculture, to the depression caused by the economic war, or the paying of the annuities.  I challenge Ministers opposite to refute that case.  Let us not have any more of the camouflage that was tried on by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and then running off.  The Minister for Agriculture and the Attorney-General are here.  I challenge them to refute that case.  In addition to that tariffs have been imposed in the last two years and there has been an increase in Customs revenue by £1,500,000. Remember, the policy adopted by your predecessors gave agriculture £600,000 from 1924.  Adopt the same policy to-day with your revenue from Customs of £1,500,000 over what it was when you came into office, which agriculture has to bear.  If that £1,500,000 extra was thrown into agriculture it would more than derate all agricultural land.  I do not want to deal with anything arising out of the economic war, beyond what was produced from taxation for the relief of rates on agricultural land, the tariffs imposed for the development of industry, and the increase in those tariffs.</P>
    <P>Your predecessors adopted the principle that agriculture should be recouped something, if not all, of the extra burden that industrial tariffs put upon it.  What case has been made by the Party opposite?  They are offering £1,970,000 for the relief of rates on agricultural land.  Against what? Against machinery for producing a revenue of £2,200,000 when they took office, in addition to the industrial tariffs which agriculture has to bear, which increased Customs duties by £1,500,000, or by a total of £3,700,000. Against that you give something back, claiming that you are giving the Agricultural Grant that your predecessors gave.  That is the case I am putting up.  The Minister for Agriculture was an absentee until now, but I challenge him to refute it.  No more will be heard from these benches about it if there is no wandering from that case.  We do not want to talk about the economic war just now.  We <Col N="989" /> will have other opportunities of doing so, and if it is relevant we will make suggestions as to what should be done. It is the Agricultural Grant purely and simply that we want to deal with now.  I put the case to show what was the position when the present Government came into office.  They have not helped agriculture.  They have cut down the grant.  They are collecting money, but they are not using it for the purpose for which it was collected. In passing, I might say that if the Minister for Industry and Commerce had any experience of local government he would know that local authorities cannot spend money for any purpose except the one for which it was collected.  If the Minister had a little experience of local government, or had a little teaching at the hands of local administrators, he would know that they cannot spend money for any purpose except that for which it was collected. They would not be allowed to use the produce of taxation except for the purpose for which it was struck. Let the Minister for Agriculture refute the case I made.  The Minister goes down the country and says: &ldquo;I said so and so in the Dáil, and I was not answered.&rdquo;  No.  He waits for the winding-up speech when no one else can speak.</P>

      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to an anomaly which exists in University College, Galway, with respect to two sets of Irish lectureships there.  In 1927 there were established as a definite advance in the policy of Gaelicisation, to which both the Government and the College were committed, lectureships <Col N="993" /> on the teaching, exclusively through the medium of Irish, of the following subjects&mdash;economics, history and mathematics.  To each of the lectureships a salary of £400 a year was attached.  Some time later, encouraged by the success of the initial experiment, three new lectureships were established for the teaching through the exclusive medium of Irish of Latin, Greek and the theory of education. The Government was in a more generous mood on this occasion and the salary attached to each lectureship was £500 a year.  I am asking the Minister now to raise the salaries attached to the first set of lectureships to the level of the second set.  In the excellence and importance, both educational and national, of the work done, in the number of hours taught and the number of students attracted, in the eminence and zeal of the lecturers, there is no room for discrimination. Both sets are doing extraordinarily good work and very gladly I take this opportunity of paying tribute to it.  Indeed, I do not know of any expenditure of public moneys which has given a richer return than these lectureships through the medium of Irish in University College, Galway; and as the money this House is being asked to vote to-day is to be, in part, expended on them, I think it right to give Deputies some account of the part Galway College is playing in the revival of the use of Irish as a full-grown literary language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Lecturer in Greek, through the medium of Irish, has edited in Irish a number of Greek plays and has done his work with such scholarship as to earn the praise of distinguished critics.  The Lecturer in Mathematics has, with <i>An Gúm</i>, ready for publication some most important mathematical works.  The Lecturer in Education is busy with an authoritative work on the theory and practice of education.  The Lecturer in History&mdash; a brilliant woman&mdash;is engaged on a history of Ireland in Irish, which will fill a clamant need.  The Lecturer in Economics, who has done remarkable work in his faculty, is, I am glad to <Col N="994" /> say, about to extend beyond the circle of his fortunate students the benefits of his work by the publication of a book in Irish on national economics. The Lecturer in Latin&mdash;another brilliant woman&mdash;has in hands a Latin grammar in Irish.  It will thus be seen that in the production of text books on subjects of vital national and educational importance the Irish lecturers in Galway College have deserved well of their country.</P>
    <P>I would also like to take advantage of this Vote to reassure the House of the effects of the compulsion it exercised some years ago on University College, Galway, when it passed a law to secure that professors and lecturers in all the faculties should be able to lecture through the medium of Irish.  This law has had the happiest results, to judge from the eminence of the professors and lecturers and the services they have been able to render, not alone to the college but to the country.  The Professor of French has written a very fine geography in Irish.  The Professor of Geology has to his credit a splendid manual of geology&mdash;all this apart from the members of the Celtic faculty who have published works which have made their names and scholarship familiar to all Irish scholars.  In another branch of the Gaelic revival in Galway, University College has played a vital role.  I speak of An Taidhbhearc&mdash;the Gaelic theatre.  The precious name is a pearl found in the stream of recent Irish literature.  Several of the professors and lecturers of the college have written or translated into Irish, from continental languages, plays for production in that theatre.  The gifted wife of the Professor of Chemistry, with the Professor of French and Prionsuis Nic Dhiarmada &mdash;a master of the dramatic art&mdash;form a triumvirate which has to its credit some of the most artistic and satisfying productions I have ever seen. The actors, too, have to a large extent been drawn from the college&mdash; students, professors and lecturers&mdash; and as their dramatic &ldquo;coach&rdquo; is one of the finest in Europe, they have learned from him to use the Irish <Col N="995" /> tongue with that melodious grace and ease that were its birthright, but which it had to sacrifice to some extent during its long penal night. For these reasons I would ask the Minister to be as generous as he can with University College, Galway, and to remove the anomaly in these lectureships which is regrettable.</P>

We would like to know what distance the Drumm Battery has got in its development, or are there any secrets about <Col N="996" /> the matter which would preclude discussion? Would it be giving secrets about the Drumm Battery if we were to discuss the matter here in the House?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy did, because if he read it he would see it announced that one of the vehicles belonging to the Dublin Corporation will be run by the Drumm Battery, and if the experiment is successful the city manager will have all the vehicles the Corporation owns run by the Drumm Battery.  That is something definite about the Drumm Battery.</P>

      <P>I think it is rather strange when introducing a Vote for a Minister simply to read out the terms of the Vote and leave it at that. I think our people are entitled to get some particulars in regard to the expenditure of money, whatever the purpose be, if it does not involve the giving away of any secrets.  On an Estimate for the Drumm Battery I think we are entitled to hear something as to how far progress has been made.  We ought to be told whether it is likely to be satisfactory and so on.  When a Vote was asked for this battery some time ago the House and the country were given some information as to how it was likely to get on. <Col N="998" /> To-day we are told nothing about it. The Vote is introduced and simply left at that.  I do not think that is quite proper.  We should at least have a statement from the responsible Minister as to why more money is wanted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is rather satisfactory, even at this late hour of the day, to hear from the benches opposite eulogies as to the great possibilities of the Drumm battery.  It was not so long ago that the Drumm battery was described as one of the greatest white elephants in the world. In spite of that declaration it is satisfactory to know, now, that the Drumm battery is going to be something that will have very satisfactory results. We hope so, and so far as we can judge from the experiments and the information that comes to our ears, it will be so.  I think it is due to the House that some information should be given to it if it does not involve disclosing any secrets.  We were asked to vote a sum of £10,000 last year.  There is an increase in the Estimate this year of £600.  No reason has been advanced for that increase. It might be well to let the House know what the Drumm battery costs the country, and to give it an idea of how long these annual charges will appear in the Estimates for the battery, and what the amount will possibly reach before the battery has achieved the great success we all hope for.  I think the Minister might let us have some little information upon these points.  It is a practical matter and we ought to have the information. Apart from certain references made some time ago, the Drumm battery is a non-contentious and non-Party matter.</P>

      <P>The title of the Vote will inform Deputies as to the position in respect of this matter.  The Vote is entitled &ldquo;Electrical Battery Development&rdquo; and the money which is being asked is for the purpose of enabling the development work which has been proceeding upon this battery to be continued.  The battery is still in the development stage.</P>

      <P>It is hoped in time that this money will be recouped in some form.  Is not that the idea?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly.  The sole reason we are proceeding with this invention is that we believe it has very considerable commercial possibilities and that, when the stage is reached at which commercial exploitation becomes possible, the State will get an adequate return for the money which it is now spending on development. The money is required during the present year mainly for the completion of the research work on which the company and the company's experts are engaged, for completing the system of patents which is necessary to protect our rights in foreign countries, to continue the operations of the Drumm trains, Nos. 1 and 2, which are in operation, and for working out processes of manufacture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No provision is made in the Estimate for contingencies, although circumstances may arise during the year which may necessitate urgent expenditure such as an order for batteries from some firm or country, which order would have to be fulfilled.  The board estimate that it will be necessary in the present year to manufacture one lorry-battery, as an experiment, one train-lighting battery, two or three bus starter and lighting batteries, as well as a Diesel starter battery.  These works are being undertaken to test the suitability of the battery for various purposes, and it is to finance activities of that kind that the money is required.  There have been a number of inquiries concerning the battery from different countries and very exhaustive tests have been carried out under the direction of the firm of transport engineers who are advising the company concerning the battery.  The company hope to be able to complete their development plans during the course of this season, in which case the question of the manner of control and the procedure for financing activities of this kind in the future would arise for consideration.  At some stage, it is inevitable that this property of ours will be placed in <Col N="1000" /> charge of an organisation which will have much closer resemblance to an ordinary commercial organisation than the present company, which is entirely financed and maintained by annual Votes in the Dáil.  At some stage, it may be necessary to provide capital in the ordinary way and to allow the company to proceed with commercial development.  That stage may be reached in the present year but that will depend on the result of the investigations and the development work which are being undertaken. The principal item covered by the Vote, apart from the items I have mentioned, is provision for salaries and working expenses.  The Board maintains a research staff of certain dimensions and employs fitters, mechanics and workmen in their factory in order to carry out battery-construction work.  A large part of the Vote is intended to meet this expenditure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the exact figures but the Deputy can get them from the revenue returns.  No new contingent liabilities have been accepted since last year and the position in that regard has, therefore, not been changed.  The total amount expended since 1929 will be found in the revenue accounts for the year.</P>

They have been given an opportunity of getting all the information it is considered desirable they should have concerning the performance of the battery.</P>

      <P>We are seeking patents and, in essence, that means that we reveal the information in return for monopoly right for a number of years. That is the essence of patent law. Somebody who has made a discovery or invented some process gives the benefit of his knowledge to the public and, in return, gets monopoly right for a period.  In the patents that we have taken out in various countries, we have set out in detail the peculiarities of the battery and the circumstances which make it a valuable commercial property.</P>
