      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether he will state the period of service given (a) in the Army and (b) in the Army reserve by Mr. Michael Nagle, No. 63034, of Charleville, County Cork; his character in the Army; and the date upon which he would normally be due for discharge from the Reserve; and whether he will state if he is aware that Mr. Nagle was discharged from the Reserve on the 5th March last; and if he will state the reasons for such discharge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>Michael Nagle had 3 years, 237 days Army and 5 years, 236 days Reserve service.  His character in the Army was &ldquo;very good.&rdquo;  He was normally due for discharge on the 12th January, 1935.  He was discharged from the Reserve on the 5th March, 1934, for the reason that his services were no longer required.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the position that this man, after eight years' service, and with a very good character in the Army, was discharged from the Reserve and simply told that his services were no longer required?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister prepared to say what is the policy behind this action of his of discharging men who have had a good character in the Army from the Army reserve without any notice and without giving them any reason?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would talk to Deputy Fitzgerald, who is sitting beside him, he would find that there is an Army regulation which empowers the Minister to discharge reservists for the reason that their services are no longer required.  The last Minister took that power for very good reason. I want to see every soldier who gives good service and whose services are required retained in the Army, but I am not going to retain men in the Army whose services are no longer required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state what are the reasons which make the services of those men of very good character who have had very long service in the Army no longer required? Will he say if it is on the recommendation of the military authorities that he has discharged these men from the Army?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>By the Department of Defence.  The only question asked is <Col N="1132" /> whether such a soldier's services are required.  If they are required, he is continued in the service; if they are no longer required, he is discharged.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister comes to the House and hides behind a term like that.  He takes a man of long service, and with very good character, and he puts him out of the Army and out of the Army reserve without giving any explanation beyond saying that the man's services are no longer required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.  The Minister for Defence has legal powers and duties to carry out, and for everything that happens in the Army he takes full responsibility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Where did the legal duties of the Minister come in in treating that man in that manner?  He takes a man of long service and good character and puts him out of the Army without any explanation except that he does not want him any more.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>What change has taken place in the Department of Defence which makes it necessary for the Minister to discharge from the Army a man of good character and who has had long service?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. D. Fitzgerald Mr. D. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was quite right in referring to that regulation about dispensing with men who have served in the Army when the number is too great, or when, for matters <Col N="1133" /> of economy it may be necessary to reduce the number.  Then comes the question of where one man is selected rather than another.  In this case the man is of good character and long service. When the Minister makes a choice between one person and another there should be some principle guiding him.</P>

      <P>On this matter, I want to ask the Minister a question. As there is a certain amount of confusion, with regard to the tea duty, arising out of the new proposals of the Minister for Finance it is well that we should be clear about it.  The Minister has power under this Bill, I think, by wiping out the preferential rate on tea coming in here from the Commonwealth countries, to reimpose a tax of 2d. per lb.  Can the Minister assure the House that he has no intention of utilising this power of reimposing this tax of 2d. without further reference to the House?</P>

      <P>I am not aware there is any confusion about the duty on tea. One newspaper did mislead its readers by an incorrect announcement upon that matter.  There has been no misunderstanding. The power is taken to give the preferential rate to any country to which it may be decided to extend it.  The question of the continuance of the preferential duty on tea now enjoyed by certain countries is under consideration in connection with certain trade negotiations proceeding. I would not like to make any statement until these particular negotiations are concluded.</P>

      <P>In speaking last night, and following Deputy McGilligan, I am afraid that I omitted to deal with a number of points of substance which were made by other speakers in the course of the debate.  I propose, therefore, for the <Col N="1137" /> moment to leave Deputy McGilligan to one side and take up some points that were made by these others. I think that any one who has listened to this debate will agree with me when I say that from a critical point of view the best speech which was made in the course of it was made by a Deputy on the Government Benches.  I refer to the speech which was made by Deputy Séamus Moore, who showed that he had, at any rate, studied the Budget: that he had studied it from the point of view of a person who was concerned about the national finances and so did not wish to make Party capital out of the result of his investigations either on one side or the other.  His speech was in striking contrast to most of the other speeches made in the course of this debate which, according to Deputy McGilligan, were characterised by an absolute avoidance of ordinary facts in the discussion of this Budget, were far removed from reality, or any sort of appreciation of business methods in their application to the finances of the State.  Deputy Moore's speech was not characterised by that absolute avoidance of ordinary facts, or by that want of appreciation of business finances of the State.  On the contrary, it indicated that he had an acute appreciation of sound principles of public finance when he asked whether we were justified in borrowing to meet the cost of the bounties and subsidies because he assumed that if these were to be an annual item in our Budgets, then they would have to be met out of ordinary taxation.  Well, we hope that these are not going to be a recurring item in our annual expenditure.  &ldquo;We hope,&rdquo; as Deputy McGilligan said, &ldquo;that there will be a realisation on the part of our friends on the other side of the water that our relation to them is not merely one of geographical proximity, but that it is also one of great strategic importance to them in time of war.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The House will recollect that last night Deputy McGilligan said that</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We have our geographical position to bargain.  That is not merely an asset, but it was recognised as an <Col N="1138" /> asset by the British Government.  It will continue to be recognised as an asset by them so long as they are in the position in which they are now in the event of war.  Would all the meat that Australia, Canada and New Zealand could have sent across the ocean in the days of the Great War have meant anything to Great Britain?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We hope that the force of that statement will be appreciated not merely here in the Twenty-six Counties but elsewhere, and that the answer which will occur to the minds of all reasonable men both here and elsewhere is this: that if by restricting our imports certain people choose to strangle our cattle trade, then in times of national emergency they are going to suffer very much more than we are in consequence. I hope also there will be on the other side of the water a realisation &mdash;once more putting it in the words of Deputy McGilligan&mdash;that in a test as between ourselves, New Zealand, Canada or Australia we have many things to offer Britain in the way of trade relationship that none of those other countries can offer and that it will be seen, once more in the words of Deputy McGilligan, that these two facts are appreciated by the British themselves and that they will manifest that appreciation in a practical manner.</P>
    <P>Therefore, because of these two facts: because we have trade advantages to offer Great Britain that other Dominions have not: because we can be of material assistance to them in times of national crises it would be from the point of view of their national security an unpardonable mistake, a mistake the consequences of which would be heavily visited upon their people, to strangle our cattle trade and to cripple our agricultural industry.  We hope that through the ultimate realisation of these important facts by all parties concerned with them it will not be necessary for us to continue these export bounties and subsidies indefinitely. By a realisation of these facts, by taking the practical view of them, I am certain that in course of time&mdash;it may be sooner or later, but eventually and <Col N="1139" /> inevitably-a settlement of the present differences between the two countries will be arranged.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore also asked what was the position of the Deferred Annuities Fund and did it actually exist as a separate fund.  My reply to that is that it has no separate existence as a fund but that the assets, in fact, do exist.  The arrears of annuities which were not collected in the later part of 1932 or the whole of 1933, have been funded at the request of those from whom they were collectible and are now being repaid by those by whom they were originally due in a compounded annuity payable over a series of years.  These annuities have become an Exchequer asset and we would be quite justified, should it be necessary to do so, to borrow against the asset which has thus been created.  It has not been necessary so far to raise any money against that security.  In fact, in the course of any negotiations which we have had in relation to Government borrowing, the question of offering it as Government security has never arisen and I have merely set it out in the Budget statement to show that when we do borrow to meet the cost of the export bounties and subsidies, we have already created, against that loan, an asset which in course of time will enable us, apart altogether from the ordinary sources of taxation, to repay whatever we may have to borrow now.</P>
    <P>Then, Deputy Moore raised a point as to whether it was necessary to issue the Fourth National Loan or not in view of the fact that we had at 31st March last over £5,330,000 in the Exchequer.  If the Deputy will consider the additional services which are envisaged this year, I think that he will satisfy himself that it was, if not essential, at any rate desirable, before undertaking these commitments that we should see our way quite clearly in the matter and be satisfied that we should have in our hands the finances which would enable us to carry them through.  When the Loan was arranged last year preliminary estimates for the Local Loans Fund had come in.  Final arrangements were being made to <Col N="1140" /> repay the Dáil Eireann External Loan. We knew we had commitments in regard to the sugar beet factory.  We knew that an issue of debenture stock was contemplated by the directors of that concern.  We knew that further moneys would possibly be required by the Industrial Credit Corporation.  We also knew at that time that the obligations which fall on the Exchequer particularly about Christmas time would have to be met, and accordingly we had to choose as to whether we were going to raise the necessary money by means of an issue of short-term bills or whether we were going to issue a long-term loan.  In every concern, whether it be a State enterprise or a private business, it is undesirable to enter into short-term commitments of considerable magnitude unless it is certain that one will be able to redeem those commitments once and for all and will not have to renew them as continuing commitments for an indefinite period.</P>
    <P>We could have quite easily arranged the finances for the last year by the issue of Exchequer bills which would have enabled us to discharge the Exchequer obligations round about the end of the year, but it would have meant that we should have had to carry them on into this year and, when we came to face the Dáil here to point out that we were going to have to raise £4,200,000 for the Local Loans Fund and the moneys for the other services to which I have referred in the Budget statement, we would be obliged to say that we had not those moneys then at our disposal, but should have to go to the money market for them.  I think it was a prudent thing, therefore, to float the Loan.  Furthermore, most of these potential commitments would be long-term commitments. In connection with the Local Loans Fund, I think that the period of advancement is 25 years.  The Dáil Eireann External Loan is paid once and for all.  We shall never recover any part of the £1,000,000 which will be expended upon it, and the export bounties and subsidies will be given once and for all also.  There was no possibility that any one of these commitments would liquidate itself within <Col N="1141" /> the ensuing 12 months.  Accordingly, as they were all long-term commitments, the proper thing to do was to provide for these payments by long-term borrowing. Therefore, if we had to go to the money market here in Dublin for that money it was essential that we should go on the basis of a long-term loan.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also raised a question with regard to the funds which we have invested in respect to the Savings Certificates Interest Equalisation Fund and the money which we have in the National Loan Sinking Fund and he asked us would it not be possible to utilise those for the constructive purposes to which the Fourth Loan is to be applied.  The answer to that is that Savings Certificates constitute an obligation which is liable to be paid on demand. Any person who has a Savings Certificates can go into a Post Office and cash it there and receive both the principal and some portion of the accrued interest.  I think it would be a very shady practice-at the very best, it would be a misleading practice-if we were to say that we have provided £1,600,000 for the Savings Certificates Interest Equalisation Fund and then invest it in long-term securities.  That money is only invested, as far as it possibly can be, in short-term securities, or in securities which can be realised without depressing the market to any undue extent.  It is not easy to find such securities here; in fact, it is very difficult.  It is one of the problems which have always confronted those who are charged with the management of funds in this country.  At any rate, it is an essential requirement that, if funds of this sort are to be invested, they can be quite easily realised, in case those who have invested in securities such as Savings Certificates want suddenly to realise their money and so that the Exchequer will be able to meet all its obligations in regard to them, as far as they are foreseeable, on demand.  Accordingly, we should not be justified in investing the great bulk of the Savings Certificates Interest <Col N="1142" /> Equalisation Fund in either the Third or Fourth National Loans.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister got the total amount of Savings Certificates outstanding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to deal with the point the Deputy raised.  The total amount, with accrued interest, is £9,598,000.  That can be offset to the extent of £1,800,000.  Deputy Moore pointed to the fact that we had over £890,000 of the National Loan Sinking Fund unapplied and asked if we were not going to use the Sinking Fund to finance outstanding commitments.  It is one of the conditions of the issues of National Loan that the Sinking Fund be applied to the purchase of the actual stock in respect of which the Sinking Fund has accrued.  It is a testimony to the standard of credit of the Government that it is exceedingly difficult for us to purchase a sufficient amount of that stock in the open market to fulfil our Sinking Fund requirements.  On that account, the amount of the Sinking Fund unapplied has increased from year to year.  I may say that that has been particularly noticeable since we came into office.  These, I think, were the three principal points raised by Deputy Moore.  The mere fact that he did raise them indicates that he, at any rate, has not approached the discussion of this Budget with any lack of appreciation of business methods in their application to the finances of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry I cannot say the same of the other Deputies who participated in the debate.  I think, in fact, that only two speeches from the Opposition require serious attention-the speech of the Parliamentary Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Cosgrave, and the speech of Deputy MacDermot.  I propose to deal with a few of the points which they raised.  Deputy Cosgrave said there was increased taxation this year of £100,000.  Of course, he said, the sum of £400,000 was ascribable to the customs duties on foreign-manufactured sugar which was imposed in February of this year.  That is the sort of assertion in substantiation of <Col N="1143" /> which I should like to have some facts adduced.  If Deputy Cosgrave had taken the trouble to refer to the White Paper he would have seen that so far from the receipts from customs and excise, in which, of course, sugar duties are included, being estimated at £400.000 more this year than they yielded last year, on balance there is a decrease of £450,000&mdash;a decrease of £733,000 in the customs side and an increase of £270,000 odd budgeted for on the excise side, due to the fact that next year, when the Carlow sugar concern is working, the burden of taxation which was formerly borne by all imported sugar will be transferred, to a large extent, to the native product, and any increase in sugar price will be attributable, not to expenditure upon the ordinary services of the State, but to the provision for the farmers, who grow the beet, of a reasonable price for their product, and in providing farmers' sons and other workers in country towns&mdash; Carlow, Thurles, Mallow and Tuam &mdash;with the wages that were formerly paid to foreign firms who made the sugar which was consumed here.  I anticipate that, when the year closes, it will be found that the total yield from sugar in customs and excise duties will not greatly exceed the total yield which we got from sugar last year.  There is no substance in the statement made by Deputy Cosgrave that, on the whole, we are taking an extra £400,000 out of sugar this year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave challenged the allowance I had made for over-estimation. He started out by eliminating from the calculation those items for which we had borrowed, and for which we propose to borrow, and also by eliminating the new items, and came to the conclusion that it would be necessary to apply the figure 5.7 per cent. to obtain the amount we allowed for over-estimation on Supply Services next year.  He wished the House to conclude from that that our allowance was, in fact, excessive.  As to the first point, I should like to remind the Deputy, if he were here, that it was the invariable practice of his Government, and of Mr. Blythe <Col N="1144" /> when he was Minister for Finance, to calculate the allowance for over-estimation upon the same basis&mdash;the Supply Estimates included in the volume of Estimates&mdash;and that we have merely proceeded on the same basis, and have taken the figure, 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>The question arises whether experience would indicate that, in taking the figure in that way, we are making an excessive allowance for over-estimation. I have had the actual figures got out for me, and I find that while, in most years, the actual percentage saving, due to over-estimation, was of the order of six, in only one case in ten years did it fall below five, and that was an exceptional year.  So that in taking the figure 4 per cent.  for over-estimation, I am working upon a conservative basis.  There is no reason, therefore, to believe&mdash;and I presume this is the point Deputy Cosgrave really wished to make-that the budgetary position is in any way unsound because I have taken the figure 4 per cent. for over-estimation. As I pointed out, I have a considerable margin in that figure, a margin from past experience of about 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Deputy questioned the propriety of raising, by borrowing, £1,500,000 for the payment of export bounties and subsidies.  He also referred to the figure £300,000 which we propose to raise in order to make advances to the Guarantee Fund.  As to the £300,000, I should like to point out that the actual amount of the funded annuities against which this advance has been made, is about £500,000 or £550,000.  It is very difficult to calculate the amount exactly because of the overlapping between one year and another which took place over a period of ten years.  The sum is between £500,000 and £550,000, and we are taking £300,000 of that this year.  It is not being given as a free grant.  It is an advance to the Guarantee Fund and it will be paid out of the Guarantee Fund to the county councils in anticipation of the collection of those arrears which, undoubtedly, will be collected in the course of time.  It will enable the Guarantee Fund to refund to the county councils the sum of £300,000, withheld from them, which sum would, in the <Col N="1145" /> normal course, not have been available to them from the operation of the Guarantee Fund this year, owing largely, as I pointed out, to the failure of a comparatively small, but well organised, section of tenant purchasers to meet their obligations to the Land Commission in respect of the lands which they have purchased from the State.  This advance to the Guarantee Fund will, we believe, be repaid in time because one thing is certain&mdash;that the great mass of honest people in this country are not going to permit any man to remain in possession of the lands of this country unless he discharges his obligations to the people of this country.  Those who are taking up the attitude of refusing to pay their annuities must also contemplate that, if they maintain that attitude over a period, the time will come when they will be asked not to pay their annuities but to give up their lands.  As we hold the security of the land of this country for that advance, I think that we are quite entitled to borrow against it.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of the borrowing which Deputy Cosgrave questioned was the raising of the £1,500,000 for payment of the export bounties and subsidies.  He said that we had against that an asset which he valued at £2,500,000.  In fact, the total amount of the funded arrears in respect of the last half of 1932 and the whole of 1933 is £4,445,000.  On the principle that the £300,000 we are advancing to the Guarantee Fund will be ultimately repaid, there is no doubt whatsoever that, over a period of 30 or 40 years, the whole of that sum of £4,445,000 will be repaid to the Exchequer.  It is a good asset, and I think we are justified, on the soundest principles of public finances, in raising, if necessary, £1,500,000 against it.  The Deputy questioned the propriety of including the sum of £1,511,000 in respect of the Road Fund in the statement of our assets.  His words were: &ldquo;These advances do not appear to me to be a justifiable asset.&rdquo;  That is rather an extraordinary statement from a Deputy who was once head of the Administration here and who stood in this House and, every year from 1928 to 1931 defended Budgets in which <Col N="1146" /> the advances to the Road Fund were presented as an asset of the State which could be set off against the outstanding National Debt. I do not consider that that practice was unsound.  Every year we are collecting in respect of the Road Fund a considerable sum in motor licence duties.  It does not follow that we are bound to apply that money solely to the upkeep of the roads.  Elsewhere it has long been regarded as an anomaly that taxation which, in most cases, is levied upon a luxury service should be earmarked for expenditure upon roads.  In the early days, when the roads of the State were not adapted to motor traffic, it was, I admit, quite justifiable and wise to earmark the duties which were collected in this way for that particular purpose. If the proceeds of the motor duties were, over a period of years, to be much in excess of the sum required for the proper upkeep of the roads, I should not accept the principle that road licence duties should, therefore, be reduced and that the ordinary taxpayer should not reap some benefit from the collection of those duties and from the growth of motor transport generally.  Apart altogether from that, any moneys expended from the Road Fund up to the present have been expended entirely upon maintenance and improvement of roads.  Therefore, these advances are a proper charge upon the Road Fund and, if the general account of the Exchequer has had to make advances to the Road Fund to carry out these works, the Exchequer is quite entitled to regard those advances as a sound and secure asset, the value of which will ultimately be realised to the full.  That was the attitude our predecessors took up with regard to advances to the Road Fund and I am following that practice.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave also alleged that there was a mistake in relation to the tea duty on page five of the Budget statement.  If the Deputy will take the trouble to read my speech again, he will find that I was dealing there with the yield from the customs duties generally.  If he will compare the figures which will be published in <Col N="1147" /> the Finance Accounts in due course with the statement which I made on the Budget he will see that what I have already stated in that regard is quite true; that there was an increase in the yield from customs duties or that it exceeded the Estimate by £77,000 and that it was £126,000 more than last year.  I do think that the Deputy has taken the yield for customs and excise and presented those figures.  If he reads my speech again he will see that I was referring to the yield from customs duties alone.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacDermot raised a couple of points in relation to the position of the Savings Certificates and the Post Office Savings Bank.  I have already pointed out in my Budget statement that we have made full provision to cover the interest which has accrued to date on the Savings Certificates issued.  It is not the practice anywhere to set up a sinking fund in respect of Savings Certificates.  These certificates are a much more liquid form of investment than any that I know of.  As I say, they are payable on demand.  The practice is to allow the certificates to be self-liquidated and that the redemption of outstanding certificates is, in general, made out of the proceeds of the issue of certificates which are current at the time.  I am not sure that in certain eventualities that is not a very dangerous practice.  It could become a very dangerous practice if, offering an unduly generous rate of interest on the Savings Certificates, the amount in issue was becoming so high that a very large uncovered position would be built up which would become top heavy and which, in times of public uneasiness, might lead to a financial crisis if people rushed in and presented their Savings Certificates for simultaneous redemption.</P>
    <P>We have endeavoured to meet that position by reducing the rate of interest which hitherto was allowed on those Saving Certificates so as to slow down subscriptions to them just to that amount which will enable us to balance the repayment of certificates with fresh issues and to keep the total amount of issue of Savings Certificates around the neighbourhood of £10,000,000.  I <Col N="1148" /> do not think it is necessary to go any further than that.  I do feel, as was pointed out before when this matter was under investigation by the Public Accounts Committee, that we were paying far too high a price for the money which we were getting on these Savings Certificates.  We have now reduced the interest payable on those to a figure comparable to that which the British authorities are giving in respect of the Savings Certificates issued by them.  I am satisfied that the present position in regard to Savings Certificates is such that we could handle it without any great difficulty and that we have sufficient liquid resources to meet not merely the demand for the £10,000,000 but for a much greater sum if such demand happened to be made upon us.  Accordingly, following the general practice not to create a specific sinking fund for Savings Certificates, and as we are in a position to meet any demand which could be made upon us at any time up to the maximum amount of the certificates issued, I do not think it necessary to do anything more.</P>
    <P>On the question of the position of the Post Office Savings Bank, to which Deputy MacDermot also referred&mdash;I am at particular pains to give the information I am giving in respect of these matters in view of the speeches which have been made, not by the Deputy but by certain members of the organisation to which the Deputy belongs, and notably by the leader of that organisation who quite recently has been doing everything he possibly could to destroy the credit of the State and to create public uneasiness as to the way the resources of the State have been managed by us.</P>
    <P>In regard to the position of the Post Office Savings Bank the last figures I have were those for the 31st December, 1932.  The last account was presented to the Oireachtas on 11th August, 1933. At that date the balance due to the depositors, including accrued interest, was £4,171,000.  The total amount of the securities held by the Post Office Savings Bank authorities against that figure was £4,913,200.  Of these securities the sum of £841,542 were advances on the securities of the annuities to be provided by the annual Vote of the <Col N="1149" /> Oireachtas.  The rest consists of £944,000 in cash and the balance in securities mainly of this type:-5 per cent.  Second NAtional Loan; 4½ per cent.  Third National Loan; 5 per cent. Compensation Bonds; 4½ per cent. Land Bonds; 3½ per cent.  War Stock; 5 per cent.  Treasury Bonds; 4 per cent. Funding Stock; 4 per cent.  Consolidated Stock; 4½ per cent.  Conversion Stock and 3½ per cent.  Conversion Stock.  There was a very insignificant holding of £20,000 in Guaranteed 3 per cent. Stock.  The investments in the Second and Third National Loan were comparatively small; they did not amount to more than £250,000.  So that the total of the assets, amounting to £4,913,000, held by the Post Office Savings Bank, with the exception of the annuities, is held in the most liquid form.  There would not be the slightest difficulty in realising any of them at their full face value.  For that reason the Post Office Savings Bank is in a particularly liquid position.</P>
    <P>The Deputy, in a general criticism of the Budget, stated that he regarded the Budget as being fundamentally unsound because of its magnitude and he went on to point out the criticisms which, I think 25 years ago or so, were advanced by leading public men in Ireland with regard to the Budgets introduced by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer.  It is quite true that budgeting for a large amount may be a great calamity.  It is quite true that such a Budget may be eventually unsound, even though it may be made to balance. It will depend, however, upon the purpose to which the moneys that are being raised under it are to be applied.  But the days when the mere magnitude of the Budget could be cited as an objection and as a proof of the unsoundness of the financial position have long gone, because when Gladstone and his contemporaries were laying down mid-Victorian principles of finance the element of social service was almost wholly absent from the Budget.  The sums which were being taken from the taxpayer then were being expended mainly in maintaining armies and navies, diplomatic services <Col N="1150" /> and the paraphernalia of courts and royalty.  It was largely exhaustive expenditure, expenditure which, in many cases, never yielded any return to the Exchequer, expenditure for purposes which created a further burden on the Exchequer, such as the building of warships, with the consequent imposition of a secondary burden on the taxpayer for their munitionment.</P>
    <P>These were the things which represented the greater portion of budgetary expenditure in the old days.  But the whole position has been changed. Expenditure now on public services is no longer mainly exhaustive, as it used to be.  It is mainly transfer expenditure at the present moment, expenditure upon social services, upon the payment of old age pensions, upon the provision of maintenance and assistance for the unemployed, upon the provision of public works, upon the encouragement of housing and upon one hundred and one things which represent the transfer of unused purchasing power in the great majority of cases to individuals who will be in a position to use that purchasing power, first of all, to maintain life in themselves and to create a demand for goods and services from other people. It is not, therefore, as I have often said, the size of the Budget that should be called in question, but the purpose to which the expenditure which the Budget contemplates is going to be applied.</P>

      <P>If I may interrupt. I wonder if the Minister realises that the principles which he is now laying down would have justified to the full the Labour Budgets in 1930 and 1931 in England which nearly brought England to bankruptcy?  Might I also ask him whether he bears in mind the statement made by his own leader, President de Valera, in 1929, when he said that social services could reach a figure and, he believed, had reached a figure in this State, where they did damage to the community instead of giving advantage to it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy is going to ask me to accept as correct his statement that the Labour Budgets of 1930 and 1931 were <Col N="1151" /> responsible for the position in Great Britain.  On the contrary, what was mainly responsible for the position in Great Britain was the unwise speculation in Great Britain on the part of the British inhabitants, in the first instance, and in America largely also on the part of the British citizens, in the second instance. Those two factors contributed to build up a speculative condition in the United States which had its repercussion in Great Britain in 1930 and 1931.  The budgetary difficulties in Great Britain then were not primarily due to a failure to maintain speculative incomes there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It might have been quite true to say that in 1929 if we were to continue to make the payments to Great Britain which were a feature of the Budgets of that, the preceding and succeeding years, if we were to continue to take out of this country £5,000,000 a year and send it over to Great Britain and get nothing in return for it, if 25 per cent. of our budgetary expenditure was to be of an exhaustive nature as that £5,000,000 was, then it is quite true, I believe, that the limit of our expenditure upon social services had been reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what the President said.  That is what the Minister wishes he had said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy ought to stand as a Labour candidate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>But if, as has since been demonstrated, that exhaustive expenditure were to cease and, instead, the money were to be spent in providing additional social services in this country, then the community as a whole would benefit from it, as the experience of last year showed, when every possible tax showed a yield in excess of the Estimate and, in most cases, in excess of the yield secured in 1931-32.  That brings me to a criticism made by Deputy O'Sullivan, that we had underestimated the yield from Customs duties.  It is quite true that we had, because we were unable to gauge the limits to which people in this country <Col N="1152" /> would go in order to be able to say to their neighbours that the clothes or the boots which they wore were made in Paris or London.  And while it is quite true that the duties on wearing apparel exceeded the Estimate by £330,000, and the duties on boots exceeded the Estimate by £150,000, that is due mainly to the fact that people who can afford to pay for their clothes are prepared to pay almost twice as much as they are worth in order to be able to say that they were made in some place other than in this country.  While as a moralist one may bewail the fact that people should be so vain, nevertheless, as Minister for Finance, whenever I see a lady wearing a gown that cost her twice as much as it ought to have, because she would not have her clothes made here, I always console myself with the knowledge that she is keeping an old age pensioner for 13, 14 or 15 weeks of the year, and that other people, who are prepared to wear Irish clothes and Irish boots and shoes, are in consequence relieved of the burden.</P>
      <P>One of the points that has been made most frequently, made by Deputy MacDermot, I think, amongst others, was that this Government should not assume to itself all the credit for the strong, financial position of the country.  In my speech on the Budget last year, as well as in my speech on the Budget for this year, I made it quite clear that we claimed no credit for that.  I pointed out that the fact that this country was financially and economically as strong as it has shown itself to be was almost as great a surprise to us as to other observers.  Deputy MacDermot went on to say that this strength was largely due to the operation of land purchase in this country and that when we regarded the British National Debt we ought to remember that certain assets were created by that debt and that we were enjoying the benefit and advantages of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing that strikes me about Deputy MacDermot's speeches is that always in them, here and there, there seems to be a hiatus in his knowledge of the events which took place here over the last 20 or 30 <Col N="1153" /> years.  He knows all about land purchase, but he does not seem to know anything about the Great War.  We are told that we are now enjoying in the British market for Irish produce a lower price relatively speaking than the Irish farmer ever enjoyed before-that is a much lower price than the world price.  If the Deputy were in Ireland during the period from 1914 to 1920, he would remember that all farm prices in this country were strictly controlled and, if he were to compare the prices which were paid at that time in Great Britain for Irish butter and eggs, for Irish bacon and Irish cattle, with the prices that were being paid for Danish produce, for instance, he would have seen that we were not getting one-third of the world prices.  He would see that if the British financed land purchase-and they had to do it in order to compensate the people whom they had planted on the land&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and who had constituted themselves the British garrison in this country for generations-they had to do it out of loyalty to them and not out of affection for the common Irish-if they did that they would have recouped themselves to the full during the World War years here. If it took £112,000,000 to complete land purchase in this country, they secured that in one year by compelling our farmers to grow the produce and to sell it at the price they fixed themselves, which was at least one-third of the world price at that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that this is a debt of honour.  That is one thing, at least, that we can set off against it, even assuming-which we do not-that there is any legal or moral foundation for the British claim. The fact that they compelled our farmers during the World War years to sell at the prices they fixed, when they held control of the land of this country, is sufficient to wipe out any claim they could otherwise sustain against us for land purchase. When Deputy McGilligan is telling us about the prices we might secure in the British market if only they were now able to enforce their <Col N="1154" /> will upon us he should remember the moral of the War years.  At that time, because we were tied to them, for the reason that those who led us at the time took up exactly the same attitude towards Great Britain as Deputy MacDermot and his colleagues are taking up to-day, they were able to fix the price, and not we.  Once we allow them to feel that the British market is so essential that we cannot do without it and that we are not prepared to make such sacrifices as may be necessary to secure our economic freedom-for that is what is at stake in this-they will be able to regard us as serfs willing to work for the wages they fix.</P>
    <P>We were told by Deputy McGilligan and the others about this great British market.  We were told that, because of our geographical position, that market is open to us&mdash;if only we will say the word and be loyal members of the Commonwealth and forget all about the political aspirations of our own people and make up our minds to fall in with the other States which, at Ottawa, signed certain agreements.  How are the States which went to Ottawa, which had no quarrel with Great Britain upon political issues-how are they feeling about the matter to-day?  I have a copy here of the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> of to-day's date.  On the principal news page there is an article with this heading: &ldquo;New Zealand Under the Quota.&rdquo;  I shall read a few extracts from this article to the House.  The despatch is from Wellington, New Zealand, and dated April.  It runs as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;People in England can scarcely realise the change in the outlook in New Zealand which has followed the growing conviction that within less than 18 months the market for the Dominion's cheif export, dairy produce, must undergo, if Britain means business with the quota, a serious restriction.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then, the correspondent, referring to the fact that from the New Zealander's point of view England should be a much richer country, agriculturally, than New Zealand, and that, therefore, there is ample scope for the <Col N="1155" /> development of agriculture in Great Britain, goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But what is to become of New Zealand under the quota?  That is what is exercising people's minds now.  Every other issue in politics is eclipsed by this new portent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is to say, by the fact that New Zealand is going to be shut out of the British market.  The article continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Comical, if it were not so tragic, would be the spectacle of leading politicians and prominent personages rushing about wringing their hands in despair...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So that they have their Deputy Beltons in New Zealand also.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...ready to sacrifice the secondary industries built up by years of high protection and give Britain Free Trade or anything, if only this frightful quota is dropped.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The article goes on to say lower down:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As it is, there is a respite till the summer of 1935... New Zealand has so long to put her house in order and adjust her rural economy to the limitation of her only important market, for practically 90 per cent. of the Dominion's exports go to Britain.  How is it to be done?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then, listen to the plight of the New Zealand dairy farmer in face of the possible quota restriction:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;How is this to be done?  From the authorities so far there is no sign of a plan.  The recent dairy conference produced nothing for publication except talk of a subsidy to the industry-£2,000,000 was suggested-to bring prices up to a paying figure. Not even the present Government would dare to add that burden on the taxpayer to the bounty the farmers are getting through the arbitrary fixation of exchange at £125 to £100 sterling.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, at any rate, there is one thing certain, that there <Col N="1156" /> is no prospect for a Butter (Prices Stabilisation) Bill in New Zealand, or of getting £1,100,000 out of the consumer for unemployment assistance, or of £2,250,000 for export bounties and subsidies, or of £470,000 of increased relief of the rates on agricultural land, but there is this fact staring the New Zealander straight in British market is going to be closed to him just as it is closed to us, and there is this further fact on the face been said so often in this House is being realised by every intelligent man in the Commonwealth, that there is no longer going to be free import into Great Britain for any sort of agricultural produce as long as the British farm lands themselves remain undeveloped, that there has been a complete change in the attitude of the British Government towards the British agricultural producer, and that every other Dominion, whether as loyal as New Zealand or whether Canada, Australia or South Africa or ourselves, if we are still in the Commonwealth, will have to reorganise its agriculture to meet the changed conditions.  The only difference between them and us is that while they have not started to do it, we began to do it two years ago and we are now nearly at the end of our job.</P>

He pointed with a great deal of pride to the excellent record of certain Commonwealth States in regard to recent public issues and he asked us how it was that we did not do as well as they did.  I say that in those States, at any rate, the Opposition Party had responsible statesmen at the head of its affairs.  I said, in the course of my Budget speech, that the Fourth National Loan was issued in somewhat unpropitious circumstances, and that has been applied to the correspondence which took place between the President of the Executive Council and the British Secretary for the Dominions at that time.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Referring to the loan, General O'Duffy said... but the people would want some guarantee that the money would not be used for vote-catching and Communist policy purposes. He knew that they had one of the arch-Communists of the Free State residing at Cobh.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That speech was made by the leader of the Opposition Party-by the &ldquo;someone.&rdquo; as Deputy Cosgrave referred to him, in the course of his statement-on the very evening of the day upon which the announcement that <Col N="1159" /> the new loan was to be issued was first made.  It was an indication at once of the attitude which this gentleman, at any rate, who, I presume, spoke also for Deputy Cosgrave, for Senator Blythe, for Deputy MacDermot, Deputy Fitzgerald, Deputy Mulcahy, and the other members of the Opposition Party who sit in this House, was prepared to take in regard to the loan.</P>

      <P>I have pointed out that on the 8th December this statement was made by General O'Duffy, the leader of the Party opposite.  I should like to remind the House of the manner in which this statement of mine in the Budget speech was dealt with by the Opposition.  It was quite clear to whom I referred.  Deputy Cosgrave referred to it in this way: &ldquo;&lsquo;Somebody in the Opposition,&rsquo; he said, but he did not mention who it was, &lsquo;made a certain statement.&rsquo;&rdquo;  Then he said that if somebody in the Opposition made that statement, that was not the reason why the underwriters had to take up a certain portion of the loan.  What I am anxious to get at is this: if the Opposition spokesmen in this House do not feel guilty in the matter why is it that they have not referred to that statement of their leader, but rather have endeavoured so far as they possibly could-by saying that Mr. de Valera said this thing one year and a Minister for Industry and Commerce said something else later-to get away from it altogether.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my appreciation of the courtesy with which he has given way so often.  I think it is fair to put this question to him.  Does he remember that I, for instance, put a question down some time before the National Loan was floated; that he asked me to come and see him; that he represented to me that that question might injure the prospects of the National Loan and that I accordingly withdrew it?  Is it not just as fair to quote that as representing the attitude of the Opposition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I rather take it that that represents the personal attitude of Deputy MacDermot: I agree that in those matters he has a greater sense of responsibility than many of the people associated with him.  What I am asking now on the point at issue is this: did the Opposition as a whole, and did the responsible leaders of the Opposition, endorse this statement of General O'Duffy:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am afraid that that £6,000,000 is going to be spent in bribes for votes.  In the middle of that bribery a general election will be called and county surveyors will be sent out to give work and arrangements made for free supplies of milk to get Mr. de Valera back.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The implication of that was this, that that £6,000,000 was to be spent as <Col N="1163" /> bribes for voters and to start works and give free supplies of milk in order to get Mr. de Valera back.  The question at issue is this: was that statement made by the selected leader of the Opposition Party, the person who is president of the United Ireland Party, with the full cognisance and with the full assent of the Deputies who sit in this House and who are vice-presidents and members of the Executive Committee of that Party?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">

      <P>Perhaps not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that it was not, because one thing that was remarkable here in the course of the debate, particularly in relation to that statement, was the fact that everyone was anxious to disclaim any responsibility for it, to minimise its consequences, and to say that if there was any reduction in the rate at which subscriptions were being made to the Fourth National Loan it was due to something other than that.  What is the position?  The National Loan was issued and the lists were opened on the 4th December and it was arranged that they should close on the 12th, eight days afterwards.  Notwithstanding anything that has been said here about the correspondence which took place between the President of the Executive Council and the British Secretary for the Dominions, the subscriptions to that loan came in at a very satisfactory rate indeed until the 10th day of December.  On the morning of the 10th day of December we had subscriptions for £2,200,000-that was inside of six days.  Up to the close of business on the 10th day, when General O'Duffy's statement was getting around in the country, we had £2,377,000, and we closed with £2,900,000.  We closed because we decided beforehand to close.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were not going to do what our predecessors had done in regard to the Third National Loan.  We were not going to drag it out for 15 days; the position in that regard being that on the 12th day the subscriptions to the Third National Loan amounted to £4,067,000.  We could have kept our lists open.  We could have kept on, <Col N="1164" /> but we made up our minds that we would only keep the lists open for eight days, because we had already arranged that the loan should be fully subscribed and taken up.  We wanted a substantial amount from the public if we could get it, but we were better satisfied to have the loan placed in good hands and firmly held.  When we became aware of the attitude which General O'Duffy was taking up, that that was the sort of campaign which was going to be launched through the country, and that the mind of every small investor would be made uneasy by statements like that, we decided that in the national interests it was better that we should close the lists.  We did not want to allow that uneasiness to be created, with possibly a very difficult financial reaction.  Therefore, we closed the loan on the eighth day.  I pointed out to you that our predecessors kept the list of the Third National Loan open for 15 days, and that 12 days after the lists were opened they had only received £4,067,000.  Then on the thirteenth day the subscriptions went up to £6,387,000 and they say now that the underwriters and the Government Departments did not take up a large portion of that loan.  I say they did.  It has been the practice, and there is no reason why it should not be the practice. It is the practice in Great Britain and everywhere else.  The ordinary public very seldom subscribe fully the amount of a loan.  The position from our point of view is that the terms which we offered to the public were, as I have already said, £1 4s. 9d. per cent. less favourable to the public and more favourable to the taxpayer than the terms of the Third National Loan, and we did not attach to the Fourth National Loan any of the adventitious aids, such as making it tenderable for death duties, or any of the other things which have characterised the First, Second and Third National Loans issued by our predecessors. It was a straight issue at the lowest rate of interest of any Government issue made in this State; issued at a rate more than 33? per cent. more favourable to the taxpayer <Col N="1165" /> than the most favourable issue by our predecessors.  It did equally well so far as the ordinary subscriber was concerned, and we have no reason to be ashamed of it.  Now that the shallowness and the silliness, if I might put it that way, of the statement that was made by General O'Duffy have been fully exposed, when even his own Party disown him, and when it is quite clear that he does not speak for any responsible man in this State, if we have to make a public issue again before we leave office, I have no doubt that whatever issue we do make will be considered by the people sufficiently sound and sufficiently atractive to secure a full and adequate subscription.</P>

      <P>I have dealt with this loan for the reason that people outside and here in the House have said that we are going to borrow £7,000,000 during the coming year.  I should like to make this prophecy: that we can, during this year, finance all the services which we forecasted in the Budget and that we will not have to go to the public for one penny piece. We are in a position to carry through the programme that we set before the people and, while our Estimates of revenue are made on a conservative basis, and I believe that the Budget for this year will have a conclusion as satisfactory as the Budget of last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, Schedule, Part II, at the end of the portion of the column relating to Article L to add the words &ldquo;The insertion after the words &lsquo;by way of ordinary legislation&rsquo; of the words &lsquo;but no such amendment passed by the Oireachtas in respect of Articles VI, VII, VIII, IX, XVIII, XIX, XXIV, XXVIII, XLIII, XLVI, XLIX, L, LXI, LXII, LXIII, LXIV, LXV, LXVI, LXVIII, LXIX, LXX shall become law until after a general election shall have been held and a Resolution approving of such amendment shall have been passed by Dáil Eireann on the recommendation of the Executive Council first elected after such general election.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of the amendment is to ensure that any amendments of the Constitution which are effected by the Dáil will not be equivalent, merely, to an ordinary Act of the Oireachtas, under Article L of the Constitution, before the expiration of a period of 16 years from the date of the coming into operation of the Constitution. During that time the Constitution can be amended by ordinary legislation; in other words, by an ordinary Act of the Dáil.  Any such Act of the Oireachtas, purporting to amend the Constitution, within that period can, therefore, itself be altered or repealed or amended by another ordinary Act of the Oireachtas.  Therefore, when the Seanad has been abolished, in accordance with the terms of this Bill, the position shall be, unless some safeguard such as is proposed in this amendment is inserted in the Bill, that the Constitution will have completely disappeared or, if it does not disappear, will be alterable by an ordinary Act of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1169" /> The Articles supposed to safeguard the rights of the citizen, as set out in the amendment, are fundamental Articles of the Constitution.  Article VI provides for the inviolability of the liberty of the subject, and the remedy by way of <i>habeas corpus</i> for unlawful detention; Article VII provides for the inviolability of the dwelling; Article VIII provides for the guarantee of the citizen's right of free expression of opinion, and so on, with the various Articles enumerated in the amendment. It is obvious that if these fundamental rights are to be continued in any way that will give any safeguard to the citizens there must be some check, after the passing of this Bill abolishing the Seanad, against depriving the citizens of this State of these fundamental rights by the passage of a mere Act of the Oireachtas which could be done in the course of a few hours in this Dáil.  That is the object aimed at in this amendment.  It is proposed in respect of these Articles which set forth, and guarantee to the citizens of the State, the various fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution&mdash; that Articles, subject to the provision of Article L, that they should not be in a position to be repealed, altered, or swept away by an ordinary Act of the Dáil.  The proposal is that during the residue of the period of 16 years mentioned in Article L the guarantees contained in these Articles for the rights of the citizens should be preserved by making it impossible, constitutionally, for the Dáil to pass an ordinary Act in any way prejudicing or affecting those rights.</P>
    <P>The proposal is that the Constitution, during the residue of that period, can still be amended by ordinary legislation which will amount now to an ordinary Act of the Dáil, but that that Act shall not operate as law until after a general election has been held during which the people will have an opportunity of expressing their opinion on the Constitutional amendments that have been proposed, and that after that general election, whatever Executive Council is elected as the result of it will have complete control <Col N="1170" /> over the situation.  If the Executive Council that originally proposed an amendment to the Constitution is returned, by the mere passing of a resolution of the then elected Dáil the Constitutional amendment will there and then become law.  On the other hand, if the Executive Council that proposed the amendment of these fundamental rights is not returned and the Executive Council that does take its place takes a different view from the previous Executive, it has complete control over the situation.</P>
    <P>This Dáil is no more sovereign than any of its predecessors or any of its successors.  The Dáil&mdash;the Oireachtas as it stands at the moment&mdash;is a sovereign Assembly.  Its sovereignty is to some extent cut down by the Constitution and by the provisions of the Constitution, but to the extent only to which the powers of the Oireachtas are cut down by the Constitution.  The Oireachtas is sovereign and the position would, therefore, be that this Dáil could, if Article L is allowed to remain in its present state, sweep away the entire Constitution of the State by an ordinary Act of the Dáil passed in a few hours.  It is obvious that some remedy must be found for that state of affairs.</P>
    <P>The President has down in his name an amendment dealing with the position of the judges.  He has expressed the view of himself and his Government that they accept the principle of the independence of the judiciary, and that the only matter between himself and the Opposition was one of the numerical amount of the majority which was necessary to remove a judge.  Now if that amendment is carried, as I presume it will be, and inserted in this Bill and the Bill becomes law, the Constitution, of course, is amended <i>ipso facto</i>, but the law which amends the Constitution to that extent is itself only an ordinary Act of the Oireachtas which can itself be repealed by another ordinary Act.  Therefore, as things would stand, except some such principle as we are proposing is inserted in the Bill, the independence of the judiciary would not be preserved even by the President's amendment, nor even by <Col N="1171" /> the amendment which we proposed on the last occasion when the matter was before the House.</P>
    <P>We want to see that the fundamental rights of the Constitution, guaranteed by the Constitution to the citizens of this State, will continue to have some effective guarantee.  Under the system of unicameral legislation which will obtain if this Bill becomes law, and if Article L is allowed to stand as it is at the moment, there will be no effective guarantee for the Constitutional rights which, for the moment, are set forth in the Constitution.  The right of freedom of expression of opinion can be limited in any way and on any day by an Act passed by the Dáil.  The Article which provides for the freedom of expression of opinion, Article IX, can be amended by ordinary legislation in accordance with the provisions of Article L.  To take that Article as an example, we propose that the constitutional right of the citizen freely to express his opinion and freely to form lawful political associations should not be made the sport of whatever political Party happens for the moment to form the Government of this country.  We propose that if any Government, having a majority for the moment in this House, wishes to interfere with the constitutional right of freedom of expression of opinion that they will not be enabled to do that by means of their chance majority, or the majority which they happen to have for the time being, but that, before any alteration is made in such a fundamental right as that, the people should have the opportunity of expressing their opinions as to whether their constitutional rights are or are not being interfered with.  We suggest that the proper way to do that, in present circumstances, is to provide that no such amendment to the Constitution in reference to that fundamental right, or in reference to any of the fundamental rights set forth at the moment in the Constitution, should be capable of being prejudiced, or in any way affected by an ordinary Act of the Dáil before the people have had any opportunity of expressing their opinions upon it.  In the last couple <Col N="1172" /> of weeks in this House we have heard a lot of talk about democracy.  The proposal that we are putting forward is essentially democratic.  It should not be in the power of the Executive Council to interfere with the guaranteed constitutional rights of the citizens.</P>
    <P>On the occasion of the Constitution (Amendment) Bill which the House considered a few weeks ago the Minister for Industry and Commerce challenged the Opposition to give reasons why the Bill which he and his Government were fostering in relation to the deprivation of the Universities of their representation should not be passed.  That, apparently, is the attitude of the present Government. I pointed out on that occasion that the Universities had a constitutional vested right at the moment, and that the onus lay on those who were taking away that constitutional right to give reasons why it should be taken away. The same argument could be put forward in relation to other constitutional rights unless some such provision as we are proposing is inserted in the Constitution.  The Ministry may bring in a Bill to provide for the limitation of the right of free assembly, the right of freedom of expression of opinion and the Minister for Industry and Commerce will use the same&mdash;I was going to say&mdash;arguments, but it is really lack of argument.  He will ask the Opposition why should not the right of freedom of expression of opinion be cut down.  The Government, he would say, is charged with the duty of preserving public peace, that they think the people should not have the right of expressing their opinions; that the Government have been elected by the people and that nobody should open their mouths against the Government or say anything by way of opposition or criticism. The Ministry would ask the Opposition for reasons as to why that right should not be cut down rather than take up the attitude that it is upon them to justify the proposal to take away a vested constitutional right.</P>
    <P>We have some reason to anticipate that these rights may be in some way <Col N="1173" /> whittled down by the present Government, having regard to their attitude and to the fact that recently they brought in a Bill to take away a right which was vested in certain people under the Constitution, a right which has existed in this country for nearly 12 years.  For these reasons which, I submit, are quite unanswerable, we put forward this amendment, not believing that it will be accepted, but looking forward with a certain amount of derisive anticipation to the ridiculous arguments that will be put up against it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was astounded to hear the mover of this amendment say that he presumed it was not going to be accepted by the Government, but I am still more astounded to see a certain movement on the part of the head of the President indicating that he does not propose to accept it.  I know that members of the Government and of their Party have habitually assumed that the sovereignty of the Government implies unlimited sovereignty.  It seems never to have entered their heads to wonder why it was that in Christian civilised countries generally there has been such complicated machinery of government.  There has been the equivalent of the Dáil, the House of Commons, the Chamber of Deputies or whatever it might be, with extraordinary powers, and yet there is another power able to veto their action and to prevent their doing certain things.  There has been a monarch or a President working in conjunction with these two bodies, and the whole three have had to work within the framework of a Constitution.  As far as I understand it, the reason that a Constitution exists is that, although it is necessary to have in a State a Government with the power of life and death in order to promote that rigid justice and that order which are requisite amongst people living in society, at the same time the human person is superior to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said that as individuals we are subject to the stars, but as persons we control the stars.  Any person <Col N="1174" /> in this country, judged by the end for which he is created, is of infinitely greater importance than the Irish nation, as a person.  One of the notes of the person is that the person is the centre of liberty.  We, created persons, must necessarily of right, by our very nature, possess liberty, but the Government's idea as far as I have been able to judge from the statements and actions of the Government, and particularly by the nod of the head of the President a few moments ago, is that there is some extraordinary right existing in a Government or in a majority, which right must not even be challenged, no matter how it operates. Here, these Articles that are in the Constitution are there because they are the right of the person over against the State and over against the Government, and any attempt of the Government, or of any institution, to claim power to obliterate these rights, is an act of diabolical tyranny and can imply nothing else but the act of a most completely tyrannical person.  The people of the country have rights, no matter what Government is in power, that no Government has any right to take away from them.</P>
    <P>The whole idea of the Constitution, one may say, in other countries was to have a sovereign State.  You have Governments elected with sovereign authority over the whole State but the Constitution is there controlling the Government's actions and the reason for that is that it is right, proper and necessary that the Government should have some restraint put upon it.  What restraint are we going to have here? Here we have the position where there is an Executive Council with a servile majority in the House.  Not only the present Government but any future one, can, on any one day they choose, obliterate any innate right that exists in the human person in this country. There should be, I maintain, power to put a legitimate limitation to the possible operation of the powers the Government claims.  Here we propose that the fundamental rights of the human person in this country cannot be taken away by the Government. What we are proposing, however, is in itself inadequate because if the <Col N="1175" /> Government propose to operate against those rights, and if it brings in a Bill here and goes to the people of the country, and the country for a while votes in favour of these rights being taken away, that is an act of tyranny, an act of injustice and an immoral act. Actually, therefore, the proposal we make here is inadequate but at the same time we can see that it is morally impossible, or that it is morally unlikely, that certain things proposed by a Government that are clearly against justice, would receive the assent of a majority when they went to the country or that they would only receive the assent of the majority if there was some particular reason why the rights should be limited.</P>
    <P>Here we have an extraordinary situation.  The Government that came into power first of all denied the Governor-General&mdash;I think, strictly speaking, he should have certain powers vested in him, though I admit we took them away&mdash;power to go to a tea party or to give a tea party if he wanted.  Then they proceed to abolish the Second Chamber.  They now want power to say that no matter what they may decide in their minds, whether it is against the best interests of the country or not, it must become law by their desire alone.  The President might say that he has no intention of ever taking any action to deprive the people of the rights that they are guaranteed by these Articles of the Constitution.  He might say that and he might be sincere about it. We know on the other hand that he might change his mind as he has often done before.  It is not so many months since he went round the country denouncing us and saying that we wanted to establish a dictatorship. A dictatorship, as I understand it, is a tyranny by one person, government by the will of that person and his supporters and not according to wellbeing of the general body of the people.  We get up and we say that there is nothing further from our intention than the institution of a dictatorship but let us assume that we may change our minds at some later stage.  Not only that; it might not <Col N="1176" /> be we only who would come along to set up a dictatorship.  If the President were honest in his apparent indignation and in the fear that he expressed that when we proposed a corporative system that implied a dictatorship, what is he doing at the moment?  He is not only smoothing the path for us but he is removing every possible tiny obstacle that might be in the way of any person who might possibly get some sort of snap majority.  He is removing every obstacle from the way of such a person setting up a permanent and absolute dictatorship.</P>
    <P>If he accepts this amendment it is true that he himself can form a reasonable judgment as to what he may want to do within the next four years.  He may give himself the particular latitude that he may want to do certain things.  At the same time, all we are proposing is that there should be this limitation on Government action although we could not possibly be the Government until the President's Party has ceased to be the Government. It is true that we cannot make a fair estimate of the protection that we would require but I would ask him if he does not intend to accept the amendment to say that he does not propose, in relation to the rights guaranteed in the Constitution, to take them away without having the matter submitted to the people.  With the best motives in the world, he may say it is perfectly ridiculous that any limitation should be put on the Government.  He may say that everybody knows him and that our people know perfectly well that he would never want greater power.  He may say that he is never going to sin against the light or to take away from the people rights which are necessary for them and to which they are entitled.  He may think so and he may be quite convinced of that&mdash;and it may be quite true&mdash;but he must recognise that here he is creating a position that if to-morrow anything happened, as it might&mdash;God between us and all harm&mdash;that quite a number of Fianna Fáil Deputies might die they would be in a minority.  What would happen then?  Another Party would come in, or there would be a <Col N="1177" /> general election, and the President would be handing over to the people whose policy and outlook he thinks is directly against the interests of the people, power to do anything they like &mdash;complete, absolute and uncontrolled power over the lives and actions of the people.  That is what he would be doing.  With that enormous confidence that he has in himself in any arrangement of the kind he must look a little beyond to-day.  I admit we created a situation in which the Constitution could be changed by ordinary legislation. We recognised that it was a dangerous situation.  On the other hand, we felt the need to pass over to some Government coming after us certain latitude, as experience might show that there were certain things which, if they remained in the Constitution, might be a hindrance to the progress of this country.  At that time it was required that a Government elected at one general election would have to be convinced that such a change was good and, at the same time, that the other House, the Seanad, elected at a different time and at a different moment in the country's history, would have to concur.  That was quite an inadequate limitation, but it was some little limitation.</P>
    <P>The President brought in certain Bills which he says he was convinced were necessary.  He wishes to put down the wearing of blue shirts.  We think that was motived in his mind by a certain dictatorial attitude of his.  I have no doubt he felt he was justified in taking that action because he thought the Blue Shirt movement represented a menace to the State and a menace to public peace.  When the Seanad used their powers to delay that Bill for 18 months, he took a short cut and said he was going to abolish the Seanad.  But his action in abolishing the Seanad was really a minor effect.  That was a negative act. As a positive act an Executive Council that, at any time, came into power would be absolute dictators.  They need not consult anyone about what they desired to do, as their own servile followers would be prepared to agree. With this power and their followers <Col N="1178" /> they could abolish the whole Constitution and could establish themselves in perpetuity in this country.  That is the position the President, by his own action, has created.  He resists any attempt to prevent him getting rid of the Seanad and he purports to prevent that situation arising with regard to the judges, if I may say without offending him, by making an offer on the old lines of the cow for sale.  I would like to hear him putting up any sort of case against this amendment. If he is going to do so, he must indicate with regard to the specific clauses why he requires to be able to abolish those rights which were assured to the people without first having submitted the proposed change to a general election. At the same time I wish to say that I do not consider the amendment adequate, because, if there was a proposal by which a Government could take away my fundamental rights, and if the country voted solidly for that, I would still deny the right of the people to take these rights from me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to have no reply?  I am afraid Deputy Costello is going to be disappointed, as he will not have the pleasure of hearing the ridiculous arguments that might be put forward against the amendment.  I can sympathise fully with the President and with the Attorney-General.  They are showing remarkable reticence and modesty in not trusting themselves to arguing against the amendment.  The amendment has been put forward and has been supported and ample opportunity was given to the President to define his attitude, if he has any attitude to justify him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here is a Bill, so important that it proposes to abolish one member of the Oireachtas, namely the Seanad, and on the amendment that tries to rescue some of the rights of the people that are threatened, the Executive Council is silent.  They do not wish to speak. Apparently they have no argument in favour of whatever attitude is to be revealed to us in the Division Lobby. One of the obvious things with this Bill going through&mdash;and I think the danger is illustrated by the contemptuous <Col N="1179" /> attitude of the Government to the House, including their own followers&mdash;is that this House is to be turned, when there is an opportunity, when they have an argument, into a mere machine for registering the decrees of the Government.  Of course, that is the obvious fate that is always in front of a single Chamber. That is the danger.  Even in this small matter of courtesy to the House, I suggest the President reveals his attitude, contempt for the body that he intends to make a mere registration machine.  After the eloquent pleas he has made against this amendment I have no doubt he has fully convinced his followers, and that they will follow him obediently into the Lobby perhaps in more good faith than if he had put forward arguments.</P>

      <P>I never suggested that the Deputy is responsible for the brains of the supporters of his Party in the Seanad.  I am referring to the attitude of his own Party in the Seanad.  As the mover of the amendment and Deputy Fitzgerald pointed out, the amendment tries to make one last effort, so to speak, to save the country from the very obvious dangers that are unfortunately familiar to everybody who knows anything about the unicameral system; to save it from <Col N="1180" /> these dangers, and to prevent what it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to avoid if the Bill in its present form became the law, namely, the setting up of permanent Party despotism in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When speaking previously on this question the President referred to bedrock. We have not got down to it. Is there any bedrock in constitutional matters where he is concerned, is it not dealt with in these Articles that this amendment, to a certain extent, tries to safeguard?  For the President, is there anything fundamental in the Constitution?  For him, is there anything fundamental so far as the rights of the people are concerned?  He cannot pretend, as he did on previous occasions, that national principles are involved and that, therefore, he must trample on certain Articles of the Constitution. He used make a distinction between certain Articles of the Constitution that flowed from what he called an imposed Treaty and other Articles that flowed, apparently, from the fundamental rights of the people. What this amendment proposes to do is to safeguard, so far as an amendment to this Bill can, rights that were regarded at one time by all Parties in this country as fundamental.  It is not an attempt to safeguard what he used call, at one time, the imperialistic Articles of the Constitution.  These are Articles which would have been put into any Constitution of this State even if the State were not bound by any Treaty.  He utilised, to the great disadvantage of the Irish people, the imperialist argument against certain Articles of the Treaty.  To a certain extent, he got away with that.  The House and the country will notice that he is equally warlike against the ordinary Articles of the Constitution&mdash; Articles that guard the rights of the Irish people.  The House will notice that his policy is fatal to these rights, as it was fatal to some of the Articles in the Constitution that flowed from the Treaty.  His policy is equally destructive of both, but he cannot raise the imperialist bogey&mdash;it was nothing else&mdash;so far as these Articles are concerned. Yet, he is quite as hostile to <Col N="1181" /> the working of these Articles as he was to the working of the Treaty.  They have one fundamental weakness from his point of view&mdash;they stand in the way of the exercise of his power.  To put it in a way which he may prefer, they prevent him from putting into effect all the ideas he believes are for the good of the country.  It is for the country to decide what is for its good and not for even a heaven-sent person like the President.</P>
    <P>Why are these Articles necessary? There were hints occasionally from members of the present Government when they were elsewhere, and there are hints even now, that a Constitution may some time be good for this country.  Why?  Because it is necessary that limitations should be put on the power of an Executive and on the power of a majority Party in a Parliament. That is one of the fundamental purposes of a Constitution.  That is why it is framed.  That is why most Constitutions with which I am familiar include what are called &ldquo;fundamental Articles.&rdquo;  These Articles cannot be abrogated by a Government or a majority which may be merely a passing majority.  The people feel that these Articles are necessary if any meaning is to be given either to constitutional liberty or to democracy.  That limitation is needed in the case of every Government, no matter how enlightened or inspired.  If it is the wish of the Irish people to do away with both constitutional government and democracy, and to set up a form of despotism, that is another matter.  But if you are to have democratic and constitutional government you must have safeguards of this kind.</P>
    <P>The President spoke of our being in a state of flux at present.  Does not everybody recognise that he is determined to keep this country in that particularly fluid condition?  Does not everybody recognise that he is determined to keep the country like a mass of molten lava?  Is not that the whole aim of his policy or, if it is not the aim, is it not the result of his policy? Is he not determined that the country will not settle down?  Is it not a fact that he and his Party find that they can fish best in troubled waters?  They <Col N="1182" /> realise that they can make most out of disturbed conditions, out of that state of flux which the President referred to in his speeches.  He made it clear that he envisaged a continuance of that state of affairs for quite an indefinite period.  If the Government opposes this amendment, it will be obvious that there is no such thing as bedrock for them, that this country is not to be allowed to go to rest.  That is the policy of the Government.  Naturally, every class of that type who have got into power have acted as revolutionaries in possession.  That is what they are.  What is the objection to safeguarding the Articles dealt with in this amendment?  We are waiting to hear the objection.</P>
    <P>We do not want the mere pious expression&mdash;I am using the word in its semi-slang meaning&mdash;on the part of the President that he likes these principles and that they appeal to his heart.  Fundamentally he is in agreement with them.  We want to know what he is going to do to preserve them and to see that his Government and every Government honour them and honour them not by saying how deeply they are attached to them but by acting up to them.  We can only assume, if he rejects this amendment, if he refuses to safeguard these principles, even to the limited extent to which this amendment tries to safeguard them, it is because he knows perfectly well that he is going to violate these principles and that though his heart melts when he goes to look at these principles, in reality he is going to trample them underfoot.</P>
    <P>As has been pointed out by Deputy Costello, and as has been shown in this House by other Deputies, the Government have given proof already of their intention in this respect.  They have done these things several times in the past in one of the most peaceful countries in the world, and they have done these things in times of peace.  What are they prepared to do &mdash;what do they think they are prepared to do and what are they thinking of doing in the times of heat and excitement that may crop up in any country?  Can the Dáil then stand between the people and the despotic <Col N="1183" /> exercise of power?  Does anybody think it will?  It is in a moment of that kind that safeguards are more necessary than at any other time.  But it is precisely at moments of that kind that it is quite clear the President is to violate these Articles of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Why is there not, after the previous protestations of the President, a ready acceptance of this amendment?  Were these protestations that he made when in opposition&mdash;this talk about the freedom of the Irish people&mdash;for the one purpose to see that that freedom would be dependent on the will of an individual or Party?  That is not freedom.  That is not democracy. There are tremendous dangers inherent in the unicameral system. Some of the worst terrors that have been set up anywhere have been set up because of the unicameral system. It was found that one House of legislation was capable of being turned into a registration machine.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I do not see the necessity of instructing the President in these matters.  I have already pointed out that historical examples are there for him.  I want to appeal to the ordinary sense of the people.  Everybody knows that that particular danger is there in a unicameral system.  The speches made by the President and the actions of the Government must convince anybody who does not prefer to be blinded in this matter how great the danger really is.  Any despotic Government that desires to usurp rights against the nation always finds excuses.  As I previously pointed out, the President has already been finding excuses for despotic action in the future.  &ldquo;Factious opposition!&rdquo;  Well, &ldquo;factious opposition&rdquo;&rsquo; is never out of the President's mouth.  In reality factious opposition means opposition to him.  It means criticism of him, criticism even here in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the Articles that this amendment tries to guarantee and to preserve <Col N="1184" /> deals with the right of Deputies elected by any section of the people to come and give expression to the views of their constituents here in the Dáil, but that Article can be swept away. Does anybody who has watched the Fianna Fáil Party in the last two years, and has seen them trample on every principle to which they professed allegiance when in opposition, think that those rights will be safeguarded? Does anybody think that the Fianna Fáil Party or the highly interested Labour Party are a safeguard for the people's rights or that they will save the people from despotic action on the part of the Government?  The danger is really there and it would be criminal on our part to overlook that danger.</P>
    <P>We are trying by amendments to this Bill to safeguard certain rights of the people.  I hope at last the President will be induced to break the Trappist vow of silence that he has put upon himself. We have heard the old protestations that the Government has a sense of responsibility; that the Government elected by the people must be supposed to have a sense of responsibility.  I admit that the Government should be supposed to have a sense of responsibility. But the reason why Articles of this kind were inserted in the Constitution is because no Government should be given despotic power and no Party should be given despotic power. The judges are there, as has often been pointed out, to decide even between the claims of just men.  Constitutional Articles of this kind are put into the Constitution to limit despotic action on the part of any Government no matter how excellent its intentions. Unless a despotic Government is wanted these Articles should be retained.  If you want democratic government these Articles must be preserved. Articles of that kind can be violated if there is not protection for the citizen under Article IX.  As the thing stands, all these rights of the citizens can be swept away, not because there is any ground for sweeping them away but because the exercise of these rights irritates the head of the Government, irritates the members of the Government and irritates the Parties who support the Government.</P>

      <P>I am not disappointed at the silence of the Government.  I am merely disgusted.  Every time the Government Party are doing a discreditable and disgraceful thing in this House they merely hang their heads and, relying on a machined majority, sing dumb.  The President may grin. It is not the first time that the President has grinned.  And it is not the first time his Government has done a discreditable thing in this House. What are you doing in the sacred name of democracy?  You are destroying everything that stands for democracy in this House.  You are depriving the people of the rights which they enjoyed before your time.  You were talking about the sanctity of democracy, and the only vocal sign we had from the Government Benches was an interruption by Deputy Donnelly: &ldquo;We followed the President before and will follow him anywhere.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Deputy says &ldquo;absolutely,&rdquo; and it is put up to us to make a case for the retention of the things which the Government desire to destroy.  The same argument could be advanced for the retention of the Mallow Bridge.  Is the onus always to be on us to make a case for retention and is the machined majority, by their silence, always to be destructive?  Well, at least, their act was clothed with the decency of silence.  Neither the President nor the Attorney-General, nor any statement from those benches except Deputy Donnelly's interruption, tried to make a case against this amendment which, in fact, is laying it down that the people have a right to speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is great confusion nowadays between a majority in this House and a majority in the country.  A majority in the country, as everyone over there knows, the President in particular, may be secured by the most brazen and dishonest promises.  We have the President grinning over there.  He secured a majority in this House by the most brazen and dishonest promises that were ever made to an electorate, and now he grins at the poor dupes <Col N="1186" /> who voted for him, and he knocks down, one after the other, every kind of protection that the people had from his tyranny.  The Seanad has got to go as a matter of policy and, we are told, as the result of a mandate.  Why did you abuse that mandate 12 months ago if you had it?  If you had a mandate to destroy the Seanad, to remove it, why did you come in here with a finicky Bill to limit the power of delay of the Seanad?  Was it not because at that time you believed you were even exceeding your mandate?  If that was not so, if that was not the intention of the Government as a result of the vote of the electorate, then it was dishonest, and it was abusing the trust of the electorate.  But 12 months after you come in with a Bill to destroy that institution.</P>

      <P>Might I ask the President what particular point in my speech he objects to?  The President does not reply.  Might I ask the Chair what is the particular point objected to?  The gist of this amendment is that when the Seanad goes, any legislation passed by this House will be referred back to the people at a general election.  The reason for this amendment is because the President, by his legislation, is out to destroy, to remove, one of the safeguards which the people had before his time.  The reason this particular Bill is introduced <Col N="1187" /> is because the Second House asserted its legislative function in the interests of the ordinary democrats of this country by interfering with the President in his attempt to annihilate one of the emblems of the political opposition in this country.</P>
      <P>The President, all during his time in public life in this country, has objected to opposition and has at the same time bleated about democracy.  He has only recognised the sanctity of the rights of a majority when he, by a slick trick, secured a majority.  He has not, however, a majority in the Oireachtas. The people who have powers not of vetoing, but powers of delay, exercised those powers of delay and they have got to go and, recognising that the majority here will secure that in the course of time they will go, an amendment is put down here to say that if they go, well, then lean back on the people, lean back on real democracy. The President indicates &ldquo;No&rdquo; by his silence and he is fortified in his attitude by the weight of the votes behind him.  He has neither the courage nor the manliness to stand up here as a real tyrant, a real enemy of democracy, and to say in so many words why he objects to an amendment to refer power back to the people.  Make no mistake about it, if this amendment is rejected&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not believe that is a point of order, but, nevertheless, Deputy Donnelly will get his answer in due course.  At the present moment I am dealing with the amendment before the House, and no red herring is going <Col N="1188" /> to attract me away from this particular matter.  There is no good in talking about democracy and standing against this amendment; there is no good in talking about the rights of the majority of the people and at the same time opposing this amendment.  We are waiting patiently to hear any case made against the amendment, except the argument of the majority, secured on promises which will never be fulfilled.  I am ashamed of the silence of the President.  If he has any case to make against this amendment, why does he not stand up and make it?  If there is no case to be made against it why does he not accept it?  The whole point in this amendment is that, before a Bill becomes law, a Bill interfering with the Constitution, the people should have a right to speak.  Are you afraid of the people?</P>

      <P>I am not surprised that you are.  Your actions during the last 15 months have opened the eyes and the minds of the people to the type of men they have put in charge of this State.  We got advice from the Minister for Industry and Commerce within the last 48 hours that the way a Parliament should be run is by getting the political Parties, each of them, into a room, each member of the Party agreeing as to what he is going to say when he comes into this Assembly.  We know that has been the practice of the Deputies opposite, and that is the greatest curse of this Parliament; that is what makes it a humbug, and that is what makes it necessary that there should be some court of appeal over and above the majority Party in this House.  According to the Minister the Party opposite is composed of men who meet in a room and each of them is told what he is going to say and then afterwards they come in here and say it, each one responding to the whip, to his master's voice.  What this country has got to know is whether it is going to be ruled by one man or by a Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Heretofore we had an Oireachtas consisting of two Houses.  One House is to be abolished now because it defended the rights of the political <Col N="1189" /> opposition in this country.  An attempt was previously made to abolish, to stampede, to trample on, that political opposition.  The ordinary reaction of the Irish people to tyranny stood up against that and beat it, and then what you could not do by the mob you try to do by legislation.  Legislation failed because of one of the Houses that constitute this particular Oireachtas. Accordingly, that Second House has got to go.  Then, when your illegalities were held up by the courts, and when the courts were protected by that Second House, the Second House has got to go first and the courts afterwards. As a substitute for that Second House, this amendment proposes the people.  You have all been talking about the people, and this amendment is calling the bluff.  Are you prepared to listen to the voice of the people?  Are you prepared to hear their commands?  Your answer to this amendment will be the answer to that particular question&mdash;whether you are prepared to abide by the voice of the people or whether you want to trample on the voice of the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not the slightest desire, I assure you, Sir, to take part in this debate at all, but naturally, after the kind of semi-invitation thrown across from Deputy Doctor O'Higgins&mdash; and, needless to say, after the very friendly tone in which that invitation was extended across the House&mdash;one has to respond to it.  Instead of speaking to the amendment, as far as I could judge from what the Deputy said, his speech was more concentrated all the time on a bitter personal attack on the President.  The adjectives the Deputy used ought to be cherished. They ought to be taken down by some industrious Deputy and put on a long list for future reference when any Deputy in this Dáil wants to attack another Deputy.  They are really choice words&mdash;every one of them characteristic of many of the speeches the same Deputy delivers in the country when he is taking a tour either in his own constituency or in any other constituency.  To a certain extent, I must admit, they are enjoyable&mdash;and I myself do enjoy them&mdash;because they are <Col N="1190" /> characteristic of the Deputy, and I should not care to listen to a speech of his unless there was a good supply of these adjectives in it because, otherwise, I would not recognise the speech as his.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asks us, of course, are we afraid of the people?  That is the usual kind of question we are used to from the Opposition.  Is it not time that they ceased to ask that question from the Opposition?  We went to the people twice within 12 months.  We went to the people with our programme.  There were a number of by-elections before that.  We went to Longford-Westmeath and the people gave us our answer there.  That was the time when the old Cumann na nGaedheal organisation took to the youth.  After Longford-Westmeath we went to the people of Kildare, and we got a reply there.  Following those by-elections, we had a general election, and the organisation responsible for the Opposition at that time ceased to exist. At the last general election we got a clear majority over all Parties.  On top of all that, the Deputy still asks the question, are we afraid of the people? He also hurls across at us the jibe of our doing certain things in the interest of democracy.  He, certainly, is a peculiar champion of democracy.  As a matter of fact, he is an extraordinary champion of democracy at the moment. I think that his vote was registered in this Assembly for the removal from the Constitution of the Referendum which was the greatest safeguard that democracy could have.</P>

      <P>Well, it was removed out of the Constitution when we, when in opposition, tried to make use of it, and we find now that this body that took away the safeguard for democracy are engaged at the present moment in trying to put back into the Constitution something that they themselves took out of it.  This is to be the safeguard for democracy that Deputy O'Higgins wants.  As I said to Deputy O'Sullivan, his argument about our Party machine is getting a little stale.  We have our Party meetings and we get our orders there and we <Col N="1191" /> act accordingly, according to him, and there are no similar Party meetings held by the United Ireland Party.  I can quite understand that, because no two of them could agree about anything, judging by their meetings.  We, however, agree and we have a loyalty and fidelity to our leader that certainly will mark every action of ours.  We are proud of that loyalty and fidelity and we intend to carry on in that spirit.  We showed our leader fidelity and loyalty when he was in the wilderness, and we will continue to show fidelity and loyalty still.  Deputy Doctor O'Higgins may refer to it as &ldquo;His master's voice&rdquo;, if he likes.  I would advise him that the sooner he can get into his Party the same loyalty for leadership the better it will be for his Party.  It would do him no harm and would do a lot more good than this perpetual jibing and sneering at what people ought to be proud of&mdash; the characteristic of fidelity and loyalty to a political leader.</P>

      <P>There is no need to make any speech on this amendment because everything that is to be said about this amendment was said already a dozen times, and all that the Opposition could say in favour of their amendment would only repeat, in anything but a very convincing manner, arguments which they had put forward a dozen times already.  I thought that, when Deputy O'Sullivan was speaking on this occasion, he might give us some of the cases of disaster he pretended <Col N="1192" /> to have on a previous occasion.  I asked him before to give us these examples of the disasters that followed a unicameral system.  He is a Professor of History and he spoke as one who knew all about these things and had them at the tips of his fingers. I asked him for these examples on this occasion, and again, although he pretended that he knew all about them and that, in fact, every schoolboy should know about them, he did not deign to tell us what they were.  We would have listened with great interest to the stories of the disasters that had followed the unicameral system.</P>
      <P>Now, we are not accepting this amendment.  The method that is proposed, that of a general election, as a means of testing this precise type of question, has been objected to by me on more than one occasion, both on this side of the House and on the other side.  I objected to this method of getting a decision because, at a general election there is a variety of questions before the electorate and when a decision is wanted on a specific matter like this, I think it ought to be sent alone to the people for consideration. Therefore, if there was to be a check, I think it should be by way of a referendum and not by way of a general election.  It is very interesting to hear the Deputies on the other side speaking as if the whole of the democratic foundations here were to be overturned because the Seanad was removed.  Everything was going to go wrong because this Seanad was going to disappear.  That has not been the opinion of the people and let the Deputies, when they go out to the country, tell the people what a supporter of their liberty the Seanad as a House has been and ask the people whether they are not frightened at this bulwark of their liberty being taken away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are in the Constitution two types of Articles.  The division was referred to by, I think, Deputy Professor O'Sullivan.  There are those which might be inserted in the Constitution of any democratic State and there are those which everybody knows were inserted in the Constitution here because of a threat of war <Col N="1193" /> and outside pressure.  Now, I think, there is one ground on which we can get agreement between both sides of the House and I propose to have carefully examined these fundamental Articles dealing with the democratic foundations of the State.  I do not mind if these are fixed so that they cannot be changed by ordinary legislation without some such provision as a Referendum to the people, but I do not want that done by way of an amendment introduced without proper examination and in which there is no attempt whatever to deal with all these Articles.</P>
    <P>I do not know that all these Articles are perfect and I do not think that our predecessors found them perfect.  If it is agreed that we should go through the Constitution and take out these Articles which have not any immediate relation to the Treaty and, having examined them, say, with the experience of administration which has now been got by both sides, whether we can in their regard perhaps modify Article L, again I say it should not be done in this particular manner.  I also hold that the method by which the will of the people should be tested in regard to Articles of the Constitution should be by way of Referendum and not by way of a general election.</P>
    <P>I am not then going to accept this amendment.  If all these Articles are carefully examined it will be found that some of them are not without being entangled with the Treaty and with the Constitution that has been framed with special reference to the Treaty.  I cannot, therefore, accept these, as they are here, as clearly separating Articles of the Constitution which may be regarded as having relation to the democratic foundations of the State and the liberties of the citizen.  I do not agree with the argument of Deputy Costello because, if his argument were quite sound, nothing we could do here would affect the situation.  All our work here would be idle, if we cannot do anything here by way of ordinary legislation which would put difficulties in the way of legislation later for revising this Constitution.  I believe, for example, that the provisions in the next two <Col N="1194" /> amendments in my name do secure that these particular Articles will not be altered except under conditions which have been definitely laid down. There is not, I think, anything further to say.  It has been suggested that because we do not accept these amendments we are going straightway to abolish all these Articles or to interfere with them vitally.  That is not the intention at all.  What is being done, I remind the House again, is that the Seanad, as a Second Chamber, is being removed, and it is being proposed that, instead of having two Houses in future in the Oireachtas, we shall have one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably the last couple of words in the statement to which we just listened epitomised the whole situation.  &ldquo;There is nothing further to say&rdquo;&mdash;having really said nothing.  Let us examine the situation from the historical standpoint.  Twelve years ago a Constituent Assembly considered a Constitution which was presented to them by a Provisional Government, that Provisional Government having had the opportunity of being advised in that connection by a responsible Committee of citizens, one of the Committee&mdash;a person who was not a citizen of this country, and not a citizen of any European country, assuming for the moment that Great Britain is in Europe&mdash;having been taken into council.  He was an American.  They considered the Constitution and they submitted a Report to the Provisional Government.  The Provisional Government considered the Constitution, and the late President Griffith and Mr. O'Higgins went to London in connection with it, and there certain representations were made in respect of particular Articles.  The Articles in question were disclosed to the Dáil, the Constituent Assembly which considered the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Constitution at that time was considered in a non-Party spirit.  It was the first time, one might almost say, for a century, if not longer, and certainly the first time in the history of this country, that a really representative institution in the nature of a Parliament sat down to consider a Constitution, and they considered it, as I <Col N="1195" /> have said, apart altogether from any Party considerations, subscribing, each person, his quota of what he considered would be the fundamental principles of a democratic Constitution, and embodying in it those Articles which were considered and put forward by the British as having in them their conception of the Treaty and their acceptance of the Treaty.  In it, so far as the ordinary citizens were concerned, there was the safeguard of a representative body, in the first instance, the safeguard of a Seanad, half of which was elected by the Dáil and half nominated, in the second instance, and then a Governor-General.</P>
    <P>There are, unfortunately, biassed views in connection with all three institutions, and people, when considering them, put on, if they so desired, prejudiced spectacles in order to give to their followers, or to the people whose votes they are endeavouring to get, as prejudiced an opinion as is possible, in connection with any one of these three constituent parts of the Oireachtas.  The President would be one of those who would tell us 12 years ago that that was not a fit body to consider a Constitution.  Whether it was or not, neither he nor any member of his Party could have improved upon the safeguards that were embodied in the Constitution for the democratic rights and liberties of the people. Neither he nor any supporter of his could make any improvement on those Articles.</P>
    <P>An amendment of the Constitution was possible through the assent of the other two constituent parts of the Oireachtas.  It so happened that without any help from this Ministry, or any member of this Ministry, or any member of that Party, a complete change took place with regard to the authority of the Governor-General.  If we could consider that question apart from Party bias we might, perhaps, better appreciate the value which could be reposed in a person occupying that position and doing his duty properly, in accordance with the Constitution and the law.  I will just mention one instance.  There is there in that Constitution an Article giving a life of six <Col N="1196" /> years to the Parliament.  The Seanad will be gone in 12 months' time.  There is nothing to prevent an alteration of the six to 12, or 18, or 24 or 30, or for life if you please, in connection with all the members here.  There is only one stoppage, which we in our wisdom or unwisdom have provided, and that is the Governor-General saying: &ldquo;No, I will not sign.&rdquo;  There was his use in that connection, if the office and the holder of the office could be viewed without any bias and without any prejudice.  He would be the person who would say &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  Similarly with regard to dissolution.  The President of the Executive Council might not possess a majority in the Dáil; he could refuse to come to Parliament, and go to the Governor-General for a dissolution.  There again the Governor-General would be entitled to exercise his discretion, granted now that the inferiority complex in connection with the office is not there.  We are now proposing to take out one of the three constituent parts, one having been already parked in safety in Monkstown, and to that extent non-effective.  The people of this country are in the position that their fundamental rights are at the will and pleasure of a Single Chamber, and of a majority of one in that Single Chamber.  It is not good business.  It is by no means good business, and it will not be considered, apart from politics, according to the speech to which we have just listened. Take one particular case.  The President said that if there is to be an amendment to the Constitution it should not be effected after a general election.  Let me put this question. An amendment to the Constitution is required, let us say, on some small point.  There is an Article there, No. XI.  It deals with lands and waters and other things of that sort.  A small unimportant amendment to it might be required in connection with mineral development or something else of that sort.  Are we to be put to the cost and trouble of a Referendum in order to get that?  The Attorney-General was going to make some observation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the President said that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I know he did not, but he said that amendments to the Constitution should not be effected after the fashion that is proposed in the amendment, but, if they are to be at all, they should be in the form of a Referendum.  If he likes to make his position more clear I am prepared to listen to him.  Then we are to take it that if there is to be an amendment to the Constitution after 16 years have elapsed, assuming the 16 is going to remain there, those amendments can, in the opinion of the President, only be properly made if submitted to the people in the form of a Referendum. We have had 24 amendments in 12 years.  Twenty-four referenda!  Of course they might be bulked, but remember this is a particular case in which a decision would probably have to be taken.  The particular Bill which we have before us is one that, at any rate, having regard to the speed of its introduction and the reason of its introduction, would certainly mean a Referendum. We were told in the course of the speech just delivered by the President that he has two amendments in, to safeguard the judiciary on the one hand and the Comptroller and Auditor-General on the other.  I should like to know if it is seriously put forward that that security which is there is recommended as a real security.  What is there to prevent this Dáil or the next Dáil from taking out that amendment?  This Dáil had the right to put it in.  Is the next Dáil to be denied a judgement upon that particular action?  If it is, then this particular Dáil is more sovereign than the one which will follow.  Let us get that point clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, quite right, or perhaps before 16 years, if we pay attention to some observations that were made yesterday in another place. That was the opinion of the people after the Constituent Assembly had concluded its work, that every eight <Col N="1198" /> years an opportunity was to be given to amend the Constitution.  If it is correct to have spread that out to 16 years, then it is the people who have got the authority; it is the people who have secured the rights, and the Dáil cannot interfere with them.  It was stated from the beginning, when the first Dáil came in under the Constitution and properly elected, that it had its opportunity, with the Seanad, of altering the Constitution within a limited space of time.  Everybody knew that.  The position that is now proposed to be taken up is that this particular Dáil is evidently a more sovereign one than its successors, because it lays down the law which will bind them with regard to this matter.</P>
      <P>I will put another question to the Attorney-General.  Will he say, as a lawyer, that it is not possible to take out that whole Article, or alternatively to take out the Article which refers to the independence of the judiciary, once this passes into law and we have a single Chamber?  What this amendment seeks to do is to ensure for those Articles of the Constitution which affect rights, liberties, freedom of expression of public opinion, and various other things of that sort, something which will put it beyond the power of a majority of one on any particular day to take away any one or all of those rights. Take the particular case of <i>habeas corpus.</i>  Is it to be left to a single majority of one to take that right and privilege away from the people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It so happens that Deputy O'Sullivan will not give us any opinion regarding historical precedents.  One thing ought to be taken note of, and that is that the greatest ruffian in history, I suppose, always had legal sanction for his actions, or pretended to have it.  I refer to Robespierre. The difference between that Ministry and the Opposition on this question is the difference in our conception of the authority of the Executive.  My view on the authority of the Executive is that it must not abuse power; and from what I have listened to and heard I believe that the conception of the Ministry is that, having the power, <Col N="1199" /> they can exercise it without either judgment or discretion, be it an abuse of power or otherwise.  My view is that the people give a limited authority to an Executive or to a Parliament. Their view is that having got what they call a mandate or a majority, which is the real thing, they can do as they please.  That is not my conception.</P>
    <P>This amendment does not hinder or hamper alterations in the Constitution. I am prepared to admit that it is not ideal.  The Government should remember when talking about a mandate that the proposal was to abolish the Seanad as at present constituted. It was not put before the people that they were going to abolish it altogether. There were two institutions, one closely associated politically and otherwise with the people; the other having, perhaps, an opportunity of looking at matters from a more detached point of view.  The speeches which we have listened to would seem to endeavour to feature the Seanad as a body which had views inimical to the best interests of the people.</P>
    <P>The names of two members of that institution have been bandied about by a Minister; one of them being one of the biggest industrialists in the City of Dublin and a good citizen. His political views and mine were, perhaps, as different as chalk from cheese.  He spent perhaps the best part of his life in trying to prevent the coming into existence of this State.  We should remember, however, that when the Minister in question would not be listened to anywhere as a responsible authority or as a person worth listening to in connection with any public matter, one of these two individuals did all that lay in his power to prevent the division of this country into two parts.  Having been practically all his life a Unionist, he became a Dominion Home Ruler the moment Partition was mentioned and has remained one.  I met him for the first time when this State was established, and I think it is very bad form on the part of the Minister to pillory a public man, a big industrialist, and a citizen of this country simply because <Col N="1200" /> he held certain views 30 or 40 years ago to which he stood up like a man.  Men such as he have lost the power and influence they had but they are citizens of this State and should they not get the rights to which citizens are entitled?  They are citizens of this State and should have the same rights and privileges as other persons.  It ill becomes the Minister of a Government which is going to wipe out this institution to single out two people for no other reason than that he believed they were politically opposed either to the land movement or the Home Rule movement for a long period.</P>
    <P>That is the thing which satisfies me that the Ministry is taking a biased view in connection with this whole problem of the Seanad.  If there was any semblance of honesty in connection with that policy the first thing they would have done would be to put themselves in the position of the Constituent Assembly of 12 years ago and say: &ldquo;We have experience of that; we can realise its imperfections and faults,&rdquo; and then take the Constitution and see what improvements can be made in it, instead of what mutilations can be perpetrated upon it so as to leave practically none of it at all.  Is it the idea that we have to have fundamental law or that we are to have such a state of affairs here as will enable Parliament day after day to change it?  There may be people who think that, although you have a Constitution, any Bill, without specifying an amendment of it, could alter the Constitution and could override the Constitution.  That was not our view.  These particular Articles of the Constitution which it is sought here to preserve will never interfere with an Executive in their administration for the securing of order, peace, good government or anything else.  The fact that the Ministry are standing against this and that they have only one apologist out of the whole lot of them to speak against it satisfies us that no case can be made against it.  They realise that they are not just men and are not doing the honest thing in not accepting the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General (Mr. Maguire)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather amazed at the speech of Deputy Cosgrave, having regard to what the President said.  Deputy Cosgrave must realise that he is quite wrong in saying that there is no agreement that there are certain fundamental Articles which ought to be put in a place apart and not be so easily altered as other Articles of the Constitution. I thought the President made it quite clear that he agreed with that, but that this was not the place and this was not the method by which they ought to be protected. Deputy Cosgrave very cleverly avoided dealing with the attitude which the President made quite clear in his speech.  The Deputy sought to introduce such a trivial thing as an amendment of Article XI and to suggest that the President's idea of an amendment only after a Referendum would apply to such an Article as that, whereas I understood that the President made it clear that he referred to certain fundamental Articles which he agreed might be protected in a special way.</P>
      <P>Of course, the whole discussion of this amendment is rather amusing.  It was a very clever bit of politics.  I do not know whether it is of real value to the Opposition.  I do not understand what particular value they hope to get out of championship of the Seanad.  It would not appear to have any great appeal in the country.  I do not think Deputy Cosgrave would care to go to the country on the question of whether the Seanad should or should not be abolished.  The discussion on this amendment summarises their whole attitude.  They sought to present the Seanad as being the guardian of certain fundamental rights of the citizens and have tried to make the case that we are removing the Seanad out of the way in order to tamper with the fundamental rights of the citizens.  Such a case is perfectly absurd.  I do not think it is really believed in by the Opposition.  I believe it is only being put forward for another object, which emanated from Deputy O'Higgins's speech more clearly than from some of the others, and that is to create an atmosphere of suggestion or suspicion that we are really out for despotism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1202" /> Deputy O'Sullivan talked about the fact that in every Constitution you have safeguards of this kind against precipitate action on the part of a popular Assembly; that you had checks and safeguards in order to protect these fundamental rights.  The Deputy was particularly cautious, as the President pointed out, not to give us the benefit of his knowledge of these Constitutions or to say where they have been found so valuable and so essential.  He was particularly careful to avoid reference to developments on the Continent, where at present it is not the unicameral system which is coming into favour but the one-man system, a system which, as far as we can see, is rather popular with certain of the leaders of the Opposition; a system by which legislation does not have to pass through even a public assembly.  Legislation by decree is now popular in some of what, I am sure, Deputy O'Sullivan would call the highly-civilised States.</P>

      <P>This ramp of putting the Seanad forward as being the guardian of the liberties of the subject is so absurd and ridiculous that I do not believe it appeals even to the most ordinary man in the street. Deputy Cosgrave opened with a disquisition on the history of the creation of these institutions here and said they were brought into being after a Constituent Assembly.  I agree with a good deal of what he said about that Assembly.  It went about its work with a great deal of care and, so far as time allowed, gave as close attention to the writing of this Constitution as could be expected.  It cannot, however, be lost sight of that rather a large section of the people were not represented there.  I know Deputy Cosgrave will say that that was their own fault, but the fact was that this Constituent Assembly, so called, did not represent the whole of the people of this country.  He then pointed out that they brought in these several legislative institutions as we have them to-day and that one of these was the Seanad.  He did not, however, <Col N="1203" /> travel over the ten years of the existence of the Seanad and show where it preserved those fundamental Articles which Deputy Costello has embodied in his amendment.  I think we have only to glance at Article II A of the Constitution &mdash; Constitution (Amendment No. 17) Act&mdash;to see the effect of that Article as embodied in the Constitution.  Section 2 of that Act says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Article III and every subsequent Article of this Constitution shall be read and construed subject to the provisions of this Article, and in the case of any inconsistency between this Article and the said Article III or any subsequent Article, this Article shall prevail.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is generally thought that the reason why this Constitution (Amendment No. 17) Act was written into the Constitution was because the law officers of the day advised that unless it was so written into the Constitution there were several sections of it that might be held to be in conflict with several of the very precious Articles that Deputy Costello is now trying to protect.  The Seanad, which was the guardian of these fundamental Articles hitherto, and against whose removal we must, hot-foot, make provision, as some of them expect to be swept away, accepted that special section without having troubled itself to ask what were the particular Articles they were interfering with there.  I cannot call to mind any instance in which the Seanad displayed its absolute regard for the fundamental rights of the people as embodied in the fundamental Articles of the Constitution.  I waited to have that pointed out; it would be relevant. What we heard was not relevant.  This particular amendment does not properly find its place in this Bill, which is a Bill to remove the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Costello says we want to remove the Seanad because it refused to pass the Blue Shirt Bill, and there was a hint that the method by which the Seanad was asked to act was unconstitutional, and that the Seanad rejected the Blue Shirt Bill because of its sense of duty to the people whose <Col N="1204" /> fundamental rights were embodied in the Constitution.  The Blue Shirt Bill was a piece of ordinary legislation.  If it interfered with any of the Articles of the Constitution, set out in this amendment, the courts would have stepped in, so that the Seanad's interference was quite unnecessary.  We did not write in the Blue Shirt Bill as part and parcel of the Constitution and I think a case has yet to be made in favour of this amendment.  Deputy Costello said he listened to the arguments from these benches with amusement.</P>

      <P>I have yet to hear any instance where the Seanad interfered, in the past, to protect any of the rights embodied in these fundamental Articles of the Constitution. As I said, it is a question of analysing these various Articles, and having them carefully considered and having them, with the experience at our disposal, and with the experience at their disposal, carefully phrased before being put into a place apart.  That method of dealing with the Articles is quite reasonable and worthy of consideration. But to say because the Seanad is going, we must, as an amendment of the Bill to abolish the Seanad, put these Articles in a special place, so that they cannot be altered except as a result of a general election, is, to my mind, a matter absolutely without the slightest argument to support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy O'Sullivan rambled into their usual phrase, that this is an attempt to establish a dictatorship.  I do not think that this kind of attack, from the benches opposite, during the last two years cuts any ice.  I do not suppose one man in a thousand, in the country, accepts the view that the action of the Government is heading towards dictatorship, while there are many thousands of people who firmly believe that dictatorship is very much in favour with the Opposition.  That their action with regard to the Seanad in relation to the Blue Shirt Bill was <Col N="1205" /> more than dictatorial is quite clear. When the Bill was introduced the leader of the Party opposite told the Seanad not to pass it and they did not do so.  If that is not dictatorship, I do not know what it is.  It is manifest, from this debate, that the Seanad was very obedient towards its masters, the Party opposite, when they were in office.  But the moment we get into office it proceeds to hamper, and to impede us, and to set up, in effect, an Opposition dictatorship in this country. That is one of the reasons why this Bill has been introduced.  And lest I should be misrepresented, and misunderstood again, I might say, I am quite prepared to admit there are certain fundamental Articles in this Constitution which I do not believe for a moment there is any fear any Parliament representing the Irish people would tamper with.  But lest there might be such fears it might be well to consider them, and whether they should not be treated in a special way and in a particular place.  But I object to this Bill being the medium by which this is to be effected.</P>

I said then that I should not have called upon the President to conclude.  It was a mistake on my part.  Standing Order 38 is conclusive with regard to a Deputy speaking twice.

      <P>I am raising a point of order, and I do not think it is in <Col N="1207" /> order for a Deputy, or even for a Minister, to interrupt when a point of order is being raised.  I have not put the point of order yet.  Deputy Costello moved an amendment standing in his name, and in the course of the discussion the Leas-Cheann Comhairle called upon the President to wind up the debate.  I then intervened and said that the motion had been moved by Deputy Costello and that it was he who should close the debate.  The President spoke, and as the debate was about to conclude Deputy Costello rose.  I drew the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's attention to Standing Order 38, which says: &ldquo;No Deputy shall be entitled to speak twice upon the same motion, except to close the debate upon a motion of which he was the proposer; but a Deputy is not precluded from speaking on an amendment by reason of having spoken upon the original motion or upon any other amendment.&rdquo;  The point of order that I want to put to the Chair is: will Deputy Costello be entitled to speak on Article L, when the question on amendment No. 1 is decided, if he is not entitled to speak now?  In other words, when the amendment is decided and if it is beaten, has Deputy Costello then got the right to speak on the substantive motion on Article L?</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>2.  In page 3, Schedule, Part II, to delete the portion of the second column relating to Article LXIII, and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The deletion of the words &ldquo;on resolutions passed by Dáil Eireann and Seanad Eireann,&rdquo; and the substitution therefor of the words &ldquo;by a resolution of Dáil Eireann for the passing of which not less than four-sevenths (exclusive of the Chairman or presiding member) of the full membership of Dáil Eireann shall have voted&rdquo;; the addition at the end of the Article of the following sentence &ldquo;Notwithstanding anything contained in any other Article of this Constitution, a Bill for legislation to amend this Article in relation to the passing of the said resolution shall not be introduced in Dáil Eireann unless or until the amendment proposed by such Bill has been approved by a resolution of Dáil <Col N="1211" /> Eireann for the passing of which not less than four-sevenths (exclusive of the Chairman or presiding member) of the full membership of Dáil Eireann shall have voted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>During the discussion on the Committee Stage fears were expressed by the Opposition that, with the removal of the Seanad, there was a danger that the independence of the Comptroller and Auditor-General might somehow be weakened.  I do not think that these fears are at all well grounded. I think that the representatives of the people realise their duties sufficiently and realise that it is in their interest also that there should be an independent officer to examine the accounts and to see that appropriations made by the House are spent in accordance with the wishes of the House. As, however, fears were expressed, I thought it might be possible to go a certain distance to meet them.  We have gone a distance sufficient I think to remove any genuine fears that might exist.  Under proportional representation a majority of four-sevenths is never likely to be achieved by a single Party and the fears to which expression were given that a single Party might, in some Party interest or for some Party reason, wish to get rid of the Comptroller and Auditor-General I think were ill-founded. I think that that cannot possibly occur.  It is very unlikely in any case that such a thing would occur. A majority of four-sevenths is an almost impossible majority for any Party under the system of proportional representation.  When I mentioned that before I was told that I was thinking of Parties but it was the Opposition who were thinking of the majority Party, as they call it.</P>
    <P>I have been thinking altogether in terms of the elected representatives of the people sitting here.  Before the Comptroller and Auditor-General could be removed a motion would have to be brought here, and a reason would have to be stated in public why he was being removed.  I do not think it is at all likely, if there are not grounds of incompetency or misconduct, patent <Col N="1212" /> to all, any Party would ask its members to aid in removing the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  The first part of the amendment will secure that a motion of this sort, to remove the Comptroller and Auditor-General, cannot take effect unless it is supported by four-sevenths of the full membership of the House.  With the present numbers in the House it would mean that 88 members would have to vote for such a motion.  The second part of the amendment seeks to meet a view that was put forward by Deputy McGilligan.  He said that anything we might do, such as in the earlier part of the amendment, was of very little use, inasmuch as a motion could be brought in here to change that Article, and to change it by a simple majority. Therefore, if you could get rid of the necessity of having four-sevenths, by a simple majority, there was very little use in putting in that safeguard.  This clause makes it impossible to change that Article by a simple four-sevenths majority.  Consequently, this Article is intended to go as far as we think it at all reasonable, to meet the views put forward on the Committee Stage.  The second part is a reference to the Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>

      <P>This does not prevent his abolition by a majority vote hereafter.  Let me put this analogy for the purpose of getting a distinction. Supposing the Government of the moment introduces a tariff and puts it into a Bill, at the end of which it says: &ldquo;This tariff shall not be removed except with a four-sevenths majority.&rdquo; Would that bind a new House?  Would it bind the present Government? Obviously not.  A simple majority can repeal a clause which necessitates a four-sevenths majority to do anything. <Col N="1213" /> What is the difference?  What greater force, or sanctity, is there in the four-sevenths majority in the case of the Comptroller and Auditor-General than in, say, applying any process of ordinary legislation to a tariff?  Do not tell me there is, because it is in the Constitution. We have seen the Constitution amended, not in accordance with the Constitution.  Supposing Constitution (Amendment No. 24) Bill is passed containing that clause, and the Government, a year hence, says: &ldquo;We cannot remove the Comptroller and Auditor-General,&rdquo; and it has only a single-member majority in the House, the Government that wants to remove him may say to the draftsman some day: &ldquo;Draft whatever legislation is necessary to get rid of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.&rdquo;  The draftsman may come back to the Government that wants that legislation, and say: &ldquo;You cannot do that because, say, Constitution (Amendment No. 50) Bill, of 1934, stops you.&rdquo;  The Government will immediately give an order to repeal that Bill.  What is to prevent them doing so?  Will the clause in Constitution (Amendment No. 50) Bill prevent a repeal Act being passed by a simple majority?  If so, is the Dáil being put in the position of extra sovereignty over another Dáil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Dáil does not pretend to be a Constituent Assembly.  A Constituent Assembly has powers that an ordinary Parliament will not have.  What is the force in this Dáil which a new Dáil will not be able, by a simple majority, to repeal?  If what I say is true, we are back, without any discussion of fractions, to what I have always stated in relation to the Comptroller and Auditor-General; that once the Constitution is interfered with, a simple majority of the House can get him removed from office.  No argument that 80, 85 or 90 must vote for his removal or vote for legislation to bring about the change, can have any effect.  A simple majority in a new House after this Bill is through can repeal, notwithstanding the supposed restrictive clause in the Bill, unless in some way this House can get itself into the position of being a Constituent Assembly.  The next one can do <Col N="1214" /> that too.  If this House could be a Constituent Assembly it could operate in relation to tariff legislation as with the Comptroller and Auditor-General. No one can tell me, and hope to have it held, that a Government can pass an Act in relation to the Dáil and put into it some clause that cannot be repealed except it secures a nine-tenths majority.  When that Bill becomes a statute it is open to the ordinary method of removal.  A majority can repeal, and once repeal is effected, whatever clauses are in it cease to have effect.  There was one Constituent Assembly and it passed a Constitution. It may afterwards have to be decided in the courts whether the amendments that have taken place have been in accord with what that Constituent Assembly did.  If not, they are bound to be declared null and void.  But this House does not pretend to be a Constituent Assembly in regard to things that the Dáil that preceded it did.  It cannot bind by any pretence some majority to give effect to proposals before legislation is introduced to implement these proposals. It cannot have any effect by way of restrictions.  Any talk about fractions is unreal.  If not unreal, it is definitely put up for the purposes of deceit.  A Government which controls a majority of the House can hereafter take the necessary steps, first, by repealing whatever Bill is there and having repealed it, getting the situation back to what it is now.  It can proceed by a majority and say that the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor-General are to be varied or that he shall be removed, no question of fractions arising.</P>

      <P>I felt like pulling my colleague down when he was disclosing the weakness of the Government's case in this matter, because that was for the courts.  I had intended, and would have preferred, to keep that up my sleeve for the proper occasion, if and when required.  I do not propose to enter into a legal controversy as to whether or not the President's proposal in this amendment is going to do what he thinks.  Personally I believe it does not.  However, that is another day's work.  Deputy McGilligan said <Col N="1215" /> that the discussion about fractions is unreal.  It may be unreal; it is certainly very amusing.  I referred during the Committee Stage, when dealing with this question or with the judges, to the fraction of a Deputy. At the time I had not done the necessary sum in arithmetic.  I did it a few moments ago and I find I was precisely right, because we are fighting about the one and six-seventh part of a Deputy.  The President's proposition on the last occasion in this connection worked out at 85 members. His present proposal works out at 86 and the six-seventh part of a member, so that, in order to remove a judge, 86 votes and the six-seventh part of a vote must be obtained in this House. When the President says that, if his proposal is carried, it will be practically impossible to remove the Comptroller and Auditor-General, I agree, not for the reason he gives but for the reason that it will be impossible to get the six-seventh part of a Deputy's <Col N="1216" /> vote.  I do not know how it is going to be done, but that is the President's proposal.  I do not know if our old friend omega will come in and work out the fraction.  Perhaps the theorem one plus omega plus omega squared will apply and the result be equal to the value of this proposal by the President.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Costello that it would have been much better for Deputy McGilligan to have left over his subtle argument until the occasion arose.  I do not agree that the court will hold with his interpretation.  It is the intention of the President to secure that the figure in that Article shall not be altered save in the manner provided and on a resolution passed by that majority.  The court would in my opinion hold that any legislation which attempted to do it otherwise would be ineffective.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, Schedule, Part II, to delete the portion of the second column relating to Article LXVIII, and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The deletion of the words &ldquo;by resolutions passed by both Dáil Eireann and Seanad Eireann,&rdquo; and the substitution therefor of the words &ldquo;by a resolution of Dáil Eireann for the passing of which not less than four-sevenths (exclusive of the Chairman or presiding member) of the full membership of Dáil Eireann shall have voted&rdquo;; the addition at the end of the Article of the following sentence &ldquo;Notwithstanding anything contained in any other Article of this Constitution a Bill for legislation to amend this Article in relation to the passing of the said resolution shall not be introduced in Dáil Eireann unless or until the amendment proposed by such Bill has been approved by a resolution of Dáil Eireann for the passing of which not less than four-sevenths (exclusive of the Chairman or presiding member) of the full membership of Dáil Eireann shall have voted.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The remarks I will have to make on this amendment are precisely those I made on the previous one.  Deputy McGilligan's point is rather interesting, and I want to see if I can follow it and ascertain what it exactly means.  As far as I can gather from his remarks, his view is something like this: that there was a certain Constituent Assembly which had a special character. It did certain things by laying down a Constitution, and it provided in it how that Constitution might be altered.  It did provide that the alteration of the Constitution within a certain period of time might be made by way of ordinary legislation.  That implied that within that period each particular Parliament was, in fact, a sovereign Assembly in that regard. and it might be regarded, inasmuch as it could change any particular Article of the Constitution, as a continuing Constituent Assembly.  If that be so, I take it his argument is that we can do any act here within the period prescribed, continuing to any succeeding Dáil the right which we claim for ourselves and that what we would bind they could claim that they could loose, and that, therefore, it is in vain for us to attempt to do anything having any permanent character with regard to the Constitution.  I am not certain that I fully apprehend his argument, but that is what I understand from it.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I take it that the conclusion he wishes us to draw is that any effort of ours to bind within the period is vain.  I take it that he will go further and say on that account that the only check that could possibly be would be a check in the way of legislation, the check of the Second House and that in removing that check we have, in fact, removed from the Constitution any power of any fundamental stability which it might secure.  There are some points in the arguments which I do not think are sound&mdash;but supposing we assume it is correct I differ fundamentally from the members on the opposite side with regard to the real checking power of the Seanad.  The Seanad has proved several times that it could not be relied upon to be a check in the case where the majority here was of the same political view as the majority in the Seanad.  It is not a check.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next thing that occurs to me is <Col N="1219" /> if the Deputy's argument is fundamentally sound, then his own amendment and the other amendments are open to the same defect.  Finally, we have to ask ourselves is it or is it not right that there should be power and a continuing power to change the Constitution? For a moment to dream of having a cast-iron Constitution which could not be changed would be heading straight for revolution.  What you want is to have reasonable security that changes will not be made without proper consideration; that these changes cannot be arbitrarily made and that the proposals will have a fair discussion. Fundamentally, I think that is provided for in a Chamber like this which is constituted of representatives of the people and particularly so when these representatives are chosen by proportional representation.  In fact I believe it would be a danger to try to check the representatives of the people from being able, when there was a need for it, to carry out what they were satisfied was the will of the people.  A Referendum, as I have already indicated, is to my mind a much better way of getting the people's opinion in regard to a special matter than a general election. But if we are in the position that Deputy McGilligan would suggest, then it is quite clear that there is no use in putting into this Constitution any proposal for a Referendum or for a general election, because within the period it will be held that each successive Dáil is sovereign.</P>
    <P>From a legal point of view, in so far as I can presume to understand the matter, I do not know where a Constituent Assembly derives its authority from except directly from the people. If, for instance, we wanted in a short period to get this Constitution revised and a new Constitution secured, the natural way of doing it would be to get an Assembly for that purpose elected directly by the people.  It is clear that the Parliament of the time would arrange for the type of Assembly and how it was to be elected and I cannot see how, if it so chose, you could prevent any Parliament from constituting itself, if need be, into a Constituent Assembly.  If we follow the <Col N="1220" /> line that Deputy McGilligan has indicated, we would have stability nowhere.  We would simply get to the position that each Parliament is sovereign, which is the position, of course, where there are no written Constitutions. Now, in this Constitution we have the courts established for the purpose of deciding whether legislation is in accordance with it or not; but the courts themselves are set up, I take it, in accordance with the fundamental law which was decided on by the Constituent Assembly itself.</P>
    <P>So far as this amendment is concerned, whether it gives greater security or not depends upon whether we are going to assume that the representatives of the people in a National Assembly, an Assembly like this, are going to act in a reasonable manner or not.  I think there is no use in attempting to legislate for an Assembly if we are going to start off with the idea that it is going to be capricious, that its members will have no sense of responsibility and that they are simply going to run amok.  I move the amendment, at any rate, as giving the same security that any other Article of the Constitution would give.  It will be the Constitutional position when it is passed that to remove the judges in this case will require a majority of four-sevenths of the House and that Article itself could not be changed without a similar majority in the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting to note that the arguments which were addressed to the last amendment, and which were criticised by the Attorney-General as being proper for a court but not for this House, have now brought forth this reasoning by the President.  The Attorney-General held the view that this House, although it is a deliberative Assembly of the people and is supposed to see that laws do not go out for examination by the judges in a rubbishy or foolish form, is not the proper place in which to discuss amendments.  We are, according to him, to let the courts decide hereafter.  I am glad to see that that point of view has not been approved of.  The President, as usual, in his attempt to reduce contentions <Col N="1221" /> to the point of absurdity, gets himself into a tangle.  Are we going to legislate, he asks, on the assumption that the representatives of the people will act capriciously?  If we are not, why not keep the simple majority in the House to do everything?  I would not have voted against the last amendment if I thought it was any safeguard, if it even meant anything, or if it was going to be taken as an agreement by the Government that, as long as they lasted in this Dáil, they would not move except with the consent of the four-sevenths.  But it does not bind them.</P>
      <P>Are you going to assume that the people will act capriciously?  I suppose that is intended to draw assent from me to this proposition, that we must assume the people's representatives will act properly.  On that assumption we should not have any of these checks at all.  The President says that if you tie the people up in a cast-iron Constitution it is a headline for revolution.  Let us suppose that a group hereafter gets four people short of the four-sevenths of the House and cannot get aid from any other Party.  They have three elections and they always come back four short of the four-sevenths majority. They find themselves tied up in this cast-iron business with regard to judges.  Is that a headline for revolution? If you have to get even one more than the majority, then the majority may rage and fret.  You increase agitation towards revolution by imposing on them the necessity to draw more and more support than the simple majority.  If we are to take these theoretical arguments in the abstract and if we are to say that the people will always act honestly and that there is going to be no caprice about them, then on that basis there is no reason to insult the people's representatives by saying that they require one more than the majority of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the cast-iron Constitution leading to revolution, there are quite a number of Houses that have cast-iron Constitutions and they have passed pieces of legislation and the aftermath showed that that legislation <Col N="1222" /> had speedily become unpopular.  But it took years and years to get it repealed by way of Constitutional amendment.  America provides a glaring example of that.  Can anybody say it was a headline for revolution? It brought about such a disregard for the law that even people who thought there was some social value attached to a certain social law saw in the end that the balance was in favour of letting it go and they favoured a repeal.  In any civilised State with a traditional Government it is an insult to say that a cast-iron Constitution leads to revolution. Apparently the four-sevenths majority is not cast-iron.  The whole thing is simply absurd.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any choice in this matter as between saying that the simple majority has sway and that sway ought to extend to everything in the State or else saying that you do recognise some value in checks and balances and you think this can be put in without wanting to cast any insult at the people's representatives or saying that they are going to act capriciously.  Then we come to debate what is the proper check. I admit, as far as I am concerned, that once the framework of the original Constitution, with every Article of it considered&mdash;not amendments to it, but every Article of it&mdash;once that is broken there is no possible check.  In the former situation the check, whatever it was worth, was the Second House.  Once that goes I think that there is no possible check and you are at the mercy of the majority in the Dáil for everything.</P>
    <P>The President thinks that the Seanad was no check.  His argument was that while the Seanad had the same political view as the majority in the Dáil, then it did not act as a check.  That is a specious argument.  It is a false argument.  The check is this: if you have another House, not elected in the same way as this House is, and which has, as far as its membership goes, a different period for which they are elected, and whose members have not to submit themselves for election around about the same time, and who <Col N="1223" /> will be discussing matters in a different atmosphere and, therefore, will not be swayed by the same political considerations, and that constituents will not have the same grievances against them as they would have against the members of this House, then they will have to bring to the consideration of a Constitutional amendment different considerations from what you will get brought to the examination of the same point here.  In fact, the Seanad was a good check.  Merely to say that, in the main, they agreed with legislation passed by the preceding Government does not nullify the argument I have used&mdash;that it was capable of being a good check, and, in fact, was a check.</P>
    <P>If we really have any appreciation of democratic government, or that government is supposed to be ruled in these times by an appeal to people's reason, and that legislation is going to be passed after deliberation, examination, the clash of argument, and the impact of mind on mind, surely there is some good in getting a second body freed from the particular affiliations and ties of constituents&mdash;in having a second body before whom a Government must go with its proposals, even though the members of that body when starting off, let us say, were deliberately chosen from amongst the people who at one time had the same views as a Government that existed at one particular period.  Merely to go from one House to another, to get a new group of men after a period of delay and in a different atmosphere&mdash; particularly in a fundamental and vital matter such as the liberty of the subject, the right of freedom of speech, the removal of the judges or the removal of the Comptroller and Auditor-General&mdash;if, as I say, you got a body appointed in a different way in the main, as they are, and chosen for different reasons from those for which this House is chosen, you certainly have at least some new point of view brought to bear on the examination of a problem.  There will be a different atmosphere there.  Different arguments will be used and different considerations will apply.  Even though it <Col N="1224" /> may not be a complete check, it is better than having a majority here ruling for everything.</P>
    <P>We are told, in opposition to that, or at least as partly aiming at the argument that this House ought to have power&mdash;the President said it&mdash; that once you have proportional representation and a House and Government elected by it, then you get a better representation, a better spread of the democratic idea, and a better exposition of democracy through the members, and there is no necessity to trouble.  With proportional representation&mdash;different systems of proportional representation&mdash;that might be a good and potent argument, but there is a Bill going through at the moment which seeks, in the main, to nullify proportional representation.  Its effect, in the main, will be contrary to the best schemes of proportional representation, the schemes judged to be the best of those that give a better representation to certain groups, of numbers and of standing in a constituency, but which groups are not able to get a majority over the constituency as a whole.  We are weakening that idea, and any House elected under the new Constituency Bill will, definitely, less well represent the proportional representation idea than, say, this House.</P>
    <P>I want to admit now, with regard to any amendment that is being put now, amongst others the one to which I put my own name&mdash;the first one here&mdash;that it could have been wiped out the day after it was passed by a simple majority of the House, and that it certainly did not bind a new House.  I want an answer to the point I raised along these lines.  Will it be contended that an ordinary piece of legislation&mdash; I am not referring to a matter of vital importance such as an amendment of the Constitution, but an ordinary piece of legislation like, say, the imposition of a tariff&mdash;will it be contended that that piece of legislation, if it contained a clause like the proviso here, would not be subject to repeal except by a four-sevenths majority?  Is it contended that it would be possible to pass an ordinary tariff measure and to bind succeeding Dála in such a way that they could not repeal that <Col N="1225" /> measures unless they obtained a four-sevenths majority?  I am referring here only to an ordinary piece of legislation. If that cannot be contended in relation to ordinary legislation, can it be contended in relation to a Constitutional amendment passed by a body which does not pretend to be any better than the Dáil which preceded it or than the Dáil which will succeed it and which does not arrogate to itself the title of Constituent Assembly?  Is there any difference between a piece of legislation brought in to amend the Constitution by an ordinary Bill and a piece of legislation, say, to fix a tariff?  Is there any answer to the contention that, if any of those purported to prevent their own repeal by the requirement of the four-sevenths majority, what they purported to do is impossible to carry out?  In fact, this pretence can be shown up to be a pretence by a simple majority of the succeeding Dáil, or of the same Dáil, a week later.</P>
    <P>As to the Constitution, the President says that he does not know, from a legal point of view, whence a Constituent Assembly derives its authority.  Surely, when a President of an Assembly moves to amend a Constitution, you would think that it would come into his head, as one of the first considerations, to ask how did that come in first.  Would he not ask, what body passed it; did it attempt to bind its successors; what force had it to bind them, and where did it get that force?  What distinguishes a Constituent Assembly from any other Parliament purporting to be sovereign? The President says, frankly, that he does not know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not confess to a political agnosticism, as the President does.  I do hold that there was a Constituent Assembly, and that it, <Col N="1226" /> having passed a particular Constitution, and submitted it to the people, gave that Constitution a certain sanctity.  A judge in the courts recently has used phrases to that effect.  This Constitution was compared, I think, by two judges recently to a Social Contract of the Rousseau type.  They regarded it as a definite contract struck between the people at the time, no Article of it being changed except in accordance with its own provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>And I am sure if it was found to be held by a majority of the judges, the judges would not stand very long, and that is what we are against.  Once you get going on this high-road, that the representatives of the people are always right, and, no matter what mandate they get, as the President said, from the people, he is entitled, during the course of a Dáil, to discover and decide on what the people are thinking of at that time, you must crush everything out of your way and sweep everything aside.  But it was to prevent that sort of thing that constituent assemblies came into being and that constitutions, with some more force than ordinary legislation, were recognised as normal things throughout the world.  However, I think there was a constituent assembly, called definitely for a particular purpose and, that having achieved its purpose, the Constitution, as such, was before the people at an election, and a Government came back and carried on that Constitution.  That Constitution lasted and every clause in it &mdash; not an amended clause in it, but every clause; the bargain, as it was then&mdash;and if it is to be regarded as a bargain at all, the bargain idea must pervade every clause of it.  The President is going to be definitely up against that either now in this amendment, or hereafter on actions in the court, and it is about time that the people who are chopping and changing Constitutions should begin to think of what is the meaning of constituent assemblies, how they arise and what force their decrees have, over and above the tariff legislation which this House may pass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1227" /> Swerving again to this idea of majority government, the President says he does not see how any Parliament could be prevented from calling itself a Constituent Assembly. That, again, is a point of view which is the expression of the man who is whole-heartedly in favour of the majority of the people, at a particular time, ruling and ruling completely and comprehensively.  Of course, that is what is here.  The President is pretending, by his amendment, that that is not the situation.  I am only arguing that that argument is worth nothing, and if the President found&mdash; I hold that his remark is rather appropriate to my argument&mdash;that the judges felt that the old Constitution had more force and effect than what he wants it to be given, I am not sure that those judges would be allowed to have much force and effect for long afterwards.  The President has a way of removing them under that, and it is only folly to pretend that he would require, or feels that he requires, or would feel that he would require, a four-sevenths majority before he would move against them.  The President will come down then, completely inebriated with the idea of majority rule, and we will have a lecture that, if majority rule was not allowed to have sway, we should be heading for revolution, and if the judges were blocking the opinion of the people, and if some sort of strait-waistcoat were put on the people that they could not get out of, the judges had better be sacrificed rather than that the people should be sacrificed.</P>
    <P>I think that, on the whole, you come back definitely to this point, that he recognises that there is no difference between this piece of legislation and an ordinary piece of tariff legislation. Pretending to have a four-sevenths requirement has only to be mentioned to be dismissed as ludicrous.  The only other way in which that can be justified is by pretending that this is a constituent assembly.  I do not think that pretence can be upheld, and that being so, no mere similar amendment with reference to the Comptroller and Auditor-General is worth anything. <Col N="1228" /> Some speaker said that it was an expression of a point of view.  So it is, for the time being, but the President's points of view are very fleeting.  They change according to the circumstances, and they particularly change according to his view of what being a representative of the majority of the people at a particular time entitles him to do, and so far as I have been able to find out, that has not meant any check.  It does not mean that he recognises any check, and it is absurd, in face of all the President's past performances, to pretend to the people that this is intended to be a check.  It is only intended as a pretence.</P>

      <P>On that question, I wish to make just one or two observations, mainly in reply to some of the points raised by the President and the Attorney-General in the course of the discussion on the amendment which stood in Deputy Cosgrave's and my name.  I think this Bill ought not to pass for a very large variety of reasons. I propose to deal with only one reason at this stage and that reason is that, in the Bill as it stands, at the moment, there are no safeguards for any of the fundamental rights which are supposed to be guaranteed to the people by the various Articles of the Constitution which are set forth in amendment No. 1 on the Order Paper to-day.  The President said, in the course of the discussion on amendment No. 1, that he agreed that there were certain fundamental matters in the Constitution which ought to be recognised as such and the Attorney-General reproached Deputy Cosgrave for the speech he had made inasmuch as he had overlooked that startling and striking declaration of the President, that he recognised that there were certain fundamental matters in the Constitution.  That was the first time this House heard from the lips of the President, or any member of the present Executive Council, that they recognised that there were certain fundamental matters in the Constitution which ought not to be susceptible <Col N="1229" /> to, or capable of, change by way of ordinary, casual legislation passed in a few hours in this House.  Apparently they have now declared themselves as recognising those fundamental matters but there was no amendment down in the name of any member of the Government Party or any member of the Government to provide any safeguards in reference to these fundamental matters, the right of liberty of the person, freedom of speech and all the other matters that are supposed&mdash; it is no wonder that Deputy Corry shakes his head in derision&mdash;to be guaranteed to the citizens of the State by the Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We put down amendments dealing with the judiciary, the Comptroller and Auditor-General and these fundamental rights.  Until we put them down, there was not a single suggestion from the Government that they intended to cover these matters and there is not a single suggestion even now that they intend to cover these fundamental matters in this Bill. They propose that the Bill should pass as it stands at the moment, without any safeguard for these fundamental rights of the citizens.  I do not intend, as I said before, to enter into a legal controversy on the question of whether or not this Bill itself is constitutional or unconstitutional.  I have a very clear and very decided view on that subject but I am not going to air it in this House.  The President, by putting down, after our amendment had appeared on the Order Paper, the amendment dealing with the Comptroller and Auditor-General and the judiciary and providing safeguards&mdash; they may not be adequate safeguards, but at least they purport to be safeguards&mdash;against interference with the independence of the judiciary and the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and by leaving out any safeguards for <i>habeas corpus,</i> the right of free expression of opinion, and the other fundamental rights in the Constitution, brings into bold relief the fact that he regards the matters, which he has provided <Col N="1230" /> for in this Bill, the independence of the judiciary and the independence of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, as the only vital fundamental matters in the Constitution.  To him, the liberty of the subject, the right of free expression of opinion, the right of free assembly, which Deputy Corry again shakes his head at in derision, and all the other fundamental rights of the Constitution are of no importance. He did not intend to provide for them, and he has not provided for them in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the amendment that was put down by us to-day, dealing with those fundamental rights of the citizens of the State, we proposed a certain form in which those rights should be safeguarded. The President said that he did not like the method by which we proposed to safeguard them.  He agreed that they should be safeguarded, but he preferred the Referendum. He did not say he was going to safeguard them even by Referendum, at any stage of this Bill, nor did he say it even when this amendment appeared on the Paper, nor was there any Government amendment put down recognising the principle in our amendment even though it did not recognise the method.  If there were any sincerity in the declaration of the President or the declaration of the Attorney-General that those fundamental rights are recognised, when this amendment was put down by us to recognise those fundamental rights, if the only objection to the amendment was one of method, a Government amendment ought to have appeared on the Paper, ought to have been passed by this House, and ought to have taken its place in the Bill. That is not what this motion before the House at the moment proposes to do.  It proposes that the Bill shall be received for final consideration with only two fundamental rights in any way safeguarded&mdash;the independence of the judiciary and the independence of the Comptroller and Auditor-General. The liberty of the subject is not safeguarded. The right of free expression of opinion is not safeguarded, nor is there any intention so to safeguard it. The Attorney-General stated during <Col N="1231" /> the course of the discussion that something in the nature of what he called a ramp was being set on foot by the Opposition Party in connection with the Seanad.  I made it very clear during the course of the Second Reading of this Bill that we were not standing for this Seanad as at present constituted; that what we were standing for was a proper check and constitutional safeguard for the fundamental rights of citizens of this country, and that at the moment the only safeguard in the Constitution was the Seanad.  Whether or not it was the best safeguard was a matter for discussion.  Whether or not this Seanad was the best Seanad that could be devised was also a matter for discussion.  Whether a unicameral legislature or a bicameral legislature was best in the interests of the country could also have been a matter for discussion.  We were not given the opportunity.  This Bill was rushed in without consideration, without any warning, without any thought, as is perfectly apparent now, and with the sole motive of getting rid of what the Minister for Industry and Commerce referred to as the Jamesons and other ex-Southern Unionists.  The Seanad, as it stands at the moment, is the only safeguard and the only constitutional check.</P>
    <P>We have got to a stage now&mdash;which we had not arrived at some weeks ago &mdash;that the Government admit there must be some constitutional check on the Executive, even though that Executive has been returned to power by the popular vote of the people. That is now admitted by the Government. The only constitutional check we have at the moment is the Seanad. That is being swept away by this Bill. There is no check substituted for it. The President prefers a Referendum, but he does not say, as a matter of Government policy, that the Referendum should be substituted for the Seanad.  He does not say that the matter has been considered by the Government in any way, nor are we given any reasons why the Referendum is a better method of safeguarding the constitutional rights of the citizens of this country than any <Col N="1232" /> Second Chamber, however constituted, would be.  No opportunity is to be afforded for discussion in this House of that very vital matter&mdash;the safeguarding of the constitutional rights of the citizens of this State, and the safeguarding of the ordinary liberty of the subject from encroachments by any Executive, no matter from what Party they are formed.  If it were the policy of the Government to get rid of this Seanad, we ought to have been in a position to discuss calmly and without political heat the question as to whether a unicameral legislature or a bicameral legislature was the best system in the special circumstances of this country, or whether the Referendum was more appropriate to the condition of the country.  Those are matters on which various views might be held.  The Referendum is supposed to be the hallmark of political democracy. It may be a very useful constitutional machine in some countries. It may even be a very useful machine in this country.  It is a matter for discussion and very serious consideration as to whether the system of Referendum, having regard to the conditions existing in this country, is the appropriate method of safeguarding the constitutional rights.  I admit that is a matter for opinion, but those matters are so vital that the ordinary citizen should not in any way be prejudiced in his considerations by the bringing in to this Dáil of a Bill the sole purpose of which is political and which is merely what I called on the Second Reading of this Bill, a piece of Presidential pique.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate but for hearing Deputies opposite talk about the liberty of the subject.  That is rather amusing.  I wonder when did they learn that the subject has any liberties whatsoever?  When they sat here they had no idea of that description.  To anybody looking back over the last nine or ten years, and seeing the way in which the rights of the subject were looked after in those days, it is rather amusing to hear Deputy Costello speak of them to-day.  The rights of the subject!  I have seen, for instance, checkers on the Great Southern <Col N="1233" /> Railway pulled off a train 13 times in one fortnight, in order that they might be dismissed from their employment. There was no charge whatever against them.  I have seen men arrested on their way to work, pulled into the local barracks, and kept there from 8 o'clock to 12 o'clock.  They were then allowed to go home, and no charge was made against them.  I have seen the same thing happen five times in one week to men going to work in Ford's factory. The result was that they were discharged from their work.  The factory had no use for men who could not be there at the appointed hour to do a day's work.  That was the liberty of the subject.  They talk about judges. I got any amount of invitations here to speak about judges when this matter was on.  I had a little experience in 1926, and, mind you, that was a long time after the Civil War was over, and a very short time before I came in here to have a look across at the nice gentlemen who had done all this good work. I was arrested about 2 o'clock one morning in 1926, taken off to the local barracks, and kept there for three nights and three days.  I was then charged.  I was told I was then being arrested.  I was taken to a room upstairs.  A gentleman who called himself a judge sat down there. He gave a look at me and said &ldquo;Remanded for eight days.&rdquo;</P>

Deputies should not be so forgetful of what they did in the name of majority rule for many a year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather glad to get the definite indication from the last speaker that what he aims at is majority rule to remove judges.  That is quite frank.  Majority rule is to be allowed to remove judges.  That is Deputy Corry's idea, because somebody remanded him in 1926.  That is a clear-cut expression of the view of Fianna Fáil back benchers.  It is the view of the Front Bench, too, only they do not express it so clearly.  Why have we in this measure what Deputy Costello alluded to&mdash;that out of the whole Constitution two Articles alone have been picked out as Articles to be safeguarded in some way or another?  I do not think there is the slightest safeguard in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us consider the course of the measure.  It was introduced here when the President was undoubtedly suffering <Col N="1235" /> from a rebuff that he got over a most undemocratic proposal of his that went to the Seanad and was rejected there.  That measure was introduced and came up for Second Reading. Right through the course of the Second Reading debate no word came from the Government that they thought there was one Article of the Constitution more sacred than another, or more deserving of safeguarding than another.  When we came to the Committee Stage, the statement was made at an early stage of it that the measure had been very carefully considered in every one of its sections.  The Schedule referred to most of the Articles in the Constitution and, of course, in referring to some, one would have to conclude that the others would be referred to, if only from the point of view of excluding them from the Schedule.  Very late in the course of the Committee Stage the President stated that there were some Articles of the Constitution of greater value than others.  His second phrase was that there were some of value and they should be preserved.  Now we come to the Report Stage, and two amendment are put down which pretend to safeguard the judges and the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  In the course of the discussion on the Fourth Stage we get the statement from the President that, in his view, the Referendum is the way to look after the other Articles of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>An amendment, which had not very much force in it, but which was, at any rate, as good as amendments Nos. 2 and 3 in relation to the judges, was put down to safeguard what were considered to be certain fundamental rights of the Constitution.  I do not suppose anybody has been so audacious as to argue that the Articles to which amendment No. 1 relates do not deal with very vital matters.  They can be easily enumerated: freedom from arrest; liberty to speak and to associate freely for lawful purposes; the right of one's dwelling being inviolable; Articles to protect the Dáil, making it an obligation on the Government to call it together at least <Col N="1236" /> once a session for the purpose of discussion, so that questions agitating the public mind may get at least one chance of debate; Articles which protected the members coming to and going from the Dáil; Articles which protected their utterances here in this House; Articles which state that finance and the judiciary have to be safeguarded in a certain way; Articles which state that the only armed forces in the State should be those under the control of the Oireachtas.  It was sought to give some sort of colour of protection, when proper protection had failed, to these, and they are left out.  It is not even proposed to have a four-sevenths majority about changing, say, the Article of the Constitution which says that the dwelling of each citizen is inviolable and shall not be forcibly entered except in accordance with law.  There is no pretence that it requires a four-sevenths majority, hereafter, to change the Article of the Constitution which says that the liberty of the person is inviolable.  That is a matter which deserves comment.</P>
    <P>By pressure of argument, as this Bill went through its stages, the President was forced to the bare admission that there were Articles of value in the Constitution which should be safeguarded. It did not push him any further, not even to the pretence of safeguarding them, except these two only.  So that the sacred majority of the people operating by one vote can, as Deputy Corry wants, remove judges. If there was any sincerity in the view expressed that there are Articles in the Constitution of more value than others, they should be set aside in some way and different treatment given to them from that which is given to the others, but the marked contrast is there. Simply because the discussion centred upon two Articles, because it was politically a bad thing to have it rumoured abroad that the President wanted, possibly, to attack the courts and, possibly, wanted to attack the Comptroller and Auditor-General; because it was a wrong thing to go out that the President possibly was not feeling easy in relation to the legality of some of his acts, and in relation to <Col N="1237" /> the financial integrity of some of his acts, we have a pretence to cover these two things.  There is no pretence even to cover the Articles which state that there shall be no armed forces in the country except those operating under the control of the Oireachtas; no pretence to cover all those others which protect the Dáil, necessitate the summoning of it at least once a session, necessitate respect for certain things in regard to people's persons and their homes, their right to associate freely and speak their minds freely.  All these now definitely are open to the great majority.  These things do not appeal to Deputy Corry. He is saddened by his own experience.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>And succeeded.  Yet, despite that, Deputy Corry's view is that the majority ought to have power to wipe out the judges.  Certainly! And presumably also to break up the public meetings of those who are in a minority of one in the representation of the country; and possibly, also, to have the dwelling houses of people, opposed to Deputy Corry, open to access by him in his capacity as a representative of the majority.  The history of this thing is interesting. There was no appreciation of its effect when this measure was introduced.  I do not believe the Bill was properly considered.  The statements made in support of it did not lead anyone to believe it was given the slightest consideration. It was a measure introduced as a result of pique and panic, bad temper and hot temper, and with very little appreciation of the fact that it was creating a very dangerous situation. Then, apparently, an attempt was made to appreciate the danger, and it was thought politically better that something should be done about that, and as a result we have this amendment which is a confusion about fractions which shows that there was some appreciation of the situation by the President.  I do not know what this amendment means, or whether it <Col N="1238" /> means anything.  But it is introduced by the President, and it shows what his idea is about the other Articles of the Constitution.  He probably has my view of these two amendments, which is that they are not worth anything. They leave it clearly expressed to the people that the President holds Deputy Corry's fond view, that the views of the majority here should carry in relation to all public meetings in the country.</P>

      <P>The President overlooked the fact that there are certain fundamental rights involved in the Constitution which should not be changeable by any authority in the country.  The President is creating a situation by which he, or his successors, will have complete freedom without let or hindance to abolish all these rights.  And he clearly overlooked the fact that the Seanad is a safeguard for them.  The President's attitude was indicated when he said that the Seanad has, on several times, shown that it cannot be relied on to accept measures sent up by a body of the political complexion of the present majority of this House.  That shows the state of the President's mind.  He says the Seanad supported certain legislative measures that were brought before it of which he disapproved. When our Government was coping with organised murder, at a time when an attempt was made to corrupt justice, and the fountain head of justice, the jurors, were called upon to commit perjury, or else face assassination, the Seanad agreed with us, when we brought in a Bill, the effect of which was to give the then Government power that they did not previously possess to deal with that situation.  The President reads into that that inasmuch as the Seanad realised that the law as it then existed did not give the Government enough power to deal with that situation, the Seanad, because it passed the Bill that the then Government set up, must be of the same political complexion as that Government.  He seemed to think that no one should agree to put down these murder associations at that time unless they were blinded by political bias in our favour.  He says the Seanad was no check and he proposes now a check of four-sevenths with regard to two items.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1240" /> I think it was when this Bill was introduced into the Dáil for the first time that the Electoral (Revision of Constituencies) Bill came up.  After the last general election the President and Ministers and the chief propagandist of the Party opposite went round the country and stated that if there had not been proportional representation there would have been a complete victory for Fianna Fáil.  They assumed that the smaller constituencies that would be required would be replicas of the larger constituencies as they exist, so that the smaller constituencies would vote as the bigger constituencies voted.  They assumed that in the constituencies to be subdivided, where Fianna Fáil had a majority, they would still have a majority in the smaller ones.  That would mean that in the smaller member constituencies, in the vast majority of cases, their candidates would be elected.  What does the Electoral (Revision of Constituencies) Bill do?  If we are to accept the reasoning of Ministers since the last election, the Bill for the change of the constituencies effectively does away with proportional representation, and if the vote is to be the same as at the last election, and the small constituencies vote proportionately as the big constituencies voted, then Fianna Fáil in the elections that will follow after that Bill will have an overwhelming majority. Take Wicklow with three seats.  A bare majority over 50 per cent. gave two seats to Fianna Fáil and one to the Opposition.  Now you have a situation, under the new Bill, in which the majority of the constituencies in the country are to be three or four-seat constituencies.  If we are to accept the Government's reasoning and propaganda, that means that in every three-seat constituency they, having a majority, will get two seats, and in every four-seat constituency they, having a majority, will get three seats. That means that they would have in the next Parliament an overwhelming majority and the four-sevenths would not apply at all.  I do not personally regard four-sevenths as having any meaning whatsoever.  This four-sevenths was brought along on the <Col N="1241" /> lines of the selling of the cow.  We brought in an amendment which, to my mind, was quite inadequate.  The Government could, at any time they wanted, get rid of the judges by simply repealing that amendment. The really important thing is now that the Government has created a situation in which their Party or the Party that takes their place is going to have uncontrolled power over the fundamental liberties of the people.</P>
    <P>The President refused our amendment to-day.  He said that the Referendum is a more appropriate way of meeting the situation, but he has not brought in the Referendum.  The President makes nice, reasonable speeches but he takes care to get the power that he wants.  To be quite honest, I do not think that our first amendment was in any way adequate at all.  Our amendment dealt with the Articles in the Constitution which guarantee the fundamental rights of the people. These Articles are now going to be at the mercy of any Party in the country that can snap a majority.  If the President were honest he should face up to the situation and see that adequate means were provided so that these rights in the Constitution could not be arbitrarily done away with. We know that the President makes fine speeches.  He said that the Dáil is not going to act capriciously.  But the whole Constitution and an enormous mass of law is based on the assumption that it is always possible for the Dáil to be capricious.  There is enormous machinery built up recognising that fact.  If the President thinks that his own Party is perfect he surely must recognise that it will be a perfectly easy matter for another Party to come in here and do all sorts of things.  He is handing over the most absolute, dictatorial powers to his successors.</P>
    <P>It was said to-day that this Dáil is no more sovereign than any of its predecessors or any of its successors. During the lifetime of this Dáil the President has taken power that the last Dáil had not got.  We were elected in September, 1927.  Undoubtedly, we came in with very great powers.  I think we had more powers than any <Col N="1242" /> Executive Council in Europe at the time, but with all that there was a restraint on us.  The Seanad was in existence and it could not be dissolved by our arbitrary act.  So far as the President's Party is concerned, if they give him any trouble, he can simply say: &ldquo;I am going to dissolve the Dáil to-night&rdquo; and, of course, the members of it know that unless they are taken under his cloak they cannot be elected. We had not the power that he has taken when we were elected in 1927. We knew very well that if we proposed any legislation which did not appear reasonable to people, generally, or which appeared to be outrageously unreasonable, the Seanad would, necessarily, use its power against us. The President knows very well that when we were elected in September, 1927, the Seanad was already there, and that we had no power to put it out of operation except after the lapse of a certain number of years, when one-fourth of its members would automatically go out and have to be replaced.  The Seanad had power, limited power it is true, but power enough to make it impossible for any Government to use absolute arbitrariness. The President is now giving this Dáil power that its predecessor had not, unrestrained power, and he is passing that over to whatever body of men takes his place when he gets out of office.  By passing this Bill we are going to hand over to some Executive Council, the present, the one that succeeds it, or some other, absolute power over the fundamental rights of the people of this country.  The more I think the more I feel that absolute nationalism in a State is very far&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was just going to bring that in by way of analogy, but I do not want to digress.  The President is taking power to interfere with the most vital and sacred rights of the people, and is wiping them out. He says himself that he is satisfied that grace is operating in him now, but is it always going to operate in him so that he can never do anything wrong or sin against the rights of the people? <Col N="1243" /> We cannot look beyond the legislation we are dealing with.  When this Bill becomes law we must assume that the people of this country are going to be greater slaves of the Executive Council than any unfortunate moujik ever was under the Czars of Russia.  While that is so, the President has not indicated that he is going to take any steps to provide any restraints on his own Government or on any Government that may succeed it.  In his pique and loss of temper he is overthrowing the Seanad.  While he may have, legitimately enough, seen faults in it, yet he had no right to abolish the Seanad until, at all events, he was completely satisfied that he was going to create some other instrument that would discharge the necessary and desirable functions now performed by the Seanad.</P>
      <P>In amendment No. 1 we proposed a sort of substitute.  To my mind, it was completely unsatisfactory: not nearly as good a proposal as the maintenance of the Seanad even as it exists at present.  The President refused to accept that.  I think that when we discussed this earlier it is possible that Deputies and the people of the country did not realise what was at stake.  In the discussion on this Reading of the Bill it has been brought out and has not been refuted&mdash;it cannot be refuted by the Government&mdash;that the fundamental rights of the people are being taken away.  I tried in an inadequate way on previous stages of the Bill to bring out this point: that we are now in the position in which the Constitution can be changed by ordinary legislation.  It is abundantly clear as regards the Articles in the Constitution that exist for the purpose of protecting the fundamental rights of the people, that the amendments that we proposed to them provided a very inadequate restraint on the Government, but even so the Government did not accept them.</P>

      <P>I have only a few observations to make on the measure as amended.  There is a certain gentleman, as I have heard, who occasionally commits a lapse from grace: that is to say he spends too long at his dinner, but being advanced in years he takes the precaution of getting medically examined before he does that so that there will be no fatal consequences. I would suggest to the Ministry that in future, before they introduce a measure such as this, they ought to take care to have the implications of it examined.  As amended, it has a shred of respectability that it had not got on its introduction, a fact which was revolting to the finer feelings of a man like Deputy Fitzgerald. But it has been slightly improved.  That is to say, it is not absolutely as dangerous as it was.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may point out to my friend here, it has at least this pull over the Bill as introduced: that a day has been added to the official life of the Comptroller and Auditor-General and to the independence of the judiciary.  The Bill <Col N="1245" /> has been amended in that respect.  In other words, the Dáil must first take out these two clauses before it will exercise its majority, and I presume it would take two days instead of one. Even a day extra in a man's life may be of some advantage.</P>
      <P>It is for that extra day that I am putting to the House the advisability of not receiving this Bill for final consideration this evening, and so enable the Executive Council to consider the whole matter in relation to the criticisms that have been passed on the measure as now amended.  The various clauses to which it was sought to give greater security in the first amendment are still within 12 hours&mdash;six hours one might say&mdash;of being removed from the Constitution altogether, if and when this Bill passes into law.  We have been told that that matter will be the subject of examination by a Commission or by some body that will be set up.  May I say in all seriousness that the introduction of such a measure as this, and other acts on the part of the Administration, will keep some people at any rate away from any counsel with the Executive.  In other words, people's confidence is so shaken that they may not consent to being made what they will consider the cat's paws, or the persons who will be simply brought in to help the Government out of a difficulty, when they know their advice will be rather canvassed than employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already said, when I was recommending the adoption of the first amendment here this evening, that there should be no objection on the part of anybody who has any respect for representative institutions or for democracy, against securing these clauses.  It was not outside the bounds of possibility for the Executive, with all the resources at its command, to have framed an amendment better than that put down in our name.  We put down the amendment in all seriousness, in the very special circumstances of the case, that we thought could have been acceptable even to the pride of the Executive Council.  The case for the strengthening of these Articles is admitted, but the consideration of their <Col N="1246" /> strengthening is postponed.  Within recent months we have had the word &ldquo;dictator&rdquo; bandied about all over the country, but when this measure, as amended, is passed, not even the judiciary or the Comptroller and Auditor-General along with them, can impede an Executive Council, with a majority of one in this Dáil, from establishing a dictatorship.  All the professions and pretensions we get to the contrary do not allay the uneasiness there is behind that feeling that there is simply a distance of nine, ten or 11 months between us and the passing of that Bill, supposing it does pass into law.</P>
    <P>I do not think there was ever a measure introduced into the Oireachtas which should have had greater consideration than this measure.  It is quite plain on the face of it that it did not get that consideration.  In the first place, there were no amendments to the measure on the Committee Stage.  Objection is occasionally made by either Ministers or backbenchers on the other side that there is a waste of time in discussions here. On the Paper to-day there were two amendments from the President of the Executive Council, showing that, if it were not for the Opposition, there would be far less security for the independence of the judiciary or the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  It is to be observed that this is List No. 2.  I do not remember having seen List No. 1.  It is quite possible that the first amendment, which was drafted by the Executive Council, on subsequent consideration was passed over and that this is the second amendment, showing again hasty judgment, imperfect judgment.  Now, I suppose, this is the last word in wisdom. If the Attorney-General were asked to pronounce on the Constitution of Latvia.  Lithuania or Turkey and if the safeguards in their Constitutions were to be the safeguards in our Constitution with a single Chamber, I am positively certain he would say, &ldquo;Well, we could do much better if we tried.&rdquo;  It is for that purpose that I am putting it to the House that this measure which it is now proposed to receive for final consideration should not be passed by this House, so as to <Col N="1247" /> give the Executive Council an opportunity of reconsidering the whole matter.  It is not a Bill for which there is any need just now.</P>
    <P>I presume that when the previous measure, which limits the authority of the Seanad to holding up a measure from this House for three months, becomes law next December, January or February, or whatever date it may be, this measure will be re-introduced.  It is not a matter of importance that this Bill should pass any time in May, June or July.  I do say that bringing in this measure now in the midst of all the financial business that has got to be done, is little short of deliberate waste of time.  I take it that when the other measure becomes law it will be employed to enact this Bill again so that this Bill will be passed through the House again.  I have much more consideration for the dignity of this House than the Ministry.  I dislike even seeing my political opponents introducing and passing into law, with the aid of their majority, a measure for which this Oireachtas, and not they, will be held responsible because it is not the Government that passes Bills but the Oireachtas.  I say that any historian of the future, writing about this measure, will be bound to say that it was conceived in haste, passed in haste, and without that consideration that it should have received from the Ministry.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been listening to a trifling speech,, trifling because there was no serious attempt to deal with the questions at issue at all.  In fact the attitude of the Opposition for the most part has been trifling.  We brought in the Bill to abolish the Seanad with the Articles that had to be amended consequentially, indicated in the Schedule.  That was a complete Bill, perfect in itself, dealing with the particular issue involved.  Arising out of it there was a question of the future constitutional position and I indicated when we had the earlier discussion on another Bill, what our attitude was in that particular regard.  The suggestion that we have been forced step by step to a new realisation of this, that, and the other, is all nonsense.  If anybody <Col N="1248" /> takes the trouble to go back and to look at the statements made on the Bill, shortening the time for delay, they will indicate that these things were clearly foreseen.  What happened with regard to these amendments is that the Opposition, in order to follow up the policy which was clearly indicated by their leader in his Second Reading speech, the policy of trying to create panic of one sort or another, fastened on stating that the Comptroller and Auditor-General could be easily removed; that there was some purpose in this Bill to attack the position of the Comptroller and Auditor-General. The Comptroller and Auditor-General is as safe when the Seanad Bill is passed, as at any other time.  I hold he will be safe by a simple majority.</P>
      <P>These people, who examine everything thoroughly, brought in amendments, but were not clear of their effects.  If Deputy McGilligan's view was taken why were they brought in at all?  Was it for the trifling delay that Deputy Cosgrave says would be gained?  If Deputy McGilligan's view is correct, and if it is accepted by his colleagues, then all these amendments were nonsense.  They brought them in simply to try to create a certain impression, to give them an opportunity of talking about a certain thing. We want to meet them as far as is reasonable.  We want to meet Deputy McGilligan's point of view to a certain extent.  The Deputy says his point of view cannot be met.  Then it cannot be done in this Dáil, and that is all that is to be said about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said I was not clear as to the legal position with regard to the Constituent Assembly.  That does not mean that I had not views about it, or had not thought about it.  I know the condition of the country at the time that the previous Constituent Assembly met.  I know how far it was representative of the people.  They talk of &ldquo;contract&rdquo; or something in the Constitution. I remember the day it was put before the people, on the day of the election.  I would like the Deputy to explain legally what is the position of a Constituent Assembly in any framework.  It simply does not come <Col N="1249" /> in.  It originates certain framework of government.  It may provide for certain changes in the fundamental law, that is, for changes to be effected after the fundamental law has been passed.  There is nothing to prevent a new Constituent Assembly being called at any time.  There is no fundamental way in which it is laid down legally that such Constituent Assembly shall be called or constituted. When we talk about Constitutions we are dealing with very fundamental things.  Some of the arguments reminded me of the squirrel in a revolving cage.  It gets nowhere, as each step may be a step backward.  Our attitude has been this: This Constitution was framed originally under exceptional circumstances. There were certain Articles in the Constitution which were forced upon the people of this country. There are certain Articles which represent democratic ideals.  Those that represent these ideals, in so far as a thorough examination by people who have had experience of administration goes, are consistent with practical government.  These Articles ought, with all possible speed, be examined, and be made as lasting as it is possible for anything to be made lasting, in a Constitutional way, without the danger of a cast-iron Constitution which, as I said, is always a temptation to revolution.</P>
    <P>It is in the national interest that the other Articles should be easily changed, according to the progress made by our people, and according to the ability of the people to get recognition of a free expression of their will.  It has been always my view, in the first place, that in removing the Seanad the procedure <Col N="1250" /> in this House would have to be examined; and, in the second place, the Constitution, in light of the fact that you are going to have, for a period, at any rate, a Single-Chamber Legislature.  But when would that be done?  Would it be done when the Second Chamber exists, when you are working without the knowledge if you are going to have a single Chamber and Executive for a time, or should it be done when the Dáil, at any rate, has passed this measure, and it is bound to become law after a certain period?  Clearly the interval is the proper time for first determining all the necessary changes.  No one can suggest that necessary changes cannot be made, such as the question as to whether certain Articles of the Constitution which have no reference whatever to the Treaty or forced relationship should not be examined, with a view to getting them into a form in which they can be made as permanent as we deem it advisable to make them.</P>
    <P>When dealing with this originally, I said that I regarded it as wise that provision should be made for changing the Constitution during a protracted period.  That argument holds particularly in regard to certain Articles. Those that deal with the democratic ideas of government can, to my mind, be dealt with out of hand.  The moment this Bill has been to the Seanad, and is either passed or rejected by it&mdash;and I am assuming for the moment that the Seanad is likely to hold it up&mdash;it can be dealt with.  I do not think I can possibly deal with that at this stage.  I will reserve it for the Fifth Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking on this Vote when the House adjourned on the last occasion.  Anybody who listened to the Minister's speech or who since read the Minister's speech in the Official Report must be at least convinced of one thing, that it was neither a serious answer nor an attempt at a serious answer to the grave indictment that is brought against his policy and the administration of his Department. It was no answer to these serious charges for him to treat the House to a series of cheap jibes and cheap scores against various Parties.  I candidly confess that we might have expected something of the kind from other members of the Government. From the particular Minister I must say that an answer of that kind showed a lack of seriousness that seems to indicate that he is falling into the habit or the conduct of some of his colleagues. Can anybody who has read that speech or was listening to it get from it the impression that there was on the part of the Government on <Col N="1253" /> whose behalf that speech was made any serious conception of their duty so far as the administration of the law is concerned and of their duty to the people of this country?</P>
      <P>I pass over certain aspects and details of the speech.  For instance it is quite clear&mdash;and I think the Minister himself, on consideration, would possibly be the last to deny it&mdash; that when he was dealing with the particular case of Deputy Mulcahy and his guard either he had not seen the documents that had been submitted by Deputy Mulcahy, or else he had forgotten their contents.  I say that because certainly the views which he attributes to Deputy Mulcahy, as having been expressed in these documents, found no support in these documents. That suggests&mdash;and this is rather a serious aspect of the case&mdash; that assurances of &ldquo;inquiry&rdquo; are of little value when a Deputy of this House, an ex-Minister who had occasion to make a serious complaint as to the way the so-called guarding of him is carried on, has his complaint treated in that way.  An investigation, we were told, was taking place.  It is very hard to get the impression that the Minister had given the matter his serious attention. I wonder whether any of the other investigations that are promised are conducted in the same lighthearted, haphazard fashion.  We are told that a number of such investigations are taking place.  How many of them are conducted like this investigation in the case of Deputy Mulcahy?</P>
      <P>There are two tasks that we look for the Minister to fulfil so far as crime in this country is concerned, namely, the prevention of crime, and when the crime is committed the detection of that crime.  I doubt if any Deputy who has followed the Minister and who has read the case made against the Government in these two respects, can really say with honesty that the Government has made the case&mdash;or proved the case &mdash;that they have been zealous in the performance of their duty either in the prevention or detection of crime?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is futile and idle to throw the taunt against the Opposition that when they were in office certain major crimes went undetected.  Let us <Col N="1254" /> remember in this particular respect that a large proportion&mdash;not the majority, but a large proportion&mdash;of the country were, some accepting with reluctance, and most of that portion rejecting the actual form of government set up, and that a man who is now a member of the Government, then a Deputy in the Opposition, raised his voice here with indignation and asked: &ldquo;Can we be expected to be informers?&rdquo; I remember having listened to that statement being made.  Now there is no such excuse of want of goodwill.  There is only a very small section in the country who do not profess a readiness to come to the assistance of the Government in the suppression of crime.</P>
    <P>The Minister raised the question of Dundalk on that occasion.  He said: &ldquo;I have been prepared at any time to place the police reports I have at the disposal of the Leader of the Opposition, and to assure him that the police are satisfied beyond year or nay that there is no relationship between the mine that was exploded in Dundalk and the incidents that took place in Dublin. I have offered to make these reports available.  They are available.&rdquo;  My recollection is sometimes very faulty, I admit.  I want to know when was that offer made.  The Minister knows there is a motion connected with this very matter on behalf of Deputy Cosgrave, the Leader of the Opposition, standing on the Paper.  Did the Minister communicate that offer, that he says was made, to Deputy Cosgrave?  I suggest that anybody listening to him or reading his speech would imagine he had.  Secondly, may I point out that when the question was debated on a kind of cross-talk in the House on one occasion, I myself drew attention to the matter that there had been no denial&mdash;and there never since has been a denial&mdash;of the charges made by Deputy Cosgrave as to that meeting taking place and as to the observation by the detectives, and as one of the objects of the meeting.  There has been a denial&mdash;I think the Minister will himself admit that on the occasion in question he limited himself to such a denial&mdash;of the implied deduction that because the mine exploded next day <Col N="1255" /> there was some connection between the two.</P>
    <P>But is it still denied by the Minister that this meeting, which the detectives had under observation, took place? Does he know the purpose of the meeting? The House will know and the public will say that he has been remarkably silent on that particular matter.  He speaks of the attempt to make political capital out of this.  Is the Minister trying to convey to the House and to the country that there was nothing political in the Dundalk outrage, that it was purely a matter of private revenge against this unfortunate old lady?  Surely this is not the suggestion?</P>
    <P>Is there any doubt in the Minister's mind that this outrage in Dundalk was what is called a political outrage?  Has it been got after?  The Minister seems, apparently, to know a great deal about it.  The Minister can establish&mdash;one of the most difficult things to establish, I admit&mdash;the negative: that there was no connection between the two.  I wonder does he know so much about both sides of this particular outrage that took place in Dundalk, if there were two sides to it?  I wonder whether any man in this country doubts that it was a political outrage?  I suggest that in the two directions from which the Government and the people of this country are entitled to look for support of the policy of the Government, namely, in the prevention of crime and in the detection and punishment of crime, the record of the Minister's Department in the last 12 months has been most unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>He has increased the Secret Service Fund.  For what purpose?  For the purpose of detecting crime?  For the purpose of knowing beforehand whether crimes are likely to be committed and thus being in a position to prevent them, or is it merely to get information against his political opponents? We have, at a time, as was described by the President before the Tourist Association, when the country is one of the most peaceful in Europe, an increase in the Secret Service Vote from £10,000 to £25,000.  What is the return that has been given, so far as <Col N="1256" /> the prevention and detection of crime are concerned by the Minister during the last 12 months?  Not a week passes, as the Minister knows, that there are not a number of serious crimes, the great majority of them directed against the members of this Party.  Anybody who has read the Minister's speech will see that not merely has he not during the year dealt with that problem sufficiently, but even here on the last occasion when defending this Vote he really failed to deal with or even grasp the seriousness of the problem.  The Minister does not wipe these crimes out of existence by pointing out that week after week a list of them appears in <i>United Ireland.</i>  That does not show that he has dealt with them.  The great bulk of these crimes are there neatly catalogued for him, so that he need have no trouble about the matter.</P>
    <P>He has failed to deal with that particular question.  In fact, it is rather difficult to understand his position from certain portions of the Minister's speech.  Though he condemns crime, and though, I will admit, there are occasions when he gives evidence of a desire to get after crime, yet coupled with that there is undoubtedly running through his speech, I shall not say a note of palliation, because that would be too strong a word to apply to the Minister, but at least there is an understanding of the criminal mind on these matters.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to interruptions at meetings.  Anybody who has read the newspapers of this country for years past, but especially during the last couple of years, will know that time and again, almost without number, efforts have been made to prevent public meetings being held by what was once the majority Party in this country and what is now a Party representative of a very substantial number of people.  That was the position, at least according to the last election.  I am speaking of the election figures only and I am not speaking of the present moment.  Even if you take the figures at the last election, the Party represent a very substantial minority of the people.  The members of that Party have had continual interruptions at their meetings.  The <Col N="1257" /> Minister has to go back over ten years to find an explanation for the interruptions that are now taking place and for the attempts made to interfere with the liberty of speech in this country.  I am afraid a person reading the Minister's speech will get the idea that he has resigned himself to the position that these weekly crimes of violence, especially against the members of our Party, are a normal condition of things to be expected and accepted in the country.</P>
    <P>He referred to the question of arms. What was the policy of the Government in that respect?  They took up arms from the people who the police authorities considered were people who ought to have arms and who certainly should be allowed to have them if they wanted to have them.  They have taken arms from people who never asked for them but who, at the request of the police, did carry arms.  The people they took the arms from were the people who, according to the police themselves, could be trusted with arms.  It was apparently the definite policy, at least as the President enunciated in this House, that even if arms are held illegally, if they are kept in secret and not paraded in public, no effort will be made to get them.  Undoubtedly, individuals through the country have arms.  But to base, on the fact that a few individuals in our organisation have arms, the accusation that it is an armed organisation, is worthy of the logic of one of the Ministers sitting opposite me, but not worthy of the Minister for Justice.  He knows perfectly well there is no force in that argument.  He knows perfectly well that the Government has allowed, not merely individuals to have arms illegally, but organisations and associations.</P>
    <P>It is no proof whatsoever against an organisation that is an unarmed organisation if, against the commands of their leaders and the rules of that organisation, a few individuals may be found with arms.  There are numbers of individuals through the country who have arms, but the vast bulk of them have no connection with our Party, and are bitterly hostile to it, and the Minister knows it.  They are much more <Col N="1258" /> closely connected with the Minister's own Party, much more closely in alliance with the Minister's Party.  The fact that one or two individuals have been found with arms is not the slightest proof against the organisation which he tries, on the basis of that evidence, to condemn as an armed organisation.  The Government, as the Minister knows, and as the House knows, has immense powers.  We all remember perfectly well the almost hysterical line taken up by the men who are now Ministers when some of these powers were entrusted to the Government of the day.  They now have these powers.  I suggest these powers have not been effective in preserving the ordinary rights of the people of this State.  In fact, instead of utilising those powers for the protection of the ordinary law-abiding citizens, instead of using them to see that the ordinary liberties and rights of the citizen are safeguarded, a great deal of the ingenuity and the inventive powers of the Government have been devoted to the making of new crimes.  They have not, apparently, sufficient powers already!  They have not sufficient crimes to punish!  They go out of their way, they spend a great deal of their energy, which might have been spent in the punishment of crimes actually committed, in inventing new crimes. They go out of their way to make a crime out of the exercise of his ordinary rights by the ordinary citizen in this country.</P>
    <P>First, they tried incitement of various kinds.  That failed.  I must say here that I get the impression from various speeches of the Minister that he is rather inclined to take up the line that even necessary self-defence is both immoral and illegal.  Now, the Minister cannot or ought not to take up that line.  He knows perfectly well that necessary self-defence is legal and, so far as the morality of it is concerned, the right of the individual to protect himself against unauthorised attack, that right of necessary self-protection is a moral right that no State can take from him.  The Minister has been at pains, I think, in certain instances, to point out, in excuse of the authorities, that the authorities cannot be everywhere&mdash;that <Col N="1259" /> they can only do a certain amount&mdash;but the fact remains that very often the people responsible for these attacks on individuals are careful to secure that the attacks take place when the Guards and others responsible for maintaining peace and order are not present.  On such an occasion, surely the ordinary citizen is at liberty to defend himself; surely he is not bound, either morally or legally, simply to take up the line that he must submit to attack and assault, and that he must not defend himself?  Yet that is the attitude the Minister is allowing himself to slip into so far as the members of this Party are concerned.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that all this talk of liberty and democracy is only pure sham if the people have not the right to do certain things that are guaranteed under the Constitution; if individuals have not the right to put their views before the people.  The fact remains that for years past the public meetings that have been attacked and to break up which attempts have been made are our meetings. No attempts have been made to break up the meetings of the Party opposite even in places where our Party had the majority at the last election. No attempt has been made to break up these meetings.  Scarcely a week passes, however, in which several attempts are not made to break up our meetings.  There is no good in pretending that it is the I.R.A. that is responsible for the attempt to break up these meetings.  They may have a certain amount of responsibility, but an equal portion of the responsibility rests on the supporters of the present Government.  Many a meeting has been broken up, many a savage attack has taken place, under the cry of &ldquo;Up de Valera.&rdquo;  The Minister may take that for granted.  Anybody who is present at these meetings can tell him of it. Apparently, however, the attitude now taken up&mdash;and you can see it in a recent letter from the Secretary of the Party to which the Government belongs&mdash;is that the only people entitled to have a large meeting in this country, or even to bring people to a large meeting, are the Government. <Col N="1260" /> The President can hold a meeting in Cork, where, incidentally, the bulk of the citizens voted on our side at the last election.  He can bring special trains in there.  Nobody objects to that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Donnelly says 24 trains, if necessary&mdash;and I believe it is necessary to make a big meeting!  As I said, nobody objects to that, but if an effort is made on our part to bring in a certain number of supporters to a meeting, there is no right to do that&mdash;that is provocative, that stirs up the people, that is putting too much of a test on the good temper of the people and it cannot be allowed! That is the attitude of the Party opposite.  Instead of using their powers to secure a fair and impartial administration of justice, they are really utilising their immense powers against their political opponents.  We need not go back to the year 1923, or whenever it was, but how can you expect the followers of the Ministry, the followers of the Government, the followers of the President, to take his appeal for order seriously when the real incitement to disorder started, in the first instance, from Ministers themselves? How can anybody expect their ordinary misguided followers in the country now not to believe that when the President is appealing for order and fair play he is not talking with his tongue in his cheek?  Even when you take up such a recent pronouncement as that of the President in Cork last Sunday, you get a characteristic piece of Presidential subtlety, the usual giving with one hand and taking away with the other&mdash;which hand he gives with and which he takes with, I need not determine.  He had appealed for fair play, and then he goes on to &ldquo;appeal to their opponents not to make the task of preserving peace at public meetings more difficult by giving an outside Government the hope that the Irish people would be beaten in the struggle and by tactics that make the march of the nation more difficult.&rdquo; What is that but the repetition, in a less open fashion, of the statements <Col N="1261" /> of the MacEntees and the rest about Castlereaghs, traitors, and so on?  Is there any difference in essence? He appeals, on the one hand, for fair play, and on the other hand, he practically appeals&mdash;as it appears to anybody who reads the paragraph&mdash;to the passions of the people in the same way that the Minister for Finance and others have been shocking the country.</P>
      <P>Let us be clear on that.  That, unfortunately, as the President might know, is rather apt to have unfortunate results.  That cry of &ldquo;traitor&rdquo; against people who have served their country has been tried again and again, very often with unfortunate results to the people against who it is tried, but, ultimately, with equally unfortunate results to the people by whom it was tried.  Those who know anything about revolutions know of repeated examples of exactly the same charge being levelled against the people who first used that cry, and that is happening in this country to-day.  The Fianna Fáil Party went around the country with the shout of &ldquo;traitors&rdquo; against the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, and now in my native county I find blocked up in large letters on the walls &ldquo;Down with the new traitors.&rdquo;  That is the inevitable result of unscrupulous conduct of that kind.  Exactly the same unfounded, base, calumniating charges they bring against others will be brought with equal effect against themselves, and at the present moment, as I say, anybody who cares to keep his eyes open going along the roads at present will see up on the walls &ldquo;Down with the new traitors.&rdquo;  That is the inevitable result of that policy of vilification, or, at the very best, that policy of irresponsible talk which alleged responsible Ministers of the Government carried on during their months of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many things in that speech in Cork that have some interest.  There was a time when the Minister for Industry and Commerce was an eloquent occupant of these benches. Just ask some of the Deputies to read, if they have time, a speech of his in the year 1928, to be found in Volume 32, columns 1428-35, in which he <Col N="1262" /> points out the various things that the Guards were supposed to be doing and stating that he could not support the Vote on Account so long as it included in the definition of crime the desire to achieve the full independence of Ireland.  The President standing over, apparently, a portion of the policy of the Minister for Justice, was challenged when speaking in Cork last Sunday&mdash; they might have challenged the Minister for Industry and Commerce had he been there&mdash;&ldquo;Who arrested Tom Barry?&rdquo;  There was a characteristic Presidential answer.  &ldquo;He arrested himself.&rdquo;  The President would never arrest a patriot.  At all events, he, in the year 1934, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the year 1928, are in full verbal agreement on that matter.  They could not, apparently, regard as a crime the activity of men out to achieve the full independence of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Is it not quite clear that the Government is not awake to the fact that the liberty of the ordinary person in this country is being done away with by the Government on the one hand and by the unorganised forces of disorder on the other?  As to the extent they are in agreement it is difficult to say.  When a member of the more extreme section of one Party obliges the Government by arresting himself, and when the delicacy of the President is so great that he could not offend the susceptibilities of the members of that Party by acknowledging that he stood over that arrest, but says &ldquo;No, the man arrested himself,&rdquo; which is received with loud cheers near the platform, anybody who has the interests of this country at heart or who has any kind of acquaintance or knowledge of revolutionary movements in other countries, and who sees how the Government here is behaving, can only look with grave uneasiness to the future.  In conclusion, I should like only to repeat what I said at the beginning.  A serious indictment was made of the policy of the Government and of the conduct of the Minister.  No effort was made by the Minister or by the Attorney-General to answer that serious indictment.</P>
    <Col N="1263" />
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is reported in column 815 of the Official Debates of 9th May as saying:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I have been prepared at any time to place the police reports that I have at the disposal of the Leader of the Opposition, and to assure him that the police are satisfied, beyond yea or nea, that there is no relationship between the mine that was exploded in Dundalk and the incidents that took place in Dublin.  I have offered to make these police reports available. They are available.  These officers were not brought in by us or promoted by us since we came into office.  They are officers who served under the Cosgrave régime, under the people opposite during their term.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be indebted to the Minister if he would inform me when he undertook to do this, because I have no recollection of his having made any such suggestion to me, nor have I read of it being made before.  In the earlier portion of column 815 he gives a report of a police account which, he said, was substantially the same as my own.  I should like to supplement my own.  It may have escaped my memory at the time, but I inquired from the police what information there was at my disposal which they had not got.  That does not appear in the police report, and I cannot understand why that should be left out of the police report.  There were two officers present, and I suppose they were able to compare notes. There were really three points of which one was, did they know of those incidents, and they said: &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  My view of that at that time and my view now is that it was a waste of time to send an officer to see me who knew nothing about that, and that it did not show any appreciation of the responsibilities of the officer in question.  If anybody in authority were to be sent, it should be somebody who knew the facts, and those officers at that time did not say to me that they were prepared to put these reports before me.  One of those men, I understand, was promoted by the Minister.  One of those has responsibility for order in Dublin.  That was a grave event and he knew nothing <Col N="1264" /> about it except what he had read in the newspapers.  Was he sent there or did he come on his own responsibility, and if he were sent, was he sent by the political head or by the police head to me on that occasion?</P>
    <P>I find that on the adjournment debate later on, the Minister takes Deputy Mulcahy and myself to task for not cooperating with the police escort which has been attached to us recently.  I should like the Minister to understand, if I have not made it clear to him already, that both last year and this year, when it was proposed to change those who had that duty before, military men, to Guards, I objected and I believe that General Mulcahy did also.  I told the responsible police authorities that under no circumstances was I going to co-operate with them in that connection.  I do not want them. The Minister can keep his Guards. I would not require any Guards in this country or anywhere else, if it were not for that Front Bench, as I have said on another occasion.  This farce of guarding ought to be ended once and for all.  With General Mulcahy, I left Dublin on Saturday evening at the head of a procession&mdash; General Mulcahy's escort and my own. We separated down the country and before I got to my destination, having left one behind, I passed the other on the road&mdash;and that is guarding, according to the Minister.  The thing is a joke.  At the place where we stayed the man of the house was called out and asked if we were there, so that they could stay in the vicinity.  Personally, I do not want them.  The Minister can take them away and utilise them for whatever purpose he pleases.  He said in the course of his statement that it is his advisers who have recommended this change.  I had advisers also five years ago, when it was considered necessary to attach an escort to the Ministers.  My advisers at that time recommended military men.  If there was any danger it was a military proposition.  They did not recommend a police escort.  The Minister's advisers now apparently have changed their minds.  If they are the same, they have changed their minds.  Very good; I have not changed <Col N="1265" /> mine.  I did not require them five years ago; I do not require them now, and the Minister can keep them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>For the last five or six years I have been drawing attention to the congestion in the Dublin District Court.  It existed at a period prior to the Minister's coming into office, and it has existed for the two years he has been in office.  The congestion in that court has meant that there has been a delay of six to seven months in bringing cases to trial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the Dublin Circuit Court.  There are traders who take advantage of that, and when a decision is arrived at they give notice of appeal. There is also congestion in the Appeal Court.  The result is that the trading community have to wait in many cases for 12 months before they can obtain payment for their goods.  The Minister told me in July last that there were 262 cases then awaiting trial. Some 16 of those were over seven months awaiting trial.  He said he was taking steps to have the matter attended to.  I want to know what are the conditions in the Circuit Court at the moment, and what steps the Minister has taken to expedite the cases there.  It is time that something was done.  I do not blame the Minister for all the delay that has occurred, but I blame him for the continuance of that delay.  I hope in his reply he will be able to report some progress in that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second matter I want to draw his attention to is the number of street accidents.  He is aware that a special effort is being made at the moment on the other side to effect a reduction in those accidents.  He told me last week that during the last year 185 fatal accidents occurred on our roads, and in addition that some 2,747 persons were injured in those accidents.  I asked him if steps were being taken to erect the mechanical signs that one notices in all other cities for the prevention of those road accidents.  He said the matter was being inquired into.  Only last night, going home from the Dáil, <Col N="1266" /> I had to pass some six different cross-roads between here and Merrion.  The first was at Merrion Street.  At that hour the policeman on duty had gone off that particular station.  Just at the moment when I was crossing, a bad accident was only avoided by the fact that two good drivers were involved. Had it been an ordinary case there would possibly have been unfortunate results.  Further on, at Merrion Road, I was stopped by an accident to a girl. A bus had run over her.  At not one of these cross-roads was there any Guard on duty.  If those mechanical signs had been at those cross-roads, I am sure they would have been the means of avoiding a number of accidents. I hope that something will be done in view of the importance of this matter and of the number that are injured every day on our roads.</P>
    <P>The third matter to which I want to draw the Minister's attention is the very unsatisfactory condition of street trading by juveniles in our city.  The number of juveniles, particularly newsboys, who comply with the regulations, represents only a fraction of those trading on the streets.  Since the 1st January, 1924, 21 boys and nine girls who were not previously in possession of a licence made application at the employment exchange, and certificates recommending the issue of licences were forwarded to the Public Health Committee in respect of 19 boys and eight girls, the remaining applications being refused for various reasons. Those figures, when taken with the number who renewed their applications since the beginning of the year, show that only 34 boys and 13 girls between the ages of 14 and 16 are entitled to sell on the streets.  Well, as everybody knows, there are five times that number of juveniles trading on our streets.  Those juveniles, when they seek a licence, must make application to the Secretary of the Juvenile Advisory Committee at the employment exchange.  The licence is not granted by the exchange but by the Corporation, and no licence will be granted by the Corporation until a certificate is received from the Juvenile Advisory Committee, stating that the application has been so made, that <Col N="1267" /> the conditions specified are satisfied, that the applicant has his or her parents' or guardian's consent to engage in street trading, and that no other suitable employment is available. That is the duty of the Guards, and the Juvenile Employment Committee have approached the Assistant Commissioner on a number of occasions.  I have been before him myself on the matter.  They promised assistance, and they put on this particular duty some two or three Guards, but they are useless to deal with the problem.  All the Committee can do is to draw the attention of the Gárda and of the Minister to the really very unsatisfactory condition in which this matter is at the moment.  I hope the Minister will be able to see his way to have the subject inquired into and to have something done.</P>

      <P>It is rather strange to hear the enormous number of complaints made here during the last few days against the conduct of the Civic Guards and, in particular, the charges made by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenny. Deputies opposite go down the country and deliberately endeavour to incite the people to rows and wrangles and try to get up disturbances at their meetings, as that is the only way in which they can collect a crowd.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I say openly that it is the bad training given to the Civic Guards by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney when he was Minister that is responsible. He used to deliver parrot-like speeches whitewashing their illegal actions throughout the country.  Night after night, when questions were raised on the adjournment, we had from him the same old gramophone record.  It was always the same old story.  If a man was assaulted by the Guards we were told that he got a kick from a cow.  We had that night after night and day after day when Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney was a Minister for Justice.  Unfortunately, some of these men whom we complained of then are still in the Guards.  Here and there some of them are committing illegal actions.  We cannot clear them all out in a day.  Unfortunately, that kind of thing creeps in.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney said that there have been no interruptions at his meetings.  I have not read any of his speeches because I take no interest in what he says, but I have seen what some of his leaders have said. Deputies opposite think that they can allude to the President of this State from public platforms as the Pigott of 1932 and that Republicans are going to stand by and listen to that.  It is no wonder that they want Blue Shirts with leaden batons when that is the kind of conduct they carry on and that is the kind of filth they spill out at their meetings.  I have seen the so-called secretary of their present organisation at Glanmire during the last general election getting up on a wall and deliberately attempting to incite the people to attack him, just because he had a lorry full of thugs out of some back lane collected together, with five bottles of whiskey, and, I suppose, ten bob for the day.  The Superintendent of the Civic Guards had to pull that man off the wall and order him into his motor car and send him away.  That Superintendent of the Civic Guards is still in the town of Cobh.</P>

      <P>I will tell you the truth. You do not seem to like it.  It does not agree with you.  When these deliberate incitements are going on all over the country it is no wonder that we have trouble.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney will remember well an occasion when he was challenged here about four of these gentlemen being sent out to arrest a man at 10.30 at night.  That man was brought to the local Gárda station and released at 11.30 p.m., and at 11.40 p.m. he was found, with his head stoved in with the butt of a revolver, lying in the dyke on the roadside within 20 yards of the police station.  I brought up that case here and what was I told?  That he fell, or that an angel struck him.  There were no cows passing that particular road; he did not get a kick from a cow.  That unfortunate man was lying in the North Infirmary, Cork, for five days. On the same night, four of these gentlemen jumped out of their motor car and assaulted four young boys on the road and beat them with the butts of their revolvers.  That very same motor car took one of them to hospital. Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney stood up here and sought to whitewash them.  I went to the local Superintendent of the Guards and asked for an identification parade of the C.I.D. men whom he had at that period in Union Quay Barrack. What did he do?  On the following morning four of them were removed from the barrack to Dublin and were kept in Dublin for five months for fear they would be identified.  One of them came up in court the other day and said that he had never assaulted a man in his life&mdash;a man that assaulted a person on five occasions on the one day while removing that person as a prisoner from Cork to Cobh for trial and was fined by a District Justice for assault.  Then we hear complaints about the conduct of the Civic Guards. Is it any wonder that the conduct of the Guards is bad here and there through the country when persons of that kind are still in the Guards and <Col N="1270" /> in charge of them here and there through the country.  I make no bones about it.  I am here to tell the truth.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney was in charge of the Guards in 1928 when these five men were shifted out of Union Quay Barracks up to Dublin and kept in Dublin for five months so that they would not be seen in the streets of Cork and identified by those men whom they had assaulted.  There is no good in burking that issue, when you have the like of that going on for a period of years and when we had the Minister standing up night after night and going on with that kind of game.  We know what the charges are being made against the Guards for.  The Guards are absolutely justified. I remember on one occasion bringing up the case here of one Civic Guard who was fined three times in succession in the District Court for assault.  I appealed to have that man at least transferred out of that district. What was I told?  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney said that he was a right good Guard.  This Civic Guard who was fined three times in the District Court for assault was a right good Guard in Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's eyes!  That is what is wrong with the Civic Guards.  We had that kind of thing carried on week after week and month after month.  Then they stand up and complain because some old landlord down the country, who refused to pay his annuity, came in his motor car to prevent a sheriff's sale of cattle and happened to get a crack of a baton.  It is about time that some of the others were hit.  We got enough of it.  We have Deputies complaining because a Superintendent of the Guards used his walking-stick and hit somebody.</P>
