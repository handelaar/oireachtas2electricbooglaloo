      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle (for Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will make a grant to the Donegal County Council for the purpose of putting the main road from Gweedore to Burtonport in a state of repair in view of the statement of the County Surveyor for County Donegal to the Donegal County Council that this road was in a gravely unsatisfactory condition and could not be properly maintained unless radical repairs were first carried out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Out of a total of £17,622 allowed for improvement of main roads in County Donegal out of the current year's Improvement Grant, a sum of approximately £3,311 has been allowed for this road, which is only about 13 miles in length.  A sum of £2,500 is being spent on the improvement of the portion between a point half a mile beyond Gweedore and Crolly Bridge and the balance, £811, is being spent near Kincasslagh. Having regard to the urgent needs of other roads in County Donegal and in other counties, a further grant from the Road Fund could not be allocated to the road in question during the current financial year.  I may add, however, that I regard this as an interesting and important road and its welfare will not be lost sight of.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarSeanDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware of the dissatisfaction existing as a result of the method of determining the &ldquo;means test&rdquo; of applicants for benefit under the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933, and whether in cases where such applicants have been granted &ldquo;plots of land&rdquo; under the Allotments Amendment Act, 1934, he will state what benefit, if any, unemployed holders of &ldquo;plots of land&rdquo; are entitled to under the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any dissatisfaction with the method of determining the means of applicants under the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933.  The value of means is determined by an unemployment assistance officer, and if the applicant be dissatisfied with the decision he may appeal to the Unemployment Appeals Committee, whose decision is final and conclusive. any advantage accuring to the holder of a plot granted under the Acquisition of Land (Allotments) (Amendment) Act, 1934, from the use of such plot constitutes means within the meaning of Section 13 of the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933, and the yearly value of such advantage is determined in accordance with the Act. The Schedule to the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933, contains the different rates of Unemployment assistance, and an applicant, according to the area in which he resides, the class to which he belongs and the weekly value of his means, is entitled to the rate applicable to him, less one shilling for each shilling or part of a chilling by which the weekly rate of his means exceeds two shillings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarSeanDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister was there not an undertaking given to the Plotholders' Association that persons in receipt of unemployment assistance and holding those plots would not be debarred from receiving those benefits; and, further, that in such cases as are referred to the Guards were sent down to measure their plots? Will the Minister devise some means of obtaining the necessary information, and does he not think it unfair that those benefits should be withdrawn without some prior notice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The persons holding those plots under the Allotments Act are not debarred from receiving unemployment assistance; I should say that in the great majority of cases of such plotholders the value of the advantage, <Col N="375" /> as assessed under the Act, derived from the plot is deemed to be less than 2/- a week, and, consequently, the plot-holder, if he has no other means, is entitled to unemployment assistance at the full rate provided under the Act.

      <P>The reply is in the form of a tabular statement, which will <Col N="383" /> be circulated in the Official Report of Parliamentary Debates.  I would, however, ask the Deputy to accept the figures for the respective financial rather than calendar years, as the Land Commission Statistics are made up for financial years and accordingly the figures for the calendar years are not readily available.

      <P>An inspector of the Land Commission has made a detailed report on the condition of the holdings on the Hall Estate at Faha, County Clare, affected by the recent bog-slide and has made certain recommendations. These recommendations have been forwarded to the Commissioners of Public Works for consideration of the <Col N="384" /> question of providing assistance out of the Vote for Minor Relief Works.  The lands affected are vested lands and any assistance from public funds would, therefore, properly fall upon that Vote which has already, it is understood, provided some money for works of immediate necessity at Faha.</P>

      <P>I move, that this Bill be now read a second time.  I do not know whether it is necessary to make any extended statement on the Second Reading of <Col N="388" /> this measure.  Deputies are aware that it is customary to bring in a Bill of this sort at the end of the year to extend the operation of a number of minor enactments which it is thought advisable should come under review from year to year, after they were originally passed.  This measure continues for another year the same statutes which appear in Parts I and II of the Schedule to the Expiring Laws Act of 1933, with the exception of the Motor Car Act, 1903, which is being repealed by the Road Traffic Act of 1933 and the Workmen's Compensation (War Addition) Act, 1917, which is being repealed by the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1934.  With regard to some of the other measures a Bill dealing with the poor law position generally will shortly be introduced which will make unnecessary, it is hoped, the annual renewal of the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923.  A permanent measure to amend the Local Authorities (Combined Purchasing) Act, 1925, is also under consideration, and an Aliens Bill has been introduced.  With the exception of these three measures it is not considered necessary, at the moment, to introduce legislation of a permanent character in respect of the other Acts in the Schedules to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to ask the Minister whether the Government have any proposals under consideration to amend the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act of 1923.  Every Deputy who lives in the city and who is in any way familiar with the circumstances that exist in the cities and towns throughout the country will be aware of the fact that the unfortunate tenants who are condemned to live in slum dwellings are being exploited in a most inhuman and shameful manner by rapacious landlords.  A glaring example of the way in which they are being exploited by slum landlords has been afforded in this city where notices to quit have been served on people who have no means whatever, many of them applicants for unemployment assistance benefit which they have not yet received.  These unfortunate <Col N="389" /> people are compelled to live in filthy, insanitary slum dwellings. Their position is being used by slum landlords to wring out of the pockets of these unfortunate poor people the highest rents that it is possible to obtain from them.  The Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act provides no protection whatever for these unfortunate tenants.</P>
      <P>If the Minister for Justice has made any enquiries into the matter, those who have made the enquiries for him will, I think, have no hesitation in telling him that there are some tumbledown dwellinghouses in the city of Dublin from which rents of £200, £250, and £300 a year are being extracted from unfortunate people who are not able to buy bread for themselves or their dependants.  This Act gives a certain measure of protection to a tenant, but I think we should have some proposals from the Ministry to prevent these unfortunate people from being exploited in the bare-faced way that they are being exploited to-day. Those who live in these slum tenements have no protection under this Act.  These unfortunate tenants are entitled to expect that the Ministry, having regard to the exploitation which is being carried on in a most flagrant manner, would do something to deal with that very serious and growing problem.  Deputies representing constituencies in the City of Dublin, no matter on what side of the House they sit, are all well aware of the fact that these unfortunate people are being exploited.  We have got to put up with slums for another while, but I hope the Ministry will give some indication that they intend, at all events, to ensure that the slum landlord will not be allowed to squeeze those people in the present disgraceful manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion before the House is for the continuance of certain Acts.  The only legitimate amendment would be to move for the deletion of one or more of those Acts from the Schedule.  It is, I fear, customary in this annual discussion to allow a certain latitude as regards advocating the introduction of legislation to supersede these Acts. Deputies should not enter into a detailed discussion of the social conditions obtaining in Dublin or elsewhere; that would be out of order. I am prepared to hear the Lord Mayor, Deputy Byrne, briefly on the point he has raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Those matters have been raised before.  By letter, members of the Corporation have been promised that legislation would be introduced at an early date to remedy the complaints of tenement dwellers in Dublin.  One case was brought to my notice to-day in which a woman in receipt of 21/6 relief is asked to pay 15/- rent.  The House can imagine the rest, and see the need there is for immediate legislation.  The Corporation, I understand, have already been in touch with the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, and been informed that the matter is being attended to.  I would make an earnest appeal that the matter be speeded up, in order to save those scenes in the City of Dublin, where evictions are taking place because people in receipt of Poor Relief are not able to pay the high rents demanded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would receive a suggestion from me on this Bill in better part than he received the suggestions from Deputy Norton and Deputy the Lord Mayor. I would suggest to him and his colleagues in the Government that he should do away altogether with this institution of the Expiring Laws (Continuance) Bill.  It is a hardy annual&mdash; a sort of annual blister that comes up here, for which I never could see any reason.  There are something like <Col N="391" /> eleven statutes in the schedule, some of which will disappear very shortly, and I would suggest that the Minister and his colleagues should consider taking them all out of the schedule, and doing away with this institution of the Expiring Laws Bill altogether. From the point of view of practitioners, it is better that we should know whether the Bills are permanent or not, rather than be wondering as to whether they are going to be continued. I would, therefore, suggest that this unnecessary institution of an annual Expiring Laws Bill should be dropped altogether.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that when the Deputy was Attorney-General he had a good deal of responsibility for the wiping out of out-of-date laws and replacing them with up-to-date measures. His influence in the Cabinet would have helped in that direction if he had tendered that advice.  There is one satisfactory feature about this Bill, and that is that it contains a smaller number of measures to be extended than was included in similar Bills during previous years.  Deputy Norton raised a question, which he dealt with briefly, but in a sufficiently explanatory manner, for the purpose of trying to find out, for instance, from the Minister for Justice when he hopes to fulfil the promise made in this House to introduce a Town Tenants Bill.  Perhaps before the Bill is read a second time we may hear something from the Minister on the matter.  We hope to hear whether the Bill is actually in draft, whether any policy decisions have been taken by the Cabinet on the matter, when it is hoped to have the measure in operation, and, as a result of the passage of such measure, to remove some of the grievances complained of by Deputy Norton.  We have had <Col N="392" /> another promise more than once from the Minister for Local Government regarding the desirability of and the urgency for the introduction and passage of a Bill for the purchase of labourers' cottages.  Perhaps the Minister for Local Government will say something on the matter and take the House into his confidence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a Bill here which has a bearing on it&mdash;the Labourers (Ireland) Act, 1883.  I think, Sir, you will agree that that is the relic of old decency, and that it is time a progressive ministry would look into the out-of-date sections of that particular Act and make provision for the inclusion of the necessary sections of that Act in the Bill which the Minister has promised to introduce to enable the tenants of labourers' cottages to become owners of their own dwellings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Davin dealt very cogently with the criticism raised by Deputy Costello to the effect that a Bill of this sort should be dispensed with altogether.  I think the Deputy in his more responsible moments would not stand over that opinion, because if one looks at some of the measures here it will be realised that they are of a definitely experimental kind.  The combined purchasing Act was introduced as an experiment.  It is an experiment which required a number of years to work out, and in consequence of the experience which has been gained in the operation of the Act a permanent Bill is now going to be put on the Statute Book.  Others of these are measures which have worked fairly well, but which do not represent the considered opinion of the Government in regard to the matters to which they relate.  Take numbers one and two&mdash;the Parliamentary Elections Act, 1868, and the Corrupt Practices Commission Expenses Act, 1869; to evolve permanent measures would occupy the time of very valuable civil servants, <Col N="393" /> and Ministers who may not, in the opinion of the Deputy opposite, be as valuable as the civil servants.  Nevertheless an amount of the time of the Administration and of the Dáil would be taken up by the discussion and consideration of these matters, which would prevent more urgent problems&mdash; such as those to which Deputy Norton and the Lord Mayor have referred&mdash; from being dealt with.  It is for that reason&mdash;because those measures represent temporary expedients which are workable&mdash;that we come and ask the Dáil to renew them from year to year, pending the time when the Dáil and the Government will be able to give fuller consideration to the formulation of permanent measures.</P>
      <P>In regard to the question of the Labourers Act, 1883, I think I may say that the formulation of that scheme and the embodiment of the decisions of the Minister for Local Government in regard to it are at the present moment being proceeded with.  With regard to the question of dealing with the position of dwellers in slum tenements, investigations to ascertain what steps are necessary to secure a remedy for that problem are proceeding.  As Deputy Norton will know, and as the Lord Mayor will understand, I am sure, the matter is not a simple one. There are very many intricate problems to be examined and analysed, and on the basis of that analysis and examination it is hoped to formulate a scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion, when dealing with this Bill, I was <Col N="394" /> endeavouring to point out to the House what I conceived to be its real and true significance, and I was doing so because I felt, from the moment it was circulated, that it would give rise to considerable misconceptions as to the purpose and scope of the measure.  I pointed out that in my view, at all events, this Bill was nothing more or less than a Bill which was contemplated by Article 3 of the Constitution; that so far as its scope and effect are concerned, the Bill does nothing more than to provide for the matters which Article 3 of the Constitution contemplated should be provided for by legislation; that from 1922, when the Constitution came into force, a lot of work had been done in connection with the clearing up of difficulties surrounding the legal position as to our status in the community of nations known as the British Commonwealth of Nations, and that one of the subjects that had given most trouble was the subject matter of nationality.  I endeavoured to point out that this Bill does not really deal with the subject matter of Irish nationality at all; that it deals with something that is called Irish citizenship, which is something rather artificial.  That citizenship is the creation of Article 3 of the Constitution, brought into being to meet a very serious situation existing at that time, with a view to laying the ground for future development along the lines of the full recognition of Irish nationality.  The words &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; and &ldquo;citizenship&rdquo; in relation to international law are, I think, words that have only come into common use in connection with the subject matter of nationality in fairly recent times. It is rather inexact phraseology, from the point of view of public international law, to treat the subject of nationality as being the same as citizenship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In practice, I think the modern tendency is to assimilate the nomenclature of citizenship with that of nationality, but, in public international law, the real thing is nationality, and this Bill deals, in my view, with something which is not really nationality, and this Bill is <Col N="395" /> really not a Nationality Bill at all. It is the same kind of Bill that will be found to have been passed into law by the legislatures of Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. Of course the same provisions are not in the measures passed by those legislatures, but, in essence, it is the same matter.  It was pointed out at the Imperial Conferences of 1929 and 1930 that the position of the member States of the British Commonwealth of Nations, had become so well recognised in international relations that, from the point of view of those relations, it was necessary that each of the States forming the groups of these nations, should have their nationals properly defined, and that for certain juristic purposes and for the purpose of international law, Canadian nationality, South African nationality and Australian nationality were recognised as something different from the status which had hitherto been associated with the status known as a British subject or British nationality.  This Bill only deals with Irish citizenship, in the same way as Canada dealt with her nationals from the point of view of the Permanent Court of International Justice and the League of Nations, and from the point of view of general international law.</P>
    <P>I make these observations&mdash;not in any carping spirit of criticism&mdash; accepting the statement made by the President the other day in introducing the Bill, that it was not conceived in any Party spirit.  I make them merely for the purpose of elucidating what, in my opinion, is the true situation under this Bill; that the real problem that has to be solved has not been dealt with in the Bill at all. The real problem that has to be solved is being ignored so far as this Bill is concerned.  That problem requires solution, and in the solution of it the President and his colleagues in the Ministry would get all the support and all the help that we on this side of the House could give them as to the recognition of Irish nationality as an independent conception in public international law and the reconciliation of that separate Irish nationality <Col N="396" /> with the idea of common status hitherto associated with, for want of a better name, British nationality. We have no intention of giving up the idea of separate Irish nationality which springs from our sentiments as an independent race, from the full knowledge of our past history and our separate existence as a nation but, at the same time there are solid practical advantages to be got from our association with this group of independent states known as the British Commonwealth of Nations.  We can get those advantages by agreement with our fellow States in this community of States, and we can gain those practical advantages without in any way whittling down what some people may call, but which we do not call, our sentimental attachment to our Irish nationality.</P>
    <P>I realise that it is an exceedingly difficult task to persuade the old jurists, particularly in England, to give up their idea of one common nationality for the associated States. But it is a problem that can be solved, and that ought to be solved, and the President can rest assured that we on this side of the House would give him every assistance in the solution of that problem without in any way whittling down our national rights.  This Bill does not in any way affect the problem, and I think it is only right that should be recognised, because we will have the other problem to face so long as we are associated with the other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations.  We realise that if we were independent, whether under a republican or any other form of government, the problem would not exist.  While we are in the British Commonwealth of Nations we are there for severely practical purposes, to gain solid advantages for our people.  One of the advantages to be gained, and that ought to be gained, is the practical advantage that can be got by this reconciliation of our separate nationality with that of the common status hitherto associated with British nationality.</P>
    <P>This Bill, in my view, if it is passed into law in its present form, repealing, as it apparently intends to repeal, the <Col N="397" /> British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914, will leave the legal position from the point of view of international law entirely unchanged.  I would suggest that the introduction of that topic, the repeal of the Act of 1914, into this measure, was entirely unnecessary.  I have some reason to know the difficulties associated with ascertaining whether or not that Act is in force in this country or whether any portion of that Act is in force in this country, and the President will find, I think, from his advisers, that I have committed myself on that subject long before this.  I think there can be no doubt that certain portions of the Act of 1914 are not in operation in this country since the Treaty became law, but, on the other hand, it is equally certain that some sections of that Act were in force and carried over by Article 73 of the Constitution.  I do not think a question as to whether that Act, in whole or in part, is now or was at any time in force in this country is relevant to the subject matter of this Bill. We are not dealing in this Bill with British nationality in any shape or form.  We are dealing with citizenship created by Article 3 of the Constitution which co-existed with the idea of British nationality at the time of the passage into law of the Constitution. Consequently, I think that the introduction of the Act of 1914 was entirely irrelevant.  It ought not to have been introduced because not merely is it irrelevant but it is probably likely to cause some more friction between this country and our neighbour across the water which could have been avoided as it was unnecessary.</P>
    <P>I personally cannot see why this irrelevant topic was introduced into this Bill, but, having been introduced, if Section 28 of the Bill becomes law, so far as my view is concerned, at all events, even with the repeal of the Act of 1914, the position is practically unchanged, because for anybody born in this country, so long as we are legally bound by the Treaty and so long as we recognise the Treaty and live as we are living at the moment under the Treaty and the status given by that Treaty, the law remains as it was before and the President's advisers will tell him <Col N="398" /> what that was.  I put forward these views because I think that considerable misconception has arisen as to the scope of the Bill.  I repeat that this Bill deals only with local citizenship. I do not use the word &ldquo;local&rdquo; in any disparaging sense.  I use it in the same sense as the Canadian Parliament used the expression &ldquo;Canadian national&rdquo; when they passed their Nationality Act and in the same sense as the South African Parliament use the expression &ldquo;South African national&rdquo; when they passed their Nationality Act.  It has the very same significance as those and no more.  It does not deal with the vexed question of what is known as the common status.</P>
    <P>Most of the provisions of this Bill can, I think, be better dealt with on the Committee Stage.  I should have liked the President to have opened the case for some of these sections in a little more detail than in fact he did. I should have liked him to tell us some of the principles, if there are principles underlying certain sections of this Bill &mdash;or if it is merely expediency, we should like to know, because in a question of the acquisition or loss of nationality, it must be largely a matter of expediency and not principle.  I was interested to learn the President's and the Government's views on the subject of the effect of marriage on the loss or acquisition of nationality.  Apparently, the President was not inclined to follow the late Kevin O'Higgins's example. Mr. Kevin O'Higgins in the 1926 thought that by accepting the proposals which are now embodied in this Bill he would not be doing what he thought was right and, on the other hand, by refusing them he thought he would be offering himself, in the phrase he uttered in 1926, as a whole burnet offering to the women's organisations which were pressing for what they called reforms in the law of nationality as regards married women.  I think he also used the expression at that time that he was not prepared to set up national frontiers between husband and wife&mdash; apparently the President is&mdash;and he thought there was something inconsistent in the idea of separate nationality of husband and wife with the conception of Christian marriage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="399" /> These are all matters of opinion.  I do not think they are matters of principle at all, but I should have liked to have heard the justification for the proposals which are now embodied in the Bill.  I hope we will hear them more fully explained in the course of the Committee Stage of the Bill.  I personally have not any very strong views on the subject of whether or not a married woman takes the nationality of her husband on marriage, but I think it is relevant in this connection, and it leads me to another point I want to make on this Bill: there is nothing that causes more confusion in international law on the subject of nationality than the question of dual nationality.  I do not know, when this Bill is passed, how many nationalities it will be possible for people to have, at all events, in this country.  We shall have dual, treble and quadruple nationalities, assuming that citizenship under this Bill is equivalent to nationality.  Under the provisions of the Bill dealing with the acquisition of nationality by aliens, there is no provision that, when an alien comes over here and wishes to acquire citizenship, he has to abandon the nationality he had before, so that a German or a Russian or a Pole or an Italian can come over here for the purposes of his own&mdash;let us not enter into any discussion of what those purposes might be at any stage of the world's history&mdash;and acquire citizenship under this Bill and acquire it, let me remark, in parenthesis and in passing, without having any knowledge of Irish or English and still retain his own nationality. I think that is a matter which the President and his advisers ought seriously to consider&mdash;whether we should give facilities to foreigners to acquire the Irish citizenship which is conferred under the Constitution and in accordance with this Bill to people who come over here for purposes of their own and still allow them retain their own nationality.  There can be several forms of nationality vested in the one person under that arrangement.</P>
    <P>I do not know, under this Bill at the moment, what an alien is.  On the Order Paper there is an Aliens Bill which has been introduced but the text <Col N="400" /> of which has not been furnished to Deputies up to the moment.  There is no definition of an alien in this Bill, and, so far as I can recollect, the word &ldquo;alien&rdquo; in the Bill only occurs in one of the marginal notes to the Bill.  Is an Englishman, if this Bill is passed, an alien?  Is a Canadian an alien?  It may be that these matters will be dealt with under the Aliens Bill, but I think it would have been better, and this Bill could have been discussed with great knowledge of its effect, had the text of the Aliens Bill, which has been introduced, been circulated, and also had the text of the Constitution (Amendment) Bill which it is proposed to pass also been circulated, but as things stand at the moment, there is no definition of the word &ldquo;alien&rdquo; in this Bill.  We regulate the entry into this country of aliens under, I think, the Aliens Order of 1925, which was made under the Aliens Restrictions Acts of 1914 and 1919.  The Act of 1914 was in a sense a war measure, but its provisions were continued by the Act of 1919, and we adopted them by Article 73 of the Constitution and further recognised them by the making by the Executive Council of the Aliens Order of 1925.  It is that Order, made under these two Statutes, which regulates the status of aliens in this country and their entry into the country and exit from it compulsorily.  In that Order there is no definition of alien either. So that you are thrown back for a definition of alien to the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act, 1914, and that Act defines an alien as a person who is not a British subject. That is proposed to be repealed and we have no definition of an alien at the moment, as far as I can see, except whatever the dictionary meaning may be.  So that, under the Order of 1925, it may be&mdash;unless the point is dealt with and made clear by the proposed Aliens Bill, which we have not yet seen &mdash;that a person who is not a citizen of this State must be regarded as an alien; in which event a Welshman, a Scotchman, a Canadian or a South African must go to the immigration authorities and comply with the provisions of that Order of 1925.  I hope that <Col N="401" /> matter is dealt with in the Aliens Bill. As it stands, the difficulty is there.  I do not suppose it will be left there; but at the moment we have no idea as to what the position will be under it.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into detail through the very meticulous provisions of the various sections of this Bill. They will be dealt with on the Committee Stage.  So far as we are concerned, we will meet those in no spirit of hostile opposition.  The only attitude that we take up on the Bill is that we regret the Bill shows no advance on the position as created in 1922 by Article 3 of the Constitution.  That Article, as I said on the last occasion, enshrined within itself a novel conception of new Irish citizenship.  It was due to the genius of one man, I think, that that conception was embodied in that Article, and he and those who adopted the Constitution in 1922 looked, not to the creation of a mere local citizenship under that Article, but to laying the foundations on which, when the full significance of the Treaty would be realised and when, to use the current phrase, the last ounce had been got out of the Treaty, would be erected the solid edifice of Irish nationality.  This Bill, in our view, marks no advance on the 1922 position and entirely ignores the very solid achievements of the representatives of this country in 1929 and 1930 at the Imperial Conference.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Costello has raised a very practical objection to the continuance of this discussion at the present time owing to the absence of the text of the two Bills which are on the Order Paper, one dealing with aliens and the other with the amendment to Article 3 of the Constitution. We are to discuss the rights of citizens in this country, but I think we cannot do so with any degree of knowledge until we know what are the disabilities of being an alien, or what the definition of an alien will be. However, I think that difficulty can be overcome if the Government will undertake that the Committee Stage of this Bill will not be taken until we have had a discussion on the Second <Col N="402" /> Stage of the other two Bills which have been introduced.  Then we would be in a position to put down such amendments as would be useful in the light of the knowledge we would have from the other Bills.</P>
      <P>As far as the Bill itself is concerned, I have very frequently in this House during the last 12 years urged that such a Bill should be introduced.  Now that it has been introduced, I think that it is not very satisfactory. Already several definitions of Irish national have been given in other Bills.  I urged that there should be some uniformity in the matter and thought that that might be done in this Bill.  Unfortunately, this Bill far from removing that confusion does nothing but make confusion worse confounded.  A London Catholic paper&mdash;<i>The Tablet</i>&mdash;criticising this Bill in a recent issue&mdash;I may point out that <i>The Tablet</i> is perfectly entitled to do so, because this Bill does affect to some slight degree the status of great numbers of Catholics in the United Kingdom&mdash;referred to this Bill as being like the Archdeacon's egg.  I had not heard what the characteristics of the Archdeacon's egg were before, but I understand that what was the matter with it was that it was bad in parts.  As you go through this Bill, you find that that statement of <i>The Tablet</i> is fairly accurate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main objection to the Bill is with regard to the North.  The Dublin correspondent of the <i>Wexford People</i>, writing the week before last, referred to the fact that under this Bill in future the Irish people in the North are to be put in the same position as Turks, and I find that that is correct&mdash; that according to this Bill in future the young Turks of Tyrone and the dancing Dervishes of Derry will have to go on a pilgrimage to that Mecca of Irish nationality, Piccadilly Circus and, at the High Commissioner's office there, will have to have their names inscribed in order to obtain the benefits of Irish citizenship.  That, I think, is an unnecessary imposition to put on the people of Northern <Col N="403" /> Ireland.  Not only that, but in some cases the people of Northern Ireland, unlike the people of this country, will have to renounce their old citizenship if they wish to have the honorary position, or the future possible benefits, of citizenship of the Irish Free State.</P>
    <P>Under Article 3 of the Constitution it is laid down that Irish citizens are those who were domiciled in the area of jurisdiction of the Irish Free State on the 6th December, 1923.  It has since been held by the courts of this country, in a test case in County Donegal quite recently, that the area of jurisdiction of the Irish Free State at that exact date was undoubtedly the whole of Ireland. That is proved, I think, by Article 12 of the Treaty which refers to the fact that after an address from Northern Ireland had been presented the powers of the Parliament and Government of the Irish Free State shall no longer extend to Northern Ireland.  In other words, on the 6th December, 1922, they did extend to Northern Ireland, even if they were only suspended.  That view has been held, as I say, by the courts of this country.  So that, virtually, all the people in Northern Ireland are citizens of the Irish Free State, according to Article 3 of the Constitution.  That citizenship, however, in future will be, to a large extent, discontinued because of the extra provisions brought in in Section 2 of this Bill.  We find that in future they will have, first of all, as I say, to go on a pilgrimage to London to have their names registered in the High Commissioner's office and then some of these national-born citizens of Saorstát Eireann will have to renounce their local citizenship in Northern Ireland if they wish to obtain citizenship of the Irish Free State.  That is the position which is to be imposed upon the people of this country with regard to their dual nationality at the present time.</P>
    <P>The Bill is contradictory and will need very careful amendment.  The definitions of nationality which have appeared in other Bills are what is known as contradictory.  Speaking <Col N="404" /> only a few months ago in the Seanad, the Minister for Industry and Commerce suggested&mdash;in fact, promised&mdash; that this Bill would remove those confusions and contradictions.  He said, as reported in page 470, vol. 19 (No. 2):&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In a sense Senator Douglas answered Senator Robinson when he pointed out that there is no Nationality Act in operation here. Leave to introduce such a Bill has been granted already in the Dáil and it is probable that it will be taken in the Dáil during the coming Session.  When that Bill becomes law, it will alter the position in relation to this Bill considerably, because, presumably, it will provide machinery by which persons can become Nationals of Saorstát Eireann and, therefore, become entitled to the rights enjoyed by Nationals of Saorstát Eireann, in which case all existing legislation will have to be examined with a view to ensuring that there will be no conflict between the terms of the existing Acts and the terms of the Nationality Act when it is passed. That is a matter which, I think, we can leave over until the Nationality Act is passed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, we find that this is not a Nationality Act but a Citizenship Act. We received some extraordinary definitions of &ldquo;nationals&rdquo; in these other Acts.  We find one definition in the Control of Manufactures Act&mdash;a person who at the present time and for not less than five consecutive years immediately preceding that time has been ordinarily resident in Saorstát Eireann. That is one definition in the Control of Manufactures Act.  The Minister for Agriculture came forward and made a special contribution and gave a definition of &ldquo;national&rdquo; in the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Act of 1933. There he based citizenship on the matriarchal system which existed in the Polynesian Islands, where the title to nationality was acquired on the mother's and not on the father's side. The definition in the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Act, 1933, is &ldquo;a person born outside the Saorstát or the area now comprised in Saorstát Eireann <Col N="405" /> whose mother at the time of his birth was ordinarily resident in Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are contradictory definitions and they are in no way removed by the new definition which we are asked to deal with in this Bill.  This Bill only tends to create more confusion where there was already considerable confusion. I would urge that we should not proceed with this Bill or take it to the Committee Stage until we have the full text of the other Bills on the Order Paper before us.  Something should be done to preserve the right to citizenship at this stage to the people in Northern Ireland.  There are considerable difficulties put in the way of people in Northern Ireland from carrying on business in this State.  Even in this Bill, if a person should be naturalised in so far as becoming a citizen is concerned, it is provided that in any case in which an agreement is made between the two Governments with regard to mutual concessions of citizenship rights, that those shall not include the right to carry on business as provided for in the Control of Manufactures Act.  That is an extra disadvantage for the people of Northern Ireland.  I think it is for us to say that the rights in this matter which they have hitherto enjoyed should be preserved or restored to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>On listening to the three speeches that have been made from the Opposition, I have been able to come only to one conclusion and that is that those speakers did not read the Bill at all.  I was listening to Deputy Costello for some time the last evening and I have listened to him again this evening, and even now I find it difficult to find out what he has been driving at, because I cannot characterise what he has been driving at except in that particular way.  What is he driving at?  Surely it should be possible for him to put in precise terms and not in the vague language he used, his ideas, if he has any ideas, on this subject.  Everyone of the statements that have been made with respect to what this Bill will not do and what it will do will be proved on the Committee Stage to have been <Col N="406" /> groundless.  These statements are due, doubtless, to careless reading&mdash;if there has been any reading of this Bill-by the Deputies who have spoken.</P>
      <P>Take Article 3 of the Constitution. In the vague talk that I have heard from the Opposition, there is a constant suggestion that there is some going back in this Bill, some diminution of status or some diminution of principles in those who are to be regarded as our citizens.  Everyone who is affected by Article 3 realises that this Bill gives them all the rights and privileges which are accorded by that Article.  I hope that is clear&mdash; that there is no touching in any way of anybody who has come in as a citizen under Article 3.  Article 3 has been spoken of as if there were some wonderful wide basis underlying it.  What is it?  Deputy McGilligan seemed to suggest that there was an idea that citizenship could descend here through either parent.  Nothing of the kind. The sole principle underlying Article 3 was that of local citizenship and domicile on a particular date.  Those who were domiciled within the area of the jurisdiction of the Free State on the 6th December, 1922, and only those domiciled were entitled to be regarded as citizens.  The man who was born in this country and who had left the country could not be a citizen if he were not domiciled here in this country on the 6th December, 1922&mdash;that is, the person who was born&mdash;not to speak of the person whose father or mother was born&mdash;in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Article 3 of the Constitution, those who got citizenship rights were a restricted class of those who were domiciled in the State at that date.  As that Article did not include everybody who happened to be domiciled here, those who were included were classified under a couple of headings&mdash;those domiciled at the time in the State who were born in Ireland or either of whose parents was born in Ireland and those who had a certain residential qualification, having been here for seven years. What is the use of anybody pretending that that was a wide or wonderful basis of citizenship?  Is it not clear that it was based on domicile alone and not on descent through either parent? <Col N="407" /> Further, that citizenship was confined to the area of jurisdiction.  It could operate only within the area of jurisdiction. It was a local citizenship.  As I pointed out in my introductory Second Reading speech, one of the things we are now doing is improving that position to the extent that we are making that citizenship apply extra-territorially.  Not merely are we not depriving any Article 3 citizens of their rights but we are extending those rights and extending Article 3 itself by the Constitution Bill.  Since that is the fact, what is the use of anybody on the opposite benches getting up and pretending, by suggestion, that we are somehow or other contracting Irish citizenship?</P>
    <P>The same remarks apply to what has been said about citizenship and nationality.  The Deputy who spoke in this way did not condescend to tell us what the difference is between citizenship and nationality.  As I understand it, citizenship is a precise legal term. Nationality is a loose term.  Is it derogating from the nationality or status of United States citizens that they should be so termed instead of being described as &ldquo;nationals&rdquo;?  In the United States, I think, you will find that this matter is governed by citizenship and naturalization Acts. You will also find that the terms &ldquo;citizenship&rdquo; and &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; are used in the Acts of many counttries&mdash;Portugal, Hungary, Switzerland and others.  In fact, if I were to try to segregate the countries and ascertain those in which the term &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; is used, I should find that the countries in which that term is used are, in the main, republican countries.  Even that would be too narrow a class.  What is Deputy Costello driving at when he suggests that somehow we are not carrying out in this Bill the general idea of Irish nationality?  Does he mean to suggest that, when passed, this measure will not have extra-territorial effect?  He has suggested that this Bill will have purely local application.  That is all nonsense.  Wherever Irish citizens exist they will be Irish nationals by our law, and the general agreement amongst nations is that the citizenship <Col N="408" /> of person shall be defined by the law of their own country. I have an idea of what the Deputy was driving at, and we shall come to it more logically at a later stage.  It should not have been brought in directly in connection with this Bill, because it does not, in any way, influence the application of this measure.  Quite a different order of ideas arises in connection with that point, and it should not be used here to suggest that this Bill, in itself, is lacking in any way.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion on which we discussed this Bill, Deputy McGilligan wanted to know what were the anomalies which the measure would remove.  I had stated that the Bill would get rid of certain anomalies, and I pointed out some of the anomalies. The Deputy wanted to make light of these anomalies by suggesting that the measure was not necessary in connection with our fisheries at the moment, because they are not of very great consequence, and that it was not necessary for aviation and so forth. As the Deputy did ask me what the anomalies were, I repeat that they are anomalies directly due to this wonderful Article 3.  Surely it is an anomaly that a person who was born in this country and who did not happen to be domiciled here on the 6th December, 1922, could not be regarded, and was not regarded, as a citizen of this State. That should certainly be regarded as an anomaly by those on the opposite benches who have such a broad idea of what nationality should consist of and what the rights accorded to people born in this country should be.  Is it not an anomaly that a child born here since 1922 could not be regarded, even for the purpose of this Article, and is not defined as, an Irish citizen? Surely these are anomalies that should be removed.</P>
    <P>There are other reasons, which I did not mention, why it is advisable that this Act should be passed.  We are entering into trade treaties of one kind or another by virtue of which citizens of other countries may be accorded rights here in consideration of similar rights being accorded to citizens of our country.  For that purpose it is necessary that it should <Col N="409" /> be clear who is a citizen of our country. We may be entering into extradition treaties.  They are necessary.  If we are to have a treaty of that kind with another country, is it not perfectly clear that we should know who are and who are not our citizens?  Deputy McGilligan expressed regret that I had not said something as to what we wanted our citizens abroad to be.  Can there be any doubt about it?  We want those who, by our law, are our citizens to regard themselves as our citizens and not as the citizens of any other country.  Deputies will find in the Bill, I think, that anybody who adopts the citizenship of any other country will lose our citizenship.  That brings me to one of those foolish questions foolishly put by Deputy Costello.  He spoke of quadruple nationality.  Anybody who reads the Bill will see that one of the things definitely sought is to avoid that multiple nationality which is a nuisance and is regarded as such internationally.</P>
    <P>To get rid of some of these consequences you had that, amongst other objects, dealt with at the Hague Conference, If you want the principles of this Bill, and if you look through it, you will find them.  And one of the principles, apart from definitely defining who are our citizens and who are not, is based upon the idea of having a single nationality as far as possible. The idea of common nationality for the family is made easy by this Bill as far as our own country is concerned, and as far as we could effect it outside it is also made easy; so that you have running through the Bill the idea of avoiding the international confusion caused by multiple nationalities, though it cannot altogether be avoided, and there is no use, under present conditions, trying altogether to avoid it. For instance, it was not the desire to work in accordance with the existing principle of nationality, through descent through the mother, because it is obviously going to create multiple nationality in the existing stage of international law.  The idea of equality of the sexes, in so far as that was concerned with the other ideas also running through the Bill, was that if you want to see that principle you have <Col N="410" /> only to read the Bill, and you will find the objections suggested are not based at all really upon the terms of the Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy McGilligan's question as to what we want our citizens abroad to be, we say definitely we are enabling them to be regarded internationally as citizens of our own country and nothing else so far as our laws can provide for that.  Deputy McGilligan suggested that we left some loophole, or made some special provision, such as left our citizens in Britain to be regarded as British subjects.  We do nothing of the kind.  We are not able to take Acts off the British Statute Book.  We are not able to prevent the British from calling our citizens British subjects.  But I take it, if there is any substance at all in the principles that have been agreed upon at some of the Commonwealth Conferences, that when this Bill becomes law it would be an impertinence if they were to claim as citizens of their country people who are obviously citizens of another country; otherwise all the principles agreed upon at the Commonwealth Conferences would go by the board.  I hope, therefore, we have made ourselves quite clear upon this question of British subjects.  Under Irish law, no Irish citizen will be a British subject when this Act is passed. If somebody else chooses to regard our citizens as his, we will take no cognisance whatever of it as far as our law and legal system is concerned. And as I say, if they were to continue that, after this Act was passed, it would be acting contrary to the principles initiated at previous Imperial Conferences. I might say this Bill is designed to give effect, in the only way effect could be given, to those principles: and so far as it is possible to reconcile our independent rights with that association, or the independent rights of other States in the British Commonwealth, with the idea of association, then, this Bill does that.</P>
    <P>Lest I should be misunderstood, at this stage, I want to say that not a single line of this Bill need be altered if a Republic were declared in Ireland to-morrow.  It is, therefore, quite consistent with the existing position.  The terms of this Bill need not be altered, <Col N="411" /> in a single particular, if to-morrow a Republic was declared here for the whole of Ireland.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the point raised by Deputy Esmonde: What is the position of Irishmen and women born in the Six Counties.  We cannot, by Act here, get over definite political barriers.  We are not able to legislate, with any hope that our legislation would be effective, for that part of our country which is cut off.  That is something which cannot be dealt with by a Bill like this, but this Bill would not have to be changed if that fact were got over.  The existing position is this: That as the area of jurisdiction of the Free State on 6th December, 1922, has been judicially declared to be the whole of this island, so all those who were domiciled in this country on that date, became by Article 3 our citizens and retain all the rights they got by that Article. Being Irish citizens, their children will in the first generation be automatically citizens and it is only the generation after them that would have anything like the difficulties which have been suggested by Deputy Esmonde.  It is my hope, at any rate, that before that time is reached, and before many will have to take the line of action that has been suggested by Deputy Esmonde, the barriers between the two parts of this country will have disappeared. This Bill, when it becomes an Act, certainly will not have done anything to prevent a person from being regarded as a citizen who would otherwise be regarded as such.</P>
    <P>I said that we were giving effect in this Bill, in the only practical way in which effect can be given, to the principles of equality that were referred to in these Imperial Conferences.  It is by reciprocal action of this kind&mdash;by the type of action that is indicated in this Bill&mdash;that you can get common recognition of some closer relation than exists between completely independent States or, perhaps I should say unassociated rather than independent States. What you have in this Bill is this: You say that there are certain States at present with which we are associated; they are prepared to give our citizens <Col N="412" /> rights because of that association, and we are prepared to give them back equal rights.  If, by the laws of the countries in question, our citizens enjoy in these countries any special rights, then, by an order of the Executive Council, the citizens of these countries will enjoy similar rights in our country. That is action between equals&mdash;real action between equals&mdash;and I repeat that it is the only way in which that mutual recognition can be given effect to without interfering with the sovereign rights of the individual States.</P>
    <P>I hope that I will have, in the Committee Stage, an opportunity of going more fully into these matters.  I can only touch on the mere surface of them now, and I am touching on them largely to dispel the misrepresentation that will arise from the speeches that have been delivered against the Bill.  We have been brought to task, too, for having this clause with reference to the repeal of the 1914 Act.  What is the complaint? Deputy Costello has referred to an order that was made here, in which it was necessary to refer back to one of these Acts for the definition of an alien.  Now, I know that it can be strongly held, and probably the more correct view is, that these Acts did not apply here; but there was certain action that seemed to suggest that they apply here, and lawyers differ just as doctors differ and judges differ.  Our business here as a legislature is to make it so plain that there cannot be any difference of opinion, and, if there is any suggestion of difference of opinion, to resolve it and to resolve it definitely.  What we have said is: It is not necessary for us to go deeply into the question or to get a decision&mdash;if we could get a definite decision on the matter&mdash;it is not necessary for us and we have enough of necessary work to do without involving ourselves in unnecessary work.  I would not ask even the law advisers to give me advice on that matter because, as long as I was aware that there were two different views and that there were prominent people holding those different views, then I say that we have the power here to resolve it and we are going to resolve it by saying, whatever view is <Col N="413" /> held, then in either of the cases this thing disappears.  Whether it was gone or not gone, we take the action, in so far as it was deemed by anybody to have reference to this country, it disappears. Clearly, that is the common sense and the right way of doing it.</P>

      <P>If I may be permitted to interrupt the President for a moment, I should like to say that a few moments ago the President made a remark which, if I caught it correctly, seems to me of very great importance. He said that after the passing of this Bill it would be an impertinence for the British to go on claiming any Irish national as a British subject.  I think it would have been better if that statement had been made when the President was speaking at an earlier stage, so that the discussion might have taken note of it.  I interpret that remark as an invitation to the British Government to deprive Irish nationals of the status of British subjects.  Now, the terms of the Bill in themselves are unobjectionable from that point of view, or seem to me to be unobjectionable, and I merely want to intervene to make it clear that in not voting against the Second Reading of this Bill the Opposition do not associate themselves with the view that it is desirable that the British Government should deprive any Irish national of the privileges that go with British citizenship.</P>

That view was contested by our predecessors, and we had to wait till they <Col N="414" /> were in Opposition for Deputy Costello to make the suggestion he made on the last occasion.  It was denied and contested at conference after conference, that the question of common status was reducible to this question of being British subjects.  If there is to be a common status, it is simply the common status due to association, and to that fact without going behind it to anything else.  It is the privileges as far as we are concerned&mdash;common status distinguished from the privileges and the rights and the obligations, if you will, of that association&mdash;nothing more.</P>

      <P>Well, it does not matter. What I say is that the Oath of Allegiance is a different thing altogether. That does not say that I accepted the matter of allegiance any more than the oath.  I have indicated, therefore, the lines on which we are <Col N="415" /> prepared to give effect, and on which we have given effect, to the principles that were enunciated, and agreed upon so far as that was concerned, of equality, mutual respect, and reciprocal rights.  With regard to the women's position, it has been suggested by the Opposition that we could go into it more fully.  I am prepared to accept that, and to leave that matter over to closer examination on the Committee Stage.  But I say now that it is one of the principles underlying this Bill to give equality of the sexes in this matter of nationality provided that that is not going to introduce further elements of confusion into the international position with regard to nationality.</P>
      <P>We wanted as far as we could&mdash;and indeed it is a pioneer measure in that regard&mdash;to try to work on the line which was likely to be the line discovered at the Hague, the line by which the existing confusion could best be avoided, and to avoid as far as possible the creation of multiple nationality. That, together with the principle of equality of the sexes in the matter is the principle underlying this Bill.  I think that what I have said will be sufficient to clear up some of the misconceptions that might possibly arise from the statements made by the Opposition.  The truth of what I have said will be apparent in the detailed examination of these sections one by one.  I shall simply repeat this, that this is the widest expression that can be given under existing circumstances to the idea of Irish citizenship and Irish nationality.  I have said, on the question of the word &ldquo;citizenship&rdquo; instead of nationality, that we are using the precise legal term that is found in the code of other countries and in the Constitution itself.  Next I have said that the Bill implements, in the only way in which it can genuinely be implemented, the principle of equality and reciprocal treatment which is fundamental in the principles laid down at the Imperial Conference.  Finally, I say that not a single line of this Bill need be altered if a Republic were declared in the morning.</P>

      <P>I move: That the Bill be read a Second Time.  The draft Convention, concerning the marking of the weight of heavy packages transported by vessels, was adopted by the twelfth of the International Labour Conferences held in Geneva in 1929.  The Convention was ratified by the Government of the Saorstát on the 5th July, 1930.  It did not, however, come into operation until the 9th March, 1932, the date upon which the ratification of the requisite number of States, members of the International Labour Organisation, was registered with the Secretary-General of the League of Nations.  The Convention has now been ratified by a large number of States and it is necessary that we should introduce here the requisite legislation in order to meet our obligations arising from our ratification of the Convention.  The Bill is designed for that purpose.  It prohibits the loading into any ship, barge or any other vessel for transport by sea or inland waterway from a port or other place in the Saorstát, any package the gross weight of which equals or exceeds a metric ton unless the true gross weight of such package is plainly and durably marked on the outside of such package when such package is so loaded.  If the transport by sea commences outside the Saorstát, it will still be illegal to export a package of a metric ton or over unless the true gross weight is plainly and durably marked on the outside.  If it is not reasonably practicable to ascertain the exact gross weight of a package, a statement of the approximate gross weight will be required.  Any person, who by himself or his servant or agent consigns such package for transport by sea or inland waterway, will be guilty of an offence and will be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £10, unless the provisions of the Bill are observed.  The offence may be prosecuted by or at the suit of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main design of the Convention was, of course, to secure a measure of security for all persons employed as <Col N="418" /> dock labourers.  The Convention has not been ratified by every country, and it may happen that packages on which the gross weight will not be marked and which will be handled by dockers in the Saorstát, may be consigned by countries which have not ratified the Convention.  The obligations of the Saorstát under the Convention are met, however, if we provide that every such package consigned from the Saorstát is so marked, and the purpose of the Bill is to do that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be remembered that this amendment was moved on the Committee Stage but withdrawn upon certain objections being raised by Deputy McGilligan, that it was not necessary to provide against the making of a letting of a fishery to which Article 11 of the Constitution applied with provision for renewal, and in view of the provisions of the Bill that permit of the making of a letting of a fishery purchased by the Board under this Act with the provision for renewal subject <Col N="419" /> to the consent of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance.  I have reproduced the amendment in the original form because the Article of the Constitution referred to does, in fact, prohibit the making of a letting of State property with a provision of renewal.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 7, before Section 14 (3), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3) When the price to be paid by the Board for a fishery or fishing right is being assessed in pursuance of this section and it is shown to the satisfaction of the arbitrator that the owner of such fishery or fishing right or a person entitled to a portion of such price by virtue of his having an estate or interest in such fishery or fishing right worked such fishery or exercised such fishing right personally by his own skill and labour and that the profits derived from such working or exercise formed the whole or a substantial part of the livelihood of such owner or person, the arbitrator shall add to and include in the price so payable to such owner or to the portion thereof so payable to such person (as the case may be), as assessed under the provisions of this Act other than this sub-section, such sum as appears to the arbitrator to be a reasonable compensation for the whole or partial (as the case may be) loss of livelihood suffered by such owner or person in consequence of the acquisition of such fishery or fishing right by the Board, regard being had to the likelihood of such owner or person being able, in the circumstances of his case, to transfer his skill and labour to some other profitable occupation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the amendment which I indicated on the Committee Stage would be introduced although at that time I stated that it would form part of Section 23 instead of Section 14.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that, where the owners of a fishery or of a fishing right operate the fishery or exercise the fishing right themselves by their own labour, and, by doing so, <Col N="420" /> have earned a livelihood, that they should receive, in addition to the price of the fishery as ascertained by the arbitrator under the Acquisition of Lands Act, compensation for the loss of livelihood, taking into account the possibility of their being able to transfer their skill and knowledge to some other profitable occupation.  This, of course, is the amendment designed to meet the particular case of the Abbey fishermen who have fishing rights and own certain fisheries on the fresh waters of the Shannon.  In the case of other fishery owners they will receive the compensation assessed by the arbitrator in accordance with the regulations under the Acquisition of Lands Act and with that compensation they can, in theory, if they so wish, remain fishery owners by acquiring fishery rights elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Abbey fishermen are not in that position.  They are a community of people who have exercised this right of fishing in the Shannon over a long number of years, and merely to give the present members of that community the present value of their fisheries would be inequitable. Consequently, it is proposed to supplement the compensation which they will receive by another sum to be determined by the arbitrator, a sum which will take into account again the fact that the members of that community are losing their means of livelihood, and that it will not be practicable for them to transfer themselves to some other river and there exercise their skill as fishermen.  They will, presumably, have to seek occupation in some other walk of life for which their training as fishermen will be of no particular advantage, and, consequently, it is proposed to give them this extra compensation.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that another amendment, amendment No. 4, affects Section 23.  Section 23 will operate and make it illegal for any person to fish with a net on the fresh waters of the Shannon, with certain exceptions.  It is proposed to permit the right of net fishing to continue in the case of any person who has been lawfully exercising such a right for the 12 months previous to the passing of the Act.  That will mean <Col N="421" /> that there will not be a cessation of net fishing on the Shannon immediately the Bill becomes law, as would otherwise be the case, and that such persons will continue to exercise their right to fish on the stretches of the Shannon under their control until such time as their fishery rights have been acquired by the Electricity Supply Board and until the compensation, both in respect of the value of the property and in respect of the disturbance that will take place provided for in this amendment has been determined and awarded.  The main purpose of the amendment is, I may say, to give consideration to the sympathetic claim which the members of that particular community have over and above the purely legal claim which other fishery owners can put forward.</P>

I suggested that I would produce an amendment requiring that such order should be approved of by the Dáil before coming into effect.  The actual amendment that I am introducing goes a bit further.  It provides that the weekly close season, now 48 hours, which can be increased to 72 hours, can be altered by the Minister for Agriculture by order, but not so as to decrease it below 48 hours or to increase it above 72 hours.  If it is found necessary at any stage to increase the weekly close season beyond 72 hours, then it will be necessary to introduce fresh legislation.</P>

    <P>This is the amendment to which I made reference when dealing with amendment No. 2.

      <P>The position is, of course, that certain people have the right to fish with nets on the Shannon. There may be people fishing with nets who have no authority whatever from the owners of fishery rights there, but this Bill makes it illegal for any person to fish with nets except such persons as have been legally exercising such a right during the past 12 months.  The onus of proof is on such persons to show that they have a legal right to fish with nets if any question of a prosecution should arise.  The main purpose of the amendment is to enable the Abbey fishermen to continue to exercise their fishing rights until such time as the Electricity Supply Board is in a position to take them over.</P>

    <P>It is considered that this amendment is necessary in order to avoid the possibility of the scheme becoming inoperative if the Minister could only vary the number of members of the council as specified in the request, and if he disagreed with the terms of the request, a deadlock would probably <Col N="425" /> be reached and the scheme would become ineffective.  It is considered that it would be an improvement in the Bill to give the Minister discretionary power to fix the number of members. It is anticipated that there will not be any difficulty.

      <P>I should like to draw the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to some peculiarities in our present system in Cork, which, if the Bill is allowed to pass in its present form, might create some hardships and some injustice.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows that in Cork County at the present time we have three separate and independent boards of assistance and one county board of health, with three health committees for the northern, southern and western portions of the county.  The secretary of the county board of health is the secretary of the county council.  While he is officially the secretary of the county board of health, I have in mind the fact that the principal executive work of the county board of health is discharged by an official who is a deputy to the secretary of the county board of health&mdash;Mr. Wrenne.  He is responsible for the executive side of the county board of health work.  Looking over the Bill as it stands at the present time, having regard to the fact that the staff for the three boards of health would appear to be contained in the officials who work the various committees of the board of health at present, I am afraid his case might be easily forgotten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there would be any desire on the part of the Department to do so.  The official concerned is a most excellent man.  There might be one or two cases of a similar kind in the county, but this one is certainly outstanding.  I should be very glad if the Parliamentary Secretary had an opportunity of looking into the matter, between this and the next stage, to see if there would be a possibility of agreement on an amendment which would clear up the position which might be embodied in the Bill at the next stage. I am sorry I had not an opportunity of speaking to the Parliamentary Secretary about the matter, but I was <Col N="429" /> reminded of it to-day when I read the Bill more closely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Very much of what I should like to say in connection with this motion I had an opportunity of saying on the Relief Estimate which was discussed last week. Perhaps it would be useful to go over some of the points that were made on that occasion because they have more special relation to the motion now before the House than to the particular Estimate that was discussed last week, inasmuch as this motion covers a much wider field than the more restricted field which that Estimate afforded for discussing matters of this kind.  In our opinion one of the great difficulties of the present situation is that we have not got relief for unemployment throughout or practised in the big way which the situation demands at present.  Our complaint is that in regard to the situation with which we are faced at present, and the difficulty and dislocation which a certain struggle has involved for the people, the methods that ought ordinarily to be employed to combat that dislocation and hardship are not employed and that mere Votes for relief schemes generally promoted by the Office of Public Works will not of their own solve this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggested last week, and I again commend it to the attention of the Executive Council, that in this entire connection a very much wider field must be travelled than appears to have been travelled so far.  I suggest again that one of the most obvious remedies for the present position would be that the Government should examine the possibilities of embarking on a big national scheme of direct labour.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to discuss with the Minister for Local Government and the principal <Col N="432" /> officials of that Department the advisability of issuing a circular to all local authorities in the country indicating that in future grants out of the Road Fund will only be payable if all roads under the control of local authorities are worked by direct labour.  I suggest that the very same condition should apply to all public health works and at a time when public health works would be getting immediate consideration, I earnestly suggest that public health works generally should be approved of conditional on local authorities being willing to carry out such works by direct labour.  I believe that would mean a substantial increase in employment on works of that kind because once the work was carried out under that principle, there would be no obstacle in the way of employing the maximum number of men at a standard rate of wages.  Unfortunately the execution of public health works &mdash;water supply schemes and sewerage works&mdash;carried on at present under the contract system means, very often, a smaller number of men employed at a smaller wage.</P>
    <P>This principle also, I suggest, should be extended to the work of erecting labourers' cottages in the country generally and in relation to town or urban housing schemes.  This principle is the only efficient method of obtaining the maximum amount of unemployable labour for the execution of such schemes and we should have a gradual elimination of the contract system on all public works with a view to increasing the amount of labour employable on such works.  I suggest that the principle should also be extended to the operations of the Office of Public Works generally and that in regard to the erection of all public buildings&mdash;schools, barracks for the Gárda Síochána, etc.&mdash;this principle should be agreed to and work should be conditional on the adoption of the direct labour principle in connection with all such works and, furthermore, that in the very big and very useful scheme for the development of the hospitals of the country, with which the Parliamentary Secretary is associated, grants out of the <Col N="433" /> Hospitals Trust Fund should be made available on condition that the hospitals had their work carried out in this manner.  The employment of an efficient engineer and clerk of works, with the necessary skilled and unskilled labour for a scheme of this kind, will permit of the employment of a very large number of extra hands and the whole position would be improved very considerably if the principle was adopted.</P>
    <P>Of course, there are at the moment difficulties in the way of putting that principle into force.  Inter-departmental regulations, the procedure adopted hitherto and the reluctance there always is to establishing precedents in a matter of this kind provide difficulties, but I suggest that at the present time, when our unemployment situation is very bad and when we are really living in the midst of a war situation and in a war time, even if it is not a military war, the old methods, useful enough in another situation, will not in themselves serve to meet the situation.  My complaint is that, in a war situation, we are using methods that are not at all efficient or up-to-date enough for dealing with the dislocation which that situation has caused in one way or another.  I suggest also that the Department of Industry and Commerce should make a complete and thorough survey at the earliest possible date with a view to seeing how far the policy of the Minister for decentralising industry can be usefully carried out in the country.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is aware that every other day members of local authorities and enterprising citizens in various towns and villages, which have received so far none of the benefits of the industrial revival and change that is taking place, are clamouring for information and assistance in this respect.  Very often, there is a good deal of money available locally for a suitable scheme and, very often, there is not the technical knowledge or advice available locally for the purpose of forwarding the suitable scheme.  I have in mind a number of cases of the kind myself and I feel <Col N="434" /> that if the machinery of the Department of Industry and Commerce could be made available to a much greater extent locally, for the consideration of what would be the most suitable method of giving some of the industrial benefits of the present revival to the smaller areas in the country, very much more useful employment would thereby be provided.</P>
    <P>I think also it would be very useful if the Department responsible&mdash;the Department of Local Government&mdash; would consider the advisability of asking local authorities to embark on schemes of work on their own.  Local authorities sometimes, at one period in the year, are good enough to promote schemes, fostered by members of local authorities, which are described as new works.  Unfortunately, local authorities within the last 12 months in certain areas were inclined to reject all proposals of that kind and I suggest that the Department of Local Government should press local authorities to get ahead with schemes of that kind, and make loans available for the purpose of enabling local authorities to execute such works on a more extensive scale than has been possible hitherto. Very much can be done in that direction. One has only to go into some of the small villages and towns, particularly the smaller seaside places, to see very big opportunities for brightening and improving such places at a comparatively small cost; such as the improving of pathways, small marine works and the approaches to certain places used by tourists and holiday visitors in the lesser known but not less beautiful seaside spots in the country.  These would afford not alone an opportunity for very useful employment but an opportunity for doing what is very urgently required in brightening, cleaning up and improving, in the up-to-date fashion necessary at the present time if holiday visitors are to be attracted to our seaside places, the amenities of such places.  I trust that that expression of opinion will have consideration in a comparatively short time at the hands of the Department responsible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="435" /> I should also like in this connection to press the Parliamentary Secretary for some definite step towards introducing a Bill for the amendment of the Small Dwellings Act.  That would encourage housing activity very considerably particularly in the county I come from.  The Small Dwellings Act as it stands enables local authorities to give loans but, unfortunately, the position is that loans are only obtainable after long and weary searches into title and the payment of substantial law costs.  In my opinion, and I think in the opinion of the Department these could and ought to be obviated by the introduction of such a measure.  The passage into law of that measure and the ability of a number of people who contemplate housing activities of one kind or another to obtain loans for the purpose will stimulate housing activities in the rural areas in a manner which will be very desirable and useful both from the point of view of the health of the people generally and the amount of employment that will be available as a result.</P>
    <P>The whole position in regard to unemployment at a present is very far from satisfactory.  I put forward these suggestions in the hope that they will be considered with a view to embarking on works that will follow as the result of the adoption of the principles I have mentioned and which will, in addition, secure that where works are started the maximum amount of labour is put into employment on such works.  I think the House does not need convincing that the present position in regard to unemployment is a grave and serious one and I suggest that a motion of this kind, asking for new and up-to-date measures for a national scheme of reconstruction to meet the present situation, is one that ought to commend itself to the House as a whole.</P>

I have in mind a prominent seaside place in the County Waterford where at present people are hesitating about the building of houses because there is not an adequate water supply in the district.  I had a letter the other day from a prominent merchant, for instance, who was anxious to build a house in that place. He tells me that he cannot build the house unless he is promised an adequate supply of water.  He pointed out that the building of this house and the building of several others which he was sure would follow, would give a considerable amount of employment, apart from adding to the amenities of the seaside resort.  I think schemes such as that would be well worth the attention of the Local Government Department.  If we are to look after the health of the people it would be rather peculiar if, when they went to a seaside place to benefit their health, their health was actually to suffer as the result of an inadequate water supply or sewerage.  That is likely to occur in a place such as I have indicated, because there is absolutely no sewerage in it and practically no water supply.  That is only one of many cases throughout the country.  I think it would be one of the best ways of relieving unemployment, if men could be diverted to work such as that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the work done on minor roads at present under the minor relief schemes.  In a few years' time I am afraid that that will prove to be of practically no effect.  These roads are being repaired all over the country but no provision is made for their maintenance. The result is that at present many of them which were repaired two years ago are already deteriorating seriously for want of a very little attention.  Work of that nature is all right to relieve the present serious unemployment, but it would be far better if we could put men on work that would be of a more permanent nature. Take forestry, for instance.  Forestry is a thing that, once properly done, well repays the expenditure in a comparatively few years' time.  In addition to the present afforestation <Col N="437" /> schemes, it would be a good idea if the attention of the Forestry Department were drawn to this fact.  In the old days of the clearances many landlords cleared tenants off good arable land and planted the land with trees.  I think it would be a good idea if that policy were reversed now.  This is a suggestion which may not meet with general approval.  I may be accused of desecrating the countryside.  I think, however, that that land should be cleared.  I think that every stick of timber planted on good land should be cleared and utilised, and that land not suitable for agriculture should be extensively planted.  The clearing of that land, if the matter were properly taken up by those interested in woodworking, could be made to confer a double benefit.  The clearing of the land itself will give employment and the utilisation of the timber so cleared would give additional employment.</P>
    <P>At the moment we are importing a considerable amount of wooden containers. Practically all our butter boxes and egg and poultry cases are imported.  Of course it will be said that our native timber is not suitable for these things.  Properly matured, some of the native timber is quite suitable for poultry and egg cases.  I think beech could be utilised in the making of butter boxes.  If I am not mistaken, beech is used extensively in the Australian butter trade.  It is not very easy to nail, I understand, but the Australians have overcome that difficulty by using wire fastenings.  If that were done here a lot of the timber to which I am referring could be utilised for that purpose when felled.  We have a considerable amount of beech in this country.  I know that in my own district we have a vast amount of it.  At one time it gave employment to a large number of men&mdash;probably 40 men in a small district.  It was used for the manufacture of clog soles for the Lancashire factory workers.  That industry, unfortunately, has died out.  If we could divert the use of beech for the purpose I have indicated it would create an industry in the neighbourhood and provide employment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy referred to the fact that very often local authorities are not <Col N="438" /> in a position to avail of opportunities. I agree.  Efficient industry has died out in this country.  As a matter of fact we were nothing but an agricultural country throughout the nineteenth century.  Many of our people were unable to get work while others of our people who were willing to invest money in industry did not know what to do.  Men have told me that if they were given £100,000 they would not know what to do with it.  If the Department of Industry and Commerce would make out a list of small industries that could be run on a small capital, it would be possible that in a comparatively small town or village sufficient people could be got to initiate a small industry.</P>
    <P>We cannot expect to have large factories in every small town and village in the country.  It would be better to have small factories which would give employment to a number of people in the small towns and villages.  All over the world to-day there is an outcry against mass production and factory conditions.  We are told by humanitarians everywhere that we must smash the conditions obtaining at present in vast industrial areas.  It is pointed out that it is those industrial areas that have created the slum problem.  These have brought vast numbers of people into small areas where the people are herded together.  That is really how the slum problem has been created.</P>
    <P>If we are to have industrial development in this country it would be far better that we should not copy the bad old methods that obtained in industrialism during the nineteenth century. Our aim should be to have industries scattered all over the country where people could live in much healthier surroundings and where the living conditions would be better.  These are the lines on which we should go.  Even if it were possible to have great mass production factories at the present moment all over the country it would be better that we proceed on other lines.  All over the country at the present moment there is a great cry for the starting of factories.</P>
    <P>People are misled by the idea that large-scale factories can be planted in every town in the country.  That idea <Col N="439" /> is a mistaken one.  It cannot be done. Even if it could be done it is a debatable point whether it would mean advisable to do it for it would mean going back to the conditions that obtained in the industrial world throughout the nineteenth century, conditions which created the slum problem. These conditions would again create a slum problem notwithstanding all that has been done in recent times to eradicate the slum evil.  If we go back to the idea of mass production here in the City of Dublin the houses that have been built will inevitably become slums again.</P>
    <P>As one deeply interested in the smaller towns in the country, I think it is no harm that I should call attention to the decay of the small towns.  The change in agricultural conditions has affected these towns very much.  The growth of the creamery industry killed the manufacture of home-made butter.  The inevitable change that has taken place has militated entirely against the smaller towns.  It is therefore necessary that we should make some effort to bring back some measure of prosperity to those communities. Those of us who live in small towns and who remember what they were a few years ago realise that the decay in these rural communities is particularly distressing.  Many of our young, intelligent, educated people to-day find, it impossible to get employment.  One has only to look at the list of candidates who sit for the various Civil Service examinations from time to time to know how bad the position is. They will realise how difficult it is for young people to get employment when they see thousands of candidates sitting for 100 or 200 vacancies.  The majority of these candidates are intelligent and fairly educated.  It is a pity really to find such material going waste.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to lay down hard and fast rules as to what we should do in this matter, but I think we should make some effort to start rural industries so as to provide employment as widely as we possibly can, and thus give our people a healthier form of employment than could be got in the <Col N="440" /> large mass production factories that grew up during the nineteenth century.  The problem is so difficult that one sometimes almost despairs of solving it.  But we are not the only people in the world that are facing this problem.  Practically every country in the world is up against it.</P>
    <P>We in Ireland are, however, in a happier position than other nations. We are not an industrial country.  We are only making a start in the industrial line, and if we make the start on right lines now we can go on and solve that problem.  I think it would be very inadvisable indeed to go back to anything like the conditions that prevailed in the nineteenth century.  To-day, when people talk of starting industries, they always think of large industries conducted on the lines on which mass production was carried out in the past, whereby vast numbers of people were employed.  If it were possible to avoid it we should not go on these lines.</P>
    <P>To a great extent we are catering for our own people.  We are not looking so much to compete in export trade with other countries.  It would be far better if we would provide a means by which the young people in our own rural areas could be set to work in small productive units and not aim at concentrating them in large industries in one particular area.  If we go in for those large industries we will inevitably drive our people again into slum dwellings.  We must make every effort to avoid that.</P>
    <P>People tell us that it would be far better to have our people working than that they should be drawing the dole and unemployed.  I agree that it would.  There is a good deal of work that could be done in such schemes as land reclamation.  We are told time and again that a good deal of the land is going to waste for want of drainage. Land that at one time produced good crops is now practically useless owing to its being water-logged.  Then again the division of land is going on very slowly.  The men who work with their own families on good land can make a decent living, but men who are endeavouring to make a living in small farms on the hillsides are right up <Col N="441" /> against it.  I have not much sympathy with the man living on good land in the heart of the country and near a railway station.  Such men are in a position to avail of the new agricultural programme.  But the men on the hillsides where the land is poor and who have not made available to them the benefits that might be got from such things as beet-growing, for instance, are in a position of great difficulty. Many of these men have large families and now, when their children are not able, as in former times, to emigrate to America, their sons and daughters remain on the farm and find it very difficult to make a living.  The position with which these people are confronted is very serious.  They find it very hard to eke out a livelihood.</P>

      <P>While one does not agree with the attitude of the Opposition in so far as the figures of unemployment are concerned, one cannot get away from the fact that a large number of our people are at the moment unemployed.  It must be recognised, of course, that a great number of people are at present signing the unemployment register because of the fact that there are certain advantages to be got through the medium of the Labour Exchanges.  At the same time, a large number of our people are unemployed. We expect the Government to put into operation the promises they so repeatedly made to do something to help the unemployed.  A great many works, neglected up to the present, could be taken in hands by the Government. We find that all over the country second-class roads have been very badly neglected.  A great deal of attention has been given to the trunk and main roads, but the second-class road and the by-road used by the farmer have been, to a great extent, neglected. The trunk and main roads are second to none, but I suggest that the Government should embark upon the task of reconstructing the by-roads and those other roads used by the farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Party has frequently made its protest regarding the number of juveniles engaged in industry.  I do not think that the Government can <Col N="442" /> deny that a great many of the new industries have employed a number of boys and girls, while their fathers are idle.  I suggest that the Government should, as speedily as possible, enact the long-promised Factories Act, which would enable them to regulate the employment of young people.  There is very little use in industry in this or any other country if it is to be used only for the employment of boys and girls while their fathers are idle.  I ask the Government to make a special effort, between now and Christmas, to deal with the appeals of people who have made application under the Unemployment Assistance Act.  One finds it hard to understand how certain decisions are arrived at in assessing the means of the different applicants.  We have made frequent representations to the Government with a view to ascertaining how these means are assessed, but we have got very little satisfaction. I understand that at present about 18,000 appeals are being considered by the Committee in charge of the Unemployment Assistance Act, and I do not think it is too much to ask that between now and christmas special officers should be allocated to this work.  A large number of people who, it will be generally admitted, are entitled to benefit, are, because of some little bit of red tape, being prevented from getting that benefit.</P>
    <P>Certain flaws in the Unemployment Assistance Act require attention.  For instance, if a person works three days in any week, that person has to sign again for 14 days before being entitled to benefit.  That has been responsible in a great many cases for people endeavouring to avoid work.  A man does not like to take on a job for three days for which he will be paid at the rate of 12/- or 15/- a week when, as a consequence, he will lose 30/- during the following fortnight.  I suggest that the Government should do something immediately to get away from that state of affairs.  If drainage received more attention from the Government, it would give a good deal of much needed employment.  That is a species of work in which labour accounts for practically 100 per cent. of the expenditure.  Very <Col N="443" /> little is required in the way of material, and work of that kind would absorb a great number of the unemployed in the rural areas.  It is in the rural areas and provincial towns that unemployment is being felt most keenly.  A great many of the factories established have been established in cities like Dublin and Cork.  The smaller provincial towns have received very little attention so far as the establishment of industries is concerned.  If any overtures or representations are made to the Government in future, in regard to the establishing of new industries, I suggest that the Government should persuade those interested to establish them in the smaller provincial towns.  It is very inadvisable to centralise industry in cities like Dublin or Cork.  I should like to stress the point as to the necessity for dealing with the unemployment problem.  It is a problem which confronts every Government at present. That it is not easy to solve, we are prepared to admit.  At the same time, a good deal could be done by the Government to alleviate the distress which, undoubtedly, prevails amongst our people by starting certain works which have been recommended by members of this Party.  A great many people made application for unemployment assistance as far back as March, April and May, and, up to now, they have not heard anything about their application. That is a very lax state of affairs, and it should not have been beyond the power of the Government to devise some means whereby these people's claims would have been attended to long before now.  Again, I appeal to the Government to set up some special tribunal so that the claims of these people will be got through before the Christmas holidays.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan Mr. P. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Clare): I should like to have the unemployment problem considered in terms of human beings and not in terms of columns of digits and curved lines on coloured paper. It does not matter whether the number of people unemployed be 10,000, 20,000, 50,000 or 80,000, it is clear that there are sufficient unemployed to cause anxiety to any Government or any <Col N="444" /> State and to justify serious consideration by every civic-minded person within the State.  We must not put forward columns of figures to prove any pet theory.  We must take it that there is sufficient unemployment to cause anxiety.  A good deal of play has been made regarding the Government plan for the relief of unemployment. If I may say so, the Government policy at the present time reveals itself to me as something like a picture, in which we have the background of industrial revival painted in by the Minister for Industry and Commerce with some touches here and there by the Minister for Agriculture. No doubt, if Deputy McGilligan were here he would tell me that the background is highly coloured; but, whether highly coloured or not, it is a background capable of throwing into relief a great many industrial possibilities capable of being developed. We have that industrial background, and in the foreground, we have a Cubist design by Deputy Flinn, in the shape of minor relief schemes and accommodation roads for Monamuiche, and minor drainage schemes for Gurthahaibhne.  These things, while very useful in their way, and while they may be very necessary in emergencies, give one the idea that there is no middle distance to merge into the background and the foreground of the Government policy. The Government policy of industrial revival, while very good, and while having great possibilities and probabilities, and while the designs of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance are also likely to bridge over difficulties and emergencies, there appears to be no definite idea between the present emergency schemes and the industrial revival which we are all so anxious to see a success.  It is with a view to trying to show how we might provide that middle distance for the Government that I rise to speak at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know, at the present time, notwithstanding all the efforts of the Government to provide them, that there is a big need for greater and better social services than we had.  In any present estimate there are something <Col N="445" /> like 40,000 houses needed in the Irish Free State.  We know that the vast majority of these will have to be built by the local authorities.  Let me indicate in what fashion the local authorities are going about building these houses.  I know one administrative county area where 1,000 houses need to be built.  It is probably two years since this scheme was started. At the present time there are 40 houses in the course of construction in this district.  How soon, at this rate of progress, are the 1,000 houses in that area to be constructed and completed for the people?  How soon, in these rural slums, and in these town slums will the local authorities have built 1,000 houses for people to occupy? Deputy Corry says 25 years.  I should think it would be nearer to 40.  Are we going to continue to expect local authorities to build these houses?</P>
    <P>Let us take another very necessary social service in demand at the moment, namely, sanitation.  Dozens of towns and villages at the present time are in need of consideration in regard to matters of sanitation.  The local authorities are expected to initiate these schemes and to see them carried out.  Water supplies are needed and road services, also, have been mentioned.  For the roads of the country there is no uniform standard of construction.  We have roads in one county different in standard from roads in another county, while county roads themselves and other important roads in various districts get no consideration. There are various social services demanding attention&mdash;housing, sanitation, water supplies and schools. If we expect the local authorities to carry out and complete all these schemes we will have to wait a very long time.  At the rate of progress they are making at the present moment the amenities they are expected to provide will not be completed for the next half century.  I suggest to the Government they should take their courage in both hands and where local authorities are not providing these schemes, such as erecting the necessary houses and providing sanitation and proper water schemes, and schools and roads, they should <Col N="446" /> do it themselves.  They should make the roads of a standard type and they should undertake the supply of the necessary sanitation, water, schools and road construction.  I suggest that would supply the middle distance between the minor relief schemes in the foreground and the industrial revival in the background.  Probably Deputy Corry will tell me that that is revolutionary.  But the Government, or the Minister for Agriculture pulled up by the roots a system that was steeped in the minds and habits of the people, if not in tradition, and substituted in favour of it something which was undoubtedly better and calculated to give more employment and wealth to the State.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, also, has substituted a system by which instead of distributing other people's goods, we are, in this country, manufacturing our goods.  Surely Ministers who were prepared to take their courage in their hands regarding these schemes, ought not to be afraid to take their courage in their hands in order to provide the minimum of social services necessary in this country.  That is what I am asking for.  I am asking the Government, in the matter of housing, sanitation, water supplies, schools and roads to take their courage in both their hands and to provide these necessary amenities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry will no doubt ask what share the local authorities have to supply.  They will, of course, have to supply their share of the expenses of these schemes.  But the Government has it in its hands to withhold grants to the local bodies and to subsidise their works out of such grants if necessary. These are the schemes I want the Government to take into consideration. At present roads built under minor relief schemes rarely have no useful direction; you get nowhere with them.  You cannot continue making roads to bogs and such places indefinitely. I am putting a suggestion as to the minimum of social services that are necessary.</P>
    <P>With regard to some of the schemes in operation at the moment, I desire to call attention to the system in connection with applications for unemployment <Col N="447" /> assistance.  I do not dwell upon this matter from the aspect of the slowness of the consideration given. There are about 20,000 applications being considered by the Appeals Committee. I think it would be reasonable to say that 50 per cent. of these are entitled to unemployment assistance. But you have the consideration that many of these people are not entitled to work on minor relief schemes because they are receiving unemployment assistance.  They are not drawing unemployment assistance and they are not getting free food, so that you have 20,000 of those people in need, at the moment, of attention.  I put these two aspects of the matter to the Government and I suggest to them that here they should find a means of bridging over the time between the operation of minor relief schemes and the accomplishment of the industrial revival upon which the Government has embarked.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee) Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the House to consider the exact terms of this Motion.  If it does, I think it will agree with me that it is of a somewhat piebald character. The main purpose is to secure an endorsement of the principle that, so far as possible, unemployment should be relieved by the provision of work rather than by the subsidisation of idleness.  This principle, in fact, has already been accepted by the Government and, in order to give effect to it a Committee of the most experienced administrators we have has been set up under the Chairmanship of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Hugo Flinn, with the following terms of reference: To consider the extent to which it is practicable to devise a scheme of useful and desirable public works with a view to reducing expenditure on unemployment assistance to a minimum, and to report upon the nature and extent of such works, the steps to be taken to initiate them, the best method of financing them, and the organisation to be set up to carry them on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Committee has been hard at work since its inception and has already covered a considerable part of <Col N="448" /> the ground to be surveyed.  When its labours are completed I feel that we shall have for the first time in the history of this country a reliable presentation of our unemployment and poverty problem, and not merely this, but a definitely formulated programme for its amelioration.  As I have said, the Government have already accepted what I think is the real purpose of the resolution&mdash;to ensure that, so far as possible, a programme of public works will be formulated to provide relief for the unemployed.  If the resolution had been phrased in terms to embody that principle alone, I do not think that this House would have felt called upon to debate it at any great length.  Unfortunately, however, not merely is the House asked to accept the principle of publicly provided employment for the unemployed, but we are also asked to assent to the view that there is continued widespread unemployment; with this implication: that the unemployed elements in the population represent an increasing proportion thereof.</P>
    <P>I think that members of the Dáil who have listened to the speeches of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and of the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Flinn, in regard to this matter, will agree in the opinion that the unemployed are a diminishing proportion of our increasing population.  If that be so, then I think that the terms upon which the Resolution is based could not be generally accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>The resolution only says &ldquo;widespread.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Furthermore, the resolution asks the Dáil to instruct the Executive Council to make available forthwith sufficient money to permit the carrying out of large schemes of public works.  The House should note the word &ldquo;forthwith,&rdquo; because, in my view, and I am sure that every practical man in the House will agree with me, the acceptance of the word &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; by the Dáil would impose upon the Executive Council a task which is, in present circumstances, impossible of fulfilment.  If we were to take this word and the rest of the resolution at its face value, we must <Col N="449" /> assume that the sums to be provided must be sufficiently large to provide continuous employment for every man-jack who is at the moment unemployed or who is caused to be unemployed in the future, and we must also assume that these sums must be expended forthwith in such employment.  That, I think, is the meaning of the terms of the resolution in their more general connotation.  If that meaning be objected to, it has to be pointed out that the resolution is vague in every regard except in regard to the time in which the money has to be provided. It has to be provided forthwith.  If, however, it is admitted that it would be impossible to provide immediately sufficient money to enable everybody to be put in employment at once, and that the resolution is to be read in the narrower sense that some large scale public works should be undertaken to provide employment, then it can be pointed out that the Government has, in fact, undertaken such works already. This year we are spending £4,500,000 on the provision of houses.  We are responsible for an expenditure of £1,500,000 on sugar beet schemes and of over £500,000 on the deepening of Loughs Derg and Allen.  All of these are large scale public works&mdash;all financed by the Government or through the Government or under the Government's aegis, and they are all for providing work for people who would otherwise be unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that to indicate to the House that there is no conflict of view between the Government and our friends of the Labour Party as to the way in which it is most desirable that this problem of the distressed conditions of the unemployed should be dealt with. Having said that, I think that I am entitled to assume that what the movers of the resolution had in mind when it was put down is that the Government should formulate a programme of large scale public works calculated to relieve the distress due to unemployment and should take steps to carry out that programme.  As I have indicated already, a Government committee is hard at work upon that task, and that job is not an easy one. As a preliminary step to doing anything <Col N="450" /> we have to ascertain what is the real nature and extent of unemployment. It would be only facile to say that whatever knowledge we might have as to the real nature of the problem, its extent was fairly indicated by the published figures for the live register from week to week.  As the Minister for Industry and Commerce has pointed out already, this figure is not a record of the number of people unemployed, but of the number of people seeking employment, and these, I suggest, are very different things. The figure for the present live register, undoubtedly, gives an exaggerated idea of the extent to which poverty and distress consequent upon unemployment exist.  In considering the figures we have to remember that it covers many persons who are not genuinely seeking employment, but have registered in the hope of securing unemployment assistance by concealing their true means.  It contains also many others who are in possession of land and other property and who have means of subsistence other than wage earnings.  Furthermore, I have no doubt that it includes, also, many persons who are already employed, but who are seeking for work which would appeal to them more than their present jobs.  Lastly, I think it will have to be conceded that it contains many people who, for one reason or another, are unfit to work and who, under any scheme of public works, would be unemployable.</P>
    <P>However, in formulating such large scale public works as this resolution advocates, we must ascertain, first of all, the approximate number of people belonging to each of these four characters. This figure has hitherto not been available.  In the 11 years in which the State has been in existence, no comprehensive attempt has been made to analyse the live register and to place the individuals thereon in the categories to which they properly belong. The Inter-Departmental Committee, to which I have already referred, is making a searching investigation of the live register and is asking those people whose names appear upon it to facilitate them in the task.  For this purpose a questionnaire is being prepared which <Col N="451" /> will be circulated, I think, in the middle of next month to all those who are in receipt of unemployment assistance. As a result of the replies to this, it is hoped that we shall have very detailed information about the age, normal occupation, location and other circumstances of the people who are unemployed.  As I have already said, in seeking a way to ameliorate the position of the unemployed, we must know, not merely the extent of the unemployment, but its real nature, and it is hoped that the information obtained through the questionnaire will assist us in our investigations in that regard and will enable us to satisfy ourselves whether unemployment, in the acute form in which it is now manifesting itself throughout the world, is going to be a permanent feature or merely a passing phase of our present social organisation here.</P>
    <P>There are some authorities, as the House well knows, who hold that the intensification of the unemployment problem is inseparably associated with the mechanisation of industry.  There are others who do not agree with this view, and who say that the mechanisation of industry does not, on the whole, create unemployment, but merely changes the form of existing employment, converting unskilled and laborious occupations into skilled and less fatiguing work.  There are some who, while inclining to the view that the mechanisation of industry creates unemployment, regard the prevalence of that evil as mankind's reaction to overwork and hope to cure it by enforcing greater leisure upon us all.</P>
    <P>Long term measures for the amelioration of the condition of the unemployed must be determined largely by whichever of these views is believed in the end to be correct.</P>
    <P>In this connection, might I express my regret that those who have spoken in favour of the resolution have not taken the opportunity to prove that, taking all the factors into consideration, the means suggested in the resolution are the best that can be devised for the relief of distress?  They have assumed that there was agreement on that point, and while they may not be <Col N="452" /> incorrect in that assumption, nevertheless, I think they would have been discharging a public service if, in their speeches, they had given that aspect of the matter the full consideration it deserves, because it has to be remembered that it is not the only way in which the problem of social distress arising out of unemployment may be dealt with.  There are others, and each of them has its advocates in this country as elsewhere.</P>
    <P>For instance, some people hold that one effective way of relieving that distress is to impose restrictions on the growth of employable labour by discouraging immigration.  If one were to take a detached and philosophical view of this matter and to consider that suggested solution in the light of historical fact, it is questionable whether, in the long run, such restriction does, in fact, tend to reduce unemployment. New countries, undeveloped countries, underpopulated countries, have a great deal to gain by permitting the entrance of new blood.  We have only to look at the part played by our own people in building up the United States of America, the Commonwealth of Australia and the Dominion of Canada, to realise that immigration is not an unmixed evil.  However, when there is no longer a free movement of peoples and when barriers are raised elsewhere against our people, we have no option but to retaliate here and to preserve for our own whatever opportunities of livelihood there may be in this country.</P>
    <P>We may also relieve social distress due to unemployment by the simple expedient of throwing on one side the public works solution altogether and by providing maintenance only.  It is, in the view of many, the cheapest solution and the easiest to administer, but it has from many points of view great, almost conclusive disadvantages. It leads, I believe, to a great deal of social deterioration; it encourages the work-shy to avoid all possibilities of work; and in the long run it tends to render the unemployed unemployable.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned that there are some people who hold that the growth <Col N="453" /> of unemployment in the world is due to the increasing mechanisation of labour forces.  So strongly convinced are some people of this that their remedy would be completely to derationalise industry and agriculture so as to increase the manual labour content in all processes and by increasing the sheer toil of production, find a remedy for the idleness which unemployment imposes.  It may be that in a certain limited way, and in some rather specialised occupations, a little would be gained if machinery were to be replaced by manual labour, but, on the whole, I feel that the destined road for humanity does not lie in that direction.  I believe that this process, if carried too far, will result in a drastically reduced standard of living and worsened industrial conditions, because primitive agriculture and primitive industrial organisation cannot support modern social services and modern State institutions.  Other methods of providing employment should, therefore, be considered.  Much can be done in the way of creating opportunities for employment by fostering and protecting home industry. The Government has already done a good deal in this way by means of tariffs and quotas.  But even the Government's efforts in that direction can largely be reinforced by a strong public opinion which demands that, as far as possible, only goods of Irish manufacture should be used or worn. That public opinion should have its reaction and its complement in a determination, on the part of those who have secured and enjoyed protection for their industries in their own market, to enter with enthusiasm and a certain civic spirit, overlooking the narrow point of view of self-interest, into the task of providing everything we need to meet our requirements here.</P>
    <P>Then, apart altogether from restricting immigration, some steps might be taken to secure a constriction in the volume of employable labour.  We could, for instance, retard the entry of young persons into employment, and, by raising the school-leaving age, compel them to better equip themselves for the business of life.  But, here <Col N="454" /> again many considerations have to be taken into account.  In many families it would be no easy matter to defer the time at which young people begin to earn.  In some industries, industrialists and tradesmen generally will be disposed to argue that it is essential for those who propose to take them up to enter young.  Then, again, the cost to the State by way of increased expenditure on school buildings, on the teaching and staffing due to the raising of the school-leaving age, would not be inconsiderable.  As this would be an annual cost it would represent an increase in taxation which, possibly, might call in certain circumstances for reduced expenditure in other directions in order to obviate them.  Furthermore, it is probable that employers would have to pay proportionately higher wages to later entrants, and thus the cost of production would increase, a feature to which serious consideration would have to be given in connection with whatever export industries we have.</P>
    <P>I mention these things merely to show that even restricting the entrance of young people into employment cannot be undertaken without a certain amount of investigation and examination, and in fact I may say that such an investigation is at the moment going on.  Then, again, at the other end of the scale of life we could offer inducements to elderly persons to retire from work, and in this connection something has already been done by the provision of old age pensions. It might be argued that not enough has been done here, but in this connection we have to remember that elderly persons form a very large proportion of our population, larger than in most countries, and that the actual cost of old age pensions here is higher than in other countries.  If any further steps were taken in this connection I feel it could only be done by means of contributory schemes and I am not at all certain that its effect in reducing unemployment would be as great as might be expected. Then, again, we might endeavour to induce certain classes of women to give up employment and put them in a position to give their attention to <Col N="455" /> their family responsibilities.  The Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Bill which is now being prepared, and which we hope shortly to introduce, will do this so far as widows are concerned.</P>
    <P>A suggestion which was made in the course of the debate was that we should reduce working hours in industry. Even if we allow for the possibility of increased production principally consequent upon the diminution of the fatigue effect, it is clear that a reduction of working hours must result either in an increase in wages cost or a decrease in the <i>per capita</i> wage earned.  If wages are to be retained at their present weekly level there must be an all-round increase in prices and, therefore, a reduction in real money income, but the advantage of a reduction in working hours is that it spreads more equitably over the whole community the burden of maintaining the unemployed.  I feel myself that a reduction in working hours is bound to come, and that more and more we should take advantage of the improvements in industrial processes, in methods of transport and in the development of civilisation generally and the rest, not in the form of increased money income but in the form of increased leisure.  All these expedients will have to be carefully examined and their effects considered, but when they are, and when many others have been applied, there will still remain a problem to be dealt with.  As to the size of that problem we have to remember that at any time the hard core of unemployment is not equivalent to the number of persons who are unemployed.</P>
    <P>We all know that there are certain industries and trades which are seasonal, where, owing to natural conditions of climate and the rest, occupation and employment must be more or less intermittent.  Then there are large scale constructional industries on which employment cannot be continuous and constant.  If a large project, the construction of a railway, the completion of the Shannon scheme &mdash; any one of a number of jobs which Deputies can visualise for themselves&mdash;is completed, <Col N="456" /> it requires a certain period of time to wind everything up and to get ready plans for a new project.  The fact of the matter is this, that it seems to me that the complex organisation of labour in modern industry necessitates the maintenance of a certain reserve, and these people, the people who find their occupation mainly in seasonal industries and trades and those who are engaged in large constructional works, are not likely to be provided for in large scale public works, because large scale public works are like the large scale constructional works: they must be continuous.  We cannot start them to-day, interrupt them to-morrow, and resume progress on them a week or a fortnight hence.  They have to be carried on in many cases when the weather will facilitate the execution of the works: that is to say, at the time when those engaged in the seasonal trades are busiest.  Then, again, people who are temporarily unemployed will not offer themselves for employment on large scale works at a distance or where the work is of a nature to which they are not accustomed.  When making every allowance for the fact that there are people engaged in this way who will have temporary spells of idleness and again are put into intermittent employment, there will still remain the hard core of people who are unemployed. How is that hard core constituted?  It consists of all classes: the clerical worker, the professional man, the skilled tradesman and the unskilled labourer, all classes, all ages, all kinds, all trades, all grades, living in all parts of the country and enjoying all conditions of physique.  We cannot take this heterogeneous body of men and regiment them and compel them each to do his allotted part in any large scale undertaking and, therefore, we have to consider how we are going to employ all these people on public works.  The moment we begin to consider that new difficulties arise, because if the works are to have any effect on employment they must be in addition to, and not in substitution for, the existing work of the community.  There is no use in putting a shoemaker to compete against existing shoemakers or market gardeners against market gardeners.  Constructional <Col N="457" /> works must be of a type that do not ordinarily come on the market and compete with the existing supply, and this brings us face to face with a problem of the immobility of labour in the Free State.  This is one of the problems that those of us who are trying to formulate a scheme of public works, which will meet the requirements, I think, of those who moved the resolution, are going to be up against.  That immobility exists both in relation to trades and to localities.  As long as unemployment was regarded as a temporary problem it was natural to agree that an effort should be made to provide employment of a type suited to the trades of the unemployed in the localities where they existed.  If we adopt a long term policy in regard to this matter, then I think that we shall have to be met in some way by those who are responsible for the organisation of labour in this country.  They will have to recognise that modern methods of industry have rendered a number of trades obsolete, with the consequent addition of a number of people to the permanent ranks of the unemployed.  Certain trade union restrictions as to apprenticeship, and the provision of similar types of work as between the various trades, increase cost, diminish efficiency, and are inconsistent with a national policy pledged to abolish unemployment.  In a number of cases, for instance, the change in the condition and development of transport alone is tending to render certain urban areas superfluous, and unemployment is likely to be permanent there.</P>
    <P>As an example of the immobility of labour I could cite the case of stone cutting.  In the modern world, with the new methods of monolithic construction, stone cutting, except for decorative purposes, is tending to disappear completely.  Normally, one would say that the people who have been engaged in that trade&mdash;masons and others&mdash;should be allowed to turn their hands to something else.  One of the things which we should have to deal with when we are initiating a programme of large scale public works here will be what we are going to do with the skilled tradesman who has been thrown out of his job because constructional <Col N="458" /> and manufacturing methods have changed since he was a boy.  Are we going to employ him merely as an unskilled labourer, or are we going to give him a tradesman's wages and employ him at some other trade akin to that to which he was apprenticed, and in which the manual skill which he has acquired in his own trade would be capable of better utilisation than if he were condemned to labour in an unskilled capacity?</P>
    <P>I am merely going over those matters to show that this problem of public relief works is not an easy one of solution. Of the works which have been suggested here, take for example, drainage works.  We have heard a lot of talk about large scale arterial drainage schemes.  The unfortunate fact about large scale arterial schemes is that their labour content is excessively small.  I know of one scheme which has been under consideration, costing, I think, something over £90,000, and it would not give employment to 150 men for six months. Of course, it might be said, that, after all, that is the primary labour content; that even if only 150 men are directly employed in that job nevertheless a considerable additional number might be employed in making machinery, and so on, but the unfortunate fact is that the machinery which is utilised on those large scale arterial drainage schemes is all imported into this country and does not give any secondary employment at all.  Drainage is a very special engineering problem in this country.  We have a rather cup-shaped country which is difficult to drain.  Possibly, because of this difficulty to drain, it has been a very fertile country, rich in herbage and all that, due to the moisture contained in the soil.  If we start to drain this country in the same way as some other lands have been drained it may be that we will lose a great deal of pasture land which is valuable to-day, because it cannot be over-looked that undrained soil is a very efficient natural reservoir for moisture, and that possibly it has tided the farmer over many a dry spell.</P>
    <P>The question of demolition has been raised.  That seems to be one of the easiest jobs we could tackle.  I have <Col N="459" /> often heard it said: &ldquo;Why not set all the unemployed men to pulling down the ruined buildings which disfigure most of our towns?&rdquo; I think if you ask any person who has been on a local authority which has tackled that job he will tell you that it has turned out to be a most complicated business.  It is only when you start to pull down one of those old shacks that you begin to find out the number of people who have claims and rights, and are determined to assert ownership of it.  This question of carrying out widespread demolitions through the country would mean an amendment of the law, and would require a considerable amount of investigation before it could be undertaken as a large scale public work to be continually carried out as absorbing such unemployed as may offer themselves for it.  Bog development was mentioned.  We are giving the utmost attention to that matter from every point of view; first of all, to try to utilise this huge natural resource which is available to us, and which has hitherto been undeveloped; secondly, to provide relief for the areas where poverty is chronic; and, thirdly, to give a certain amount of relief to those who otherwise would be unemployed.</P>
    <P>In regard to schools, we have considerably increased the grant for schools, but there again other difficulties arise.  It is not easy to design schools for all the manifold situations in which they are placed in this country.  The staff or architects in that regard is somewhat limited.  The Board of Works is working at top pressure in regard to schools, but already, I think, more grants have been sanctioned than we are able to provide plans for.  Water supply schemes and public health works generally have also received the attention of the Government. We have provided a special subhead in Minor Relief Schemes this year for that purpose.  There again we are up against the fact that you cannot execute those works until proper plans have been prepared.  The number of people who are competent to prepare such plans in this country, and I am <Col N="460" /> afraid the number of people who in certain circumstances desire public health schemes, are somewhat limited.</P>
    <P>May I say that I have read through all this debate, and the one thing that I would plead for in connection with suggestions for public health schemes is that we should have a little more imagination.  Things have been suggested which are, in the main, being carried out.  They are the sort of works to which every Government has had recourse more or less in the past. If we had the co-operation of civic minded individuals everywhere, who would look around to see what good might be done in their own localities, what useful things might be carried out there, and if they sent them along to the Secretary of the Committee of Public Works, they would be dealt with by that Committee in its general survey of the ground, and would possibly be placed in the programme which they will definitely formulate.  Thanks to the Civic Guards and to others through the country a good deal has been done but, I am perfectly certain that all the desirable things that could be done will not be brought to the notice of the Commissioners.  The Commissioners feel that.  Within the next week an invitation will be extended to people everywhere to suggest schemes of useful work that might be carried out.</P>
    <P>In connection with some remarks made by Deputy Morrissey, when talking about public works, I should like to emphasise that in all these matters there is one essential that has been sadly lacking during the last ten years; there was no serious and settled policy. From 1922 to 1932 the whole problem of unemployment was neglected.  Its existence was, in fact, on occasions denied.  Public relief works were carried on, and hundreds of thousands of pounds of public money spent, but the works on which the money was expended were inadequately planned and often as not quite useless.  There was no systematic attack, no foresight, no prudence, no plan.  In fact, I might say nobody wanted a plan.  A plan <Col N="461" /> would have been an encumbrance, as the money provided by the Dáil would have to be spent in accordance with such plan.  Something permanent would have to be shown for the money, and it would have to be spent in the areas where the need was greatest, or where public works of some value were practicable.  If the money was not spent in such areas then an account would have to be given as to the whereabouts of the spending and such an account was the last thing that Deputy Morrissey's friends wished to render.  Any obligation of that nature had to be evaded at all costs, because these hundreds of thousands of pounds had not been spent in the areas where, from the economic point of view, the need was greatest or where the poverty was direst.  The money was spent in these areas only where its purchasing power in terms of votes was greatest; not plans and not poverty determined the spending of the money.  It is quite obvious that in such conditions there could be no planning and no coordination; nothing to secure any permanent benefit.</P>
    <P>We are in a different position.  We regard public moneys as a trust, and we are not going to use them to slush about.  It would be quite impossible for us to provide forthwith all the money that would be required to absorb on public works all the unemployed. We have to take a choice.  To maintain a man under the Unemployment Assistance Act would cost about £30, to employ a man on public works would cost £175 a year.  If we take it that there are 50,000 or 60,000 people unemployed&mdash;taking 60,000 as a round figure, which I think is an excessive figure&mdash;the cost would be £1,800,000 under the Unemployment Assistance Act.  It would require £10,000,000 annually to provide employment for those people under the other schemes.  It is obvious, therefore, that we must be satisfied that we are going to get an economic return, a sociological return for the moneys we spend on public works.  We are not going to rush into any widespread expenditure until we have a definite programme and a definite plan.  We have set up a committee to consider that <Col N="462" /> problem.  It is working on it and some times holds meetings two or three times a week.  It has assessed a mass of information about unemployment and poverty, and I have not the slightest doubt that from that Committee, on which there are engineers and experienced administrators, as well as people who know this country inside out, before next March we shall have a definitely formulated programme of public works, and when that programme is forthcoming, I have no doubt that we will be able to provide the moneys for it.</P>

      <P>I wonder where Deputy Hogan got his doubts in connection with my views as to the taking over from local authorities of housing and sanitation schemes.  In that respect I would be prepared to go further than Deputy Hogan.  As far as the county I represent is concerned, if the housing needs of the community there are left in the hands of the local authorities, it will not be in 25 or 40 years these schemes will be put into effect, but in a century, at the present rate of progress. Money is voted there as a kind of makeshift.  It is at least two years since a labourers' cottage scheme was put into effect, but 100 houses have not yet been built.  I can honestly state that while money has been voted by the local authorities for two schemes of labourers' cottages, these local authorities are taking care that they are not going to build the houses.  It is the same with sanitation and other schemes.  These works should be taken over by the central authority where local authorities neglect their duties. <Col N="463" /> As a member of a committee inquiring into rural housing needs, I say that at the present rate of progress the houses will not be built for one hundred years. It is admitted by everyone that these houses are absolutely necessary.</P>
      <P>With regard to the unemployment problem generally, every Department is at fault in that respect.  Thousands of acres of land in my constituency are lying idle.  I know one farm, containing over 400 acres, that the Land Commission has been taking over for 11 years. They have not divided it yet.  Every time inquiry is made the reply is that it is going to be done.  I have called the attention of the Land Commission during the last two years to something like 9,000 acres of land, the owners of which are consenting parties, but not one acre has yet been divided.  That land would give employment, but at present it is lying practically derelict, except as a home for bullocks.</P>
      <P>It is the same with respect to other proposals.  I was rather amused to hear the Minister for Finance talking about the reduction of working hours. I wonder how that is going to be worked out.  The Minister has many apostles in that respect.  I should like to draw attention to one section, and it is not a small section, whose position at present is worse than that of those drawing unemployment assistance. I allude to ordinary agricultural labourers, who are compelled to work at a wage which is worse than would be paid to a nigger in a great many instances; and worse than that, some of those employers have now the assurance, given in the Dáil last week, that if that unfortunate labourer refuses to work for that wage, his employer, or his slave master, can write to the Department here and that man will be refused unemployment assistance because he has been offered work and has refused to take it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a condition of affairs which, I think, will have to be remedied first. When the Minister for Finance talks about a reduction of working hours, I wonder how he is going to reduce the working hours for that section of the community?  It is the condition <Col N="464" /> prevailing with that section of the community which is giving rise to a large amount of the pressure which is being brought to bear on other branches of employment.  I wonder how the hours of the labourer, for instance, are going to be regulated. He has to be out in the farmer's yard at 5.30 in the morning and has to work until 6 or 7 o'clock that evening and those are no strange hours, as anyone living in a rural district knows very well.  He sees his brother, perhaps, walking into the beet factory and getting four times his wages for an 8-hour day and that is what causes all the dissatisfaction and forces agricultural labourers here and there in the country to rush into other avenues of employment.  I think the first matter that will have to be tackled in this country, if ever we are to get to the root basis of it, is a minimum wage for agricultural labourers worked out with a system which will fix the price of agricultural produce at the cost of production, plus something over.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to talk about setting up factories and about the wages in factories, but the root of the matter is, to my mind, that the agricultural labourer will have to be put on some solid basis.  At the present day, the position of the agricultural labourer of this country is worse than that of a serf.  He is completely in the hands of his taskmaster and that taskmaster can put him to illegal work of all descriptions under the threat of disemploying him if he does not do it. They are to be seen before the courts every day of the week charged with tree felling and wire cutting.  Why? Because if they refuse to do it they are sacked.  You have that condition of affairs prevailing all over the country at the present day.  That is a position that will have to be tackled. I admit that the condition of agriculture does not permit of what anybody would call a fairly decent wage, a wage that would compare with the wage paid in industry, but I say that that position will also have to be tackled and got over and that all employment in this country should be <Col N="465" /> on that basis.  There are numerous ways in which unemployment can be greatly relieved but the greater portion of our unemployment problem to-day results from the rushing into towns, wherever an industry is started, of rural workers.  I think that the problem of planting these people on land which, in a great many instances, is lying derelict and idle, is one that should be tackled and one that will have to be tackled by some other machinery than the present machinery of the Land Commission.  I say that the 1933 Act is practically useless and has been rendered useless in that respect.  I do not know who is at fault, but the fault is there.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Corish complaining of juveniles being employed in industry. Undoubtedly, in a number of the new industries that are being started, juvenile labour is employed, but I know that in some of the factories with which I have been very closely associated during the last few years, juvenile labour is a necessity, at any rate at first.  It is quite useless to bring a boy or girl of 24 or 25 years of age into one of those factories and expect that boy or girl to learn the business as well as a young lad of 16 or 18 will learn it.  I can say that employment in the industries which I have examined cannot be described as sweated labour, because the wages paid are decent wages, and I am prepared to take any member of the Labour Party into those factories any day he wishes and let him examine conditions for himself and let him see the wages books of those firms.</P>
    <P>A lot can be done in the way of drainage schemes, and smaller drainage schemes, in particular.  For instance, there is a lot of land in the country at the present day which it would not be an economic proposition for the farmer to drain.  In a great many cases there are areas of arable land of 20 or 30 acres in extent, with strips of wet land forming more or less a verge, which would give a large amount of employment if drained and which would make right good land if drained.  It is land that was under cultivation before in many cases and which could be well cultivated.  It is not, however, an economic proposition for farmers to <Col N="466" /> drain that land, and I would suggest, as a way out, that the farmer should get 50 per cent. of the cost of such drainage, the scheme to be worked out by Board of Works engineers or engineers lent by local authorities for the purpose.  In that manner, a large amount of useful employment, and employment that would give some return in future, could be provided.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem of decentralisation of industry.  What I suggest in that respect is that if the Department of Industry and Commerce would look through the figures of unemployment in the various districts and take those figures into consideration when advising firms to start industries in particular areas, a lot of the difficulties would be got over.  There is far too much driving of industries, small and large, into the larger cities at present.  Undoubtedly, the present Government has done a lot towards relieving unemployment, but there remains a lot to be done, and, in my opinion, the greater portion of their work is being rendered null and void in their own various departments,</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The one thing which this motion has produced, so far as the debate on it in this House is concerned, is a unanimity amongst all Parties that there is a serious unemployment problem to be dealt with.  The Minister for Finance dissented somewhat from that this evening, but, at all events, other members of his Party, and Front Bench members of his Party, have admitted, in the course of this debate, and other debates which have taken place since this motion was first discussed, that there is a serious unemployment problem to be dealt with in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A recognition by all Parties of the extent of the problem of unemployment and a realisation that that problem must be tackled and tackled effectively may awaken in the Government and in all Parties in the State a conviction that radical measures must be adopted if we are going to deal with the problem in a satisfactory and constructive way.  Opening his speech on this motion the Minister for Finance spent some time in analysing its terms.  He professed to see all kinds of difficulties in the motion as phrased: all kinds of obstacles to its <Col N="467" /> being implemented; and generally suggested that the motion was really an impossible one.  The Minister for Finance is quite an old politician and his Party say that he is a very astute politician.  The Minister is perfectly conversant with the terms of the motion, knows perfectly well what the terms of the motion mean; and so far as any case to be made in defence of the Government's policy in relieving unemployment is concerned, it ought to be made at all events outside an analysis of the precise terms of the motion.  The speeches made on the motion and the motion itself made it perfectly clear to everybody who was listening to the debate that all Parties in the House realise that there is a serious unemployment problem to be met; and it is the obvious duty of the Government, as the body charged with the custody of the interests of the whole community, to set about dealing with that problem in a comprehensive and immediate manner.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that he doubted that there was widespread unemployment and, as indicating the worthlessness of the motion and the schemes suggested here, told us of the difficulties of drainage.  He told us that there might be considerable danger in losing herbage if we undertook any extensive drainage of the country.  There is not an unemployed man in the country who will not be prepared to take a chance of losing the herbage of the country if he can get bread and butter to feed himself and his wife and children.  So far as the danger of losing herbage is a problem or a difficulty in the way of tackling drainage comprehensively, I do not think there is a Deputy in the Minister's own Party who would not be prepared to take the same chance as the unemployed man would be.  The Minister said he doubted the accuracy of the motion which declared that there was widespread unemployment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not doubt, but I said the implication of the motion was that an increasing proportion of our population was unemployed.  I said <Col N="468" /> that, after the speeches which had been made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and by the Parliamentary Secretary, I did not think that the emphasis on the increasing could be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not responsible for the speeches made by other members of the House.  I am responsible to some extent for the terms of the motion which says: &ldquo;That in view of continued widespread unemployment the Dáil instructs the Executive Council&rdquo; etc.  The terms of the motion do not imply what the Minister alleges. In any case, even assuming it did, I think that a considerable volume of evidence could be produced to show that, if the motion made such an allegation, there are substantial grounds perhaps for making that statement.  I have here in my hand an answer to a question which I addressed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to-day and I find that on the 19th November 71,000 people were in receipt of unemployment assistance benefit. That means that there were 71,000 unemployed; that 71,000 people, who normally follow employment, were unemployed and in receipt of unemployment assistance benefit on the 19th November.  But that is only dealing with unemployment assistance benefit. Let us pass to the unemployment insurance benefit.  On the same date &mdash;that is not ten days ago&mdash;there were 20,400 people in receipt of unemployment insurance benefit.  So that on the 19th November there were 91,000 people in receipt of unemployment assistance benefit and unemployment insurance benefit.  These figures take no cognisance of the fact that on the 19th November there were 91,000 applicants for unemployment assistance benefit, of whom only 71,000 were in receipt of such benefit.  If we say that even 5,000 or 10,000 of the 20,000 cases on appeal are also entitled to, and will ultimately receive unemployment assistance benefit, we get an unemployment problem, measured in terms of these figures&mdash;and these are official figures&mdash;which shows approximately 100,000 people unemployed and <Col N="469" /> having satisfied rigid State tests before they were put into that category.</P>
      <P>These are very serious figures.  No mere Party advantage or mere Party propaganda can possibly deny the truth of these figures.  So long as these figures exist it is the bounden duty of this Government, acting on behalf of the whole community, to take steps to relieve, not merely the endemic poverty, which the Parliamentary Secretary talked about a fortnight ago, but the chronic and widespread poverty which these figures prove to any person who is prepared to be satisfied and convinced by proof.</P>
      <P>On the last occasion the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance produced graphs in this House, he showed the upward curves of unemployment and the downward curves during other periods of the year.  While I concede that all that work is very valuable and very necessary in order to understand and estimate the extent of the problem, these 100,000 unemployed people do not want graphs; they do not want curves.  These 100,000 unemployed people are looking for an opportunity to obtain work at reasonable rates of wages, and no reply that you know the extent of the problem, that you have it now on a sheet of paper, is any answer to the claim of these people that they ought to be given back their heritage to earn their bread and butter by the sweat of their brow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These figures, as I said, are official figures&mdash;they cannot be denied.  The Minister for Finance in the course of his speech made no definite effort to deny the existence or accuracy of these figures.  The Minister said too that this motion, if it were passed, was an instruction to the Government to provide work at once for the unemployed. Is there anything wrong with that?  Is there anything wrong in demanding that the unemployed should be provided with work at once?  Had we not declarations from the Fianna Fáil Party that on their advent to office the unemployed might look forward to a period of economic security and domestic happiness?  But the <Col N="470" /> Minister for Finance tells us this evening that it is almost revolutionary and something that responsible people should not think of to ask the Government to provide work at once for unemployed people.  It is not an answer to say to the unemployed man that he is entitled to get work at once and that if he does not get work at once, he is entitled to get a decent standard of wage from the State. Nobody can pretend that the 70,000 people who are in receipt of unemployment assistance are getting anything like a decent standard of living from the State.</P>
    <P>The Minister attacked the motion and said that it was asking the Government to do things speedily, that it was quite impossible to carry out, without prior consideration, many of the schemes suggested in the course of the speeches supporting this motion. I could understand the Minister's point if this motion were only put down last month.  But this motion has been on the Order Paper for the past 18 months.  Surely the Government, seeing that they have now a body of experts at their disposal, have had time to examine the implications of the motion and to devise schemes that would meet its object?  It is no answer and it is an insincere plea for the Minister for Finance to suggest that this motion, which has been down on the Paper for 18 months, should not be passed by this House merely because the Government had not taken the precaution of setting up this Committee 18 months ago&mdash;when they ought to have done so.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion when the question of unemployment was discussed in this House the Minister for Industry and Commerce defended the growth of the industrial system as we see it to-day. I had previously alleged, and I allege it again, in very definite and, I hope, unmistakable language, that we are allowing to grow up here an industrial system which is unhealthy and which is characterised by the exploitation of juvenile and woman labour to an excessive extent.  In my view the Minister for Industry and Commerce might well have taken steps even before now to have dealt with the <Col N="471" /> grave menace to industry and wage standards which that unchecked growth indicates.</P>
    <P>We have urged on the Minister for Industry and Commerce and we have urged on the Government the necessity for dealing with that problem of the exploitation of children and female labour before the problem reaches such magnitude that it will be impossible to deal with it effectively.  When that problem was brought to the notice of the Minister on a recent occasion when relief schemes were being discussed here, the Minister felt bound to give an almost blank cheque to industrialism in the country.  I do not know on what evidence the Minister was prepared to give that certificate which he then gave them in such fulsome language.  Before he gives any more such certificates on the matter of the kind of labour which is employed in some of these new industries he might take the precaution of consulting some of his factory inspectors. If he does take that precaution I dare say that these inspectors will be compelled, from what they have seen with their own eyes, to tell the Minister that there is exploitation of juvenile labour carried on in factories which ought not to be tolerated in any civilised State.</P>
    <P>The Minister wanted to suggest on the last occasion that I was making a sweeping attack on all industrialists. Of course I was not making a sweeping attack on all industrialists.  There are good employers.  There are employers who conclude agreements with trades unions, and in respect of whom the trades unions have nothing to say by way of complaint.  There are employers whom trades unions acknowledge to be very good employers.  I did not at all make reference to those people.  In fact, every decent employer in the city and country supports me in demanding State action against those people who are operating in back kitchens and back lanes, and paying their employees scandalous wages.  Every decent employer knows that the real enemy is not the trades union or the employees. <Col N="472" /> The real enemy is the manufacturer in the back lane or back kitchen who is permitted to employ youths at a starvation wage.</P>
    <P>The Minister took exception to what I said about one of the new industrialists with which the country is blest&mdash;perhaps &ldquo;cursed&rdquo; would more accurately describe the situation.  He told the House that a certain gentleman wanted to establish a new industry and that he had secured premises in which to conduct that industry.  He employed ten people working 9½ hours a day at 18/11 a week.  That was the remuneration he paid these people.  I told the House on the last occasion that this gentleman got £3,000 under the Trade (Loans) Guarantee Act in order to help him to start that industry under these conditions.  A kind of human dripping factory would be the best kind of description for an industry of that kind.</P>
    <P>Since the debate on the last occasion I got a copy of the application which this gentleman requires applicants for employment to complete before their applications are considered.  It is a mighty Christian document.  It starts off in the first instance that the applicant accepts the condition that he can be dismissed without notice or cause assigned.  There is a good Christian principle in that.  Further down the list he is asked for particulars about himself and his family. He is permitted, apparently, to have children because he is asked about the children in the family.  Then the application form contains a post-script to the effect that any workman on whom the smell or trace of &ldquo;liqueur&rdquo; can be found will be dismissed instantly.</P>
    <P>Fancy a workman drinking &ldquo;liqueur&rdquo; on a salary of 18/11 a week, working nine and a half hours a day and expected to provide for himself and his family out of that! That is the kind of development that is taking place in the new industries.  The State ought to take effective action against employers of that kind.  It should make them pay a reasonable wage and it should compel them to conform to reasonable hours and conditions of <Col N="473" /> employment.  The State should check the growth of industries of that kind. As far as I am concerned, I would much sooner see this country without that kind of industry than see it carried on on that basis and accompanied by that sort of exploitation. On the last occasion the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance said that he had definitely inclined to the view that a reduction of working hours would not mean an increase in employment.</P>

      <P>Well, I am willing to be corrected by the Parliamentary Secretary, but I think that is the substance of what he said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I will take that correction from the Parliamentary Secretary.  But I am not looking at it from the standpoint of an increase in wealth production.  I am looking at it from the standpoint of human beings who are crying for an opportunity to earn a livelihood, an opportunity which is denied to them because of the chaotic conditions which the State continues to tolerate in industry.  The plain fact of the matter is that the growth of mechanisation and the rationalisation which is a growing feature in industry is resulting in men and women being sentenced to death by this introduction of machinery. Whether we increase our working hours or leave the working hours as they are, these people will continue to lose their employment by the methods of rationalisation in production.  If you mean to keep these people already employed in their employment and to provide employment for those now unemployed, it is absolutely necessary for the State to ensure that with the growth of mechanisation and rationalisation in industry there will be a steady reduction in working hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only in that way that we can impose any possible check on the disemployment that is taking place as a <Col N="474" /> result of the introduction of mechanised and rationalised methods of production and distribution unaccompanied by reductions in working hours.  I was very glad to hear the Minister for Finance say that he believed a reduction in working hours would come.  I suggest to the Minister that he might very well, as an employer, set an example in that respect himself.  I do not know whether the Minister is aware of the fact or not, but the truth is that the Minister for Finance, who is the responsible Minister under the relevant Act, is employing people in the Post Office Engineering and Stores Department for 53 hours per week, although the analogous hours of employment in outside industry for people of a comparable grade are 44 per week.  There is an opportunity for the Minister for Finance to herald the advent of the reduced working week by applying to those people the shorter working week which he told us this evening is bound to come.  The Minister may not know it but young people&mdash;some of them juveniles&mdash;are employed from 8 o'clock in the morning until a quarter to six in the evening in the Post Office Stores and in the Post Office factory.  I say to the Minister for Finance very definitely that the attitude of the Department that tolerates that state of affairs is on a par with the attitude of the gentleman in a particular town who requires his employees to work a nine and a half hour day while paying a scandalously low rate of wages.  The State ought to be not merely a good employer, but the best employer, because of the effect of its example on private employers.  What can you expect a private employer to do as regards the reduction of working hours when you find a State Department employing people for 53 hours per week, or nine hours more than is worked by members of many other occupations in the city of Dublin?  The Labour Party realise that industry, agriculture and commerce are the normal sources of employment for the vast bulk of our working population, but if there are periods of unemployment or periods during which we are awaiting <Col N="475" /> the results of projected industrial or agricultural development, large scale schemes of public works should fill in the gap.  We believe that an industrial position may arise which, if properly controlled, will absorb additional unemployed people and that agriculture may ultimately be able to absorb a larger number than it employs to-day, but we have suggested that the interregnum ought to be bridged by the carrying out of large-scale schemes of public works.  There is nothing wrong in suggesting proposals of that kind. Many other countries have resorted to large-scale schemes of public works as a means of relieving particularly acute unemployment problems.  In view of the fact that we have here 90,000 people in receipt of unemployment insurance benefit and unemployment assistance benefit, it is obvious that some steps should be taken to deal with the problem.  We have here a relatively undeveloped country, industrially and agriculturally.  We have here available the brain and brawn to exploit the industrial and agricultural potentialities of our people.  We are assured by all parties and by people who claim to talk with authority that the credit of the country is high.  If, therefore, you have got an unemployment problem accounting for 100,000 men and women, if you have got the brain and brawn available to operate on the resources of the nation, if you have an extremely high credit position in the finance market, there is no reason, given competence, attention and foresight, why it ought not to be possible to harness the brain and brawn of the people to our extremely high credit position and, by a combination of both, enable us to exploit to the fullest our relatively undeveloped agricultural and industrial resources.</P>
    <P>My suggestion to the Government is that it ought to sit down and plan&mdash; and plan with a definite objective. There is too much kicking of the football all around the field and not knowing where the goal posts are. My suggestion is that the Government should sit down and plan and so co-ordinate their industrial, agricultural and public work schemes as to <Col N="476" /> ensure that a massed attack will be made on the problem of unemployment. If there were an invasion here to-morrow there would not be this prolonged examination which the Minister for Finance spoke about this evening when dealing with large-scale schemes of public works.  If there were a plague in the country, the committee of experts would not be given 18 months, or two years, to devise plans for dealing with it.  If there were a drought in the country, there would not be any long-time consideration of ways and means of dealing with it.  If any of these evils overtook the country to-morrow, every ounce of the nation's energies would be mobilised to deal with conditions that would be regarded as national calamities if permitted to go unchecked.  Here you have a calamity worse than any of these&mdash; 100,000 men and women craving for an opportunity to earn a livelihood, willing and anxious to operate on the neglected agricultural and industrial resources of the country.  Yet, in face of that emergency, that national and economic calamity, we are told that we must wait until these schemes receive more mature consideration.  I should hope that the speech delivered by the Minister for Finance does not represent the official policy of the Government in relation to unemployment. I would not even suggest that the Minister was responsible for the speech he delivered.  It was a despairing speech and there is not, in one line of it, a glimmer of hope for the unemployed people of the country.  I hope that that speech is not the basis of the Government's policy for dealing with a problem exemplified by 100,000 unemployed men and women.  I hope that the Government will accept this motion and face up to their responsibility as custodians of the nation's interests for dealing with this problem in a vigorous, comprehensive and radical way.  There is no use in telling us that other countries have unemployment problems.  We know they have.  We are as powerless to cure their unemployment problems as they are to cure their own by adverting to their circumstances.  Let us try to do something that will be distinguished <Col N="477" /> by imagination, by the resolve to cure unemployment, by the determination to ensure that every man and woman born in this country be not merely entitled to an opportunity to live in their own country but, as far as this State of ours is concerned, be guaranteed an opportunity of operating on the nation's sadly-neglected resources.</P>

      <P>Before you, a Chinn Comhairle, put the motion, I think I ought to say to the leader of the Labour Party that we accept the principle of the motion&mdash;that the Government's attention should be devoted to this problem.  The problem is receiving the first attention of the Government.  We have set up a Committee to deal with these matters and to prepare these large-scale schemes of <Col N="478" /> public works which the motion asks for; but we are not in a position&mdash;and it is generally recognised&mdash;to provide the sums forthwith.  In view of that, I suggest that the position of the movers of the resolution is met by the fact that we are formulating large-scale schemes of public works for which the Government is asked.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Dáil condemns the Executive Council for its neglect to secure a quota for the export of cattle to Great Britain adequate to the needs of our agricultural industry.</P>
      <P>I should imagine, in view of the whole cattle industry of the country, that the Government would accept this motion right away, because there is no doubt that they have failed in their duty as regards the cattle and live-stock industry of the country.  Some time ago a Bill was introduced into this House&mdash;the Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Bill&mdash;by the Minister for Agriculture. I am sorry to see him absent now.  By that Bill he hoped to remedy the position, but we find later on, when it did not have the desired effect, that he was blaming the farmers.  If only even a small section of the farmers would do what they ought to do, the whole trouble of the cattle industry would be solved! Now he has turned around and blamed the exporters.  Is it to be contended that, even with the Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Bill, the industry is in a healthy state?  It is not.  To quote the words of the Minister's own representative, he said that even at 25/- a cwt. it must be admitted that that did not give anything like an economic price to the farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened to debates here to-night.  I have listened to speeches from the Government Benches&mdash;particularly one from Deputy Corry. Deputy Corry talked about &ldquo;once again the cost of production&rdquo;&mdash;that the farmers should get the cost of production and all that sort of thing.  That is a matter upon which we can all agree, but it is admitted that, even with the legislation introduced into this House, 25/- a cwt. live-weight for cattle is not a paying proposition and does not give the farmer an economic price.  I think it was Deputy Goulding who referred a while ago to the decay on the small towns.  Why has the decay set in in these small towns?  It has set in because of the fact that the agricultural <Col N="482" /> industry, on which these towns were dependent, is no longer in the state in which it was.  That is the reason, and that is the only reason&mdash; that the country, on which these towns were really dependent, is no longer in the same position in which it was before the Fianna Fáil Party came into office.  Hence the decay in the towns; hence the unemployment in the country about which we heard so much a while ago in a long debate in this House.</P>
    <P>I should like if the Minister for Agriculture and the Executive Council would get down to facts and ask themselves what are the causes of the present situation.  The Minister for Agriculture will stand up during this debate sometime and talk in his usual aggressive manner of Deputies opposite and say that they do not give him one suggestion.  He will criticise Deputy Curran's destructive criticism and ask what is the solution of the problem.  What is the solution of it? The solution of it is to seek a trade agreement with Great Britain, even if you cannot get the economic war settled.  There is no doubt that the economic war and the dispute with Britain are responsible for the state of the cattle industry in the country to-day.  I am not a great statistician but looking at the Press this morning, in so far as I could judge, the British Government have collected the land annuities from the farmers.  Yet we have the Government sending round bailiffs and sheriffs collecting money from the farmer which he has already paid.</P>
    <P>The President himself talks of how the British take money even though he is not inclined to give it.  He says they take it by force.  I could use the same analogy regarding the land annuities.  Great Britain has collected them off me and our own Government want to take them off me again. It was never intended that the farmer should pay land annuities to two Governments.  Hence we have a situation up and down the country such as never existed in this country before, a situation brought about by the dispute with Great Britain. <Col N="483" /> Certainly there is no credit to the Government in what their agents have been doing down the country. Granted that sheriffs must go out, they could do these things as they were done before, in a reasonably courteous manner and in accordance with the traditions of this country. That is not what is happening now. They have made a dumping ground of this country.  They are insolent even if a farmer goes to them to buy his own cattle.  The farmer is not getting any sort of chance at the present time.  It is well to face up to this problem.  I know that in so far as my own county is concerned the warrant for this year's rates amounts to £171,000.  With the exception of last year, the highest figure ever reached before was between £80,000 and £90,000.  These are the facts and that is what makes the position difficult.  The money is simply not there.</P>

      <P>You may talk about your beet and wheat schemes, and things of that kind, but they will not solve the problem.  If you take the Government policy, pushed to its furthest possible end, you will still have a lot of land in the country which will not be a paying proposition under present circumstances.  I have been informed that about 60,000 acres of beet, and about 700,000 acres of wheat, would meet our requirements.  That acreage is only a fraction of all the arable land of the country.  Take an individual like myself. If I produce a reasonable amount of wheat and a reasonable amount of beet, as I have at the moment, and if the rest of my farm is not a paying proposition, certainly I cannot expect beet and wheat to make the whole farm a paying proposition.  That is the problem we have to face in the country at present. It must be remembered that, for good or ill, the live-stock industry is the main asset of the individual farmer. It was on his young stock he depended <Col N="484" /> to meet his obligations in the past. It is on these he is dependent at the present time.  But the economic war has made his position impossible.</P>
      <P>I want to give a specific case to the President and Minister for Agriculture. The Minister knows very well that some time during the year his Department refused export licences to farmers and dealers who had not shipped a minimum of 30 cattle per month.  I took up that case with the Minister and licences were granted to such people.  Then the Department refused licences to people who had not shipped a minimum of 20 cattle per month.  I also took that matter up with the Minister and he agreed to give licences to these people.  A man who came under the latter category had some cattle at a local fair and he would not take the price which was offered for them, £7 per head. In the meantime, a licence came along from the Minister's Department and he shipped the cattle.  He would not get £7 for them at the local fair and the price they realised on the other side was £18 odd.  That is the market that the President tells us is of no use to the farmer.  We have had the statement recently made to the cattle exporters by the Minister's representative. What does it mean in essence? It means that the farmers have been robbed.  He told the exporters that he is prepared to take over the cattle industry of the country if needs be. I want to tell the Minister this, that while admitting that there was robbery and jobbery perpetrated, it will be nothing to the robbery and jobbery that will be perpetrated if the Minister takes over the cattle trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not terrible at all. The Minister would not be convinced or believe it until he heard at the Ard-Fheis how cattle licences had been sold in the country where you had given them to your own political supporters and friends.  They are being sold at anything from £2 to £3 per head.  They are being juggled about, making that price for anybody to whom the Minister <Col N="485" /> cares to give them.  I know the difficulty in which the Minister finds himself in trying to regulate the situation, but he must admit that this has happened.  His own supporters at the Ard Fheis put it before him.  Only for that is so, he would probably be saying that I was telling an untruth on this occasion.  I do not want to tell any untruth.  I want to put the whole situation as I know it before him.  A situation has been created in this country which has got to be met just like the labour problem.  There are more cattle than we can consume in the country.  What is to be done with them?  You cannot convince me that the free beef scheme, the factory to deal with old cows, and things of that kind will solve the problem.  Even if the farmers were to get the minimum price of 25/- per cwt., it is not an economic price.  I should like the President to take a note of what I said a moment ago.  Look at the difference between £7 and £18 per head.  Of course you have to take expenses from that, but they would be there in any case.  The Government of course, will turn round and say that Britain would have imposed a quota whatever happened here.  Mind you, to the ordinary man in the country&mdash;to me at any rate&mdash;the position between the two Governments, our own Government and the British Government, is simply sickening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You have the statement of Mr. Thomas that the door is still open: that they are prepared to negotiate.  Our President says the same thing: that they are prepared to discuss this and come to an amicable arrangement.  The Government may try how they will to solve the problem of farming in this country, but I submit that if they cannot settle the economic war they will not succeed unless they make a trade agreement with Great Britain. We have the position that the British Government and our own Government are squeezing the land annuities out of the farmers.  That is not just or fair. In my own constituency the rate warrant this year is £171,000.  With the exception of last year it used to be in or about £80,000 or £90,000.  Is not that <Col N="486" /> a big burden to place on the farming community?  It certainly is, and there is no use closing our eyes to it.  The arrears, so far as my constituency is concerned, amount to a considerable figure.  I do not see how in present circumstances the payment of them can be met.  Judging by some of the actions of the Executive Council the cattle industry is worth something to this country, or at least it ought to be.  It seems a very strange thing for the Government to send its representative over to Scotland to buy a high priced polled angus bull&mdash;to pay £300 or £400 for that animal&mdash;and bring him home and then to adopt the policy of killing calves.  You have county committees of agriculture putting forward schemes to foster the live-stock industry of the country.  What avail are they going to be?  If I were in a position to carry out what I feel, what I would do would be to scrap the whole live-stock industry in present circumstances, because of the way it is being handled by the Executive Council.</P>
    <P>In present circumstances I do not see any sense in trying to foster the live-stock industry or in purchasing high priced bulls for this country because cattle raising is not now an economic proposition.  We all know that at the Dublin Spring Show and at other shows throughout the country public money is being expended for the purpose of giving premiums to bulls. Everybody who attended the Spring sales at Ballsbridge is aware of that, but in present circumstances what is the use of it?  As I said before, I know that the Minister for Agriculture will stand up and abuse everybody.  He reminds me very much of a sporting incident that happened in this country. There was a certain owner who had a horse running in a race.  It was supposed to be a good thing.  It was backed to win, but it got beaten by a head or a neck.  The owner was grumbling at everybody.  The trainer was heard to remark: &ldquo;He blames everybody but the horse.&rdquo;  The Minister for Agriculture is blaming farmers, shippers and everybody but himself.  I say that the blame rests on himself and on himself alone.  He told <Col N="487" /> the farmers that they should keep their cattle off the market for a bit.  That was the story last year when the crux was about the stall-fed cattle.  He then said that we had them all cleared off.  Yes, because they were cleared out of grass.  I say that it is idle to tell the farmers to keep their cattle off the market.  In many cases they have to put them on the market in order to raise money to meet their ordinary expenses.  That is the situation that has arisen in connection with the whole problem.</P>
    <P>I hope that I have made my point clear to the Front Bench.  I would ask them, if they cannot settle the economic war, to try and have a trade agreement with Britain and get the highest quota possible for our cattle. According to what we read in the newspapers there is supposed to be goodwill on both sides: that the door is open, that it was never closed and so on.  I say to the Government: &ldquo;Leave the land annuities out of it and seek for a trade agreement; mind you we are entitled to it.&rdquo;  That will solve the problem and it is the only way to solve it.  We have had a lot of talk about unemployment, the poverty in the towns and so on. There is poverty in the country and the people are leaving the rural areas for the towns because of the hardships to be endured in connection with farming at the present time.  The farmers are not able to pay wages. It is all very well for Deputy Corry to talk about a standard rate of wages for agricultural labourers.  I have a great regard for these men.  I find them honest good workers.  I try to pay them as much as I can afford, probably more than anybody else in the district, but that is not enough. The Minister for Finance spoke about unemployment to-night, and gave the figure of £175 as the cost of employing a man.</P>

      <P>What is agriculture? Is the man who is engaged at agriculture not to get a decent wage at all? Why not apply that argument to <Col N="488" /> agriculture, and see how it works out? We offered to submit a statement of facts and figures to the President in connection with the farming industry at the present time but he refused to meet us.  It is idle to talk about a man at £175 on public works.  The agricultural labourer is the greatest asset we have in the country.  That unfortunate man has no eight hour day and no six day week.  His conditions of employment may be somewhat different if he is employed on farms convenient to towns or cities. The branch of agriculture that Deputy Corry spoke about&mdash;the marketing of milk in towns&mdash;is the only branch that is paying at the present time. Unfortunately all farmers are not in that position.  Only a small percentage of them can avail of the advantages to be derived from close proximity to towns and cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would appeal to the Government to look into the situation.  The position is serious, and it is not helping matters to be sending out the bailiffs in the way that they are being sent out at the present time.  I would appeal to the Government to take a reasonable view of things.  I say again that the law, in so far as it affects the collection of the annuities at the present time, is unjust.  In support of that I can quote the statement of the President made more than once as well as the statements of very prominent statesmen throughout the world that the law ought to be just to be obeyed. I feel that if the Government realised the position in which they are putting the agricultural community they would hardly go to such extremes as they are going.  We have had statements from the Government Benches about the position of the country, and the position of the towns particularly.  There are farmer Deputies in this House who ought to be acquainted with the situation. It is not to-day nor yesterday that the farmers' position has been difficult.  It has been gradually getting worse, and yet the Government will not face up to the problem and see what is to be done in connection with it.  I have made a suggestion, because I do not believe that this Bill recently <Col N="489" /> introduced or the establishment of a factory to convert our cows into meal or meat will solve our problem.  The problem is there.  There is a surplus amount of cattle to be dealt with. That can only be dealt with in a way which will remedy the situation for good and all.  If the Government and the farmer Deputies would look into the situation they could bring about a remedy for the position; otherwise it cannot be remedied.  The problem is there; there is one way of dealing with it, and only one way, in my opinion.  It is all very fine to talk about the factories of which we heard here to-night.  It is not very pleasant to hear about the conditions of employment which have been spoken of from the Labour Benches, and that is not going to solve the problem.  If that is the industrial development that is going to take place in this country&mdash; child labour and female labour&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  I am not going to keep the House much longer, in any case.  I put up the position of the farmers to the Executive Council and to the Fianna Fáil Party.  Most of them, I am sure, must know the condition of farming.  They have farmer friends and farmer supporters as well as I have, and it is up to them to see the farmers of this country get a fair and square deal in connection with the whole agricultural policy of the Government.  I hold that they are not getting it at the present time owing to the fact that their principal asset, the cattle industry of the country, is ruined.  The Party opposite cannot deny that, because it has been spoken of at their own meetings.  It has been spoken of there, and truthfully so.  It cannot be denied that a great injustice has been done to the farming community since the continuance of the economic war, and particularly since the advent of the quota restrictions imposed by Great Britain.  Those restrictions have created a very difficult situation, because there is a surplus amount of cattle to be dealt with.  Human nature being what it is, we all know that when a person goes into a market to buy any commodity of which there is a surplus he will avail of that surplus in order to get the commodity at as cheap a price as possible. That has been admitted by the Minister himself, or at least it has been admitted by his representative. It is not fair, on the face of his own admission that the farming community has been robbed, that the Government should try to rob them again now by collecting the land annuities which they have already paid.</P>

      <P>I do not wish unduly to stand in Deputy O'Reilly's way, but I think the House would prefer to have the motion seconded in the usual way. The motion on the Paper raises, in my view, the whole question of the Government's apparent intention to destroy the cattle industry.  Deputy Curran in introducing this motion said that no one on that bench could deny that the industry has been ruined because some of their own supporters have complained at their own meetings of the ruin wrought in that industry. Deputy Curran has apparently forgotten that one of their own colleagues went down the country and boasted before the people that what it took our fathers a hundred years to build up, thank God it would only take a hundred days to tear down.  Senator Connolly took his cue from the President, who thanked God that the British market was gone.  He thanked God that the day had come when the Irish people would be deprived of the means of disposing of that very surplus to which Deputy Curran has referred&mdash;a surplus which, if properly used, could be made the foundation upon which a prosperity could be built up in this country which would provide enough for everybody.  I remember the time when the President and his colleagues were stumping this country and telling us we were all West Britons with our eyes centred on England. We were asked why we did not look abroad, where the President said there were ample alternative markets which would consume all the produce we had to sell in the British market. What has become of the alternative markets?  They vanished away.  They are one of the promises which Deputy Dowdall described as Fianna Fáil statements.  They were made with the purpose of deluding our people into supporting the existing Government. Having got the support which those promises were made to get, the promises were forgotten and the truth was revealed.  What have the alternative markets been reduced to?  They have been reduced to the German buyer, Deputy Briscoe's protégé in the <Col N="492" /> Dublin cattle market, who purchases our cattle for 18/- and 16/- per cwt. and carts them away.</P>
      <P>We are meant to bow down and thank him for coming here and taking them, and we are meant to pay him £300 a week in bounties for carting cattle out of this country at a price which would disgrace a knacker, much less a cattle dealer.  I have no gratitude to any man who comes here and purchases our Irish cattle at 12/- or 14/- per cwt. holding up the produce of the cattle industry of this country to the public odium of the world. They are not being bought; they are being carted away for the price of their skins, and the man who is doing it is being paid the money of the Irish taxpayer to the tune of £300 a week in bounties to do it.  God knows I should hate to see good food destroyed, but I would sooner see it destroyed than see it used as a medium for degrading the cattle industry of this country before the whole world, and for suggesting to the world that our cattle are worth no more than 12/- or 14/- a cwt.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance will have ample opportunity of trying to prop up the crazy structure of his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture. He had better invoke the President and the Minister for Local Government too.  He will want them all, and he can throw Deputy Corry and Deputy Donnelly into the fray then, but he still will not carry much conviction. In the meantime, I would suggest to the Minister that out of deference to the Chair he should hold his tongue.  The German buyer!  That is one of the alternative markets provided. <Col N="493" /> The German buyer having at last brought the blush of shame to the brazen cheek of the Minister for Agriculture, he produces his second alternative market.</P>
      <P>In the Slaughter of Cattle Act, with the prudent assistance of those distinguished agriculturists, Deputies Davin and Norton, who would not know one end of a cow from another, they found a brilliant scheme for disposing of the surplus cattle in this country to the poor and needy.  Nobody on any side in this House but would be glad to see any man who he knew was a hungry man, getting what would stand between him and destitution, but it is a humiliation and a degradation to any one who lives amongst the people, and who respects them as neighbours, to see able bodied men, 20 and 21 years of age, coming in for the lump of beef just as the few unfaithful came 70 or 80 years ago to the souper kitchens.  It is a contemptible thing to see men who had some dignity, some sense of propriety, and some sense of justifiable pride, having thrust upon them a system which likens them, in the mind of their neighbours, to the patrons of the souper kitchens.  I remember Deputy McGovern stating in this House that the policy of Fianna Fáil was to turn this country into a soup kitchen, but that unfortunately they had forgotten the soup.  They have taken Deputy McGovern's advice, and have provided neck beef with which to make the broth, and our people are to be brought down by this Government&mdash; which is the poor man's friend&mdash;to the state where every individual, when he reaches the age of manhood, has to be introduced to the manners and customs of middle nineteenth century paupers. We were told by the Minister for Agriculture that in conferring that boon upon our people, to turn them into patrons of soup kitchens, he is providing another alternative market for our cattle trade.</P>

The President knows that the last thing anyone in this country wants is to have that taunt hurled at him.  There are many simple men up and down the country who imagine when warriors like Deputy Corry or some of the other &ldquo;Eloquent Dempseys&rdquo; on their benches thump the tubs and talk about Caithlin Ní Houlihan, that they can see some from of treachery, because President de Valera's supporters exposed the grievances or protested against the wrongs imposed upon them.

The President mentioned a guaranteed price of 27/6 for wheat.  The guaranteed price of Mr. Hitler is nearly 50/-.  The guaranteed price paid by the French Government is even greater, while the guaranteed price provided by the Italian Government is at least as great.  Let us suppose that the Government really means and believes that wheat can be made a substitute here for the cattle trade.  I do not believe it.  I believe that is pure &ldquo;eye-wash,&rdquo; and fraud, but for the sake of argument let us examine the proposition on the merits.  Why must agricultural labourers be hired in this country at rates which make it <Col N="496" /> possible to produce wheat at 27/6, when the Minister for Industry and Commerce is crying out for monopolies for manufacturers in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and elsewhere, in order to secure that they get a price from the consumer by which they can pay fat dividends and big wages to the operatives.  If the operatives in factories in Dublin are entitled to fair wages&mdash;and I think they are&mdash; why are not the operatives in every factory up and down the country represented by small farmers, entitled to fair wages?  Why is the Minister for Industry and Commerce clamouring for tariffs, monopolies, and Control of Manufactures Acts, in order to secure fat profits and big wages for industrial operatives, while we have a dummy sitting there as Minister for Agriculture, who is afraid to say a word on their behalf?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I venture to reassure the President that, within the terms of the motion on the Order Paper, I shall travel quite as widely as may be necessary. I was explaining to the Minister for Finance that we called on the President to deal with quota questions and I called in evidence the fact that the President, speaking at Ennis, thanked God that the British market was gone. I called in evidence the fact that the Minister for Lands, Senator Connolly&mdash;I have forgotten what he is now: he was Minister for Lands and <Col N="498" /> Fisheries and he is now Minister for some other office&mdash;proclaimed that he rejoiced that he could tear down in 100 days what took 100 years to build.  I am now in the process of examining the justification made by the President and his colleague for these monstrous statements and explaining to the House the pudden-headed reasoning which leads these men into the catastrophe into which they are at present marching cheerfully to the strains of Caithlin Ní Houlihan's funeral march. I was dealing with the question of wheat and I was reminding the House that where we have a loquacious and vigorous Minister for Industry and Commerce clamouring for every kind of restriction on trade in order to secure fat profits for entrepreneurs, many of whom, as Deputy McGilligan said, have not names which appear in the Annals of the Four Masters, and for their employees, we have a dummy sitting there who is driven from post to pillar, flapping his wings in dismal dismay in the Department of Agriculture; and, when the storm gets too violent, sending the Secretary of his Department out to contradict 90 per cent. of what he said the day before and, in fact, to make the best case he can to cover the confusion into which the unhappy Minister has got himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I want to say is that if this country can afford the monopolies and the protective tariffs and all the rest of them, it surely can afford to provide a price for agricultural produce which is being thrust upon the agricultural community by the Government itself such as will enable farmers to pay a decent wage and to make a fair profit.  We are told that it is perfectly simple to substitute wheat for cattle.  It makes one almost despair that it should be necessary to deal with a proposition of that kind in the presence of a man who masquerades as Minister for Agriculture, or perhaps I should say, is Minister for Agriculture, but who masquerades as a competent Minister for Agriculture. He knows perfectly well that if any farmer intends to grow wheat permanently, he must grow it in rotation with other crops.  He knows also <Col N="499" /> perfectly well that wheat is a greedy crop and he knows that in middle Europe, when countries like YugoSlavia and Czecho-Slovakia found that they had no market such as we had in which to dispose of their agricultural produce, they were largely driven back on subsistence farming, and when they began to grow wheat on land that was rich when they began the operation, they got yields from their land very similar to the yields we can get from our land here at the present time.  They were getting yields of 8 to 10 barrels of wheat to the statute acre and after the subsistence farming had gone on for a certain time, unaccompanied by a live stock industry to provide the manure wherewith to enrich the soil, the yield of this same land fell to 2 barrels and now it is as much as they can do to get any wheat out of the land at all. The reason for that is that they have gone on taking crops out of the land and have not put back the animal manure which we have been putting into the land for generations in this country.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly true that at the present time on much of the rich land of the country, 8 to 10, and more than 10 barrels of wheat can be got out of the statute acre, but if we keep it up, if we continue at it, and at the same time pursue the policy which the President advocates and which Senator Connolly advocates, we shall be reduced to the same level of subsistence farming that obtains in middle Europe to-day.  That is one of the difficulties in this problem but there is another difficulty.  Even the Minister for Agriculture knows this, and he does not know much.  Even he knows that you cannot grow wheat on the same land year after year.  You must have some other crop to put in between in order to make the rotation that will induce the land to yield.  If we have wheat and roots and another cereal crop and grass&mdash;to take one possible rotation&mdash;who is going to eat the three intermediate crops?  How are we going to dispose of them? Will we bury them?  Will we burn <Col N="500" /> them?  And if we do not, what will we do with them?  If we have a small farmer who grows an acre of wheat and subsequently grows an acre of turnips, is that farmer to eat the acre of turnips and if he does not, what is he to do with them?</P>

I suggest to the Deputy that he should confine himself to matters with which he is more familiar.  The Deputy, I should imagine, is rather more familiar with Drumcondra and that neighbourhood.  I shall not suggest to the Deputy that he should grow turnips in Drumcondra.  In the meantime, I would suggest that he should keep his mouth shut or go to the Library or somewhere else where he is more at home.</P>

      <P>Probably it is the kind of farming that prospers in the Minister's brain&mdash;the farming that is born in Capel Street and flourishes on the Quays&mdash;but, unfortunately, the farming on which our people live is not of that class.  That is the mistake into which the Minister and his colleagues are fallen.  They are trying to farm from Upper Merrion Street and the unfortunate creatures who are farmers are trying to farm on the land of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;of the three intervening seasons?  We cannot expect from the Minister, judging from his imbecile interjections, any constructive suggestions. We cannot even expect him to apply his mind to it for it would break if he attempted it, but the fact <Col N="501" /> is that there is no solution of that question.  Unless you have a live-stock industry side by side with a wheat growing economy, the thing becomes utterly impossible and cannot be carried on for two good reasons (1) the land will become impoverished and (2) the by-products of wheat production will be unconsumable.</P>
      <P>Now we come to beet&mdash;beet at 30/- a ton, less freight from the farm to the factory.  That is the other substitute market.  Will the Minister for Agriculture have the barefaced audacity to suggest that any farmer can pay a labourer a living wage and produce sugar-beet at 30/- a ton, less freight to the factory, plus whatever sugar-beet pulp he can get back?  The Minister knows as well as I do that a living wage cannot be paid to the farm labourer and make a profit on that basis.  Bear in mind that part of the price the farmer is going to get for his beet is the sugar pulp returned&mdash; returned by the Minister for Agriculture who sits in a Cabinet with a President who thanks God that the market in which we disposed of our cattle is gone; who sits in a Cabinet with another Minister who thanks God that we destroyed in 100 days what it took 100 years to build up.  And this Minister is going to dump two or three cwts. of sugar-beet pulp on every farmer's doorstep.  What is he to do with it?  Eat it or make porridge of it?  Is it any wonder the poor man is a dummy?  The only astonishing thing is how he opens his mouth, even in the backwoods of South Kerry.  I do not blame him for going to the Dingle Peninsula, because he will not find a safe spot to go out in at the present juncture, considering the state of mind the farmers of this country have been reduced to.  Having bestowed his benison of three or four cwt. of sugar pulp on the farmer's doorstep, leaving the farmer to consult President de Valera and Senator Connolly as to what he is to do with it, the Minister stumps out feeling that he has discharged his duty to the farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="502" /> Can any farmer hire labourers to cultivate and save beet and pay them a living wage and get 30/- a ton for his beet less freight?  It cannot be done, and the Minister knows it.  The only possible way of making the thing pay for itself is to hire slave labour, and that is what is being done in the country by people who were farmers, but who have been reduced by the Government's policy to a condition in which they are little better than slaves themselves.  That would be bad enough if it were an economic proposition.  It would be a heartless thing to make it an economic proposition at that cost. But it is not an economic proposition. It is going to cost, I think, £1,200,000 in direct and indirect subsidies.  So that with that expenditure of money and committed to the principle that the public money ought to be spent in the country, it is spent in such a fashion, at the instance of the Minister for Agriculture, that the people for whose welfare he is responsible are reduced to slavery and destitution, while his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, manages to secure a state of affairs for the industrialists and their employees which is comparative luxury.</P>
    <P>If this country is going to prosper it can only prosper on the foundation of the cattle trade.  Every other branch of agriculture is linked up with the cattle trade.  The milk industry, the butter industry, the preservation of the fertility of our soil, the consumption of our rotational crops, all lead to the same fountain head, and that is the cattle industry.  We condemn the Government for not attempting to secure for that industry a quota which will make it possible for the people to carry it on.  We do so because we are convinced that if the President put his mind to it in the morning he could get a quota to make it possible to carry on that trade profitably and satisfactorily for the whole community.</P>

      <P>Neither was Machiavelli nor Satan.  Not that I would dream of likening the President to the latter.  I have on one occasion likened him to Machiavelli.  The President, speaking recently at the Ard-Fheis, which was rather a stormy gathering, broke into one of his purple passages when the water was getting particularly stormy and we had an oration about the Republic.  I have no doubt that that lock of black hair was shaken into his eye and that he thumped the table and spoke of John Bull.  And then he said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Do you want a trade agreement whereunder we will take from the British manufactured goods in exchange for which they will take more of our agricultural goods?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>and some poor amadán in the back benches, knowing what was expected, said &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  Is not that true?  The Deputy will find very shortly, when it becomes manifest to the people that if the president wanted to make a settlement in the morning he could make it, that the President will say: &ldquo;What about my mandate from the Ard-Fheis? Did I not ask them there assembled from the whole country&mdash; the greatest Ard-Fheis that railway tickets could bring to Dublin; we whipped them up from every corner of the country&mdash;did they want to make a trade agreement, and the voice of Erin spoke from the body of the hall and said `No.' &rdquo;</P>

I point out again to the House that the ultimate prosperity of this country, industrially and agriculturally, depends upon the live-stock industry.  I make no disguise of it that if I had an ideal to set before me in the management of this country I would like to see every man and <Col N="505" /> woman in it secured against the possibility of destitution.  I would like to see every man and woman in it, from the richest man down to the poorest, get from the community a minimum which would discharge the obligation of the community to protect everyone of its members from the possibility of hunger or destitution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the ideal I would set before me.  But in setting that before me, I would think with special contempt and loathing of the cheap politician who would try to buy votes with food.  I would think with special loathing of the politician pursuing the setting up of social services with no other object in view but the buying of votes.  I would convict any politician of that base purpose of setting up social services without first seeing clearly his way not only to set up but to maintain them for all time.  I say it is nothing short of a crime against the people to set up social services with the one hand and with the other hand to destroy the means of maintaining those social services over the years.</P>
      <P>I would like to make available to our people that cover of social services which would provide for every man and woman in the State an absolute and permanent guarantee against destitution.  Having provided that, I would like to leave it to every citizen of the State, man and woman, to go out and by his own initiative to increase his wealth and improve his position if he can.  But in having that ideal before me, I would recognise that in order that the effort should have any hope of being realised, I would hasten to augment to the best of my ability the material prosperity of the State to which we all belong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No member of this Party, and few members of this House would consent to the compromise of one iota of the <Col N="506" /> independence or sovereignty of the Irish nation in order to secure that social service or any other social services. But in the knowledge that we had that sovereignty, as we have had, that we have that independence, as we have had, that we have an absolute right to decide now and for all time what form of Government or Constitution this State will have now and for the future, I would turn my mind to securing for the wealth-producers of this country the best markets that the world can offer them for the sale and realisation of the wealth they are producing.  It is manifest to every man and woman in this House that not only the best market but the only market in which the fundamental wealth of this country&mdash;the agricultural surplus &mdash;can be realised, is the British market.  I would go to that market suffering under no inferiority complex and I would point out to them the advantages of linking their economy with ours.  I would point out to them the hopelessness of offering to our people any material consideration with a view to inducing them to compromise their rights to sovereignty and independence.  I think they have been taught that lesson and no people in the world know better than the British to-day that no material consideration will induce our people to part with any part of their sovereignty, or with any part of their independence.</P>
    <P>And that being secured, as it is secured at this moment, I would go and make the case with them that we ought to put an end to whatever financial difficulty separates us.  In so far as the land annuities were concerned, if I were in the President's shoes, I would say perfectly squarely to them that without yielding my position I would not ask them to yield theirs.  They are just as much entitled to feel strongly that these moneys are due as President de Valera is to take the other view that they are not due.  Surely the matter could be argued before a Court of International Justice who could consider the dispute, though the Minister for Finance in one of his flightier <Col N="507" /> moments has said that if the court were set up and found against them they would not pay in any case.

I have suggested to him that he could do that in the morning, if he wanted to do it. If he could not arrive at an agreement with the British Government on the land annuities, he could make a bargain with them on the basis of compromise.  If he had done that two years ago, he would have saved the cost of the compromise up to now. The President could make a trade agreement with Great Britain, an agreement that would be to the advantage of our people.  It is obviously an advantage to Great <Col N="508" /> Britain to have food supplies close at hand when she wants them.  But the difference between the President's supporters and the rest of the country is that the country knows how to use a negotiating weapon but the President's supporters look upon it as a bludgeon with which to split the skull of the other party to the bargain, and when they cannot do that they bring it home and spend the rest of their time trying to dash out their own brains.  It is a good negotiating point and nobody knows that better than the President.  Nobody is better aware than the President of the case that could be made and the agreement that could be got if he wanted to get it.  But I charge the President here and now that he does not want to settle the economic war.  I charge him that he does not want to make any trade agreement with Great Britain.  I charge him that he wants to keep boiling in this country a war spirit and a war hysteria in order to distract the minds of the people from the things that matter.  I do not know if the President read recently the memoirs of an acquaintance of his &mdash;Mr. David Lloyd George.  He was referring to General Nivelle and he described how that General was planning and organising calmly in February, but he says that, within 12 months, he was a wild dram-drinker from the puncheon of self-confidence. I believe that the President started out with some highfalutin schemes and plans for the reorganisation of the whole country. I believe that a great many of his supporters started out on the same lines.  But he has now become a frantic dram-drinker from the puncheon of war.  Whenever anybody dares to raise his voice to warn him regarding the path he is travelling and the inevitable catastrophe that awaits the policy he is pursuing, the war-cry is raised.  The word &ldquo;traitor&rdquo; is bandied about and the suggestion is drummed into the ears of the people that the country is fighting for its existence.  The Minister for Justice is sent down to Ballina to tell the people there that <Col N="509" /> they are groaning under the weight of the chains of British oppression as represented by the retention of our ports at Cobh and Berehaven.  The Minister for Agriculture is quite right.  That stuff does go down with our people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>At present, I am discussing, or trying to discuss, in face of the Minister's disorderly interruptions, the question of securing a fair share of the cattle market in Great Britain for the farmers of this country.  I have pointed out to the Minister that at present every branch of agriculture is dependent, directly or indirectly, on the cattle trade.  I do not know if Deputies realise the full measure of the catastrophe this Minister's policy is bringing on the cattle trade.  I do not know if the Deputies realise that, while the British Government has put a quota on store cattle and a quota on fat cattle, that Government has been mighty careful not to put a quota on young cows.  Therefore, we have a situation at present arising out of that Minister's policy where, at one end, the foundation stock of the cattle industry is being carried over to England and, at the other end, the calves and the young cattle are being made worthless and are being wiped out.  At the present moment, our cows are going abroad&mdash;our best cows.  Why are they going abroad?  Because the large farmer in Roscommon or Mayo has got to pay his bills or he cannot get his Christmas goods.  He has got to pay his annuity or President de Valera's bailiff will be on his doorstep.  He has got to pay his rates or the Vice-President's bailiff will be on his doorstep. He has, say, six bullocks, a couple of calves and two good cows.  He goes out into his field and looks at his stock.  He says: &ldquo;I had these six cattle at this fair, that fair and the other fair, and I was not asked where I was going. The calves are not worth selling.  There is one animal there I can get a buyer for, one animal I can get a price for, and I have got to get money.&rdquo;  He takes his best cow to the fair.  Deputies are aware that, at the present time, there is no difficulty in getting £15 or £16 for a good, young cow.  Is there <Col N="511" /> any other beast for which you can get anything like that price at present? That individual who masquerades as a competent Minister for Agriculture has so arranged matters that, at both ends, the foundation stock of our cattle industry is being wiped out.  What is being left is not a smaller quantity of good cattle, but the leavings of the entire cattle population of this country. In two or three years, if the present insanity continues, we shall find that our cattle will have gone back to the standard that obtained in this country in 1870, before there was any attempt at all to improve the stock.  It took us many years&mdash;one might say it took us generations&mdash;to build up the quality of our Irish cattle.  If the Minister for Agriculture, by his incompetence, is going to allow that work to be destroyed and leave us&mdash;the people who have got to make our living out of the country no matter what happens; we have got to stay on the ship whether it sinks or floats&mdash;to clear up the mess he will leave after him.&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Whatever name he goes under, he will want to be a Hercules in spirit to do the job the Minister for Agriculture will leave after him. Perhaps it is just as well that, in discussing matters of this character, from time to time, a note of hilarity should <Col N="512" /> be introduced, because the danger of these discussions, which affect the every-day lives of those of us who live in the country, is that we lose our tempers about them and I do not suppose that much good is done by that. Let it not be imagined, however, that I approach this matter in a spirit of levity, because I do not.  I honestly believe that a situation has developed in this country, at the present time, which is going to be desperately difficult to remedy.  It is going to destroy the foundations of prosperity in the country and to make it impossible to carry on the social services or the industries of the country.</P>
      <P>There have been in the last ten years some useful and prosperous industries all over the country.  They depend for their prosperity upon the capacity of the people to buy the goods produced.  I am a farmer, and I am a shopkeeper, and I know what I am talking about.  I say that the consumption of goods largely of Irish manufacture is steadily going down amongst the agricultural community&mdash; the small farmers&mdash;because they cannot afford to pay for the goods.  I know you can keep them going for a certain time, but every responsible man knows that the longer the wastage continues the greater will be the catastrophe in the end.  We ask the Government to realise what is the inevitable result of their present course of conduct.  We ask them to realise that the cattle industry as a whole is the lynch-pin of commerce, and that every other branch is interlocked with it, and that if you destroy the cattle industry you are throwing the whole economy of this country out of gear, with the result that the whole structure will come toppling down about your ears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not, as I pointed out before, a colony.  We are an independent, sovereign nation.  We cannot resort to the expedient New foundland resorted to.  When they brought down their prosperity about their ears they simply handed it over to the British Government and said, &ldquo;Clear up the mess.&rdquo; We cannot do that.  We have to clear up our own mess.  People may say <Col N="513" /> that this is all political window dressing. I want to repeat that I did, with the full approval of my colleagues, what no member of the Oireachtas did since it was founded; I went with my hat in my hand to the head of the Government and I asked him to receive myself and my colleagues, and he would not even discuss the question with us.  I asked him to meet us and let us tell him, in the privacy of his own office, the reasons why we felt it urgent to alter the system of the allocation of licences.  We asked him to discuss with us the possibility of making a trade agreement, even though the economic war went on at the same time, about such commodities as the economic war did not affect, and we asked him, if he thought we were coming here in a panicky spirit, to open the courts to these people and let them go into the courts and let the courts examine and judge individual cases and inform him whether these people were really being driven to destitution.  There was implied in that urgent desire, as clear as day on the part of myself and my colleagues, the offer to the Government of every cooperation we could give in order to avert immediate catastrophe.  And simply because the Government thought it was better political tactics, contemptuously to reject that approach, and to present the picture before the country that we came with our hats in our hands it was turned down.  Perhaps I was a fool to make that request, but I believe that I would be lacking in my duty if I did not make it.  It was not, I suppose, for me or my colleagues to make it. But we asked because we believe that the Government's present policy is driving our people not only into destitution but into despair.  There is no use closing our eyes to things.  If men are driven to despair they will do things that they ought not to do.  If men are driven to despair no counsel of prudence will stay their hands.</P>
    <P>I make my position quite clear.  I am of opinion that no annuitant or ratepayer who has the money to pay should refuse to pay his rate or annuities.  I feel that is not a popular thing to say, but I have said it in the <Col N="514" /> country and I am not afraid to say it here to-day.  I think it is unjust that he should be placed under a statutory obligation to do that.  But considering, and weighing, the evils of not paying, against the benefits, I am convinced that the evils of breaking the law so long as you are able to comply with it far outweigh the benefits, and I am convinced that anybody who has the money ought to pay.  But let me say this, and I am prepared to say it: If the Government attempts under any Land Act, or any other Act, to go to the house of a tenant purchaser in this country who is genuinely unable to pay, and in the name of the law attempts to break up his family and exact payment the result of which may throw him and his family into the poorhouse, I say that man would be a fool if he did not stand upon his threshold and defend his home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>My words will appear in the official transcript of this Debate and I shall repeat them outside anywhere. It is to avert that situation in which you are going to destroy a man's living and practically wipe out his home that we are moving this resolution.  It is to avert the possibility of that situation developing that we went hat in hand to Government Buildings to get a hearing.  It is to avert a situation like that that we have opened up this discussion.  We do not want to make political capital out of it.  If we can help you to get a better quota or to make any settlement with the British Government we are quite ready to do so, and to help you to get that settlement.  It is because it is driven into our minds that you do not want to settle and that you are either ignorant or indifferent to the sufferings of the people that we open up these things here and endeavoured to open them up with the President.  It is in the face of that great emergency that I appeal, not only to the Government but to Deputies opposite.  If they have not the courage to come and vote with us in the Lobby and demonstrate in that way, let them tell the Government <Col N="515" /> that they know that there is hunger and destitution in many houses in the country where there never was such before.  Let them tell the Ministers to their faces that there are small farmers, and weak families, who are hungry, and that hard-working men cannot get the wherewithal to buy the necessaries of life while they have to stand at their doors and see their neighbours walking home with four, five and six pounds of beef in their hands.  But because these farmers are hard-working men, and want to work, they are thrown aside and must submit to have their livelihood wiped out by the Minister for Agriculture. They must submit to see everything they require raised in price by his colleague the Minister for Industry and Commerce and to see their rights and their political philosophy and their belief in patriotism shaken, abused, and bedevilled by President de Valera.  Freedom is abolished politically, industry is shaken, and there is no one in the country who does not know it as well as I do.  Some of you have told the Minister for Agriculture, but you might just as well be telling a feather pillow.  Go and tell the man that runs it.  Go and tell the man who, at this moment, is virtual dictator of this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Jeers are not going to save this, nor are the jokes of Deputy Corry going to affect this issue.  They may be pertinent on another occasion but not on this.  Go and tell the Government what you yourselves know.  Tell the President that the case we make here is a fair case and a just case, and if you were doing your duty by your own constituents you would join with us in pressing the case we are making upon him.  We are ready to give any help we can to avoid disaster in this country and to save not only the prosperity but the very fabric of the State itself.  We are doing all we can to try to open the eyes of the Government at the present moment to the danger of <Col N="516" /> driving people to despair and violence which can result in nothing but the undoing of themselves and of the State as well.</P>
      <P>Nobody recognises that more than I, and it is because I know the mind of these people, because I have lived and been brought up amongst them and realise the old resolute Land League spirit that is in them, and because I realise what a desperate thing it would be to start that thing up again and to stir up another land war, that I appealed to the President.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can go around this country and read my speeches and those of my colleagues and he will see that I warned him when he was starting that infernal Land Act that he was starting a land war.  I warned him of the danger of doing it and that if it was once started it was more than he or I could stop.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But the thing can be stopped; the evil can be remedied without resorting to the insolent back-chat such as we have had from the Minister for Agriculture. That is the language of a &ldquo;Buckshot&rdquo; Forster, and it will not work in this country, and if you tell farmers who are driven half to madness that you will soon stop them, you will damn soon find that you will not succeed.  It is that kind of damn-fool blatherskite that is largely responsible for the situation that is developing in this country.  Do not try to exasperate the people.  They are suffering under terrible stress at the present time, and as a result of their distress they have been driven to do certain things. Possibly, if I were under the same stress, I should do the same things myself.  I know that they were wrong, but for heaven's sake do not exasperate them further.  Show them that you have some understanding of their trials and difficulties.  Do not be jeering at them and threatening them.</P>

Let us try to find a common ground on the basis of ameliorating the difficulties under which the small farmers of this country are living, and by joining in an assurance to them that their difficulties are understood, that their distress is appreciated, that demands will not be made on them which it is physically impossible for them to meet, that the Government is going to put its back genuinely into the business of finding some way of making the carrying on of the agricultural economy of this country possible, and that they will not stop at one thing or another in the exploration of the whole question but that they will be glad to open negotiations with Great Britain or any other body with a view to securing a wider and better market for our agriculture, which is the ultimate foundation of all the prosperity which this country can ever hope to enjoy.</P>

      <P>I can remind the Deputy that his split shirt is a cold job for the winter.  Now that Deputy Dillon has made his exit, let us examine this remedy that Deputies Curran and Dillon have found for the farming community. Here it is:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="518" />&ldquo;That the Dáil condemns the Executive Council for its neglect to secure a quota for export of cattle to Great Britain adequate to the needs of our agricultural industry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I note that all the farmers are leaving the House.  I suppose they are all going back to the bullock.  Let us examine that remedy side by side with present day conditions of this market which the President is to be condemned for not seeking.  I shall not go into any fancy figures at all in order to show what this market is.  I shall give you an extract from a sub-leader from yesterday's <i>Daily Mail</i> which tells of the conditions of this great market that we are asked to go over and beg for. It is headed &ldquo;The Beef Problem,&rdquo; and here is how it starts:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The first of the great cattle shows which precede Christmas, that at Norwich, is over; the second follows at Birmingham this week; and the third opens at Edinburgh next week.  Though these displays all prove that the quality of British cattle is higher than ever, and though a hopeful spirit is abroad among farmers as the result of our present national policy of protection and subsidies, the position of the livestock industry is still one of no little difficulty.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The price of beef has fallen so low that the farmer cannot sell his fat stock with any profit, despite the subsidy of 5/- per cwt. which is now being paid by the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the market that you are to beg for&mdash;the market that the British farmer, himself on the dole, cannot sell his own stock in at any profit despite the subsidy of 5/- a cwt. from the British Government to try to help him dispose of his own stock.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHolohan" hpid="Mr. Holohan Mr. Holohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Holohan</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>About 38/-.  The article continues as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;For this state of affairs there are three causes.  The first is insufficient restriction of imports.  The second is change of fashion, which in many households has brought the abandonment of the big Sunday joint.  The third is depression in the heavy <Col N="519" /> industries, whose workers were, thirty years ago, large consumers of beef.  The first of these causes can be eliminated at the expiration of the various Trade Agreements into which this country has entered.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That shows, I suppose, that the Canadians and the Australians are going to get an increased market!</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... A tariff of 20 per cent. on Dominion meat and 40 per cent. on foreign meat would give British agriculture fair play.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the market that the Executive Council are to be condemned for not looking for&mdash;that market in which the English farmer cannot sell his beef at a profit, even though he gets a subsidy of 5/- a cwt. from the British Government; and the increased quota that we are going to get is very fairly outlined here when it says that as soon as their agreements with the other Dominions lapse they are going to see that we are going to be further restricted in our quotas.  They are going furthermore to put a tariff of 20 per cent. on that produce.  That is the market that we are asked to pay £5,000,000 a year for.  That is the market that is going to fatten the farmer, make him pay his rates and annuities and have money for jam. That is the market about which we hear the baby of the Dáil going into high jinks here all night.  I cannot call it anything else.  He worked himself up into such heat that I was afraid on a few occasions I would have to go over to hold him.  Deputy Dillon made some comments on Deputy Cooney's knowledge of agriculture. Well, Deputy Cooney was raised on a farm in South Armagh.  Deputy Dillon did his farming in a window box in North Great George's Street.  He sowed his wild oats in the King's Inns and he comes here to tell us all about it.  That is the market, as I say, that we hear all the noise about.  Deputy Dillon came along with his deputation consisting of three Deputies of this House who boasted that they could pay their annuities but would not. That was the deputation that the President was asked to interview, yet <Col N="520" /> Deputy Dillon gets up here with his tongue in his cheek and says that he advised anybody who could pay to pay. Let him give that advice to his own colleagues over there.</P>

      <P>We have lost through the quota system a market for 40,000 stall feeders in Britain at this price.  They would consume about 10,000 acres of oats if you fed them well and 10,000 acres of turnips.  We hear all this moaning and groaning here on behalf of the cattle industry, but we apparently forget altogether the position that existed in this country about which, of course, Deputy Dillon and Deputy MacDermot will do the Pontius Pilate and wash their hands saying: &ldquo;I was not here then.&rdquo;  The position was that a farmer down in my county found himself with a farm valued at £50, carrying ten cows, and he was deprived of the market on which that valuation was based, whilst another farmer in another part of the country, with a similar farm, had a valuation of £15 to £20.  The benevolent Government that was here at that time said: &ldquo;Yes, close your eyes and compete with the ranches in Australia, Canada, and every other country in that market.  You will have to compete with them here at home.  If you want to grow wheat, you can grow it even though you have to compete with them.&rdquo;  The valuation of land valued as wheat growing land was three or four times the valuation of land that was valued as fit only for rearing cattle. <Col N="521" /> That was the condition of affairs that existed in my constituency for the ten years while Cumman na nGaedheal were in office.  Of course all that has been forgotten now.</P>
      <P>I can speak here with a mandate from the farmers, because I was elected by the farmers.  I was elected by the farmers in the last three months on the most restricted franchise possible.  No man was allowed to vote on that franchise except a farmer.  There were 33 candidates and I was elected as the farmers' representative at the head of the poll.  Therefore, I can claim that I speak on behalf of the farmers, the farmers who, if we are to take the word of Deputies opposite, have been two years looking for a chance to kick us out of office, who have been two years groaning and moaning under the scourge of the Minister for Agriculture. When these farmers were asked to elect representatives, seven representatives from Cork County, they elected seven members of Fianna Fáil, and not one representative of the groaners, the moaners and the howlers.</P>

Deputy Dillon said that the reason we were still supported was that the President was going around with the baby of the republic in his arms. During the last 12 months I had the pleasure of hearing the late leader of the Party opposite speaking one night.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>To get rid of the bad policy of the Government that you supported during the past ten years.  What remedy did that Government propose for the farming community that was then left with this only market, this glorious market?  When our farmers were sending their produce to that market its value was reduced by £13,000,000 in five years.  The remedy found for that by the last Government was this: pay us the annuities and we will hand them over to Britain, not half of them, but the whole of them. That was the attitude of the then <Col N="523" /> Government in spite of the fact that the value of our farmers' produce sent to that market was reduced in value by £13,000,000 in five years.  What bargain did the late President make for the farmers and what reductions did he get for them?  When he went over to England to ask not for a reduction by 50 per cent. of the annuities, not for the wiping out of the annuities, but for a moratorium on £250,000, what happened?  His request was refused, and he was told to get back and pay. That was the bargain that the people opposite made for the farmers.  They were prepared to go over with their hats in their hands, to beg, to cringe, and to crawl, and that was the reply they got from John Bull at a time when the income of the farmers of this country who had been sending their produce to England was reduced by £13,000,000 in five years, and at a time, too, when the Government then in office was asking the farmers to pay not half the annuities, but the full annuities, not half their rates, but their full rates.  I remember that at that period I sponsored a motion here seeking a reduction of £1,000,000 a year in rates, and what was the attitude of the Deputies opposite when it came before the House?  They walked into the lobby to vote against it, and said that the farmers were so well off that they did not want that money.  Now they come along here and talk a lot of tripe.</P>

What occurred when the present Government came into office, when the economic war started and the farmers had not lost one penny?  You had the ranchers and the supporters of those opposite cutting the wages of their labourers by 4/- and 5/- a week and ordering them out in the night to cut trees, telegraph wires and to block the roads.  Those who encouraged them to do that remained in bed themselves and when these men were brought before juries composed of farmers afterwards it was not the people who encouraged <Col N="524" /> them to do that but these labourers who were found guilty.</P>

      <P>The farmers have an alternative market at home, and it is there for anybody who is prepared to take off his coat and work.  Anyone who is not prepared to work let him get out, and let somebody else take his place.  I admit that it is not an easy job to change the system of farming in this country, but this has to be remembered: that we now have a market that can be protected, and that will be protected for our own farmers, just as the British Government are protecting their beef market for their own farmers.  I am not going to say that there is any great profit in the <Col N="525" /> prices that we are getting.  But if prices are not good enough we can improve them, but not by holding out to the farmer a reed that is of no use to him.  It has been of no use to him for the past five years.  During the last five years the prices for fat cattle on the British market would not meet the cost of production.</P>

      <P>No farmer could continue to produce them at the prices paid during the last five years.  I gave up trying to do it myself, and I think I was a wise man.  Five years ago I got rid of my bullocks and kept heifers which paid me.  Deputy Dillon made a statement here to-night in which there is no truth whatever: the statement that all our milch cows were going abroad. Deputy Dillon's knowledge on this is not very reliable, because I can tell him that the export of dairy cows and heifers has not increased.  On the contrary, our cow population has greatly increased.  Deputy Dillon gave us a very moving picture to-night of the poor man who was left with his bullocks and his calves and his pigs&mdash; the man who could sell nothing, and in the end had to drive away his only cow. I could almost see the tears running down Deputy Dillon's cheek when he was telling us the woeful tale about the small little farmer who was left with his six bulls and two cows.  No doubt, when Deputy Dillon goes to tell one he tells a good one.  This kind of a story was rather overdone.  There will probably, within the next twelve months, be a step made in the direction of which Deputy Dillon was speaking&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would respectfully suggest that an agricultural wage is a bit nearer to the motion than talk of the Republic and all the rest of it which we heard all night from other Deputies.  However, I will keep to the motion and absolutely to the motion.  A motion has been brought forward here condemning the Executive Council for its neglect to secure a quota for the export of cattle to Great Britain.  That is the motion. That motion is absolutely answered in the quotation which I read here to-night&mdash;the quotation which states that that British market which all the noise is about, and which the Executive is to be condemned for not looking for, is so bad that to use their own words:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the price of beef has fallen so low that the farmer cannot sell his fat stock with any profit despite the subsidy of 5/- per cwt. which is now being paid by the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They have a suggested remedy, which <Col N="527" /> I would advise Deputies opposite to study, and to end once and for all trying to dupe the unfortunate farmers, an odd one of whom still pretends to believe in them.  They say here that the first cause is insufficient restriction of imports, and their suggested remedy for that is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The first of those causes can be remedied at the expiration of the various trade agreements into which this country has entered.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So much for future fat stock markets in Great Britain.  The second suggestion is &ldquo;a tariff of 20 per cent. on Dominion meat&rdquo;&mdash;this Dominion that Deputy Dillon was so afraid of his life we would get out of.  Take for example Canada, where every public meeting is started by singing &ldquo;God Save the King,&rdquo; with the Union Jack flying over them; even the loyal Canadians are now going to be charged 20 per cent. on their meat coming into Britain, according to yesterday's <i>Daily Mail.</i>  Is that the market for the unfortunate farmer of this country?  It is no wonder that the old shadow Minister for Agriculture opposite, Deputy Belton, shook his head in despair, and moved himself over here on the middle benches. It is no wonder.  I am not at all surprised to see Deputy Belton's removal from the post of shadow Minister for Agriculture, but I am very much afraid that when Deputy Dillon, who appears to have stepped into his shoes, comes along with his policy for agriculture the farmers down the country will not have much thought of it.  I do not believe he would even get the vote of the man with the two cows and six bulls.  Even that man would not vote for that kind of market for his six bulls.  That is the position, and that is the market. I would suggest to Deputies that that is not the kind of market any Executive should be condemned for refusing to purchase at £5,000,000 a year.  I do not want to go outside the motion, and I do not want to infringe further on the time of the House.  I think I have put the case as fairly and as honestly as possible.</P>

      <P>That attitude is not the remedy for it.  The remedy lies in the plough, and in endeavouring to change farmers from the system into which they were misled during the past nine or ten years.  Farmers will have to change their system.  I know that that will cost money and that it cannot be done in a day.  The problem of the Government is to remedy that position. They must tackle it.  A remedy <Col N="530" /> will have to be found.  I am prepared to agree with one statement made by Deputy Dillon, that the position of agricultural workers will have to be placed on a solid foundation; they will have to be put, at least, into a position where they will not be at the absolute mercy of any slave driver who comes along.  We will also have to stabilise in some manner our agricultural industry.  It may cost money, and may be a hard thing to do, but it can be done.  If the problem is faced with courage we will succeed.</P>

      <P>It is easy to stabilise the farming industry.  I suggest that we should take courage and do it.  It will not be done by paying £5,000,000 yearly for a market across the Channel. That will not carry us very far.</P>

      <P>I agree that they will not stabilise the farmers' position. There is a way to stabilise the farming industry, and it would be better that Deputies opposite should look for some constructive proposals, and put them up to the Government instead of talking thrash and nonsense, and that on the part of people who never followed farming as a trade, who spent one and a half hours crying and moaning over a trifle of that description.</P>

      <P>I should like Deputy Corry to tell the House where the Continental markets are to be got for our produce.  Belgian buyers will be buying cattle in the Dublin market to-morrow at 16/- per cwt., while men in the export trade to Great Britain are supposed to pay 25/- per cwt., and, in addition, to pay a tariff of 12/- per cwt.  The President said that the British market is gone and he thanked God for it.  Deputy Corry says that he has a new market.  Where is it?</P>

      <P>We are told that the country is going to be saved by growing wheat.  If these Deputies had as much experience of the growing of wheat as I have had, it would not be mentioned.  In the eighties, when the seasons were bad, farmers who grew wheat in Wexford, which is the model country in the Free State, from which the Minister for Agriculture comes, could not save it because of the damp climate.  It sprouted before it was cut.  It was Providence during the last two years that gave us good wheat.</P>

      <P>Wexford is not a ranching county.  A farmer there with 50 acres of land generally employs six or seven hands as the system there is one of mixed farming.  I know a farmer whose wife and two daughters work 14 hours daily.  Yet we are told of the great industries that have been started in backstreets where girls and children are employed at 3/- or 4/- a week.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corry in his speech stated that the farmers put him at the head of the poll at the elections.  They did not know him as well then as they do now.  If they got the chance to-day they would not put him at the head of the poll if he told them that they must turn away from cattle raising and produce corn.  Can the Deputy say whether mixed farming or corn growing gives most employment?</P>

      <P>I tell the House and Deputy Corry that the sooner the economic war is settled the better for this country.  The unfortunate farmers are pressed to pay the full annuities by the British Government, while President de Valera says they are only asked to pay half of them. Between the two Governments the farmers are being crushed out of existence, as they have to pay the annuities one and a half times yearly instead of once.  The farmers are told that their salvation lies in growing beet at 30/- a ton.  I am sure they have not much experience of beet growing in Cork.  When they know as much as I do about beet they will realise that it is not economic at that price.  Throwing slurs on the Blue-shirts and things like that will not get us here or there.  The sooner the people put their heads together to do what is good for the country the better.  It seems to be a great thing to suggest that a man is a West Britisher if he looks to the British market.  Where is the alternative market?  I am not sure that the majority of the people are aware that on every pig fattened for the factory the producer has to pay 7/- to the Government.  The people do not know of that tax.  Take the case of an agricultural labourer with a thrifty wife who fattens six pigs yearly. That unfortunate man has to pay a tax of £2 2s.  Very little is known about that.  But for the action of the Government the country would be well off.</P>
