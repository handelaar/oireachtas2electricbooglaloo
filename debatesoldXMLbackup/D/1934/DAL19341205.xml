    <Speaker pid="PeadarSeanDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that since the amalgamation of the transport service the existing bus services in the City of Dublin are inadequate in certain areas, and if he is in a position to state what are the reasons for this state of affairs, and what steps, if any, he has taken or proposes to take to bring about an improvement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the difficulties normally to be encountered in a large-scale reorganisation of <Col N="535" /> transport facilities such as that in which the Dublin United Tramways Company are at present engaged have been aggravated by certain factors including (1) the low state of repair in which many of the vehicles transferred were found to be; and (2) the uncertainty as to the future which continued representations against the transfer of licences involved.  I have no reason to think, however, that the difficulties which have been encountered will not be surmounted in due course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>(for Mr. T.J. Murphy) asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will make special arrangements to dispose of all pending appeals under the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933, before Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible for the Unemployment Appeals Committee to dispose of the large number of appeals which have been received before Christmas.  I have, however, made special arrangements by which, pending the consideration and decision of appeals by the Unemployment Appeals Committee, the cases in which appeals have been lodged will be reconsidered by unemployment assistance officers in the light of the existing decisions given by the Unemployment Appeals Committee, and where the facts so warrant revised decisions favourable to the applicants will be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say whether, when a decision is delayed in a case of this kind, back payment will be made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no legal authority for back payment in such cases.  The appeals referred to in the question are appeals against refusals of a qualification certificate or appeals in respect of assessment of means.  Payment can only be made to a person who has received the qualification certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it possible for the Minister to make some arrangement by which a person, who has been signing <Col N="536" /> for unemployment assistance for some months past, but has not yet received any benefit, may be given some consideration in connection with relief schemes for work on which they are not eligible unless they are actually in receipt of unemployment assistance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Until the Unemployment Assistance Appeals Committee have decided otherwise, a person who has been refused unemployment assistance is to be deemed not to be entitled to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that farmers with fairly high valuations are being employed on some of these schemes while men who have applied for unemployment assistance, and whose cases have not been dealt with, are refused employment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing of which I am aware is that the instruction is that preference in employment is to be given to persons in receipt of unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider varying that instruction to such an extent as to allow officers of local authorities to give consideration to cases in which it is shown to them that the applicant has been signing for assistance for three or four months but has not received it?  The Minister's Department knows there are cases of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible that there are such cases but such an instruction would obviously be interpreted to mean an instruction to give a preference in respect of employment to persons who were in possession of such means as not to entitle them to unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>But where it appears to the local officers, and to the local manager, that it is a case in which benefit will ultimately be paid, would the Minister give some discretion to the officers of local authorities to offer employment in that case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In each one of these cases, the local officer has already decided that benefit is not payable and the appeal is against his decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="537" />
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that that is not really the position. In the cases I know, the local employment officer has sent the file of correspondence to the head office for decision and he has no responsibility for the withholding of benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister further aware that there are a number of cases in my own constituency in which men with qualification certificates have been signing on and have not received their unemployment assistance and that, in these cases, we have had to give home assistance to the men although they are not eligible for employment on relief works?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In each case, the appeal is not to the Unemployment Assistance Committee but to the local court of referees and if the local court of referees decides in their favour, benefit is payable as from the day on which it should have been payable originally.  I cannot imagine that there is any considerable delay in dealing with cases by the local court of referees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan (Clare) Mr. P. Hogan (Clare)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan (Clare)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must know that in cases sent to the Committee here, on the question of means, people have signed as many as 22 times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that in Cavan at the present time there are cases of exceptional hardship that cannot get qualification certificates?  There is a case under appeal at present and yet nothing has been done.  Is the Minister aware also that there are factories closing down in Cavan while factories are being opened elsewhere?  As an instance, is he aware that the factory which supplied him with shovel handles, and which he gave at the last election as an election present, is now closed?  I could give him several instances, but that is one in particular.</P>

      <P>I understand that the particulars given as to rates for parcels carried by road by the Great Southern Railways Company are correct.  The railway company state that the rates in operation up to 30th November were unremunerative.  The settlement of a <Col N="540" /> schedule of charges for merchandise carried by road by railway companies is a matter for the Railway Tribunal under the Road Transport Act, 1933. The Act provides that any person interested shall have an opportunity of being heard by the Tribunal when any proposed changes are under consideration.</P>

The value of re-imports of these commodities re-imported during the year 1933 and during the seven months of 1934, was £17 and nil respectively.  It was found that to a small extent meat on which export bounty had been paid was re-imported free of duty into Saorstát Eireann, a procedure open to obvious objections. The purpose of the Order is to make such a procedure impossible.  Licences have not been applied for nor issued under the Order.</P>

As the statistics relate to the country of consignment, which is not necessarily the country of origin, the country of origin cannot be stated.  The commodities to which the Order applies have not previously been subject to customs duty on importation.  As the Order has been made for the furtherance of the production in the Saorstát of the commodities dutiable thereunder, the duty has been fixed at a rate which it is anticipated will render it unprofitable to import the commodities, duty paid, <Col N="555" /> and no revenue is therefore expected to accrue from such imports.  Steps are being taken to establish a factory for the manufacture of the dutiable commodities in Saorstát Eireann, as hitherto the Saorstát was dependent upon imported supplies.  Licences for the importation of the commodities dutiable have been granted for a limited period to firms who have hitherto imported these commodities. The quantities so licensed are restricted to the normal importations by these firms during a corresponding period prior to the imposition of the duty, and will be discontinued as soon as facilities for the manufacture of the dutiable commodities are available in Saorstát Eireann.  The object of the Order has been to prevent forestalling prior to the provision of these facilities. The quantity imported under licence is approximately 1,033 cwts. Subject to the foregoing conditions all applications have been granted.  I am not prepared to give the names of the persons or firms to whom licences have been granted.</P>

      <P>I understand from the wording of the Deputy's question that he is concerned only with the number of estates which have been definitely valued as suitable for acquisition; and not with the larger number which have been the subject of preliminary inspection.</P>
      <P>(a)  Since the 1st January, 1933, in County Sligo, 22 estates have been inspected and valued with a view to acquisition and division by the Land Commission under the Land Acts 1923-33.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  In ten of these estates, prices have been offered to the owners for voluntary purchase or the lands have been gazetted for compulsory purchase; and in two of the ten estates prices <Col N="564" /> have been agreed on or fixed.  In the same period, offers have been made or the lands gazetted in respect of 13 additional estates in County Sligo which had been inspected prior to the 1st January, 1933, and in four of these estates prices have been agreed on or fixed.</P>
    <P>(c)  Fourteen schemes of land division are at present being prepared by inspectors in County Sligo; and 11 schemes which have been prepared are under consideration by the Land Commission. These include residues of estates already partially divided.</P>
    <P>(d)  The present staff of Land Commission Inspectors stationed in County Sligo numbers five, consisting of one inspector in charge, one Grade II inspector, and three Grade III inspectors. The Land Commission staff in any area is not a permanent quota; officers are moved from district to district as the necessities of the work may require.

The other estate appears to be that of Denis Bowes Daly and comprises lands at Carrowrevagh, Bookeen South and other townlands.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is aware, under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act, 1932, orders made thereunder cease to have statutory effect within eight months from the date of the making of those orders unless they had been previously confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas.  The purpose of the present Bill is to give permanent statutory effect to the duties imposed by the various Orders enumerated in the schedule to the Bill.  A number of the Orders which appear in the schedule <Col N="570" /> would cease to have statutory effect after the 28th February, 1935, and it has therefore been considered desirable that the necessary confirming Bill should be introduced at this stage, so that there will be no danger of adequate parliamentary time not being available for the progress of the Bill. Advantage has been taken of the introduction of the Bill at this stage to include in it several orders which, in the normal course, have longer currency than those expiring on the 28th February next.  In view of the dates of certain of these orders, it would not be practicable to give permanent statutory effect to the duties to which they relate in the ordinary financial resolutions or in the principal Finance Act of the year.  It is proposed, therefore, to include them in the schedule so as to obviate the necessity of introducing a Bill or Bills in the course of the next year.</P>
      <P>This Bill takes the same form as the previous Emergency Imposition of Duties Act, 1933-34.  These orders are set forth in the schedule and briefly the subjects to which they relate are as follows:&mdash;Order No. 32 relates to boot, etc., laces, elastic, buttons, tape and tape holders, electric wires and cables, vegetable oils and fats, safety razor blades, agricultural forks, automatic machines and statuettes; Orders 42 and 43 are designed to prevent an abuse which has arisen in connection with certain industrial and agricultural products upon which on export a bounty or subsidy was paid.  The practice grew up, not very extensively, but it would, I have no doubt, rapidly develop, under which manufacturers exported certain industrial or agricultural commodities upon which bounties have been paid, disposed of a portion of them abroad.  Then as these articles were of Saorstát origin they were reimported free of duty though those who had previously exported them received a bounty in respect of them.  Orders 42 and 43 are designed to prevent that practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, bacon, poultry, and eggs in shell.  Orders 44 to 50 cover tanks, not for military use, but <Col N="571" /> for domestic purposes, cisterns, drums, etc., yarns partly of wool or worsted, rope, cord twine, etc., nursery produce, dead rabbits.  Order 51 relates to Emergency Duties imposed upon sugar on the 12th October last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to Order 51 it might be desirable that I should make the position clear in regard to that order. The House will remember that on the Second Stage of the Sugar Manufacture Bill, in July, 1933, in discussing the protection which would require to be afforded to the new beet sugar company, I emphasised that as the company would be in the position to supply the major portion of the country's requirements, it would be essential, in estimating the measure of protection which might be necessary, to have regard to the fact that sugar constitutes an important source of revenue.  I indicated that the excise duty on home manufactured beet sugar which had hitherto been exempted would have to be imposed, and the customs duty on imported sugar increased so that the revenue from sugar would be substantially maintained.  In my forecast of the additional duties which would have to be imposed to meet the requirements of the Exchequer, I stated that these might be such as to involve an increase of as much as ¾d. per lb. in the price of sugar to the consumer. In February last year, in order to counter the dumping of sugar, the Executive Council, by Order under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act, imposed an additional duty of 4/8 per cwt., that is, ½d. per lb., on imported sugar, bringing the customs duty up to 16/4 per cwt.  A subsequent examination of the position immediately before the opening of the new sugar factories disclosed that a protective tariff of at least 16/4 per cwt. would be required to enable the new industry to establish and maintain itself.  Every effort was made to secure a reduction of this figure, but owing to the fact that the new factories will not operate at their highest efficiency during their first season protection for the full amount indicated was unavoidable. Furthermore, in order to enable the new factories to dispose of <Col N="572" /> all their products between now and the opening of the new campaign, a Quota Order was made restricting the imports of sugar to a very small fraction of what had hitherto been the normal quantity during this period.  By the operation of this Quota Order, the normal inflow of revenue from the customs duty on sugar was reduced to vanishing point.  Accordingly, it became necessary to consider the amount of excise duty which the sugar from the new factories, which were about to come into production, would have to bear as from the date upon which these factories commenced operations.</P>
    <P>As I have already pointed out to the House, I indicated in July, 1933, on the Second Stage of the Sugar Manufacture Bill, that the erection of the new factories might involve an increase of as much as ¾d. per lb. in the cost of sugar to the consumer.  The protection which had been previously offered to Carlow sugar in February last has resulted in an increase of ½d. per lb. in the price to the consumer of foreign-manufactured sugar.  An excise duty of ¼d. per lb. was accordingly imposed on Irish-manufactured sugar.  This is the only tax which the sugar from the new factories carries. In order to preserve the minimum margin of protection, of 16/4 per cwt. required by the new enterprise, there was a corresponding increase in the customs duty on foreign-manufactured sugar.  Owing, however, to the operation of the Quota Order to which I have referred, the new customs duty will be productive of very little revenue.  As the result of the rearrangement of the customs and excise duties, I am advised that the total revenue from sugar for the current financial year will be £85,000 less than the original estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This Imposition of Duties Bill now before us gives us an opportunity of raising matters which, in my opinion, are of grave constitutional importance and also which reflect on the purity and decency of the public life of this country.  I want to draw attention first to certain extracts from the debate that took place in this <Col N="573" /> House when the Emergency Imposition of Duties Bill was passing through in 1932.  On that occasion the Minister for Finance and the President of the Executive Council were closely questioned as to why they sought the very wide powers which the Emergency Imposition of Duties Bill was calculated to confer upon them.  In column 1187, volume 43 of the Official Debates, Deputy Bennett spoke as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Will the Minister give us an undertaking in relation to this measure that, if the Bill comes into operation, it will not be used to impose any further burden on the already over-burdened farmers of this State?  I want an assurance from the Minister as to that.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance replied:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The powers of this Bill, as I have said, will be used primarily to open up new channels of trade and establish, if necessary, new industries here.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Bennett then said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Yes, but what about industries already here?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>And the Minister's reply to that was:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As I said, the object of the Bill is to recoup ourselves for any losses which we may suffer as a result of the present British penal legislation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now, there is no question or suggestion in that exchange that the Government had it in their mind to use the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act for the purpose of arrogating to themselves the right, hitherto reserved to Oireachtas Eireann, of raising revenue through the Finance Act or through financial resolutions adopted by this House.  In column 1247, the President of the Executive Council intervened in the debate and said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;With regard to the Bill, the Executive Council is taking the fullest powers in order that, should occasion arise, it may be able to avail of these powers for a single purpose, namely, defence of the interests of the country.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, here is a solemn undertaking given by the President of the Executive Council; that he is taking exhaustive powers for a single purpose&mdash;defence <Col N="574" /> of the interests of the country. Deputies will remember that the representation made in introducing this Bill was that tariffs were being put on by Great Britain against Saorstát Eireann and that the Government of Saorstát Eireann must be furnished with powers to put on retaliatory tariffs.  The President emphasises that and says that he &ldquo;seeks these powers for a single purpose.&rdquo;  The President went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It has been suggested that we are going to abuse these powers. Of course, we know that they could be abused, but the guarantee that they will not be abused is in the fact that the Dáil is master of the situation ultimately.  As evidence of our good faith in the matter, we have accepted the recommendation of the Seanad which makes it possible for the Dáil to be assembled at any time on a requisition of the majority of the members.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What a valuable guarantee!&mdash;77 members who, speaking through their spokesman, Deputy Donnelly, say:&mdash;&ldquo;The only policy we have is to catch hold of the tail of the President's coat and follow him wherever he leads.  We are all agreed on that.&rdquo;  And Deputy Jordan said: &ldquo;We are all agreed on that, but what that is we do not know.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenJordan" hpid="Mr. Jordan Mr. Jordan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jordan</NameTxt>
      <P>Most profound!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And this is the guarantee&mdash;after the President runs amok, the gentlemen running amok at his coat-tail are to march in defence of the constitutional rights of Oireachtas Eireann.  The President concluded by saying:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;When we are taking powers it would be stupid not to take powers which would cover every kind of action which might conceivably be necessary.  But simply because you take powers which might conceivably be necessary it does not follow that you are to use those powers on all occasions.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the language there employed by the President, reinforcing the assurances given by the Minister for Finance, is as clear as any two Executive Ministers could give to this <Col N="575" /> House.  It is a clear, definite statement that the powers conferred upon them under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act will be used for no other purpose but to counter fiscal action taken against this country by Great Britain.  And after all these protestations and assurances we discover that, when the Minister for Finance is short of revenue, the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act is called into requisition and employed for the purpose of raising revenue.  Of course, the Minister for Finance meant to be in a position to say: &ldquo;Anything I did in connection with the imposition of duties on sugar was done for the purpose of building up industry in this country.&rdquo;  On this occasion, however, not only did the President run amok, and the 76 loyal supporters run amok with him, but &ldquo;Truth in the News ran amok as well and, to the astonishment of all be holders, told the truth.  The Propaganda Bureau in Government Buildings was set in motion and they published a statement which appeared in &ldquo;Truth in the News.&rdquo;  The end of the statement reads as follows: &ldquo;The rate of 2/4 per cwt.&rdquo;&mdash;which the House will remember is the excise duty imposed under this Emergency Order, not the customs duty&mdash;&ldquo;the rate of 2/4 per cwt.&mdash;one farthing per pound&mdash;was decided upon as the lowest which could be imposed having regard to the requirements of the Exchequer.&rdquo;  Not having regard to the requirements of the industry or to the requirements of a successful prosecution of the economic war, but having regard to the requirements of the Exchequer! And the Bill brought before this House for the purpose of confirming the imposition of this excise duty is a Bill which bears upon its face nothing but 21 sections, each one of which consists of the words &ldquo;Emergency Imposition of Duties (No. &mdash;) Order, 1934,&rdquo; and it is suggested to the House that that provides Oireachtas Eireann with a sufficient opportunity of considering the methods by which the Government is raising revenue, when every Deputy in this House knows that not 2 per cent. <Col N="576" /> of the Government Deputies know or care what the terms of the Emergency Imposition of Duties Order (No. 51) is.</P>
    <P>I believe that there is no precedent, since the time of the Stuart Kings in Great Britain, for an attempt by the Executive to raise revenue by decree, and this House should realise that if the Government are going to be allowed to raise revenue indefinitely under the powers conferred upon them by the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act, 1932, there is no necessity for this House to meet, because they can carry on the Government of the country without ever calling Oireachtas Eireann together at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has read the Bill and he is well aware of the fact that within eight months of the decree of an Order it lapses unless it is confirmed by legislation.  Is the Deputy in error in that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has an indefinite power to go on imposing new duties.  The Minister can raise his revenue for these eight months on sugar, and when that lapses he can proceed to raise it from tea.  That is putting it very plainly.  The Minister could raise his revenue from one group of commodities in the first eight months and another group in the next eight months.  He could proceed from one group to another group almost indefinitely.  I have no doubt it would be a cumbersome method of raising revenue, and it is a grave inroad on the constitutional rights of this House. It is furthermore a deliberate betrayal of the undertakings given to this House by the President and the Minister for Finance when they sponsored this Bill. The action of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance in imposing this excise duty under the powers of the Bill constitutes a betrayal of their undertaking and convicts them of a deliberate intention of deceiving this House when they were recommending the Bill for the acceptance <Col N="577" /> of this House and of Seanad Eireann subsequently.  I have no hope that the 76 gentlemen&mdash;and ladies&mdash; who are tied to the coat tails of President de Valera will take any action to defend the rights of this House, but it is necessary that the people of this country should know the nature of the legislation that Fianna Fáil has forced on Oireachtas Eireann, and the manner in which they are employing that legislation, having got it by deceiving the House here and by deceiving the Seanad as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I tell the Minister that by the time I have finished, and by the time I have read the Minister's correspondence, he will pray to God that I had never opened up on it, because it took me a long time to catch him, but I have managed to catch him at last.  I have a letter here from you, but you did not know that you were writing it to me when you wrote it.  The Emergency Imposition of Duties Order, No. 32, provided for the imposition of a duty on bootlaces, and it gave the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Finance power to permit the importation of bootlaces free of duty where they should think that necessary.  I ask the House to remember that when I last raised the question of licences in this House I charged the Minister for Industry and Commerce with discriminating between merchants who sought these licences, although the circumstances under which they sought them were identical.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce angrily repudiated that suggestion.  The Minister for Finance went so far as to say that the law made such discrimination impossible. He was wrong.  I immediately said to him: &ldquo;Will you take steps to introduce a Bill into this House or to amend the Bill we are at present considering <Col N="578" /> in order to place a legal obligation on the Minister to deal equally with merchants who apply to him in identical circumstances&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>So have I, and I have a lot more which I propose to read to the House in a couple of minutes.  The Minister for Finance, having been challenged on that, turned querulously to his colleague and, if I might lapse for a moment into the vernacular, he got a flea in his ear, and very shortly afterwards stole out of the House and left the Minister for Industry and Commerce triumphant on the field of battle, saying nothing.  My charge was that discrimination was being used.  I shall now cite two specific cases in which discrimination has been used as between two merchants.  The first case is one which is dealt with in a letter addressed from the Trade and Industries Branch of the Department of Industry and Commerce, Lord Edward Street, on 7th August, 1934, under the reference &ldquo;T.I.D. 1294/3046.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That letter notified an applicant for a licence to import bootlaces free of duty that the Minister was not prepared to alter the decision already conveyed in the Department's letter on 24th July, signifying the Minister's determination not to grant a licence. The application on that occasion was made in respect of bootlaces, which had been ordered and despatched from the North British Bootlace Co., Glasgow, prior to the making of the Emergency Imposition of Duty Order, No. 32.  The bootlaces were in the hands of the carrier when the Order was made and by the time they reached the port of entry, they were debarred from entry by that Imposition of Duty Order.  The licence was refused.  I know that another merchant in this country made a similar application.  He was asked the same question that the addressee of the letter which I have just read out was asked and that was, were these bootlaces consigned before the Order was <Col N="579" /> made.  He replied as the addressee of the letter replied: &ldquo;Yes, they were.&rdquo; He got his licence.</P>

      <P>Now, what happened? I want the House to be clear on this: On the 24th July the addressee of this letter wrote to the Minister explaining that the bootlaces were lying down in the Customs shed, having been consigned prior to the imposition of the duty, and asking for a licence.  The Department wrote back and said: &ldquo;We cannot&rdquo;: that &ldquo;the Minister has decided not to give a licence.&rdquo;  The addressee of the letter wrote to the Minister, or to the Department, stating that the goods were consigned before the duty was put on and that this was surely a case when his power should be exercised.  After the lapse of a fortnight in which the matter was considered and turned over in the Minister's mind, and carefully digested, when doubtless numerous other applications had reached him, and when he had the whole picture before him, he writes on the 7th August: &ldquo;No; we cannot change our mind in this matter.  You must pay the 80 per cent&rdquo;&mdash;or 100 per cent., I think it was&mdash;&ldquo;duty on these bootlaces.&rdquo; The duty was paid, and the goods were imported.  Suppose the Minister's rather tenuous tale be true&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not admit that he issued a licence for the free importation of bootlaces?  Here is a case in which he refused, on repeated application being made, the result of which is that you have No. 1 man in a street selling bootlaces on which he has paid one hundred per cent. tariff, with No. 2 man in the same street selling bootlaces on which he has paid no tariff at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one case.  Now I come to another case, and this is even more flagrant and more scandalous still. Under Emergency (Imposition of Duties) Order No. 33, the Minister imposed a tariff of 80 per cent. on elastic.  I ask the House to bear specially in mind that I made two charges against the Minister on a previous occasion.  One I have already outlined.  The second was that he was giving a licence to an entrepreneur to bring in tariffed goods and act as a wholesale distributor of these goods within the tariffed boundary long before they were in a position to produce goods of a Saorstát manufacturer. Therefore, you had a situation where an entrepreneur who set up in a back room in Dublin could import under licence while a merchant who had been importing a particular commodity for 50, 60 or 100 years was put at an unfair advantage as compared with that entrepreneur who had only set up a few weeks before.  On the 14th August the Minister wrote the following letter, under the reference T.I.D., 1294/3046, to a firm which had applied for a licence to import elastic free of duty. The letter stated: &ldquo;With regard to elastic, the Minister is not prepared to <Col N="583" /> recommend the issue of a licence for free importation, as supplies are obtainable from Messrs.  So-and-So, in such-and-such a street, in Dublin.&rdquo;  I take it the Minister does not want me to name these firms.  I have given the reference numbers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not care whether you do or not.  I am not denying that letter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The firm which was seeking to buy elastic wrote to the people to whom the Minister had instructed them to apply for supplies and it got this answer:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We enclose herewith samples of elastic as requested.  There will be a discount of ... off marked prices for ten gross lots.  We hope to be manufacturing similar numbers in the Free State within the next couple of months.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now, the firm which had written to the Minister has been importing elastic into this country for the last 70 or 80 years, while the people to whom they were referred by the Minister for Industry and Commerce had nothing to do with the elastic or with the sale or distribution of elastic up to about six months ago.  The firm applying for a licence to import elastic wrote this letter to the Minister:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We have received your letter dated August 14th, informing us that you are not prepared to recommend the issue of a licence for the free importation of elastic as supplies are available from Messrs. So-and-So, No. 12 So-and-So street in Dublin.  We have received a letter from Messrs.  So-and-So to-day offering us foreign elastic and stating they would not be in a position to supply elastic of Saorstát manufacture for at least two months. Speaking in Dáil Eireann recently you emphatically repudiated the suggestion that while traders were refused licences to import certain commodities free of duty other individuals who held themselves out as manufacturers were given such licences and were allowed to offer <Col N="584" /> for sale that merchandise in this country.  We have been importing elastic regularly for many years and would be glad to know from you now why Messrs.  So-and-So are entitled to import elastic on terms more favourable than those available to us.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That letter remained unanswered for a week and then on the 30th August the following letter was issued from the Minister's Department:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to refer to your letter of the 22nd inst. relative to the importation of elastic and to inform you that the general question of the issue of licences for the free importation of elastic has been under consideration and that the Minister is now prepared to consider the issue of licences on receipt of the following particulars: (a)  certified statement of your importations for the 12 months ended the 30th June, 1934, giving quantity and value; (b)  full particulars of the consignment in respect of which application for a licence is now made giving quantity and value; (c)  port of entry and name of shipping company or carriers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is an absolutely watertight case, convicting the Minister of doing the very thing which he declared was unthinkable three weeks ago in the Dáil.  What I want to drive home to this House is the infinite difficulty in getting details of those cases.  If I went to any merchants and asked them to put that correspondence in my hands they would absolutely refuse to do so, because they know perfectly well that putting facts of that kind before the House would mean that the Minister would practically close down upon them, and refuse to give them any licences in the future.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking of some entirely irrelevant insertion in the newspapers but of the correspondence which I have read for the House, clearly convicting the Minister of doing what he undertook not to do; clearly convicting the Minister for Industry and Commerce of having discriminated as between two merchants under the powers conferred upon him by the Imposition of Duties Act; of grossly abusing those powers, and of deceiving this House.  My statement is that the correspondence which I have read here proves that case to the hilt, and my suggestion is that when I have been able to bring before the House conclusive proof that such things have happened, the House is entitled to assume with me&mdash;unless the Minister is prepared to rebut my presumption absolutely&mdash;that those things are happening in hundreds of other cases, and that the persons to whom they are happening are either afraid or unable to publish the facts before the country. I said, prior to the Minister's last interruption, that to get facts of this kind is fearfully difficult, because merchants will not put them in your hands lest the Minister or his Department should visit their temerity upon them.  The facts laid before the House now are laid before it with profound reluctance.  Because I felt it was essential to make known the true facts <Col N="586" /> to the country, I myself applied to the Minister for the licence here referred to.  This correspondence here passed between the Minister and myself, writing in the name of the firm of which I happen to be managing director.  But for that, search as I might, I could not bring those facts to light, nor could I carry conviction to the Deputies of this House that such transactions were going on under the veil of secrecy.  I now repeat my demand to the Minister that this system of licences be brought out into the light of day, so that the people of this country may be given an opportunity to make up their minds as to whether the powers conferred upon the Minister under the Imposition of Duties Act are being properly used, and whether substantial justice is being done as between one citizen and another in connection with the applications which they make to the Minister's Department for exemption under the Orders to which I have referred.</P>

I have repeatedly said in this House that I am glad to think there is no gross corruption in the public service of this country to date, though I do believe there is political corruption, inasmuch as a strong political supporter of the Government, backed by influential Fianna Fáil Deputies, will get a readier <Col N="587" /> and more generous hearing for applications made under this Licensing Act, or the Cattle Licence Act, than the ordinary citizen would.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

Let him put up no dummies for the purpose of knocking them down for the edification of the <i>amadáns</i> from the country.  The charge is clear and explicit; it is that the Minister did not do substantial justice between two citizens of this State.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister intervenes in my speech, and asks whether this is the sole ground for the allegation of gross political corruption which I made in Limerick.  I asked him to quote my speech, and the Minister replied that he was quoting it.  What I said in Limerick and in this House was that if this system of licensing under cover of anonymity goes on there will arise in the country a monster of corruption which other States are finding it hard to break down.  I said, and repeat, that I am glad to think that to date there is no gross corruption in the public service, but I do believe there is political corruption of a certain kind.</P>

      <P>Now we pass to Emergency Order No. 43.  In that connection quite another aspect of this whole problem presents itself.  It is only right that the country should know why this Order was imposed.  The House listened to the Minister for Finance speaking on the Second Reading of this Bill, when he made a rambling, involved and mumbled statement as to why those Orders were imposed.  He did not take the House or the country into his confidence as to why Order No. 43 was imposed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take the country into my confidence as to why the Order was imposed.  It was imposed because the Government discovered that, in the fullness of their own wisdom, they had devised a system of bounties and tariffs which made it profitable for a man to cure bacon in Limerick, to export it to Liverpool, and to bring it back again and to sell it in <Col N="589" /> Cork.  The situation to-day is that it is worth a man's while to cure bacon in Limerick and to ship it to Liverpool before selling it to a man in Kilmallock. In order to meet that situation, the Government imposed a special duty to prevent a system of carting of our produce to and fro between Great Britain and Ireland to collect bounties, with a view to making an artificial and preposterous profit, which arose out of the folly of the Government's own transaction.  It is right that the country should know the position to which the trade, agriculture and every other industry of its citizens are to be reduced by the Government.  The country does not know that, and Deputy Victory does not know it.  The Deputy is living in the happy illusion that everything is going on well, like wedding bells.</P>

      <P>The Chair has apparently heard the point.  I must apologise.  I did not.  I made the case primarily for two reasons, one, in connection with the sugar Excise duty, to protect the constitutional rights of this House, and, in connection with licences, to bring home to the Minister vividly the urgent necessity of putting an end to a system whereunder such things as I have described could happen.  I am convinced that if such things continue to happen public confidence will be sapped and grave public district of the morality of them aroused, not merely in Ireland, but throughout the world.  Such abuses do obtain in other countries.  It will be almost an irremediable disaster if they are allowed to develop here.  It is because of that, that I have ventured to deal at some length with the Bill at present before the House.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to deal with all the Emergency Orders, but I should like to direct the Minister's <Col N="590" /> attention to the fact that the frequency with which they are issued has created extra trouble and has incommoded many traders in cities and towns.  As a matter of fact I could call the Minister's attention to many cases where Emergency Orders have been issued overnight, and like Deputy Dillon, I could produce correspondence to show that orders given for certain commodities on the 1st of the month have been held up on the third or fourth of the month, because Emergency Orders were introduced in the meantime.  I feel that the Minister would not like to incommode shop keepers or traders, if it was proved to him that these Emergency Orders were a restraint on trade, and I suggest that he should apply the soft pedal in relation to their introduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two cases were brought to my notice in Cork last week.  In one case the customs authorities put on a charge of 2/10.  When the proprietor of the firm concerned returned from lunch he interviewed the authorities, and they informed him that he had been undercharged. When the merchant pointed out to the customs officials that he should not be charged at all, a reference to the schedule showed that he was right in his contention, and the 2/10 was refunded.  I want to give another instance, which I hope the Minister will take notice of, as I intend to bring it to the notice of his Department at an early date.  In the meantime, he should consider whether it is worth while handicapping an industry which was founded in Cork, and which has ramifications all over Great Britain and in many parts of Europe.  I refer to the industry carried on by the very old established firm of Booth and Fox.  By virtue of good organisation, efficiency, and all the other qualities that are necessary in business, the firm reached a stage when they were able to send out goods, value for thousands of pounds, to Great Britain and to continental countries. They were the originators of the manufacture of eider-down quilts.  What do we find to-day?  The firm is very seriously handicapped because of some of these Emergency Orders.  It <Col N="591" /> endeavours in every way possible to support Irish industry, but cannot get in this country the necessary material for the better class article.  For the cheaper class goods, certain suitable textile goods can be had, but for the high-class trade they cannot get the kind of textile required.  Because of that, and because of the imposition of duties, they are seriously handicapped. While I feel that the Minister is serious in endeavouring to create a situation where firms will be able to produce most of the commodities they require, and while I also feel that he is sympathetic to a firm which had built up a very big trade, even before the Free State was established&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>The Imposition of Duties (Confirmation of Orders) (No. 2) Bill relates to Orders Nos. 32 to 52, most of them in restraint of trade&mdash; I have no hesitation in saying that.  I was endeavouring to relate some of the things in these Emergency Orders to <Col N="592" /> the whole situation in relation to tariffs.  I want to keep as far as I possibly can within the Rules of Order, but I submit that I am entitled, in relation to these Orders Nos. 32 to 52, to which this Bill relates, to relate the position brought about, not alone by some of the Emergency Orders, but by the whole policy in relation to tariffs.  I do not want to delay the House or to say much more on that matter but I will repeat this: the Minister might apply the soft pedal in these matters.  I know of many cases where hardship has been brought about.  I brought those cases to the notice of the Minister's Department. I prefer to do it that way first.  That has been my policy since I came here&mdash; to bring matters to the notice of the Government Department concerned rather than first bring them to the notice of this House.</P>
      <P>I will say, in relation to these Emergency Orders, that they have been very injurious in their effects.  I think most Deputies are conversant with what occurred in Carlow.  Certain matter were mentioned by Deputy Dillon, but surely the Minister must be aware of the position created in Carlow, where a factory was supposed to be established for the manufacture of certain commodities and where the Order was forestalled to the extent that already a three years' supply of that particular commodity is in the country.  I will give credit to the Minister for this, no matter how I may differ from him politically, that I believe he is quite serious and quite sincere in his intentions.  At the same time, I feel that he has made many blunders in connection with these Orders.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of them.  I have not the particular ones with me at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Every one of them. As a matter of fact, they are coming now with such frequency that I merely glance through them and then throw them in the waste paper basket.  I am sure many Deputies will agree that it <Col N="593" /> would require not alone one clerk but two or three clerks to keep pace with the Minister's Orders.  In fact, the ordinary traders do not know where they stand from one week to another. You may ask any small trader in Dublin or Cork what he thinks of the Minister's Orders from day to day, and, indeed, if the Minister did so ask, the reply would probably be an education for him and would give him some enlightenment on the position.  I can indicate several small traders from Cork who do not know where they are in relation to these Orders.  I seriously suggest to the Minister, in all good faith, that he should put on the soft pedal; he should not keep rushing the trading community from one week to another, putting them in such a position of doubt that they do not know where they are.</P>
      <P>The Minister surely must recognise this&mdash;he has some knowledge of business&mdash;that if he gave an order for a certain commodity which is not manufactured in this country, let us say an order for hats or any other commodity in the drapery trade, and having given that order he finds overnight an Emergency Order has been issued putting on a tariff of 50 per cent. or 60 per cent. and compelling him to apply for a licence before he can get the goods in, he would be put in an extremely embarrassing position.  The Minister has been a business man, but, as I understand, he severed his connection to some extent with business.  I am sorry he has done so, because I believe if he had kept in touch with ordinary business he would realise how injurious it is to keep introducing Emergency Orders almost night after night.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will have this opportunity.  It is usual <Col N="594" /> when substantial Customs duties are imposed to hear from the Minister for Finance what their effect will be from the financial point of view.  If the position is that the duties that are imposed by these Orders are intended to develop industry, then the House would expect that the Minister for Industry and Commerce would be on his feet to tell us what these Orders were going to do for the development of industry in the country.  Why, the very rate at which the unemployment figures are rising ought to pull him out of his seat.  The Minister for Finance told us nothing about the revenue effect of these tariffs.  The people of this country woke up when the Minister for Finance produced his financial statement on the 31st of March last to find that the Minister had lifted out of their pockets £1,500,000 more than he told them at the beginning of the financial year he was going to take. Is the Minister for Finance during the current year lifting, through these Orders, out of the pockets of the people and without the people realising it another £1,500,000 more than he told them at the beginning of this financial year he was going to take? The House is entitled to know whether that is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce is in a position to supplement the information, or fill up the gap in the information left by the Minister for Finance.  He can tell us to what extent he has issued licences in every single case in which licences were asked for under these Orders, and to what extent there are any of these Orders under which he has not issued licences for the free import of articles. I think it is a very brazen thing on the part of the Government to introduce a measure of this kind, if it is going to raise revenue, and not tell the House what revenue it is going to raise.  When these Orders were issued the atmosphere was created by the Government that the effect of the Orders would be to develop a number of industries throughout the country. One would expect that the Minister for Industry and Commerce would have told us something about them.  I would like to hear from the Minister <Col N="595" /> what exactly is to be the manufacturing effect of these Orders.</P>
    <P>At the time these Orders were issued the Government, it would appear, issued an official statement.  It announced with reference to Order No. 32 that laces and elastic factories were to be set up in Ennis.  I think it suggested that, under Order No. 34, a factory for the manufacture of buttons was to be established in some place which at that time they were not able to specify; that, under Order No. 36, there was to be established at New Ross a factory for the manufacture of electric lighting cables and wires; that, under Order No. 37, there was to be established at Drogheda a factory for the manufacture of oils and fats; and that at Enniscorthy we were to have a factory for the manufacture of razor blades, brought about by Emergency Order No. 38.  It is whispered abroad that, under Emergency Order No. 45, there is to be a factory for the manufacture of electric lamps at Bray.  I do not know whether it is Emergency Order No. 46 or not that is developing the meat factory at Roscrea. The Ministerial Press told us that there was to be a rope factory established in Kildare; that the workhouse premises had been got there and that the work was well advanced. That, no doubt, was to be brought about in the atmosphere of Order No. 48.</P>
    <P>I say again that it is an extraordinary thing that these Orders should be enshrined in a Bill and the Bill brought before the House, without any statement from the Government as to what exactly is likely to happen to the manufacturing side, and the question arises as to whether we have arrived at a point at which the Minister is simply blindly issuing orders&mdash;that his experience is such that he does not know exactly what is going to happen &mdash;and chancing what is going to happen, but that he is not going to put himself in the position of making promises which have to be withdrawn again, in the same way as the Minister for Education withdrew the whole series of election promises that were issued some time ago.  Again, on the <Col N="596" /> question of licences, every single one, or, practically, every single one, of these Orders contains a provision that licences may be issued for the import of these articles, according to the Minister's wish, without payment of duty.  In reply to a whole series of questions to-day, the Minister said that he was not-prepared to give information regarding businesses carried on by individual firms.  The Minister may feel that he has a certain responsibility in keeping the names of individual firms private, but surely that is no reason for stating to this House that he is not going to tell them anything, good, bad or indifferent, about what is happening in the matter of licences under each and all of these Emergency Orders?  Either the Minister has a policy which is enshrined in these Orders or he has not; either he expects something to develop in the line of Irish industry as a result of them or he does not.  He ought to tell us one or the other.  There is one question I should like the Minister to answer.  In each of these Orders, is there anything that should cause a rise in the price of the articles specified in them beyond what the price of these articles was before the Orders were issued?  The Minister has a duty to this House which he has made no attempt to discharge, and I would ask him to discharge that duty.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The various points on which Deputy Mulcahy wants information have, I think, all been dealt with more or less in the explanatory statements which were issued to the public through the Press when the various <Col N="597" /> duties were imposed.  A number of the duties, of course, imposed by these Emergency Orders, are properly the concern of the Minister for Agriculture, and some of them are the concern of the Minister for Finance, in so far as they are designed to serve either agricultural or finance policy.  The duties which were imposed for the purpose of facilitating industrial development, and which are operating to that end, are those in respect of which I can give the Deputy a certain amount of the information which he desires.  On the general question of the amount of revenue likely to be secured as a result of these duties, it is not possible, for a reason which was given to the Deputy in a reply to a Parliamentary Question, to give any precise figure.  In the case of most of the commodities covered by these Orders, precise information as to the value of the imports of them into the Saorstát in previous years is not available, because they were not subject to a separate classification on the import list.  It can be said, however, that in so far as these duties are designed to protect industries, the revenue to be secured from them will be very slight indeed.  In fact, the operation of some of them will reduce the revenue heretofore enjoyed by the Exchequer, because of other and lower duties which applied to these goods.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon, of course, at the outset of his speech and as a mere preliminary statement, alleged that the main consideration behind these duties was to enable the Minister for Finance to get revenue without consulting the Dáil.  The net effect of all the duties which were imposed by the Emergency Orders which are confined by this Bill is to reduce the revenue which the Minister for Finance might, and did, anticipate from Customs duties during the course of the year, as the Minister for Finance himself explained in his speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of correction. I made no such allegation as the Minister suggests I made.  In special reference to Emergency (Imposition of Duty) Order No. 51, I criticised the raising of revenue as evidenced by the official statement issued by the Government <Col N="598" /> Information Bureau and pointed out that the President of the Executive Council had given an explicit undertaking to Dáil Eireann, when the Bill was passing through the House, that the Act would not be used for the purpose of raising revenue or for any other purpose than to combat tariffs put on by Great Britain in the prosecution of the economic war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Minister for Finance, with great patience and great clarity, explained in such words that even Deputy Dillon must have been able to follow his meaning, that the effect of the changes in the duties on sugar brought about by the Emergency (Imposition of Duty) Order No. 37 and the corresponding changes that took place at that time, would be to reduce the estimated revenue from sugar by £85,000 in this year.</P>

      <P>The Minister interrupted me frequently, and if he has the courage to face the same interruptions that I had to face, he will hear me. An Excise duty of 2/4 a cwt. was imposed on sugar which hitherto bore no duty and which was protected by the Customs duty which the Minister for Finance was in process of altering and which he now alters and proceeds to raise revenue; whereas under the old arrangement the Customs duty was left untouched and no revenue would have accrued.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

The factory for the manufacture of buttons, established by the Irish Button Co., Ltd., is located at Whitehall in Deputy Mulcahy's constituency.

      <P>At this stage we deal primarily with the principle of the measure, and in dealing with the principle of the measure I should like to deal with the very unprincipled speech which Deputy Dillon delivered himself of.  He commenced his speech by reading a number of extracts from statements made by the Minister for Finance and the President on the occasion of the passing into law of the Emergency (Imposition of Duties) Act and tried to hang on to these statements a general allegation that the Government had secured the passage of that measure by fraud, by deceiving the House as to the effect of it, and deceiving the public as to the manner in which the powers conferred upon them would be used. The statements bear no such interpretation. Even the extracts read by the Deputy bear no such interpretation.

      <P>These extracts which he read did not bear the interpretation which he tried to force upon them. What were the extracts?  We had a speech from the Minister for Finance in which he stated that the powers of the Bill were going to be used to open up new channels of trade and establish new industries.  Are they not being used for that purpose?  Is there any other design behind the various Orders made under the Bill except to open up new channels of trade?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>May I be allowed to speak without interruption?  It was also stated that the Bill would be used to recoup ourselves for the losses which we now suffer from British legislation.  That is what we are doing&mdash;recouping ourselves for the losses of trade which may have followed from the action taken by the British Government by establishing new industries, new opportunities of employment, new sources of wealth within the country.  The President said the powers of the Bill were going <Col N="603" /> to be availed of for the single purpose of defending the interests of the country.  That is what they are being used for.  To attempt to read into that statement, or into the statement of the Minister for Finance, an undertaking of some kind, which the Deputy did not explain, is obviously an attempt to mislead the House now as to the obvious meaning of the speeches that were delivered on that occasion.</P>
      <P>However, I want to deal more specifically with the charges of political corruption which Deputy Dillon has on this as on the previous occasions thrown out with great liberality. There are more ways by which the development of Irish industry can be sabotaged than by knocking trees across the road.  Deputy Dillon, by the method of these wild allegations of political corruption, is engaged in the same design, and is working with the same purpose, to sabotage Irish industrial development, as actuates those who have other and more direct methods to that end.  It is not the first time that Deputy Dillon made charges of corruption, made allegations here that the licensing system was being used, as he said, to give favours to the Government's political friends to the detriment of the Government's political opponents. The Deputy made these allegations here before.  But this time he came out in the open and endeavoured to support his charges by evidence.  He never went so far as that before.  In the past his charges were always based upon general statements without any evidence to substantiate these general statements in a single particular though frequently he pledged his word and honour here to the House to produce evidence and failed to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>On the 19th June, 1934, as reported in the Official Debates, Volume 53, No. 2, column 657, Deputy Dillon gave his word here to produce this evidence.  I interrupted the Deputy in the course of one of these wild speeches of his in which he alleged that licences were being issued <Col N="604" /> because of political considerations and that corruption was the determining factor which operated in the giving of the licences.  He said that various influences were being exercised and that favours were being given to his political supporters by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I then asked the Deputy to give specific cases.  I said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I think the Deputy had better get away from generalities and mention some specific case.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Mr. Dillon said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I will give the Minister any particulars he may require.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Lemass: I am asking them now.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then there were one or two interchanges of a similar character and then Deputy Dillon delivered himself as follows:&mdash;</P>

      <P>Mr. Lemass: I suggest to the Deputy that he should refrain from making general charges.</P>
      <P>Mr. Dillon: It is a well-established rule in this House that the name of any individual should not be publicly mentioned unless the individual is here to defend himself.  The Minister wants a specific case.  I will send him several.  Is that fair? If I do not send them he can get up here on the next stage of the Bill and say that I made general charges and was not able to substantiate them.  Well, he did not send them.</P>

The Minister said across the House to me: &ldquo;If you give me the names I will read them out&rdquo;; and later he said: &ldquo;If you object to the publication of the names of licensees how can you ask me to indicate to whom the licences were issued?&rdquo; The Minister then said that if he did not get these names he would take it that the charges could not be substantiated.</P>

      <P>I would like to be allowed to develop my point.  The incident to which Deputy Dillon refers took place on the 7th August of this year. The matter of which I am reminding him took place on the 19th June, when Deputy Dillon undertook to supply evidence in the case of several charges he made.  He said he would substantiate them.  The charges made then were similar to the charges he made now.  But he did not substantiate these charges.  He did not attempt it.  He did not send a single word or message of any kind to me to substantiate the allegations he made on the 19th July, though he agreed that if he failed to do it I could get up here at a further stage and say that he had failed to substantiate his charges and fling them back in his teeth.  He did not substantiate these charges although <Col N="606" /> his speech now is full of charges of gross corruption.  He failed to prove his original charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will.  He said gross corruption.  On the 19th June the Deputy spoke of gross corruption, and Deputy MacEntee said &ldquo;if the Deputy charges the Government with corruption either for votes or money he should produce some proof and ask for an inquiry,&rdquo; and Deputy Dillon said: &ldquo;Charge you with political corruption! I have spent the last half-hour charging you with political corruption.  You are rotten with it.&rdquo;  That is the type of allegation Deputy Dillon has been making not merely in this House but outside it.  I asked him to produce evidence, and he did not do it, although he contracted in public to produce that evidence in private.  He did not do it. His whole speech was based upon the assumption that he could produce evidence. On the 7th August I reminded him that he had not produced the evidence. I told him that he had failed to fulfil his previous promise.  He pleaded on that occasion that it took him a long time to get the facts, and then he said: &ldquo;I have them at long last; here they are (waving a sheet of paper at me).  I will send them over to him in about two minutes, but I will send them over to him in my own handwriting.&rdquo;  The Deputy left the members of the House under the impression that the charges were contained in the documents that he was holding in his hands and that he was sending them across to me.  He did not do so. No evidence was submitted to the Department and no attempt was made to substantiate the charges.  No opportunity was given to the Department to conduct an examination to prove the untruth of these charges.  Deputy Dillon made these wild charges, and he did not confine himself to making the charges here.  He continued his campaign of seditious libel outside the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Representatives of both these organisations had discussed with me the circumstances relating to the issue of licences for the commodities to which Deputy Dillon was referring, and were fully informed as to the position.  I ask Deputy Dillon why he did not produce in relation to the second of the two <Col N="608" /> cases to which he referred, the same information that he had about the first case&mdash;namely, the date on which the licence was granted.

He had not the moral courage to stand up and admit that he had no evidence, and he had recourse to that mean subterfuge of promising to send evidence on and then not doing so.  What are the cases to which he referred to-day?  One was the case of a man who wanted to import bootlaces and was told he could not get a licence to do so, and the other was the case of a man who got a licence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There were two cases.  One was a case of bootlaces and the other was a case of elastic.  I shall tell the Deputy the manner in which the licensing power in respect to the importation of bootlaces and elastic was operated.  These duties were imposed before the factory was constructed to manufacture these goods because we anticipated&mdash;and, as events proved, rightfully anticipated &mdash;that information concerning the intention to construct such a factory was common amongst certain traders and that efforts would be made to bring in large quantities of these commodities in an attempt to forestall any duty to be imposed and get the benefit, if benefit there would be, of such forestalling for the profit of the persons concerned.  Certain firms placed orders for abnormal quantities of both laces and elastics.  If they had succeeded in their efforts to bring these abnormal quantities of goods into the <Col N="610" /> country, the prospect of establishing a factory for their manufacture would have to be postponed for about two years, because sufficient laces and elastics to meet all our requirements for that period would have been available in the country.  The duty was imposed, therefore, before the construction of the factory was commenced and as soon as the various necessary, preliminary arrangements for the establishment of the industry had been completed.  The instructions which I issued to my Department and the instructions which were acted upon by my Department were that wherever they had, in the preliminary period, clear proof that laces or elastic were in transit to this country in normal quantities by firms normally engaged in the importation of these articles, licences for their importation should be issued, but where there was evidence that orders for elastic or laces had been placed after the duty had been imposed or for quantities which were abnormally large&mdash;the Revenue Commissioners could supply information as to normal importations&mdash;applications for licences should be refused and that, subject to what I have said during the whole of the period intervening between the imposition of the duty and the coming into production of the new factory, the business of importing elastic should be confined to the particular firm which was constructing the factory.  That may have been good policy or it may have been bad policy. I am quite prepared to discuss that question at any time but I do not think that anybody could base upon that decision an allegation of political corruption or an allegation such as Deputy Dillon tried to make&mdash;that the firm concerned were getting that concession because they were political supporters of the Government, whereas they were a foreign firm coming into this country under a licence under the Control of Manufactures Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The circumstances of the two cases are exactly the same. That decision was made because there were a very large number of small concerns in this country importing laces and elastic in small quantities and it was considered that there would be very considerable administrative inconvenience in operating a licensing system under these circumstances.  It was decided to adopt a system&mdash;this is the practice in the majority of European countries in which a licensing system is in operation&mdash;of nominating a particular importer or importers to import the quantities normally required and to sell them, subject to certain conditions, one of the conditions being, that the prices should not be increased&mdash;that is to say, that the importers should continue to get the imported commodities at the price at which they would have obtained them if a licensing system had not been brought into operation.  We tried that system in relation to laces and elastic and, during that period of trial, all applications for licences were refused. When we decided that that system was not working as satisfactorily as we should have liked, we terminated it and all applications for licences to import were granted.  I want Deputy Dillon to support his allegation not by comparing a refusal of an application in one period with the granting of an application in another period but by evidence of divergent treatment in two similar cases in the same period.  He has not been able to do that.</P>
      <P>In the case of elastic, to which the Deputy referred, the company building the factory&mdash;it was the same company&mdash;was at that time being treated as the sole importer of elastic and not alone was the application of the Deputy's firm refused but the application of every other firm was refused. Without seeing the document received by the Deputy, I should say that it is a stencilled document such as was sent out to all firms applying.</P>

      <P>Precisely the same reply was sent to every applicant, no matter what his political opinions were&mdash; whether he was a political supporter of the Government or an opponent of the Government.  When that experiment in operating the licensing system terminated, every person who was entitled to a licence to import commodities on the ground that he was previously engaged in the business of importing them, was given a licence for the full normal quantity without consideration or regard to his political affiliations.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon is a new member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  He has come into that Party newly, and knows very little of its history.  If he did know that history he would hardly have the face to come here and make the allegations he has made.  I wonder did Deputy Dillon ever hear of a circular issued by my predecessor in the Department of Industry and Commerce to the English flour millers soliciting subscriptions for Party funds after that Government had refused protection to the Irish millers?  I suppose he did not ever hear of a similar circular to other English manufacturers engaged in exploiting the home markets to the detriment of Irish manufacturers? He should at least note the company in which he is now sitting before he throws out allegations of this nature.  People in glass-houses should not throw stones.  A Deputy on the Front Bench opposite is making some noise; possibly he has indulged in some observation that I have not been able to grasp.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have told you.  I want any Deputy opposite to produce for me any published statement made by a single responsible body of traders or manufacturers in this country, to the effect that they have reason to be dissatisfied with the administration of licences on the ground that there is unfair discrimination between one applicant and another.  I do not mind what allegations Deputy Dillon makes. We expect such things from him.  I <Col N="614" /> do not complain that he is supported by Deputy Mulcahy.  Deputy Mulcahy, of course, cannot let his colleagues down.  But if these gentlemen are serious, let them produce from any association of manufacturers, from any chamber of commerce, or any association of merchants, statements showing that they are dissatisfied with the licensing system as administered by my Department, statements that will in any way support the allegations made by Deputy Dillon and they will be investigated. I made that challenge before but they did not take it up.  I said before and I repeat, that if such allegations are made in a serious manner, by any responsible organisation of business men in the country, I shall agree to have the minutest possible inquiry made so that the allegation, and everything associated with it, will be brought to the light of day and Deputy Dillon's charge of political corruption finally disposed of.  I will not waste the time of the officers of my Department, and of people associated with the public service, who have their work to do, investigating these allegations simply because Deputy Dillon thinks fit to make them.  I have given the Deputy a challenge. If he is serious in his charges, let him take up that challenge and he can have the investigation which he pretends to want.  Perhaps when he starts out to avail of that opportunity and comes into contact with business men who have had dealings with the Department of Industry and Commerce in these matters&mdash;men who never were and never are likely to be political supporters of the Government&mdash;he will get an idea of the impartial and efficient manner in which the Department of Industry and Commerce is now conducted as compared with the way it was administered a short time ago.  Deputy Dillon said that if he were to produce the names of firms who made complaints as to the manner in which licenses were issued they would be victimised and would never again get licenses to import any commodities. That is the type of charge that Deputy Dillon would make.  That is the manner in which his mind is bound to <Col N="615" /> work.  I say that if Deputy Dillon believes he can substantiate any such charge in the slightest way, I shall give him the fullest opportunity for investigation.  I would remind him of this fact: He is not the only Deputy in this House who has got those complaints to make.  Other Deputies in his Party have got similar complaints but, instead of making them the basis of groundless charges here, they come to my officers, put their case before them and get every satisfaction or a reasonable explanation.  Other Deputies in Deputy Dillon's Party, with a livelier sense of decency than Deputy Dillon has shown, have taken that course.  There are other Deputies in the Party opposite to whom firms come with their complaints, without the slightest fear of victimisation because of making these complaints. These Deputies have no hesitation in coming direct to the officers of my Department who administer the licensing provisions and putting their information before these officers.  They have a full explanation given them as to the course of action taken by the Department.  Quite frequently, Deputies, with the information supplied by the firms, are able to secure changes by affording new information not previously available, or by placing before the officer concerned a new aspect of the matter that had not been previously considered.  If Deputy Dillon will consult members of his own Party likely to have received complaints, and who have been in contact <Col N="616" /> with the Department concerned with these complaints, he will find that what I say is true.  But Deputy Dillon would take no great pains to find out the truth because, if he did, he could no longer sling his mud across the House and could no longer give vent to his bitter venom.  The Deputy made many of those accusations on other occasions and ran away from the task of substantiating them. His effort in that direction to-day discovered a mare's nest.</P>

      <P>Not merely do I believe that I have convinced every member of the Dáil that there is no basis for the allegation that political corruption was responsible for my giving a licence to import either of the commodities the Deputy mentioned to one firm, and refusing it to another, but I am also satisfied that the organisations concerned&mdash;the Merchant Drapers' Association and the Federation of Irish Industries&mdash;are so satisfied. The Deputy might be well advised to try to establish contact with responsible men and hear the opinions and views of responsible men before he comes into this House again to make another wild speech such as we have had from him on so many occasions.</P>

      <P>We in Cork welcome this Bill.  I would like to avail of this occasion to correct any false impression that may have been created during the short discussions that took place earlier.  The impression seems to have got abroad that the Cork County Council was an exceptional sinner because of the way it selected its committees; in other words, that it was entirely biassed in the selections made because a certain political Party formed the majority on it.  I want to say that if that were so&mdash;the position is one which I challenge, although such statements have been made here&mdash; it would, if you like, be simply returning <Col N="623" /> the compliment made by a certain section of the Cork Corporation.  I would ask the Minister to consider introducing a measure similar to this in relation to other public bodies because I regard the principle underlying it as a very good one.  It so happens at the moment that a certain political Party, because they have a majority on the Cork Corporation, have the appointment of certain committees, some of them of an administrative character. If the principle enshrined in this measure were applied a little more generally it would be very acceptable in various quarters of the Cork Corporation, because the recent elections proved that those in opposition to the Fianna Fáil Party there secured the largest number of votes.  Yet, notwithstanding that fact, not one of them was elected to a position on the various committees administered by the Cork Corporation.  I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should inform the Minister for Local Government that, in my opinion, this will be a very popular measure so far as it relates to Cork County.  I would suggest that he should go further and make it applicable to the Cork Corporation and other municipal bodies.</P>

      <P>The producer has no safeguard in the Bill as it stands, and I suggest that this amendment is necessary for his protection.  Without the amendment he will be liable to prosecution and, if found guilty, to severe penalties.  Those who have a knowledge of the dairy industry are well aware that it very often happens during certain seasons of the year and in certain parts of the country that the milk which a cow gives may not be up to the standard prescribed.  For instance, in a case of the morning's milk, if a sample is taken in the morning and another sample in the evening, it is quite likely that a discrepancy may be found between the two samples as regards the butter-fat content.  Producers will be placed in a very serious position indeed if they are not afforded the protection which this amendment seeks to give them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the amendment moved by Deputy O'Donovan.  As the Deputy has stated, if some such safeguard as this is not inserted in the Bill, producers will be placed in a very unenviable position.  It is a well-known fact that many healthy, well-nourished and well-fed cows do actually give milk of a standard lower than the standard prescribed, and that in such circumstances the owner might conceivably be prosecuted.  I do not know whether it is the intention of the Minister to bring ordinary dairy farmers under the operations of this Bill or not, but, as I read it, it appears to me to apply to them; that is, to people who do not sell milk in the towns and cities.  In the case of farmers who send their milk to the creameries, they are only paid on its fat content.  Therefore, to make such farmers liable to prosecution in the case of cows that produce, possibly, milk of a low fat content would, in my opinion, be unreasonable.  There is no inducement to the ordinary farmer to tamper with his milk.  He will not attempt to add water to it. Possibly that might be done by those selling milk in towns, but such a thing would not be done by the ordinary farmer sending his milk to a creamery, <Col N="625" /> because while he might add as much water as he liked to it, he would not get paid for the water.  He will only get paid for the fat content in the milk. I do not think that such people should be needlessly interfered with by the law.  They would gain nothing by adulterating milk.  I have had a long experience of cows myself.  I have seen good healthy cows give milk that would not be up to a certain standard, and if samples were taken in such cases the owner would be liable to prosecution and, if found guilty, to a fine.  The ordinary farmer gains nothing whatsoever by adulterating his milk, and I should like the Minister either to accept Deputy O'Donovan's amendment or to bring in some provision that will exempt from the operations of this Act the ordinary dairy farmers whose milk is not sold for human consumption in the towns.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether the definition of &ldquo;whole milk&rdquo; would not cover the point made by Deputy O'Donovan.  As I read Deputy O'Donovan's amendment, I gather that what he wants to safeguard is milk from which nothing has been extracted. Would that definition not be the same thing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment, it appears to me, cuts across the most important principle in this Bill.  I think most Deputies will agree that the defence of &ldquo;straight from the cow&rdquo; has been abused, and that it has provided, at any rate, a possible means of escape for the fraudulent purveyor of milk. It is all very well to say that the milk is &ldquo;straight from the cow,&rdquo; but it is very difficult to prove that there has been adulteration if you have not actually seen the adulteration take place.  It is a well-recognised fact that adulterated milk is being sold for human consumption, and so long as this defence of &ldquo;straight from the cow&rdquo; remains there is a possibility, amounting to a probability, that fraudulent purveyors of milk will escape the full penalties of the law.  The Bill gives power to the Minister for Agriculture to fix certain standards of fat content and other content of milk intended for human <Col N="626" /> consumption, but there is no use in fixing standards of fat content or of solids other than fat if the defence of &ldquo;straight from the cow&rdquo; is a defence that can still be pleaded in court and is likely to be accepted by the justice. When the public pay a reasonable price for milk for human consumption they expect to get an article which has reached a certain standard of purity and a certain standard of nutritive value.  It appears to me to be a reasonable attitude to adopt that we ought to take such steps as will ensure that the public will get the article which the purveyor of milk purports to sell to them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bennett has mentioned that creamery suppliers are paid for their milk on the basis of the fat content. I do not think we could set up machinery fixing the price of milk for human consumption on the basis of the fat content, but at any rate I think we ought to ensure that the fat content must reach a certain minimum. From the amount of discussion which I have had with experts on this matter, and the amount of consideration I have given to it, I am satisfied that a good many of the contributing causes of deficiency in genuine milk are causes that can be removed. Deputy O'Donovan stressed the fact that the morning milk is sometimes deficient in fat.  That is undoubtedly so if the interval between the milkings is unduly long, but I think it has been fairly well established now that, by a better regulation of the period between the milkings, and by careful and proper milking, the deficiency in the fat content of the morning milk can be got over. Seasonal variation, according to the information at my disposal on the matter, is not a very big determining factor.  The breed of the cattle certainly is, and also apparently the peculiarities even of individual cows in any particular breed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are avenues other than the production of milk for human consumption open to farmers who keep milch cows.  They can churn the milk and produce their own butter; if it is a creamery district they can send the milk to the creamery.  Again, I <Col N="627" /> have to repeat that it appears to me to be the absolute duty of the Government to ensure that milk which is intended for human consumption, and is the main diet of children, should reach a certain standard of quality. We can only ensure that standard of quality if this defence of &ldquo;straight from the cow&rdquo; is abolished.  There is just one other point that I might mention. Deputy Bennett talks about the unfortunate cow giving the milk as God gave it to her.  If we were satisfied that the milk which was sold as coming straight from the cow is always as God gave it to her it would be a different story altogether, but we are not.  This matter could, I think, be more appropriately raised and dealt with when the regulations fixing the standards of fat content are placed on the Table of the House.  The percentage has not yet been fixed.  It will be fixed by regulation by the Minister for Agriculture, and the regulation may be laid on the Table of the House.  It will be open to any Deputy to persuade the House that the fat content fixed by the Minister is too high.  To me, it would appear to be much more desirable to have a low fat content but to ensure that the milk would reach that standard.  It would be better, I think, to be in that position than to leave matters as they are, where practically any degree of adulteration might escape the penalties of the law.</P>

      <P>Might I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to state his grounds for objecting to this amendment? At first, it seemed to me as if he were saying that what is aimed at by the amendment is in fact the law, in case law.  I think that is what the Parliamentary Secretary started off by saying.  I do not know if that is the position.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary admit this position&mdash;in the end of his remarks he seemed to admit it&mdash;that if it can be proved to the satisfaction of a court of competent jurisdiction that the milk is &ldquo;straight from the cow,&rdquo; that the milking has been properly done, that the cattle milked are healthy and well fed, that there has been no tampering with the milk and that it is sold in the same condition as it comes from the cow, the man who proves that should get off?  Or, should a man, nevertheless, in some circumstances be adjudged guilty of an offence, even though he could affirmatively prove as to the condition of the cows?  The Parliamentary Secretary said that that was the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very nearly the law as it is, and there would be satisfaction in having this matter settled, because there have been varying decisions and the circumstances are not always the same.  The talk about the purity of milk and milk fats is all beside the point.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary want to have a person adjudged guilty, even though he has proved to the satisfaction of the court that the milk was sold as it came from the cow, was not tampered with, that the cattle were properly milked, and were healthy and well-fed?  I cannot see any point in including certain words which will be made a matter of doubt.  The courts up and down the country have taken various views, according to the circumstances.  The <Col N="629" /> amendment is going to make the matter clear.  Another point arises in connection with the sale of milk to a creamery, where it does not matter, in the end, what is sold, as what is paid for is what the creamery is looking for.  That position will be gauged in terms of milk fats or milk solids.  If for some reason unknown an addition has been made to milk, while a creamery has a recognised percentage of fats or solids, is the person delivering the milk guilty of an offence?  He has not fooled anyone, and has not sold to the prejudice of anyone, because the milk was sold on a recognised method and the analysis is there.  We should have our minds clear as to whether we want to have a man found guilty of an offence when he has healthy cattle, even though the milk is found deficient.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the intention of the Bill is to ensure that the purchaser will get milk of a certain standard to be prescribed by the Minister for Agriculture.  I do not think that is an unreasonable provision, even if it results, as Deputy McGilligan suggested, in creating a new legal offence &mdash;that of supplying milk which does not come up to the standard prescribed.  It is admitted that on certain occasions milk may be below quite a moderate standard, but it is not likely that the milk of a mixed herd will be below that standard if it is at all a reasonably good breed.  It is not putting an undue hardship on dairymen and keepers of cows to ask them to ensure that their animals will give milk of a reasonable standard, such as one believes the Minister will fix.  It might be a considerable hardship on the seller if milk from one cow fell below the standard, and if he was held to be guilty of an offence, but, if milk from a herd falls below that standard, it is reasonable to insist that milk of a certain standard should be supplied.  It is true that the milk of particular breeds of cattle differ.  If this Bill becomes law it should be the duty of dairymen to keep cows which will give milk of an average standard.  The onus is put upon them to supply milk which will be defined by the regulations, instead of leaving them to supply any milk that comes from the cows.  The Parliamentary Secretary is right when he said that if the definition is left as it is, it would be almost impossible, in most cases, to establish any offence for selling diluted milk, or milk deficient in fats.</P>

      <P>This is a very important matter for dairy people.  We all admit that the object the Minister <Col N="631" /> hopes to achieve is an admirable one, one which will have the support of most Deputies.  I should like to point out, however, that Deputy O'Donovan and others are concerned about the position of farmers whose milk never, by any chance, reaches consumers in towns.  In recent years legislation has imposed somewhat rigid regulations on these farmers, and they have advanced their system in order to cope with that legislation.  Everything possible has been done by them so that milk will arrive at creameries in good condition.  There are inspectors to look after the condition of the churns, and to see that they are clean.  If extra tasks are imposed on farmers, as a result of which they may possibly be prosecuted because the milk from certain cows is below a certain standard, it will cause hardship on suppliers whose milk will possibly never be used for human consumption, because it is sold at the creameries and is paid for according to the amount of butter fat it contains.  Perhaps some way might be found in the Bill to exclude such persons from its operation. If that could be arranged we would have no objection to any legislation that tends to provide milk of the best possible quality for consumption in the cities and towns.  Everyone is anxious <Col N="632" /> to see that condition of things attained. From my experience of legislation in this House I am aware that many Acts are passed containing provisions to be used only on rare occasions, but I have found that in practice those provisions are afterwards very extensively used. It may be indicated here that in the case of dairy farmers this Bill will never affect them.  Possibly it will not, but there is always the danger that numbers of small farmers in the West of Ireland and in other remote parts of the country may be brought within its scope and they may find themselves faced with penalties for a new crime.</P>

Of course, we do not stand for the type of man who waters his milk, the type of man for whom the pump is the best cow.  We would not tolerate anything like that.  We contend that if it is proved that the milk was the milk produced by the proper milking of healthy and well-fed cattle and that it was sold in the same condition as it came from the cow, the person concerned should not be brought to the court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us see the purpose so far as it is given here.  This is the point to which the Minister refers us:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In connection with the carrying out of the Shannon Power Development Scheme, a sum of £160,000 was expended out of advances made from the Shannon Power Development Fund on improvements effected in the navigation of the River Shannon.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the first relevant phrase.  It goes on:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Of this sum, £132,450 was declared by the terms of Section 3 of the Electricity (Finance) Act, 1929, not to be repayable by the Electricity Supply Board, and the present Vote is for the purpose of repaying to the Exchequer that amount of the advances.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Is that the explanation of why we are voting £132,000?  Will the Minister tell us what are the particular improvements effected in the navigation of the River Shannon on which all or the greater part of this amount was spent?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>£132,000 is said to have been spent, and I ask where the improvements are and what they were. I have not got the material in my possession.  The Minister has, or ought to have, if he could concentrate his mind on the matter.  Are we entitled to know, now when we are paying the bill, what improvements have been effected in the navigation of the river &mdash;say, the sections of the river that have been improved and what is their effect from the angle of boats of deeper draught being able to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister behave himself?  Let him remember that he has got to answer for the money he is getting from this State.  He is getting paid by the State and he must render an account of his duty to the State.  There are Deputies here who were not here in 1929, and they are entitled to hear what money was spent, how it was spent, and what was done. That is the usual course.  If we are to set the precedent that a Minister is to come in here and say: &ldquo;This is a sum of money provided under an Act passed five years ago and spent, and that is all I have to say about it,&rdquo; then we reach a very nice pass in Parliamentary procedure. This afternoon we had a whole list of Orders made by the Executive Council which placed taxation upon the people's backs.  We are told by the Executive Council that this is a democratic Government.  The Minister now, in answer to a question as to how this money was spent, said: &ldquo;You know all about it.&rdquo;  If the Minister wants Deputy McGilligan to explain all about it, let him hand over the papers and <Col N="638" /> Deputy McGilligan will explain it.  The House, apart from anybody on this Bench, is entitled to hear how this money was expended, what the purposes were, and so on, and the Minister is failing in his duty in not giving the information to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, it is obvious that the Deputy does not understand what the purpose of the Estimate is.  The purpose is to repay the Exchequer certain moneys which were advanced from the Exchequer. We have no responsibility for these advances whatever.  They were not made in our time.  They were made before we came into office for works for which we have no responsibility. All we are asking the Dáil to do now is to repay to the Exchequer moneys which our predecessors in office, with the consent of the Dáil, advanced from the Exchequer.  That is the purpose of the Estimate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is wrong to say that these moneys were spent before the present Government took office. The money was voted.  For instance, a good amount of money had to be expended on the Abbey river.  There had to be a junction made with the old canal harbour and a new entrance made to it.  A bridge across the Abbey river had to be removed.  There had to be a reconstruction and a new approach and new development of a traffic type took place in connection with that.  There was a considerable amount of experimentation because certain people said that barges going down and from the Abbey river, could not nose up into the harbour.</P>

The Minister is now running away from the point that this expenditure was carried out in his predecessors' time.  That was what he said at first, but he no longer stands now by that statement.  He confesses he has been inaccurate.

      <P>There were certain advances to be made from the Exchequer to the Electricity Supply Board and these were repayable. There was an advance of £132,450 for expenditure on the River Shannon navigation.  The only money repayable is the money expended on the River Shannon.

It is not repayable by the Electricity Supply Board.  How do we know that it is part of the £132,000 which was voted for the expenditure in certain ways under Section 3 of the 929 Act?  How do we know it was expended unless we are told the items making up the £132,000?  Is it not proper to go into some detail as to the cost of the reconstruction of the Abbey River and of the bridge over the Abbey River, down into Limerick, and of the various locks on the Shannon and other works necessitated by this scheme for effecting an improvement in the navigation of the Shannon?</P>

This Supplementary Estimate is presented for a particular purpose&mdash;to recoup the Treasury expenditure already made&mdash;and I cannot allow on it a general review of expenditure on the improvement of the navigation of the Shannon.

The moment I make that allegation, I submit that I throw on the Minister the onus of rebutting it and he must inform the House promptly as to how the money was, in fact, spent.  To secure that information, I move the rejection of this Estimate on the ground that the money was spent on paving O'Connell Street and is, therefore, not a fit and proper subject for a Supplementary Estimate.  I object to the passing of an Estimate because the money was not spent in conformity with the original Estimate and is not covered by Section 3 of the Electricity (Finance) Act of 1929.</P>

      <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £349 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1935, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for External Affairs, and of certain Services administered by that Office including Grants-in-aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate is necessary in order to obtain the approval of the Dáil for a grant, made during the present year, to the Statistical Society of Ireland and the Entertainment Committee of the Celtic Congress for the purpose of entertaining distinguished visitors. The entertainment was not provided, primarily, by the State so that it was not possible to make the grant out of the Entertainments sub-head of the Vote.  With regard to the details it will be noted that the sum of £62 is the grant-in-aid of the Statistical Society of Ireland and it arises in this way: Originally, the Department of External Affairs had proposed to give an official reception to the delegates of the Celtic Congress in April, 1934, on the occasion of their visit to Dublin.  Owing to the greatly regretted death of the American Minister to the Saorstát it was subsequently decided to cancel the official reception and enable a grant of £62 to be made to the Statistical Society to enable them to provide entertainment for the delegates.  The other item is a sum of £287 made as a grant-in-aid to the Committee of the Celtic Congress which assembled here in July this year.  In response to representations made to the Entertainment Committee it was decided that a grant <Col N="650" /> should be made towards the cost of the entertainment of the delegates. The amount of the Vote, £287, represents portion of the cost to places of historical interest, and incidental expenses.</P>

      <P>I move that the Supplementary Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.  I do that for two very serious reasons.  I think that the fact of entertaining both the International Institute of Statistics and the Celtic Congress created an atmosphere which was detrimental to the intellectual integrity of our people and blinds them to certain facts affecting certain vital things at the present moment.  Take the Celtic Congress first.  The President attended the Celtic Congress and on the opening day, I think, he stressed what is the vital thing affecting us here, and the vital thing that gives interest to the Celtic Congress in its discussions. Quoting from the Press of 10th July, I find that the President:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...hoped the Congress would lead to new fervour in the pursuit of Gaelic studies until an organised co-operative effort was made to revive the Celtic languages among the people.  Special efforts were needed to bring the language into line with the requirements of the age.  It is well for us that we have an example of some, at least, of other Celtic peoples to guide us in this task.  More vital still was the lead to preserve Irish as the language of every-day life in the small area of our country where it still remains dormant, and to spread it from that area to the rest of the land.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>And then he emphasised the fact that</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Alone among the Celtic peoples we have a National Government, a Government which, I assure you, is fully resolved to do all in its power to assist and to spread the restoration of our language.  We are prepared, in such measure as may be practicable, to share this advantage with the other Celtic nations.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My objection to entertaining the Celtic Congress here is that it blind-our people to things that exist here <Col N="651" /> and makes them feel that they are attending to things that require attention here.  There is a boys' primary all-Irish school here in the City&mdash;the only all-Irish boys' school in the City &mdash;set up at the instance, and the urgent instance, of parents who are bringing up their children through the medium of Irish.  In the third and fourth standards there are only 82 boys getting primary education in these standards through the medium of Irish, and there is only one teacher in charge of that instruction.  In the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth standards of that school there is only one teacher looking after the work of these standards.</P>

      <P>On the point of order that was put to you, Sir, that is, as to whether or not I am entitled to discuss, on this Estimate, the policy and the wisdom of entertaining societies like these here, I wish to draw very brief attention to facts of vital importance to the country that are obscured by the very action of entertaining the Celtic Congress here.  I wish to draw attention briefly to three or four facts, and I want to argue that we are blinding ourselves here to what is the vital thing, if there is anything vital, in the work and the deliberations of the Celtic Congress.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, Sir, the Deputy has stated that he wishes to raise, on this Estimate, the desirability of entertaining people&mdash;distinguished visitors&mdash;who come here.  I pointed out that one of the reasons why we asked leave to submit this Supplementary Estimate to the Dáil was that, as the entertainment had not been provided directly by the State, it did not come strictly within the sub-head of the Vote.  The Dáil has already, in adopting <Col N="652" /> the Estimate for External Affairs, decided as to the propriety of entertaining distinguished visitors here.  I submit, Sir, that if the Deputy is going to discuss that question now, he is out of order.</P>

      <P>I have informed the Deputy of the position regarding the motion in his name on the Order Paper.  The purpose of a motion to refer back, in relation to a main Estimate, is to afford the House an opportunity of discussing policy, but in a Supplementary Estimate nothing may be discussed but the purpose for which the money is intended.  In this case, debate is confined to the giving of a grant-in-aid to certain societies for the entertainment of members of similar societies visiting the Saorstát.</P>

      <P>Sir, in your letter to me, you said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... In the case of a Supplementary Estimate debate is confined to the purpose for which the sum is required.  Therefore, the only aspect of policy that can be debated in connection with Vote No. 67 is the policy of giving grants-in-aid to Irish societies to enable them to entertain visiting members of similar or kindred societies from other countries.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that the reason why I object to the giving of grants to the International Institute of Statistics on the one hand and to the Celtic Congress on the other hand is that the fact that we take these bodies here and entertain them blinds our people to vital facts that are lying around them, makes them feel that they are doing work which, in fact, they are not doing.  I have referred to a statement by the President at the opening of the Congress where he drew attention to the really vital matter, or <Col N="653" /> what ought to be the vital matter, in the whole work of the Celtic Congress, and that is the preservation of the Irish language as the language of every-day life in the small area where it remains dormant and the spreading of it from that area to the country as a whole.  I also drew attention to the fact that the President had pointed out that the co-operation of countries which had Celtic languages was necessary but that we stood pre-eminent among such countries by reason of the fact that we had a national Government here, a Government which was fully resolved to do all in its power to assist and to spread the restoration of our language.</P>
      <P>I say that doing work of this particular kind tends to blind our people to facts that are around them.  It has, in fact, blinded our people to the fact that the only primary boys' school which is all Irish in the City of Dublin has 82 boys in its third and fourth standards with only one teacher in charge of them, and with only one teacher in charge of the four ranks above that&mdash;the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth standards.</P>

      <P>The Deputy, on a moment's consideration, will realise that he is discussing in detail the policy of the education Department. On similar lines, he might argue that the giving of this grant-in-aid blinded our people to many other facts and might proceed to discuss the policy of other departments which would be equally irrelevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to discuss the policy of the Department, but to put four or five facts together briefly.  First of all, that there is only one all-Irish primary school in the City of Dublin and that in a school alongside there are 200 children waiting to get into a preparatory school, and that in another school on the south side of the river 200 children are waiting to get into that school, while there are Irish-speaking parents asking for a school who are not getting it.  We are bringing over here residents of other countries who have a language problem and we are fooling ourselves <Col N="654" /> and our people by feasts and pageantry and talk that we are saving the Irish language here when the Minister for Education knows very well, as a result of his experience of the Irish-speaking districts, that the parents in the Irish-speaking districts are not sending their children to Irish-speaking schools to the extent they ought to send them, while here in the City of Dublin there are many people prepared to go after a Unionist hunt and find a private school down in Wexford and bait it because it is not teaching Irish, and Irish-speaking parents with homes in the City of Dublin are asked to send their boys to the one primary school to which I have referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, Sir, and I merely wish to say that I oppose bringing over these people, because it blinds us to facts that we ought to know and see in front of us, and makes us, with all this pageantry and talk, believe that we are doing something for the country.  I leave the Celtic Congress now and come to the International Institute of Statistics.  We entertained that Institute here, or at least the Statistical and Social Society of Enquiry did, and we are asked to give a grant to it.  Very rightly, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, at a lunch, praised the Statistics Branch of the Department of Industry and Commerce and pointed out the great assistance and co-operation they had received from the International Institute.  The President of the Statistical Society expressed the hope that as a result of the visit of the members of the International Institute they would be able to appreciate the statistics which their Minister and their own department produced for their information as well as for the information of those at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we had a gathering of <Col N="655" /> foreigners who came to this country and who talked about statistics, and, I the importance of statistics, and, I say, rightly so.  They praised the work of the Statistical Department of our Department of Industry and Commerce, but the work of that Department is sat upon and choked down.  It is held up and not given to this country by the Minister.  I do not think that we can afford to spend public money to blind our people throughout the country and to let them feel that the Government in power to-day has an admiration and a respect for statistics. It is quite true, as the Minister has stated, that the Statistical Department here had forced them to review their preconceived ideas of the resources, possibilities and developments of the country, but things that would help our people to realise the possibilities of Government policy&mdash;vital statistics with regard to industry, even with regard to employment&mdash;are withheld from the people.  I do not think that this House should vote any money that would help the present Government in getting the people to think that they are telling them truthfully what the Statistics Department is turning out, or that they have any respect for much of the stuff that is talked with regard to statistics and their value, at these meetings.  We can do without the help of international statistics or international institutes if we rely on our own Statistics Department at home.  If we are going to have self-sufficiency, let us turn our eyes inwards to the statistics that we can get at home, and let us have these statistics.  I am opposed to voting this money, because it is intended to show that the Government are getting statistics which they are not getting or are not giving to the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not pretend to know a great deal about these societies. They may be very worthy, and it may be desirable that they should be entertained. I object to this Vote because this country is already legally committed to the paying out of a sum of money which should really cover such work and <Col N="656" /> such entertainment as is sought to be provided for in this Supplementary Estimate.  I cannot say that it is specifically and formally voted for that purpose, but ten years' tradition in this country, following on a much longer tradition in other countries, established that though the Governor-General might have what would appear to very many people as the very large salary of £10,000, it was well understood and was not to be questioned that that £10,000 was not really salary, and that the major part of it should be used for such a purpose as is indicated in the Estimate, namely, that a certain person should entertain distinguished visitors and should act as host on behalf of the nation.  The legal salary of the Governor-General at this moment is £10,000.  True, we are informed&mdash;misinformed, I should say&mdash;in a document issued to us that the salary of the Governor-General is £2,000, free of income tax.  Legally, in this country, there is no such thing as a salary free of income tax, and therefore that statement is clearly false as issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The law in this country provides that the Governor-General shall receive £10,000 a year.  He, therefore, has the right at this moment, or at any later time after he has resigned, of enforcing that legal claim, and our Government, if they are ordered, must pay that full amount.  That figure was much canvassed in this country when it was actually paid over to the Governor-General, but there was no advertence made to the fact that it did not go into his pocket or that it was used for such purposes as this, which the Government now indicates as a very desirable purpose.  The members of that Government, which is committed to pay that £10,000, and so to relieve the State of such expenses as are indicated in this Estimate, are in a somewhat similar position to the Governor-General and, just as he can claim his legal salary when he resigns, they also can claim back the salary which the State is committed to pay them.  At this moment we are paying to the Governor-General who, presumably, is fulfilling no function at all, a sum which is based on the assumption that he is going to provide such entertainment <Col N="657" /> as is included in this Estimate.  The Government now asks us to pass this further Vote, to vote money for such things as were by tradition and by all equity to be provided for out of the Governor-General's salary.</P>
    <P>Legally, the position at this moment is that we are paying, or are due to pay, at any time the Governor-General likes to enforce his claim, whether during his period of office or after his period of office, a sum of £10,000.  On top of that we are asked to provide for things that the Governor-General is given £10,000 to provide for.  Therefore, I think it is a scandal that we should be asked, when the country is committed to the payment of that enormous salary, to tax the Irish people and to relieve the Governor-General of fulfilling functions and of incurring expenses out of his salary which it was clearly indicated he should so incur, after we have had a ten years' tradition established in this country that it was his function and his real duty to provide such things as are to be voted now in this Estimate. Long before the State came into existence that tradition was well established in other Dominions.  I think the Dáil has no right whatever, as custodians of the public welfare of this country, to vote this money, which is merely making the people of the country pay through taxes what they already pay for in the Governor-General's legal salary.</P>

      <P>If there is any basis for the case he has raised, then he can raise it in its proper place and it will be listened to sympathetically. The Ceann Comhairle's ruling puts it out of order to follow him.  I have to confess that I had no idea that the subject was going to be raised, and I have had no opportunity of examining the details, so that, even if it were in order, I should not have been able to follow the Deputy into the details to ascertain to what extent he was misinformed. The fact simply that there is a grievance in one direction should be no excuse for refusing to make this grant.  It is suggested that this entertainment is blinding the eyes of the people to the realities.  I cannot look at it in that way, and I do not think any reasonable person could look at it in that way.  The Celtic Congress has a special meaning.  It is the coming together of representatives of the Celtic peoples who reside in different countries.  They go periodically to the different countries.  They came here on this occasion, as they came formerly in 1925, and, just as the previous Administration in 1925 made a grant for this purpose, so we are making a grant this year for the self-same reason.  The only difference, it appears to me, is that we recognised that we could not make the grant out of the Vote and that it would have to be brought before the Dáil for special sanction.  I think on the previous occasion that the incorrectness of doing it otherwise was not appreciated.  My recollection is that on that occasion it was paid out of the Entertainment Vote, but quite incorrectly. If we had in the Entertainment Vote a larger sum than we have, it would have been quite easy to provide this sum from it, but we would nevertheless have been compelled to come to the Dáil to seek its approval for this expenditure, as we are doing now, quite independent of any moneys that might have been at our disposal from the Entertainment Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I can leave Deputy Mulcahy's point at that.  Now, coming to Deputy Fitzgerald, the Deputy is fond of bringing forward new theories.  He has a new theory now that if a gift is made it can be revoked at will.  The Governor-General <Col N="659" /> has made a gift of practically £8,000 of the £10,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see how that can be maintained.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Governor-General's salary is £10,000, then this State claims from him income tax on that £10,000, which would be something like £3,000.  That means to say that his salary, at this moment, would be something over £5,000 a year.  I understand that the Government here give him £10,000 and that he, in order to preclude himself from taking legal action afterwards, hands back a certain amount of that to the Government. If that is so, then when he receives that £10,000 he, by all the law of this State, is responsible for the payment of income tax on that amount.  The Government issues a paper which is to inform the Irish people of what the Governor-General gets, but if the course that seems to me to be indicated by the President is true, then the Government issues a false statement with regard to the Governor-General's salary, which would clearly be something over £5,000, when it says it is £2,000.</P>

      <P>The Deputy, of course, is talking nonsense, and he knows it.  This is not the time to go into details on this any more than it would be to deal in detail with an Estimate on educational matters.  The fact, however, is that the cost of the Governor-General's Department has been reduced to less than one-sixth of what it was.  The position, leaving the income tax part of it aside&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Because it is dealt with and has been dealt with separately. With regard to the Deputy's point as to the money that is being given back to the Treasury, there would be no legal right on the part of the Governor-General to claim it back at any time any more than if I make a gift freely I can revoke that gift <Col N="660" /> later when I might think it would be well for me to get it back.  A gift is a gift.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If what the President says is so and if the Governor-General at the moment receives £10,000 and makes a gift of £8,000 to the Treasury, then the Revenue Commissioners are not doing their duty, because he is due to pay to them income tax on the £10,000.  If that is not so, then the gift he makes to the Treasury is the difference between £2,000, plus income tax, deducted from the £10,000.  The President says he makes a gift of £8,000.  His legal salary is not £8,000.  His legal salary is only the amount that is represented by £10,000, minus income tax and super-tax on £10,000.</P>

      <P>As I was saying, this is not the time to raise without any notice details with regard to any particular Estimate other than on the particular items which we have here. The fact is that the Governor-General gives back to the Treasury whatever balance is left of the £10,000, except the £2,000 that he is actually receiving.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>£2,000 he receives net.  That is the position.  I know the Revenue Commissioners' devotion to duty sufficiently well to feel certain that whatever the law demands in regard to the question of income tax is fully satisfied.  Otherwise, the arrangement could not have been made. With regard to this particular item, the Dáil is asked to vote a sum in connection with the Celtic Congress because of the fact that it was advisable to give it as a Grant-in-Aid in that particular form.  As regards the Statistical Society, the Minister for Finance <Col N="661" /> explained the circumstances in which it was decided, that instead of giving a reception from the State directly out of the Vote, this sum should be given as a grant-in-aid.  In those circumstances it would have been unbecoming if the State itself had given the reception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to entertainment in general, I do not think that that question arises, apart from the question of the Governor-General.  I think that when the Estimate is being debated we will be able to prove that not <Col N="662" /> merely was there a saving to the State of the large amounts that have appeared in the Governor-General's Vote, but that even apart from that there was a saving over and above these amounts on entertainment given by the State in the past.  I do not think there can be complaints from any side as regards any tendency to lavishness on the part of the Government.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>Go ndeontar suim Bhreise ná raghaidh thar £763,000 chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1935, chun Deolchairí, Conganta Airgid, etc., alos Easportála.</P>
      <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £763,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1935, for Export Bounties, Subsidies, etc.</P>
      <P>The sum in this additional Estimate is composed of bounties on both industrial and agricultural exports.  The original amount set aside for bounties on industrial exports was £75,000.  No change has taken place during the year in the rate of bounties on industrial exports, but the quantity exported exceeded the estimate, and it is anticipated that an additional £25,000 will be required before March 31st next. There is £738,000 in bounties on agricultural exports, including an additional amount on horses.  About 1st August the rate of bounty on horses was raised from 10 per cent to 20 per cent. and in consequence of that the amount has to be increased probably by £76,000.  Early in May increases were announced on dairy produce, eggs and dead poultry.  The increase would amount to about £394,000.  There is another group, namely, bacon, pigs, pig offals and pork in which various changes were made during the year. They were increased and reduced on many occasions to meet the situation as it arose, but the sum total of all the changes would mean an increase in export bounties of £278,000, which would complete the total asked for, £737,000.</P>
      <P>With regard to bounties on bacon, live pigs, pig offals and pork, there will be a receipt against them from the excise duty that has been imposed on bacon.  That duty was first at the rate of 5/- per cwt. on bacon produced by bacon factories in the Free State and was subsequently increased to 7/- and now stands at 10/-.  There is an estimated receipt from that of about £270,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is 10/- per cwt. now. The necessity for that procedure arose owing to the fact that at one stage during the year it was more profitable to sell in the home market than to export, and while some factories were anxious to take the long view, and to continue to export in order to hold the quota, other factories were taking the short view, and were inclined to stop exporting, and to take advantage of the home market.  The only way the matter could be equalised was by putting an excise duty on all bacon produced and to increase the bounty so that those exporting at that time were getting as good return for bacon as those selling on the home market.</P>

      <P>There are fluctuations in the market as between the export price and the home price where in fact it is impossible to foresee from month to month and the only temporary expedient we could adopt, pending the introduction of the Bacon Bill, which is being prepared, was this method of regulating the excise duty and the export bounty, as far as possible to give equal benefit to those who sell at home and to those who export.  In this matter, we had the proprietors of the bacon factories in consultation. As soon as the Bacon Bill is introduced it will contain provisions for dealing with this matter by some sort of stabilisation arrangement, and that stabilisation will be controlled more by the trade itself and will, I expect, run smoothly.  Up to 31st March, the present arrangement of a levy on home-produced bacon and of export bounties must continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for consideration,&rdquo; with a view to extracting from the Minister certain information that this House should have before they vote a sum of £763,000 for additional bounties and subsidies.  The first matter to which I wish to draw the attention of the House is that when the Minister for Finance was introducing the Budget he was asked to explain the unprecedented figure, and he said that one of the principal reasons why the Budget appeared to be so big was that he had provided for every conceivable head of expenditure that could arise and that the House need expect no Supplementary Estimates during the year.  Since then, there has been a steady shower of Supplementary Estimates.  In connection with this Estimate, in the original Estimates, for exports and bounties he went further and said that in looking for £2,250,000 he determined to borrow a large part of that because he could not conceive the economic war going on forever and that he looked forward to a settlement. Now we discover, when that pious anticipation has apparently receded into the distant background, that we are to appropriate a further £763,000 and part of what we have already borrowed and raised by taxation for the services of bounties and exports on agricultural and industrial produce. There are one or two questions that I want to put to the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="667" /> to-day.  He is reported in that shrine, or shall I say, mausoleum, of truth, the <i>Irish Press</i>, of June 30th, 1933, as saying:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo; `The Government has been accused of being in favour of tillage and of being out for the destruction of the live-stock industry.  The person who made that accusation,' said the Minister in his striking speech at the first Convention of the United Farmers' Protection Association, `was either a fool or a knave.' &rdquo;</P>
      <P>I ask the House to bear that in mind. Senator Connolly then took the field. Senator Connolly, the Minister for Lands, at a Fianna Fáil meeting in Kilcock to-night&mdash;this is what the extract says&mdash;said it had taken 100 years to establish the cattle trade of this country, but with God's help it would not take 100 years to kill it.  I want to ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce a straight question.  Is Senator Connolly a fool or a knave, for he must be one or the other?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is in the plural.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not expect the Minister to reply now, because he probably would be put out of the House if he did; it would be disorderly to describe a Minister either as a fool or a knave.  I invite the Minister for Agriculture to take a trip to Wexford and to tell his constituents there whether his colleague is a fool or a knave.  But the Minister is in deeper water.  Acting on the admirable example of the Senator, the President thought he would have a few handsprings through the country on the subject of the cattle industry and he went to Limerick and there he thanked Heaven that the British market was gone; he rejoiced to see the end of the cattle industry.  Will the Minister inform his constituents whether President de Valera is a fool or a knave? It will be a source of considerable interest to the people to know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose, this evening, to cover again the ground I traversed last Wednesday night when we were discussing the general question of <Col N="668" /> quotas.  The Minister, so far, has made no attempt to answer the case that the keystone of our whole agricultural economy is the live-stock trade. In fact, he went so far as to say, in that historic speech which was delivered before the United Farmers' Protection Association, that if the farmers of this country tilled they must have live stock; otherwise, the farmers could not use Irish barley, hay and other products, or get manure.  He added that we must, at least, maintain the amount of live stock that we have. At that moment he was a sensible man. It was an unusual rôle for the Minister to play.  I must say that as we sat here this evening listening to him explaining, with some embarrassment, the negotiations that took place between himself and the bacon curers, when he was trying to induce the bacon curers to ship their bacon to the accursed market that the President was glad was gone, it occurred to me that he was playing much the rôle of Sinbad the Sailor with the Old Man of the Sea sitting on his back smiling at his woes, because I noticed that the President was sitting beside him as the poor Minister for Agriculture was floundering through his explanations.</P>
    <P>In that confusion it seems pertinent to ask what are the Minister's intentions in respect to the cattle trade and to our export trade for bacon?  Does he want it to go on or does he want it to stop?  If he wants it to go on, surely he should use his influence with his Cabinet colleagues and particularly with the Old Man of the Sea who is at present afflicting him, to bring about a settlement of the economic war, or at least to secure some kind of trade agreement with Great Britain which would ensure that we would be afforded an opportunity of selling our cattle and our agricultural produce at a profitable price in the British markets. The Minister may say that cannot be considered at the present time but that he could provide alternative markets.  He might have suggested that two years ago, but he cannot say it now because the President has admitted that, having made every possible endeavour to secure alternative <Col N="669" /> markets, he has made up his mind that it is absolutely impossible.</P>
    <P>The Minister will remember his famous crate of chickens, the crate of chickens wherewith we laid siege to the French market and which arrived unheralded at Le Havre, where it was decided that they could not be let in. After telegraphic correspondence took place accommodation was secured for the chickens.  Food was provided for them and lairage was chartered on another steamer and they set forth again on their Odyssey for Ghent. Having arrived at Ghent they were disposed of and the Comptroller and Auditor-General was obliged to report that the transport, lodging and victuals for the chickens cost very much more than the chickens realised in Ghent.  The Minister will, no doubt, remember that rather trying experience.  I trust he is not going to send out cattle on the same weary pilgrimage.  We must know what his intentions are.  If there is no alternative market, if he will not touch the British market, then the sooner ne tells us that and the sooner he suspends all bounties and lets the people realise the full implications of the policy which he commends to them, the better for the country and the more honestly will the Minister act.</P>
    <P>The financial condition of this country is bad enough as it is without spending millions forcing our way into a market which the Minister, and his leader, proclaim they want to destroy.  There is a temptation whenever these matters arise to go deeply into the fallacies and folly which characterise the Minister's administration of his office since he took charge.  One must avoid the danger of repeating oneself and so I confine myself now to putting two explicit questions to the Minister for Agriculture although I am perfectly satisfied that he will not attempt to answer either one or the other, because he has neither the competence nor the courage to do so.  The first question is to tell this House, in the light of his speech of the 30th June, 1933, and in the light of Senator Connolly's speech at Kilcock on 9th <Col N="670" /> June, 1934, whether Senator Connolly is a fool or a knave; in short, whether he is fit for removal to Grangegorman or Mountjoy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Or to the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Having disposed of that question, I invite the Minister to inform the House definitely and finally what is the policy of the Government of which he is a member in respect to the cattle industry of this country, bearing in mind that he himself has said that the tillage policy of Fianna Fáil is unthinkable and impossible unless the live-stock industry thrives and prospers with it. Those are two clear, explicit questions. Deputies who are invited to vote over £700,000 for the maintenance of our exports are entitled to have clear and explicit answers.  Farmers up and down the country who are trying to make ends meet, living much as the horse did when it waited for grass, are entitled to know whether they are paying £1,000 a year free of income tax to a potential inmate of Grangegorman or Mountjoy and, secondly, whether the Minister for Agriculture and his colleagues have determined to wipe out the cattle industry or not.  Until those questions are answered, and explicitly answered it is an impertinence and a presumption on the part of the Minister to expect this House to entrust a further £763,000 to him to spend at his own sweet will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words on the bounty question. It is very difficult to understand how the bounties are administered. Invariably, the people whom they are intended to benefit get little or no assistance from them.  I will give the House one or two instances.  In the case of turkeys at the present time there is a bounty of 5d. a lb. given on them and they are being sold at 6d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is, they are being sold at a penny a pound, and that simply means that John Bull is getting turkeys at a 1d. a lb.  The policy of Fianna Fáil always was to quit giving John Bull cheap food, and now he is getting the <Col N="671" /> best he ever got at what was an unthinkable price some time ago.  There is a general complaint in every branch of the trade that the bounties are not being passed on.  In the fat cattle business, for instance, we see that, although a price has been fixed, the Minister has found it impossible to put it into operation.  He found it necessary to reduce the price, uneconomic as it was, from 25/- to 22/-, and I do not believe that 30 per cent. of the cattle will make that price, and I do not think the Minister can enforce it. I do not think he can overturn the whole law of economics.  I know that bounties are all right in theory and they are necessary.  I will say that they are necessary apart altogether from the economic war.  In any country where protective tariffs are imposed to help industry, a bounty provision is the only way to protect an industry which depends on the export of its exportable surplus, such as agriculture, so that I am not speaking against bounties.  With the present quota system, however, it is impossible to give effect to the Minister's intention to pass on the bounties to the producer.</P>
    <P>There is another more serious aspect than that of fat cattle.  I refer to the store trade.  If fat cattle are not realising an economic price, what is the position of the small farmer in the poorer parts of the country who is not getting 25/- or 22/- or 10/- a cwt. for his cattle?  If there was one thing more than another which the Fianna Fáil Government professed to be, it was that they were a Government of the small farmers, and the small men. I know the position of the small farmers in Co. Cavan.  They cannot sell their store cattle at all, and I know of a very large area in a mountainous district in which they did not get half their hay saved this season.  They have no outlet for their cattle and they are taking them out and leaving them on the road.  That has happened, and I can give several instances of cattle being left on the road.  That is the position in County Cavan.  It is so serious that the Cavan Co. Committee <Col N="672" /> of Agriculture, on which there is a Fianna Fáil majority, were unanimous in passing a resolution which I shall read.  A Deputy on the Fianna Fáil side of this House is a member of that Committee, and I hope he will try to impress on the Minister the necessity for doing something in the matter. I do not want to occupy the time of the House, but the matter is grave and should be seriously considered by the Minister.  This is the resolution passed:</P>
    <P>That this Committee desires to draw the attention of the Minister for Agriculture to the recent Act whereby fat cattle are realising 25/- per cwt., and to point out that that will be of little material benefit to the Cavan farmers and small store cattle raisers, we urge on him that action should be taken to safeguard these interests, and to ensure that the holders of export licences will give the last penny in value for the store animals purchased.</P>
    <P>I think this is a matter which the Minister must do something to meet&mdash; the situation of the people who are raising small store cattle, especially in mountainous districts.  It is impossible, no matter what you give for beef, to compel any purchaser of store cattle to buy these cattle from the farmers, for the simple reason that there are ten store cattle offered for the one beast wanted, and the pick of the best cattle will be bought at any price, while the poorer class of cattle coming off the poor land will not be bought at all.  I should like to know what the Minister proposes to do, because he must do something.  The Executive Council are responsible for this policy, and remember that the people who are so affected are contributing taxes for the payment of bounties which are no advantage at all to them, so far as store cattle are concerned.</P>
    <P>I notice in the Estimate also that the Minister proposes to try further experiments in regard to finding alternative markets.  I should be very glad if the Minister could succeed in finding those alternative markets, but I have not the slightest hope that he will find them.  I never had any hope that he <Col N="673" /> could because the market he had thrown away was the best market in the world and was at our door.  There was no use going to the countries in Europe, which have been exporting to Great Britain, to see if they would buy our stuff.  He told us on one occasion that he had been getting in here and there&mdash;that he sold a few cows in one place, a few hens in another, a bit of butter and some eggs in a third and so on.  He had hopes then that that was a beginning, and that he would improve.  I should like him to tell us now what the improvement is, and I should like him to give the House a clear indication of what advance he has made on the foundation he laid then.  Is he still in the position of having to experiment with regard to finding alternative markets while the country is going to the dogs?  It is a humiliating thing sometimes for a member of this House, even though he is a member of the Opposition, to see the Minister going around the markets of the world like a hawker to sell small items&mdash;matters of a few thousand pounds&mdash;when there are millions and millions concerned in respect of a country which had an export trade valued for £40,000,000 a few years ago.  We all feel humiliated to think that a Minister of the Free State should have degenerated into something in the nature of an agricultural pedlar.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take this matter more seriously and make some effort to remedy the situation which makes these difficulties for himself and is creating poverty and distress for the agricultural community and which is beginning to reflect itself on every section of the community.  I hope the Minister will try to induce his colleagues on the Executive Council to do something for the particular industry over which he presides in the same way as the Minister for Industry and Commerce tries to help the industry in which he is interested.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce tries to get an economic, or, perhaps, a little more than economic price for whatever is produced by the new industries which have been started, but the Minister for Agriculture, admittedly, <Col N="674" /> does not make any attempt to see that the agricultural community gets anything like an economic price. That, of course, leads to unemployment and, in fact, it is at the very bottom of the whole unemployment problem&mdash;the failure of agriculture and the inability of the farmer to pay workmen, because, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance told us here a week ago, some of the small farmers&mdash;and I know them myself&mdash;who were giving employment some years ago to others besides themselves are now taking the bit out of the labourer's mouth and trying to get jobs on the road, in order to keep the wolf from the door.  That is the position that the agricultural community has got to and that is what the small farmer has been brought to.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hugo Flinn told us that the increase in the register of unemployment was due to the registration of those small farmers who are looking for relief.  They do not mind how much a week they get.  They are not looking for 30/- or even 24/-.  They will be very glad if they get £1, or if they get any money.  I know cases where they would be glad to work for any money. They have been trying to get certificates in order to qualify for unemployment assistance and whatever is added to it, but they find it impossible to get them.  Their farms are reckoned up against them as means when, in fact, they have no means.  Instead of their farms being any advantage to them, they are a great disadvantage. They would be very happy if they could be in the position of some of the labourers now so that they would have a chance of getting work or unemployment assistance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the picture painted by the Deputy who has just sat down of the absurdity of the Government throwing away, recklessly and deliberately, a market worth in or about £40,000,000 per year and then sending their agents out like so many pedlars to carry our goods over every frontier in Europe in the hope of getting a bidder, of getting a purchaser, is a rather striking picture of the absurd conditions which exist in this <Col N="675" /> country at the moment and of the muddleheadedness which is ruining and, incidentally, ruling the country at the present time.  We had the Minister, in the stumbling statement with which he introduced the Supplementary Estimate, explaining why steps had to be taken to penalise those who preferred to sell in the home market and why steps had to be taken to encourage those who, according to him, took the long view and preferred to sell in a foreign market.  We had that statement made, I take it, in all honesty by one Minister of this Government, and we had his colleagues on the Ministerial Front Bench touring the country, as Deputy Dillon mentioned, thanking God that the British market was gone.  We had the President and another Minister in that Government hoping that it would only take a few short days to destroy entirely the British market and the live-stock trade of this country.</P>
      <P>Something about £2,250,000 has been spent this year already in bounties.  We are now asked, an overtaxed and poor people, to put up another £750,000 for bounties.  The money is big, but if we could get at that price a clear-cut, honest statement from the Government it would be cheap even at that price.  Two years or more experience of that Government compels me to believe that no matter what price we pay, we certainly will never get a true or straightforward expression of Government policy; we will never get any expression of Government policy that any two of them will agree to stand over at the same time.  Like the animal that changes the colour of its skin or hide according to atmospheric and geographical conditions, we have a Government that changes its colour and complexion according to the particular type of people they are talking to; the particular area they are in; or whatever the lad at the back of the crowd wants them to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why are we providing this £3,000,000?  Is it to get into a market that it is a good thing to have lost? Let us see what this amounts to.  We put up £3,000,000 here to help produce <Col N="676" /> into the British market.  We pay £5,000,000 on the other side of the water to further help it in by way of admission tax.  Between the two, we pay £8,000,000 or £9,000,000 per year to feed the people that we are supposed to be carrying on an economic war with&mdash;to get our goods into the market that it is a good thing we have lost.  Where are we drifting?  Is it good policy or not to sell to England? If it is bad policy to sell our goods to England, it is unforgiveable to be taxing the people in order to sell goods to England.  If it is good policy to sell goods to England, then any and every obstacle between the people of this country and the British market must be removed; and Ministers one and all must combine and use every effort to remove any obstacle that is there between this country and that market.</P>
    <P>When we advocate any attempt at negotiations, any honest meeting between the members of this Government and the British Government, we are called traitors; we are told we are playing the English game; that we are backing up England in the economic war.  What part did the Minister himself play in Ottawa when he attended bridge parties where we are told cards were not produced?  What negotiations took place in Ottawa?  What was the foundation for the Vice-President, when he arrived back in this country, telling us through the Press that if a settlement had not actually been made, at least the way had been prepared for a settlement?  Was that true or was it false?  If it was true, was he acting the part of a traitor in Ottawa? If his statement was true, that over there in Ottawa, when the bridge parties, where there were no cards, were carried on between the Minister, the Vice-President and Mr. Thomas, the way was actually prepared for a settlement, who interfered subsequently; who blasted those hopes; who undid the work in which the Minister himself participated in Ottawa?</P>
    <P>We had a speech&mdash;apparently a hypocritical speech&mdash;delivered by the President at Geneva.  We had him there lecturing the plain people of the world, deploring and condemning secret diplomacy, backdoor methods; advocating <Col N="677" /> there with all the appearance of honesty, that if there were difficulties between countries, those difficulties had got to be settled in God's sunshine before the peoples of the world.  How did he practise what he preached? Was there anything open from beginning to end of the struggle that is ruining this country?  Were there any negotiations ever held in the light of day?  Did the people of the country or the Deputies in this Dáil ever get any account of what transpired at any of these negotiations?  We had that indication by the Vice-President that, if peace had not actually been made, at least the road to peace had been levelled and prepared. What occurred since?  We had a certain amount of cat-jumping here and there&mdash;hopping across and hopping back.  We have meetings in London, meetings in Dublin, meetings in trains de luxe, anything but the open type of diplomacy which was advocated in Geneva.  If we cannot have open diplomacy as advocated by the President when he spoke at Geneva, we can at least have common honesty. That is not expecting too much.  And we can at least have sufficient courage behind that honesty to say whether that market is a good thing to have or not.  If it is a good thing to have, even so good and valuable as to be worth while mulcting the people of this country to the tune of £9,000,000 in order to scramble into its fringe, then it is worth while to consolidate our position in that market and to demand of the Government Ministers to do the job they are paid to do&mdash;that is when difficulties arise between this country and between any other country that they will face up to their responsibilities like men and meet the members of that other Government, pit their brains against that other Government, and bring back to their people here at home whatever is due to them according to the strength of their case and their ability to state that case.</P>
    <P>Such work means political risk.  You cannot do the work of Government Ministers and keep the extremists with you all the time.  You cannot do the work of Government Ministers and <Col N="678" /> be 100 per cent. effective in every negotiation into which you go.  That is one of the responsibilities of government. It is one of the things you are paid to do and if you shirk that you shirk the very first and greatest and gravest responsibility of government in this or any other country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>We have here an Estimate for £763,000 for agricultural bounties.  There was a Bill called the Confirmation Orders Bill brought into this House to-day to confirm certain duties or tariffs under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act.  I do not know whether the Minister made it clear as to the amount he expects to derive from those duties or tariffs.  But we had in the Budget a sum of £2,500,000 and if we are to tot up all the additions to the original figure in the Budget it will certainly amount to £4,000,000, the figure at which Deputy O'Higgins put it.  We are expending £4,000,000 for what?  To preserve, as the Minister says, an industry which everybody knows is not being preserved&mdash;to give the lie to the Ministers on the Front Bench who, two years ago, were making very different declarations from those they are making now.</P>
      <P>In July, 1932, when the British first put on taxes on our agricultural produce, as everybody who had any commonsense expected they would do, we had the spectacle of the Minister for Finance, one of the Ministers who is largely to blame for this state of affairs, coming into this House and telling us that the action taken by the British would be futile in making the people of this country pay the land annuities.  He added:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The tariff, whether it be 20 per cent., 40 per cent., or even 100 per cent., if the British choose to make it as high as that, would inevitably fall on the British themselves and be paid by the British farmers and consumers.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, we questioned that.  The debate on that particular subject was rather curtailed.  Most of the farmer-Deputies on this side of the House were prevented from speaking on that <Col N="679" /> particular occasion.  Some of us got in something by way of interjection.  I did put a question to the Minister, a question to which Deputy Dillon referred to-day.  It was the only chance to intervene that I got.  At that time the Minister was apparently very serious in his contention that whatever duty the British put on our goods, it did not matter to us, as they would have to pay themselves.  Now we have a Bill for £4,000,000 odd&mdash; giving the lie direct to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The Government introduced another measure at a later period.  It was called the Emergency Fund (Grant-in-Aid) of £2,000,000.  The President himself came into the House and introduced it.  He told us that it was required to open new markets for our agricultural produce and for our manufactured products.  Speaking on that debate I ventured to make a few remarks.  I have not changed my mind since though the Minister has changed his.  I said then what I should like to say now&mdash;that £2,000,000 would go a very short way in subsidising the cattle industry of this country if we were going to provide a price which will be anything like equivalent to that which existed before the present situation arose.  I said that I believed that both the search for new markets and the attempt to bolster up economic prices by subsidies would fail in the end and that we would find ourselves depending on the British market for the sale of our agricultural produce.</P>
    <P>That was at the time when the President was saying that the sale of our products in the British market did not matter.  Events have proved that those of us on this side of the House were nearer to the truth than the Ministers opposite.  The Ministers and especially the Minister for Agriculture are paying for their own indiscretions. Probably the Minister for Agriculture was the least culpable.  But he has to carry the baby.  I have every sympathy with the Minister in the position in which he finds himself.  In my particular county we had two or three perambulations from Ministers <Col N="680" /> on the opposite side.  We had two visits from the President, one from the Minister for Industry and Commerce and I think a visit from the Minister for Agriculture.  They all tried to prove to the farmers of Limerick that there was at least one profitable end of the farmers' business&mdash;that was the dairying industry.  I do not think that the Minister for Agriculture will get up in the House to-night or to-morrow or any day this week or month and say that dairying is a profitable industry.  We had the President himself coming down to Limerick and stating that the farmers of Limerick above all the people in this State should not grumble&mdash;that they were living in clover.  And we have £394,000 bounty asked for to-day in addition to the other expenditure on dairy produce in order to maintain that industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the Minister for Agriculture and the Government are satisfied that no alternative markets are available, I think that, in all fairness, the farmer should get a bounty equal to the tariff he is paying to the British Government until such time as the economic war is settled. The exporter is asked to pay 25/- per cwt. for cattle to be shipped to the British market.  Take a ten cwt. beast at 25/- a cwt.  The tariff will amount to £6, and 18/9 must be put aside for a three-quarter cwt. loss in transit. In all, the cost will come to £21 3s. 9d. That beast would require to fetch in the British market £2 2s. 4½d. per cwt. to cover that sum.  Deputy Corry has said that the English farmer cannot <Col N="682" /> rear beef at present-day prices. If he cannot do so, what about the Irish farmer who has to pay a £6 tariff on a two-year-old beast?  Surely he is £6 worse off than the North of Ireland or the British farmer.  We are asked to grow more corn, especially wheat.  We are prepared to grow anything that will pay us.  But if we grow more wheat, we have got to stall-feed more cattle or fatten more pigs or we shall not be able to grow it very long.  We must have farmyard manure and we must have rotation of crops.  For every acre of wheat we sow, we must follow up with an acre of oats or something else.  That means that we shall have a bigger surplus of fat cattle and a smaller surplus of store cattle.  Until the economic war is over, we would want a bounty equal to the tariff if the Government's policy is not to fall through.  One cannot grow wheat for two or three years on the same land. We have heard a great deal about the pig industry.  Through the policy of the Government, pigs in the Minister's own constituency fell 7/- a cwt. between last Friday and Monday.  On last Friday the price was 40/- and on last Monday it was 33/- live weight. That means 14/- on an average 16-stone pig.  There is no protection for the farmer or the labourer.  How can he afford to meet a loss of 14/- per pig without any notice?  I think that it is up to the Minister or the Government to guarantee a price for so many months ahead so that people will know what they are doing.  I know a man who, last Saturday morning, saw by the papers that the price was 40/- a cwt., and made arrangements accordingly, while the wire from the factory on Monday showed that the price was 33/-.  Who had to bear that loss?  The unfortunate man who fed the pig.  To make their policy a success, the Government will have to change the whole system.  There is no use in saying that we will make the country prosperous by growing beet at 30/- a ton.  That cannot be done.  There is no encouragement in the price of 30/- to the man who knows the hardship involved in getting the beet out of the land and sending it to the factory.  It is only during the fine seasons of the past two <Col N="683" /> years that wheat could be made a success. It was made a success and I am glad of it, but is there any guarantee that we shall have a continuance of fine weather?  On several occasions, I remember seeing wheat getting lodged before it was cut.  We have much moisture in this country and if our wheat gets lodged and we have not live stock, what is to become of it?  If it is not millable, it will have to be dumped somewhere.  If the Government cannot afford to give a bounty equal to the tariff, they must stop the economic war or break the people.  The people are fairly well broken at present. We hear that there is a no-rent campaign down the country.  What there is in the country is an inability-to-payrent campaign.  The people are not able to pay.  They have already had collected from them by the British Government £2,000,000 on their produce.  Yet, President de Valera says the farmers are so well off, with half their annuities remitted, that they should be thanking God that the British market is gone and gone for ever.</P>

      <P>The Deputy tries to persuade the farmers that if the cattle trade goes down the whole country must go down with it.  Deputy Dillon stated that we had demoralised the people more in two years than the British Government did in six centuries.  I believe we would demoralise the people entirely if we agreed with the views put forward by Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Dillon that the only thing they could do was to produce cattle.  We were told that if the market for cattle was taken away the country would be on the point of collapse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="685" /> The Government is doing everything it can to alleviate a very difficult situation.  I believe the British Government is not behind in trying to help their farmers in the great difficulty in which they are.  Like us, they proceeded with the rather profitable industry of raising live stock, and that had been the custom owing to their fiscal policy having lasted for 60 or 80 years.  Most of them, like the farmers in this country, lived the life that existed before the war.  They did not admit that after the war a new world commenced.  We find in 1929 and 1930 that the position in the British markets, as far as cattle were concerned, was this: it would take something like 24,000,000 cattle to feed the British people in the year.  Ireland, England and Wales combined to supply some 12,000,000; Australia alone could supply the other 12,000,000.  The other Colonial countries&mdash;Rhodesia and Canada, not including India, and other Protectorates&mdash;could supply 37,000,000. Immediately, there was a surplus of live stock.  But something added to that surplus, and made it more difficult to operate, and that was the economic depression that touched every single country after the war.  Many young people in England, professional men and others, had found occupations after the war in different Colonies. About 1929, passenger ships returning from these countries were full up of young men whose jobs had ceased because of the economic depression. They came back to England to look for something to do.  Most of these people decided that they would produce something on the land.  Industries had been sinking rapidly and there was no employment to be got in these particular lines.  These people were forced eventually to go on the land.  The position in England in 1929 and 1930, as far as the importation of foodstuffs was concerned, was this: that the Commonwealth or Dominions could supply England with twice the amount of food she needed.  From foreign countries England bought in these years £10,000,000 worth of foodstuffs per week.  They paid £17,000,000 a year for imported eggs and £1,000,000 a week for butter&mdash;something like <Col N="686" /> 6,000 tons.  I want anybody very interested in that to take these figures and compare them with the figures to-day of what England alone produces and what it is imperative for England to produce.</P>
    <P>Now apart altogether from the economic war, as it is called, and the political dispute between this country and England, any normally minded person will admit that it is the duty of the British Government to protect British farmers and they will admit that they are in need of protection, and they are taking every step it is possible to take to protect them.  And, apart from political issues and other issues, as men we are not entitled to claim the other man's property.  The position has gradually come to this that England by herself is able, for instance, to produce all the eggs required in England; and having produced all the eggs required, they are able to produce the normal amount of meat and poultry required.  In every other industry, the pig industry and the butter industry, they are making every effort to supply themselves because it must be done.  However, strange to relate, it is a fact that the same policy is being preached in England as we are preaching here.  A Deputy made some remarks about the growing of wheat. The British Minister of Agriculture advocated very strongly that wheat be grown and less live stock be raised. The real position in England at the moment is this: districts like Wales, and some of the Highlands of Scotland, are as badly off as the districts Deputy McGovern complains about. There is gradually arising in Wales a serious surplus of store cattle.  They are a rather inferior type and they are rather difficult for them to cash. One reads in the English newspapers of almost daily protests by Welsh farmers that they cannot sell their store cattle; that every market is crowded with Irish cattle and that owing to the superior quality of the Irish cattle they are unable to sell their cattle.  I am informed by dealers who go to the Welsh fairs that these cattle can be bought from £2 10s. to £3 per head.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="687" /> England has her problem, and there is no use in people here trying to lead the whole country to the opinion that we can force ourselves on the British market when, in reality, that market is needed by British farmers themselves. The sooner we realise that these subsidies and bounties are made to lessen the burden, and to make it easy for our farmers during the transition period, the better.  The Argentine alone could put more beef on the British market than the British market would require in two years.  They, like other great meat producing countries&mdash;even when they signed an agreement, as I heard somebody mention, at Ottawa&mdash;signed an agreement with the British Government that the British would allow their meat in without restriction, provided that the Argentine took a certain amount of manufactured goods.  When this collapse came in the British market, the British Government appealed to the Argentine in order to see if they could change the agreement and if a quota on meat exports into the British market would be accepted.  The Argentine agreed to that, but they agreed to it with respect to chilled meat only and said that if they were to submit to export into the British market under a quota system, the British Government should insist that every meat producing country that was supplying the British market should also submit to a quota.</P>
    <P>It is only last week or the week before last that the British Government asked Australia to desist for at least three weeks from exporting meat.  One of the peculiar things about this matter of quotas is that the quota is only on the high-class meat and not on low-class meat.  Some call it box meat or rolled meat.  It is only boned meat rolled up.  It looks extremely well and it is sold at 2½d. per lb.  So that, even the British farmer does not receive the protection he wants, and it is from that protection we are suffering; and if the live stock industry is not one to follow up, we must turn our attention to something else.  If the late Government had recognised those facts we <Col N="688" /> would not have been in the plight in which we are to-day.</P>
    <P>You may talk about all the prosperity that existed before the advent of Fianna Fáil, but as far back as 1927 &mdash;in the Christmas of 1927&mdash;there was a motion put down here which and reference to the activities of the Land Commission in recovering annuities.  It was extremely difficult to collect annuities towards the end of 1927. Something serious had happened.  Some screw had gone wrong in the machinery and people found themselves unable to meet the land annuities.  I, along with other Deputies, made a special appeal asking the Land Commission to desist from putting writs into execution for at least the three weeks of Christmas.  When we took over power, there were in County Meath, as far as I remember, 4,000 writs against farmers in the hands of the State Solicitor.  That did not indicate the degree of prosperity that some people on the opposite benches would try to lead us to believe existed. I know that many Deputies on the other side knew that there was serious objection to the carrying on of such a system in this country and knew that, nationally, men had protested, and protested strongly, for generations against this system.  I notice that none of the men opposite make any mention whatsoever of other difficulties.  I may say that they are difficulties we are rather proud of.  I refer to the difficulties we have here now in an increase in population.  There is no Deputy on the other side but knows very well that at the height of the cattle industry in this country, emigration had reached its greatest height also.  The two things went arm in arm with one another.  There is no Deputy on the other side but believes that, long before Arthur Griffith or Eamon de Valera spoke about it, people protested against that system and held the belief that as long as it existed emigration would have to continue, and that the people would continue to leave this country.</P>
    <P>I maintain that one of our greatest difficulties here to-day is that we have not enough people yet, and that our <Col N="689" /> population is extremely low.  I notice Deputies smiling at that statement. Deputies may smile, but I believe that that is the greatest difficulty.  There may be Deputies here from Donegal, and I think that they will admit that conacre land in Donegal is worth from £7 to £7 10s. an acre; whereas in County Meath £3 an acre cannot be obtained, because there are no people there to take over the land.  If we want value to attach to our land it can only be attached to it when there are people there to take the land.  What did the cattle trade leave behind it? Up to 1921 it was a trade that enabled quite a number of people, especially those engaged in production and distribution, to make a living out of it. It was a trade for a few people.  It kept those few people going, and that is one of the reasons why, even after all the preaching and propaganda and assistance through newspapers that was given to the other Party, every time they went to the people in the last three years they came back weaker.  They came back weaker because the people were intelligent and would not be deceived, and they found that, ultimately, the farmers of this country were men who were capable of making good, and who could make good even under the present conditions. I maintain that a number of farmers in this country are making good already under the present conditions. If there is a surplus of cattle and live stock generally, as there is in other countries, we are doing our best to help them to dispose of that surplus. During the last regime our cattle and our poultry industry deteriorated.</P>

      <P>It is quite true, and it would have been the case if there was never an economic war.  What happened in this country was that there was sheer neglect of the farmer up to the present time&mdash;neglect both as far as the division of his land was concerned and attention to his particular industry.  We appealed here for a tariff on oats, but Canadian oats were sold here at 7/- a barrel.  The Minister opposed that tariff bitterly, but the next morning he presented us with a tariff on oats.  But when? When most of the distributors had got away with the profit.  That indicated that he was forced by some circumstances of the depression.</P>
      <P>If there are losses to-day on the farmers of Ireland, they can be mainly attributed to the neglect and lethargy of the late Government.  It is quite true that the collapse of 1921 finished quite a number of farmers.  The result of the collapse of cattle prices then was not apparent immediately afterwards, but gradually; and up to the present day the results are becoming apparent day by day.  Accordingly, as I said a few moments ago, the cattle trade has left nothing behind it&mdash;neither people nor buildings, nor wealth, nor anything else.  It could not have left anything behind it because it was the business of only a few people.  That is not saying that we do not want a cattle trade. We do; but we want a cattle trade of a high-class nature.  We want to be able to supply our own needs here and to supply whatever country is in a position to take cattle from us.  But if you got the country to agree to your principle that there was nothing in this country but the production of cattle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I can tell the Deputy that we have not any farmers in the south who can make 7/- per acre out of their land at the moment.  I do not know whether Deputy O'Reilly is a farmer or not, but if he is a farmer and if he comes down to County Kilkenny and instructs us how we shall be able to make £7 out of our land, we shall try to make it.</P>

      <P>I should like him to do so.  I do not know whether the Deputy has attended any fairs or markets for the last year, but I have to attend practically three or four fairs every month.  I happened to be at one last Monday and I was at one in Thomastown yesterday in our own county.  It is pitiable to see the conditions at these fairs and the position with which the farmers are faced at present.  They are selling splendid cattle for 50/- per head, cattle for which they were getting £11 and £12 per head at the time to which Deputy O'Reilly refers, when the last Government were in office.  I say that the Government are responsible for the present position.  I say that the farmer who breeds his own cattle, keeps a dairy and tills a certain amount of his land, gives more employment than the man who goes in for tillage alone.  He is a man who gives more employment than any other class of farmer in the country.  If a man does not keep a certain number of cattle, there is no use in his going in for tillage, because after a certain number of years he will have nothing but weeds and dockleaves growing on his land.  You cannot have successful tillage without stable manure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The destruction of the cattle trade in this country destroyed the best branch of our industry, the one upon which we most depended.  We grew corn and roots, we tilled our land and fed our cattle.  It was principally from what we received for our cattle that we paid for our tillage.  I look upon the present position as a disgraceful position and I hold the Government, and nobody else, responsible for it.  If they want to settle the economic dispute <Col N="694" /> we are with them.  If they do no want to settle it, let them compensate us for the losses which we have suffered.  We cannot continue to live under the present conditions.  I say it is a disgrace to any country to see the sheriffs and the bailiffs confiscating the property of the farmers.  In Castlemorris, in our county, they have erected a new pound at a gentleman's residence.  They have there four or five lorries with a number of Broy Harriers for confiscating cattle and other property of the people.</P>

Here we are up against the winter with a lot of surplus cattle on our hands and with no market for them.  Even if we are able to sell them at 25/- a cwt., they cannot be reared and fattened at that price.  The Minister knows it cannot be done.  It is his duty to get a market for the surplus cattle we have on hands.  I blame the Government and nobody else for the whole position and let the Minister take the responsibility on his shoulders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will tell you some truths. There was a debate to-day on export bounties.  This is on export quotas. What I have to say can be taken as a reply to either debate, because I think those who spoke from the opposite side did not make any distinction in their speeches.  They dealt with both subjects.  Deputy Dillon asked me two specific questions.  I am sorry that he is not here.  I am sure if he were and heard my answer to him he would, as Deputy O'Reilly said, go on making the same old assertions over and over again.  The Deputies opposite must give a political twist to what they say here.  They do not come here to try and settle these problems at all, they make no attempt to do that, but rather talk politics so that they may be able to go down the country and repeat at a Blueshirt meeting or at cross-cut parades all the smart things that they tell the people they said here.  Deputy Dillon asked me whether Senator Connolly is a fool or a knave, and what is the policy of the Government with regard to cattle.  Senator Connolly is neither a fool nor a knave.  I am quite certain about that.  The Deputy also asked me my opinion of the person who would say that we can go on here with increased tillage without increasing our live stock.  I am supposed to have said on some occasion or other that the person who made the statement that this Government were out against live stock was either a fool or a knave.  I probably did say&mdash;I do not deny the correctness of the report &mdash;that the Deputies opposite said that we were trying to kill the live-stock business of this country.  If Deputy Dillon said it I would not have any hesitation in telling whether he is a fool or a knave.  I have told the Party opposite over and over again that, as <Col N="696" /> far as this Government is concerned, we never went out to kill the live-stock industry.</P>
      <P>We were up against it in certain cases and we tried to do the best we could. When we were up against it we did not get much help from the Deputies opposite.  They took every possible advantage of the situation we were faced with to make political propaganda out of it.  I remember that when these quotas came on first, we advised the farmers not to rush their cattle on to the market, but the people on the other side said that we would have 58 per cent. of a surplus and that if the farmers did not sell then they would never be able to sell.  They advised the farmers to throw all their cattle on the market at the one time so that we would have here a bad market or, as they call it, a de Valera market. They did not care what ruin they brought on the farmers and the country. All that they were concerned about was to make political propaganda out of the position, and they advised the farmers to throw all their cattle on the market at the one time, thereby bringing down prices.  In giving that advice they thought they were doing a good thing for their Party, and they did not mind what injury they were doing to the country.  I said on that occasion that we could get rid of all the stall-fed cattle in this country if people would only take their time, and we did.  We had an idea of the number of stall-fed cattle that we had in the country at that time and of what the home consumption would be.  We knew exactly from the number of licences what our exports would be.  We knew that the number of stall-feeders in the country could be got rid of by the end of May.  In consequence, we advised the farmers not to rush their cattle immediately on to the market but to try and hold them.  If they had done that and followed our advice they would have got a better price for their stall-fed cattle last spring, but, of course, that would not suit the Party opposite.  If the farmers had taken our advice the Party opposite could have made no political capital out of the quotas, and, of course, that was all that they were concerned with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="697" /> Deputy Dillon asked what is the policy of the Government with regard to cattle.  I repeat what Deputy O'Reilly said: let us produce good cattle and let us produce as many cattle as we can get sold.  That is our policy. Let us produce as many cattle as we can absorb on the home market and as many as we can export.  That is our policy and, I suppose, would be the policy of any Government that would take control in this country. Surely that is simple enough.  Deputy Dillon asked me to be explicit in regard to our policy.  What I have said should be explicit enough for Deputy Dillon to understand, and if I can get him to understand it I am sure I could get any fool of a farmer in the country to understand it.</P>

      <P>If that is understood, then I can go on.  There are some other points that I want to deal with.  I will probably come back to the cattle again as that is the big subject.  I was asked about the bounties which arise with regard to cattle and turkeys.  Deputy Keating, I think, said that unless we pay the full bounty, that is a bounty equivalent to the tariff, we are not being fair to the farmers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not say whether it is right or wrong, but that is what the Deputy said.  Deputy McGovern, on the other hand, finds fault with us for paying the full bounty on turkeys to cover the tariff at the other side.  I know that there are serious splits and differences in the other Party.  It is very difficult to deal with a Party which says things like that; where one of them censures the Government for not paying a bounty equal to the tariff, and where another censures the Government for paying a bounty equal to the tariff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The bounty here is 5d.; the people are getting 6d.  If they are getting a bounty to pay the tariff on the other side they are getting 6d. as if there were no economic war.  Is not that the position?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy is paying for it.  That point will come too if he will allow me.  Deputy McGovern said that we profess to be the Government of small farmers.  We profess to be the Government of all classes in this country, but especially we are the Government of small farmers.  The small farmers have made it quite plain, every chance they got for the last three years, that we are the Government of the small farmers.  They have not left any doubt about it at all.  Not only the small farmers but, as I have said here before, every genuine farmer in this country is behind the Government. Every genuine farmer who is working his farm in the proper way, and trying to make a decent living instead of felling trees, is behind the Government, otherwise we could not be here after three successive elections.  Every genuine farmer in the country is behind us.  The ballot boxes tell that. When the people go to the poll they confirm what I say.  Deputy McGovern said the people left cattle along the road in the west of Ireland &mdash;that they turned them out on the road because they could not sell them. That reminds me of what Deputy Bennett said at one time&mdash;that they were drowning young pigs down in Limerick.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose they did not slaughter the calves either?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They did, but not enough of them.  If we had given sufficient encouragement&mdash;probably we did not &mdash;to the farmers to slaughter more calves, and consume veal instead of beef, we would not have the same problem here, because we would be getting more into the position of Continental countries who have enough cows to supply their own wants in dairy produce, and not too many cattle to supply them with beef. That is the trouble here.  After all we have 1,200,000 cows in this country. If we did not export any butter or milk product we would require 900,000 cows for our own use in this country.  Supposing we did get our cows down to 900,000; if we were to <Col N="700" /> go on with the present system of rearing calves we would have too many cattle.  The way they deal with that problem in Continental countries is they consume more veal and less beef.  If we could go even a small bit in that direction here we would be much better off.  As Deputy O'Reilly says also, we would be very much better off if bad and inferior calves were slaughtered so that the quality of the cattle left behind would be improved.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGovern complained about the efforts we were making to get the foreign markets.  He compared me to a pedlar.  I would almost want Deputy Smith to deal with that.  He would have dealt with it, judging from the speech he made here in the House some time ago.  I do not think Deputy O'Higgins contributed a great deal, except those very peculiar mathematics which are worked out on the opposite benches.  He says we pay £3,000,000 in bounties and that we pay £5,000,000 in tariffs on the other side. He counts that up to be £8,000,000 which it is costing us to send our cattle to England.  I find it very difficult to understand that.  I find it very difficult to understand why those two items should be put in and added together, because surely no matter how you look at it&mdash;from the point of view of the Irish farmer, from the point of view of the shipper, from the point of view of the British purchaser, from the point of view of the Irish Government or from the point of view of the English Government&mdash;the two should be on the opposite side of the ledger.  If the Irish farmer here claims that he is paying the full tariff going into Great Britain, surely the bounties come off that, and they should not be added together.  We are told that is what it is costing the country to export our stuff to Great Britain&mdash;the £5,000,000 and £3,000,000.  They are added together.  That gives an idea of the mathematics on the other side.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless the Deputy wants a vulgar fraction he will have to subtract the smaller from the larger. Deputy Bennett, on the other hand, says that we brought in a Bill here this evening which is going to put tariffs on things coming into the country, and we bring in an Estimate for £3,000,000 for things going out of the country; he adds the two of those together as the cost of trade and he makes it, I think, £4,000,000.  Again I would say that this is the difficulty in dealing with the arguments which come from the people opposite.  They all seem to have their own view about everything&mdash;not only about who should follow one leader or the other, but even on the matter of bounties and subsidies they all have their own view as to how to make calculations.  If it were true that the British were collecting £5,000,000 on the other side&mdash;which they are not&mdash;if they collected that money at that side instead of getting it across from this side, so far as the country is concerned, I cannot see that it makes very much difference.  Those who speak on behalf of agriculture may say it makes a big difference&mdash;and so it does&mdash;because they may say that part of it would come out of general taxation if paid across by the Government, <Col N="702" /> like, say, the R.I.C. pensions, instead of being levied off agricultural products.  It is true that it would make a big difference to agricultural exports, but to the country in general I do not see what difference it makes whether it is levied off goods that go into the British market, or whether it is see across in cash from one Government another.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not a bit, as far as I am concerned.  Deputy Dillon made a very long speech, occupying I think twenty-nine columns of the Official Debates.  There are just a few points that I was able to make a little sense of, with which I should like to deal. There is not much sense in the rest. The Deputy talked about the price of cattle going to Germany.  In one column he said the price of cattle was 18/- or 16/- a cwt., and a few lines further on he said that they were 14/- or 12/- a cwt.; while, in another column, he said that they went for the price of their skins.  That is Deputy Dillon's regard for facts on which to base arguments.  It did not make the slightest difference to him whether cattle were selling for 18/- or for the price of their skins, as long as he could throw dirt on the German buyer who came to the market here.  I will give the House an idea of how little Deputy Dillon knows about agriculture or agricultural schemes, and how little interest he has in the farmers in his <Col N="704" /> own constituency, or in any other part of the country.  The Deputy, in the course of two columns, talked about the guaranteed price of wheat being 27/6 a barrel, which it is not.  Deputy Dillon did not know that.  The big argument used by Deputy Dillon, as well as by many other Deputies this evening, is that by lessening the number of cattle we cannot have any tillage.</P>

      <P>It does not matter to Deputy Dillon whether it is or is not. I am supposed to have said that the person who accused the Government <Col N="705" /> of being in favour of tillage and of being out for the destruction of the live stock industry was either a knave or a fool.  I was talking of tillage on that occasion.  I am now told that we cannot increase tillage unless we increase live stock.  I am told further that unless we keep cattle we cannot increase tillage, because cattle are supposed to be very important in a tillage country.  Of course, they are very important, but they are not all important.  The British quota for fat cattle, with which we are dealing in this motion, was reduced by 50 per cent. &mdash;I do not remember the exact figure&mdash;for January, February, March, April and May.  These five months covered the stall-feeding period.  Our quota did not amount to more than 40,000 cattle.  Therefore, we were cut by 40,000, and if there was no quota we would have exported the same number of cattle in the first five months of 1933 as 1934, as I believe there were not quite as many stall-fed cattle. Supposing we had an extra market for the extra stall-feds, and supposing that we had produced them for an expanding market in Great Britain what would it amount to in the way of tillage?  What would this great British market amount to if we got it back without any quota?  Deputy Dillon gave the impression the other night that it ruined our whole tillage policy &mdash;the loss of the British market. Deputy Keating dealt with cattle and tillage.

Probably not more than 10,000 acres of grain, and 10,000 acres of roots.  As far as the quota for fat cattle goes, about which there is all the trouble, and which this motion deals with, if we cannot do extra tillage, because we have lost a market which amounts to only 20,000 acres of tillage, we have grown this year about 30,000 extra acres of beet and about 45,000 extra acres of wheat, making 75,000 acres, or almost four times as much as we lost by the cattle quota.</P>

      <P>You said you could not do it and pay labour a living wage. Deputy Keating corroborated that this evening.  I wonder did Deputy Keating get as many requests from the people in South Wexford to be allowed to grow beet this year as I did?  Did he get as many pressing letters as I did from the farmers asking to be allowed to grow beet at 30/- a ton?  I believe that there were 4,000 extra acres put under cultivation in that area.</P>

      <P>If we can do it, we will, but we must get a market.  Deputy Dillon told us here how I went down and the only astonishing thing I did was to open my mouth in the backwoods of Kerry.  What is wrong with Kerry for the Deputy to talk about it like that?  Are the people of Kerry to be looked down upon by Deputy Dillon and those who sit on the benches beside him?  Why should he speak in such a way about my going down to the backwoods of Kerry?  That sort of talk shows the mentality of the Deputy.  Apparently, unless a person comes from what Deputy McGilligan would refer to as the Clyde Road area or North Great George's Street, he is to be looked down upon in this House. The people in the backwoods of Kerry are very intelligent people and I can assure the Deputy I got on quite well with them.  I can also assure him that he would not get on nearly as well if he went there.  They probably would not agree with many of the things he says.  I was not in the Dingle Peninsula, <Col N="710" /> but I was in South Kerry.  However, that does not make much difference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The importance of the cattle trade has been stressed.  Deputy Dillon expressed the belief that the cattle trade was of supreme importance to the country.  He asked the Government to realise that the cattle industry is the lynch-pin of the country's commerce and every other branch of industry is interlocked with it.  He said that if you destroy the cattle trade you are throwing the whole economy of the country out of gear, with the result that the whole structure will come toppling down about your ears. Surely Deputy Dillon has sufficiently emphasised that the cattle industry is the all-important industry.  Yet that was denied by some Deputies opposite this evening.  We have the usual statements from prominent Deputies on the opposite benches.  They say that they do not approve of the movement not to pay rates or taxes.  They do not approve of the cutting of trees and <Col N="711" /> they advise the people to pay rates. But having done so, apparently they do not want to lose the support altogether of that element in the country, and they come back and say: &ldquo;Of course, if you are hard-up and not able to pay, that is a different thing.  Do not think I am condemning you altogether for doing these things. If you are hard-up, we will stand by you.&rdquo;  The Deputy says: &ldquo;If the Government, in the name of the law, attempts to break up a man's family and exacts a demand the result of which may throw him and his family into the poorhouse, I say that that man would be a fool if he did not stand on his own threshold and defend his home.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This, I take it, is an occasion on which Deputy Dillon would take up the rifle and cross-cut.  He said he would take them up if required, but Deputy Dillon last Sunday qualified that statement also.  He said that there had been a civil war before and one was enough and although he was prepared to take up the rifle and cross-cut, he qualified that statement by saying that he could not see any circumstances in which he would take them up because he does not want to see another civil war again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That ends Deputy Dillon's twenty-seven columns on this motion. The two big matters that arise are, I suppose, firstly, that we are being censured because we failed to secure a <Col N="712" /> quota sufficient for the needs of the country, and secondly, that in the arguments that are put forward in support of this motion, it has been suggested by practically every Deputy on the opposite side that not only do we lose the cattle industry by losing that export quota, but that practically every branch of agriculture goes down as well.  The argument is made that if we have any lesser number of cattle, our tillage policy goes completely.  The motion says:</P>
      <P>That the Dáil condemns the Executive Council for its neglect to secure a quota for the export of cattle to Great Britain adequate to the needs of our agricultural industry. &mdash;(Deputies P. Hogan and R. Curran).</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with condemning this Government, because this Government is not responsible for it, and that is what I have been trying to impress on the Deputy all the time. I have been trying, for, I suppose, practically three years now, to impress on all the Deputies opposite that this Government is not responsible for that state of affairs.  I have been trying to get the Deputies opposite to take the view that the British Government are, at any rate, also responsible, and I think they might go that far.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They have to take this view for political reasons, and now they are in difficulties politically in trying to keep the greater section of the Blueshirts on their side.  For political reasons, we will let them blame this Government, to a certain extent, so that they may keep their dwindling following together, if that is possible, but they ought sometimes at any rate <Col N="713" /> to admit, for the sake of the country and for the sake of getting a bigger quota, if you like, that the British Government is also responsible.  It would be better for this country, even if they took only that low view of it, if you like.</P>
