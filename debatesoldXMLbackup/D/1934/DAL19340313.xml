      <P>asked the President if the issue of typescript copies of Emergency Orders made by the Executive Council under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act, 1932, has been discontinued, and if he will consider the reintroduction of this procedure in order that Deputies may not have to wait for the publication of these orders.</P>

      <P>Except in the case of the earliest orders issued under the Act in question, it has been the practice to present printed copies of such orders to both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I have arranged that, in future, typed copies of every such order will, as soon as possible after it has been made by the Executive Council, be provided for presentation to both Houses and for circulation to Deputies and Senators.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state (a) what was the amount of the loan raised by the Kilmallock District Council in the year 1912 for the purchase of additional half-acre plots for cottiers; (b) what were the conditions of repayment of same; (c) what amount, if any, remains outstanding and (d) how many plots were acquired by this means.</P>

      <P>The reply <Col N="534" /> to the several parts of the question is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) A loan of £10,000 was obtained in 1913 by the former Kilmallock Rural District Council for the acquisition of additional half-acre allotments of land for existing labourers' cottages in the district; a supplemental loan of £5,000 to complete their acquisition was obtained in 1915.  (b) Both loans were obtained from the Minister and Leinster Bank for a period of 17 years at 4 per cent.  (c) The first loan is paid off and on the 30th September, 1933, a sum of £309 was outstanding on the supplementary loan.  (d) 470 additional allotments were provided.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (1) whether he is aware that parcels posted in Germany addressed to Irish Free State firms are subjected to London customs clearance charges made by a British firm acting as agents for the German parcel post; and (2) if he can make arrangements with the German Post Office authorities that only German and Irish transport and customs clearance charges shall be payable on parcels consigned to the Irish Free State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>Parcels posted in Germany can be forwarded either by the official Post Office service or by a semi-official service run conjointly by the German Post Office and certain private transport agencies in London. Parcels forwarded by the official service are examined and charged at the Dublin customs centre only, but when the semi-official service is utilised the parcels are subject to customs examination and clearance charges both in London and Dublin.</P>
      <P>The service used is decided by the senders and is not a matter in which this Administration can interfere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that fair?  We were told that the tobacco crop was to be <Col N="536" /> a great source of wealth and many people turned their attention to tobacco growing in order to obtain the advantage promised.  I think it is very unfair now to those growers who received that promise last year.  It would be more reasonable to prohibit the growing of tobacco altogether than to thus limit the number of growers.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That in the case of the Wearing of Uniform (Restriction) Bill, 1934, the remaining stages of the Bill shall be proceeded with as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  The Committee Stage of the Bill shall be set down for consideration on Tuesday, March 13th, 1934, and the proceedings on that stage, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 7 p.m. on Wednesday, March 14th, 1934, by putting from the Chair forthwith and successively any questions necessary to bring the proceedings to a conclusion:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provided that after the said hour on the latter day no question shall be put from the Chair on any amendment set down to the Bill save an amendment set down by the Government and the question on such an amendment shall be in the form: That the amendment be made; and after the appointed time the question to be put from the Chair to bring the proceedings in Committee on the Bill forthwith to a conclusion shall be (as the case may require), that the section, the sections, stand part of and that the Title be the Title to the Bill, or, that the section, the sections (as amended, if amendments have been made) stand part <Col N="538" /> of and that the Title be the Title to the Bill;</P>
    <P>(b)  The Fourth Stage of the Bill shall be proceeded with immediately upon the conclusion of the Committee Stage, and the proceedings on that stage, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m. on Wednesday, March 14th, 1934, by putting from the Chair forthwith the questions necessary to bring the proceedings to a conclusion, and after the appointed time no question shall be put from the Chair upon any amendment save an amendment set down by the Government, and the question on such an amendment shall be in the form: That the amendment be made;</P>
    <P>(c)  The Fifth Stage of the Bill shall be proceeded with immediately upon the conclusion of the Fourth Stage and the proceedings on that stage, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 10.15 p.m. on Wednesday, March 14th, 1934, by putting from the Chair forthwith the question necessary to bring the proceedings to a conclusion.</P>
    <P>The situation that renders it necessary to bring in this motion has arisen, I might say, entirely from the tactics adopted by the Opposition.  If Deputies will look at the amendments, serious and otherwise, that have been tabled to this Bill they will find that they number 127.  On the Second Reading debate all aspects of this Bill were gone into in detail and considered. The debate lasted for three days.  While reasonable time is necessary for the Committee Stage and the other remaining stages of the Bill, I would have felt that something like five or six hours, at any rate, would be ample to deal with any serious amendments proposed to be made to the Bill.  We have to recognise that the main principle of the Bill has been accepted by a majority of this House. The great majority of the amendments tabled by the Opposition are purely and simply, as anybody can see, intended to be obstructionist and to secure delay.  Some of them would appear to have something of the comic <Col N="539" /> side about them rather than to be an attempt to achieve something that the Opposition might try to achieve in the way of improvement, if they wanted that, of the Bill itself.  We regard this Bill as a necessary and as an urgent measure.  Because we regard it as such we, in view of the attitude adopted by the Opposition, have had no alternative except to table this motion which I now submit to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>The Opposition are not prepared to agree to this motion and they consider that they are fully justified in resisting it and resisting this Bill in every legitimate way they can.  We do not look upon this from a Party point of view.  This is a very serious question and we have very serious responsibilities with regard to it.  We should certainly not be tempted, even for a moment, to create a state of things in this country dangerous to public order and in contradiction to the principles of liberty and democracy simply because we might derive Party advantage therefrom or because we might have a better chance of winning the next General Election.  Now I wish I could get Ministers to believe in the sincerity of that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the President made a speech here on the 1st March I began to think that the prospects of reasonable accommodation between the Government and the Opposition on this matter were not so remote as they might seem.  Unfortunately, he made another speech the next day in a different tone and there has been no attempt since the 1st March to carry any further the proposal for accommodation and co-operative action that he sketched in that speech.  Now, I think it is desirable that we should realise, if the statements made solemnly on both sides are to be taken at their face value and are to be taken as sincere, that we ought not really to be flying at each other's throats in a desperate struggle over this measure. The President said the other day that he hated everything that tasted of coercion from the bottom of his heart. In spite of that he goes ahead with a <Col N="540" /> Bill which, I think, to any unprejudiced person does very decidedly taste of coercion.  The Government are going ahead with this closure motion which also tastes of coercion.  In other words, they have adopted the policy which they so often complain of in another connection: the policy of the big stick.  Is it really wise, is it desirable in the interests of this country, to settle this question by the use of the big stick?  The President said that he believed in patience.  He also used these words&mdash;I quote from column 2492 of the Official Debates&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Now I believe in liberty.  I believe in liberty for the individual. I believe in democratic liberty.  I believe that as human beings we are not to be dedicated to some idol of the State, but that the State&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and then he used the words &ldquo;in the main&rdquo; which do not appear in the Official Report&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;should be organised for the benefit of the individual.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now I accept the principles there outlined by the President.  I think everyone who is a true democrat, or a true lover of liberty, must accept those principles.  I also accept the view that we do not want militarism in politics: we do not want even the appearance or the colour of militarism in politics.  We do not want a state of things prevailing here similar to what prevailed for a great many years in several of the South American Republics where the normal method of changing a Government was a military or a <i>quasi</i>-military revolution. We want to teach the people of this country what democracy really is, and that is something that I am afraid a very large proportion of them do not yet understand.  We want to teach them that they should think out the nation's problems for themselves and that politics are not something that should be regimented; that people should not take their opinions readymade from organisations, particularly if those organisations have something in the nature of a military flavour.</P>
    <P>We are all agreed&mdash;any thinking person, any true democrat, any true lover of liberty must be agreed&mdash;about all these things and I would ask the <Col N="541" /> supporters of the Government not to suppose that we, on this side, are so lacking in conscience, so lacking in love of country, that we are prepared to imperil these principles for the sake of Party advantage.  Of course, we realise that this Blue Shirt movement has brought us great Party advantage and is likely to bring us more.  We realise that it has a glamour for the young people apart from its merits, its very great merits.  We realise also that what the Government have hitherto done and what they are now doing, in the way of using coercion against that organisation, is playing into our hands from a Party point of view, that their attempts under the Public Safety Act have brought us enormous advantage from a Party point of view and that this Bill, if and when it is passed into law, and the resentment created by it, will do great good to us and a great deal of harm to them.  Therefore, from a purely Party point of view, I do not think we have anything to gain by adopting a reasonable and conciliatory attitude and yet I wish to adopt a conciliatory attitude because our duty is not to the Party but to the country.  I would a thousand times sooner see the present Government stay in office indefinitely than have them turned out of office as the result of such methods as injure the cause of true democracy and true liberty.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Government that we have a great deal more reason for being suspicious of their <i>bona fides</i> in this matter than they have of being suspicious of ours.  When the first attempts were being made to stifle our Youth movement several months ago, immediately before the Party merger &mdash;or it may have been immediately after the Party merger&mdash;I myself had an interview with the Minister for Justice and the Attorney-General and, while I do not think it proper to publish afterwards what is said at such interviews by anyone except oneself, I think I am entitled to repeat what I said to them.  I said that, assuming they were genuine in the fears they expressed of the revolutionary activities of the National Guard, assuming that they really believed that this engaging of extra police and all the <Col N="542" /> rest of it, had been necessary to protect this Assembly against a Guy Fawkes plot in the cellars of this House, and that they were able to produce to me at any time evidence of such revolutionary activities going on in our Youth movement, that I would exert myself to the utmost to see that such activities were stopped and that failing that, if those activities existed and were not stopped, I was prepared to go out into the open and denounce them.  No proof of such activities was ever produced.</P>
    <P>Shortly afterwards, when I was abroad, a colleague of mine was approached by the Government in connection with that undertaking and was informed of a minor matter that the Government complained of in the activities of the Young Ireland Association and the thing they complained of was promptly stopped.  Apart from that they have not been able to reveal to us anything of an objectionable nature in the activities of our Youth movement. Later on, when the Young Ireland Association itself was banned, I had an interview with the President and I made certain suggestions to the President, as a personal matter between the two of us, which in my opinion would have removed every semblance of militarism from our Youth movement and I asked him whether, if I could get these suggestions accepted, he would withdraw the ban on the movement.  I regret to say I was unsuccessful in securing his agreement.</P>
    <P>Now the Government proceeded as long as they could against our Youth movement on the basis that it was actually revolutionary and they brought certain proceedings suggesting that the head of the movement was advocating the murder of the President.  It was only when they had made themselves thoroughly ridiculous in attempting to prove that our Youth movement was a revolutionary movement, that they turned to this method and that they based their case against it, not on its alleged criminal character, but simply on the fact that it introduced an undesirable element of militarism and provocation into politics, similar to what had been introduced in various Continental countries.  The impression that <Col N="543" /> is necessarily made on an impartial mind by the line the Government has taken is that their real interest has been to crush our Youth movement as such, that they were anxious, first of all, to see it taking a criminal direction and that, having been disappointed in that, they are now trying another method; that they found in fact that under the application of the Public Safety Act, much to their dismay, they were compelled to imprison for the most part supporters of their own and not supporters of the Opposition, and that here is a Bill which they hope will release them from that painful situation.</P>
    <P>How deep does this objection of the Government to militarism in politics go?  I would like to think that it did go deep but, to my mind, the suggestion that it is the Blue Shirts who have introduced a note of militarism into Irish politics is too ridiculous to be entertained for a moment.  Certainly throughout the two years and a bit of my own participation of an active character in Irish politics, militarism has been rampant, and a dangerous form of militarism, not the mild and glamorous form of militarism, if you like to call it so, that is exhibited by the Blue Shirts who come out into the open to defend freedom of speech, who are attacking nobody's property, nobody's personal liberty, but a very much more sinister and more dangerous form of militarism, a form that has lurked in the background and has incited people to commit outrages upon their fellow-citizens in the darkness of the night and with masks upon their faces, and has glorified all that under the name of patriotism.</P>
    <P>And the worst of it is that the Government have encouraged that form of militarism, that dangerous form of militarism.  Throughout their career as a Government they have encouraged it by the sort of language that they used about the Opposition and the tone that they took about the Opposition performing the duties that any Opposition worthy of the name must perform, that any Opposition with a sense of its duty to its <Col N="544" /> country must perform.  They encouraged it by allowing parades in military formation.  Did any of us ever hear a whisper of objection from the Government Benches to parades in military formation until the appearance on the scene of the Blue Shirts? Why, even now it is considered nothing at all out of the way for the Minister for Justice to attend a funeral and have volleys fired over the grave, not by the forces of the State, but by some private citizens.  In what other country is it considered right and natural and normal for volleys to be fired over anybody's grave except by the authorised forces of the country?</P>
    <P>The Labour Party are now full of zeal on this question of eliminating militarism from politics, but when did their interest in the question begin? Is their record any better than the Government's?  I have not heard from any Labour speaker, except Senator O'Farrell, a denunciation of the sort of thing to which I am referring.  I have not heard any objection raised by Labour representatives to the existence of the I.R.A. or the activities of the I.R.A.  I wonder if the Government, who are talking so much about the dangers of militarism, have any idea of preventing military parades in the future on the occasion of various anniversaries by their own friends.  I think we ought to object to displays of militarism by those who have dangerous ideas about the authority of the State much more than to displays of militarism, if they are displays of militarism, by people who accept the authority of the State and who uphold outspokenly the very principles of democracy that are challenged by the other people of whom I have been speaking.</P>
    <P>If the Government want us to co-operate with them in making the position of democracy impregnable in this country, they must show us, first, that they are genuine in wishing us to have the liberty that we ought to have and, secondly, that they are genuine in objecting to militarism among their own friends as well as among those whom they dislike. There is too much military spirit in this country.  The politicians on both <Col N="545" /> sides, to take a minor example of it, have got too much into the habit of using military metaphors, and there is far too much talk all the time of marching on to victory, far too much use of clichés that really have no sense in them at all but that serve to put the youth of the country in a wrong frame of mind about politics.  There is far too little recognition of the fact that there is nothing left for us to fight for, that there is no possible object in stirring up a bellicose spirit.</P>
    <P>What the country does need is a spirit of conciliation.  With the way things are going here, one cannot be altogether surprised that you find the feeling in the North hardening more and more against reunion.  I think, in dealing with all these subjects, we should keep an eye on the North of Ireland; we should never forget the existence of the North of Ireland and it should colour our policy in all its details.  I confess that it distresses me each time I read such a pronouncement as was made yesterday by Lord Craigavon, that a united Ireland was something which was never, never going to exist.  Not that I think pronouncements of that sort have any great effect.  You cannot keep back the tide by ordering it to stay back and I am convinced that in the long run the unity of Ireland is something which no person, however evilly disposed, can prevent.  But we can postpone it and we postpone it, among other ways, whenever we encourage in the South any spirit of militarism and when we stir up the feeling that there is some sort of independence that we have not got and that we still have to fight for.  I do not want to go outside the proper limits of the debate on this motion, but I think it is desirable to insist on this, that politicians on both sides who dislike militarism should never miss an opportunity of making the people understand that we are independent and that if we want a Republic to-morrow there is nothing in the wide world to stop us from deelaring one.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party explain the difference of their attitude as between the I.R.A. and the Blue Shirts by saying that the I.R.A. is something which <Col N="546" /> has its roots in the past.  Does it make it any the less dangerous that it has roots in the past?  I would think it actually makes it more dangerous. Is the 12th July a praiseworthy institution simply because it has been celebrated for a great many years?  I do not think it is.  I think that because it revives bitter memories that go back into the 17th century it ought not to exist.  Take what view you like about the results of the Sinn Fein movement, one thing at any rate is certain about it, that even during the golden age, as the President appears to regard it, of 1919-1921, it produced phenomena in this country that nobody could possibly wish to see except during a period of revolution.  An organisation and methods which keep alive revolutionary ideas and which lead people to think that the same paths to glory exist to-day for the young Irishman as existed during the period of revolution, are greatly to be deplored.  It seems to me that the fact that the I.R.A. has its roots in the past is all the more reason for coming out openly and saying that it ought not to exist to-day. I am still waiting for anyone on the Government Benches or anyone on the Labour Benches to say those simple words: &ldquo;The I.R.A. ought not to exist.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Government are proceeding with this Bill, but if in the course of the discussion on it, or before it reaches the Seanad they get a change of heart, and really wish to have the Opposition co-operating with them in rooting out every form of militarism in this country, I do not believe that co-operation would be found impossible. We believe in liberty and democracy.  We believe in them 100 per cent.  We believe that the Blue Shirts have saved them, and it is because the Blue Shirt movement was necessary to save them that we have encouraged it.  The Government have apparently thought we ought to be perfectly satisfied if lorry loads of troops and multitudes of Civic Guards are sent around to protect our meetings, and if our meetings are held in an atmosphere which suggests that we are traitors to be defended from an indignant public by the forces of the <Col N="547" /> State.  We are not satisfied with that &mdash;not for a moment.  We do not believe that more than an infinitesimal fraction of public opinion looks upon us in that light.  We believe that we have the bulk of decent opinion in this country with us.  We believe that we are entitled to show our strength.  We believe that if there were no troops or police in this country we have enough opinion behind us to hold our meetings without disturbance, and we believe that we owe it to our Youth movement that an atmosphere fatal to democracy has not been established in our regard.  For these reasons, we have no hesitation in opposing this Bill and opposing this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy who has just sat down seems to be a very simple man.  I think his place is not at all in Irish politics.  He seems to think that the Blue Shirt movement which is now in existence can be controlled by him when it grows to strength.  He could no more control it if it once got to a certain strength than Canute could stop the ocean from coming in.  The Deputy should carefully study, and the people of this country should carefully study, what is going to be the position of all Parties and of the people in the country if you get a body such as the Blue Shirts into power.  We have seen what has happened in other countries.  There is no use in Deputies trying to think for a single instant that things are going to be any different here than they have been in other countries where militaristic bodies or quasi-militaristic bodies got control.  We hear a lot of talk about the Youth movement, which makes it seem to be something angelic.  What about the 750 men who were dismissed from the Guards by General O'Duffy during his time as Chief Commissioner, and who were ready to shake hands with him?  Are those people belonging to the Youth movement? They were dismissed, and if that is the type of man you have in the Blue Shirt movement, why in the name of heaven talk about the Youth movement?  There is no such thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Stripped of all foolery and all oratorical embroidery, the plain fact <Col N="548" /> of the matter is that the Blue Shirt movement is a dangerous one.  It can be recognised as a dangerous movement.  The mere fact that the Deputy states it has helped their Party considerably is an indication that they are making use of a militaristic body, the Blue Shirt organisation, to come back to power.  Well, I doubt very much, if the Blue Shirts become sufficiently strong, that Cumann na nGaedheal or the U.I.P. or whatever the proper name of the Opposition at the present is, will ever get back to power.  Somebody else will be on those benches and on these.  It does seem to me, and perhaps it would be well to realise it, that the Army Comrades' Association was a perfectly legitimate body formed to protect their own interests. I think a great many of the rank and file of that body did not exactly know what they were doing.  They were really put there to pull the chestnuts out of the fire, or keep the chestnuts from getting into the fire for the heads of the A.C.A. or the people organising it.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly evident that the last Government, that is the Government prior to the Fianna Fáil Government, did not, in the people's minds, fulfil what the people thought were the obligations of the Party to them. After ten years that Party lost its place at the general election, and through the Blue Shirt organisation they saw some chance of getting back into power.  I do not think they will get back or anybody will get back if the Blue Shirt organisation becomes as strong a body as similar bodies have become in other countries.  I should like to say that the great bother in this country down the centuries has been want of unity.  Did we have at any time up to 1830 complete union amongst all the people we would not be struggling after a Republic or any other form of government; we could have had it by unity.  The bringing into being of this body and the support of it by the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, or what was the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, went to create more disunion.  It is going to bring about conflicts between the <Col N="549" /> people, and, as the President said, it is likely to lead to civil war.  I wonder do Deputies on the other side, and people outside the House who are supporting Deputies in the support of the Blue Shirt movement, realise for a single instant what they are doing.  It seems to me that they are irresponsibly and light-heartedly and callously building up a body which is going to create civil war here, and prolong the bitterness, the removal of which you are all giving lip service to, and which you are giving only lip service to.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacDermot has stated that he has not heard anybody on this side of the House condemn the I.R.A., and he went on to state that the President or somebody else said it had its roots in the past.  He referred to the 12th July celebrations and he referred to them as having their roots in the 17th century.  The I.R.A. has its roots since the Anglo-Normans came to Ireland. The I.R.A. represent the people and though I do say, and say it very definitely, there should be no such thing as a military organisation about it, the I.R.A. as a body represent the Irish people.  I am speaking of the genuine I.R.A. and I do not say that people are now associated with it who should not be there.  A lot of the people to whom Deputy MacDermot referred as coming out at night with masks on their faces are not members of the I.R.A. at all. They are ruffians.</P>

Coming back now to this body which is supposed to be unarmed, I can state nothing particularly as to the extent of the arming.  Deputy Mulcahy asked the Leader of the Labour Party what was a lethal weapon.  I happened to see one of these lethal <Col N="551" /> weapons taken on the day the Blue Shirts held a meeting in Cork.  It was taken from one of the Blue Shirt people.  It was a piece of cane with a thong around one end and a pretty big lump of either lead or iron at the other end.  Anybody who got a blow on the head with that instrument was absolutely bound to be killed, and if that was not a lethal weapon, I do not know what is.  It is about time that people rid their minds of cobwebs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>People say they are and people also say that the farmers are very badly off.  People forget that there has been a world cataclysm and that we are suffering, in common with other people, from the effects of it. The Great War had a lot to do with accelerating that condition of affairs and the Party opposite are now endeavouring to bring about a prolongation of that condition of affairs by leading us into another civil war.  I would ask those gentlemen to pause and to consider carefully where they are leading the people.  All talk of unity and all talk of co-operation is idle if they persist in this movement, as, apparently, they intend, judging by what Deputy MacDermot has said this afternoon.  For that reason, I think it wise that this Bill should be put through quickly and if the Party opposite act carefully and do not endeavour to antagonise the people, there will be no trouble for any of them, if they simply obey the law. There is one other thing I should like to say before I sit down.  There has been a lot of talk about interruption at meetings.  One would think that interruption at meetings started only since the Free State came into being. <Col N="552" /> There have been interruptions of meetings, faction fights and all that sort of thing for hundreds of years.  In an election in England recently. British Ministers could scarcely speak. All their meetings were attacked.  I do think it is very desirable that the Opposition, if they think that they are getting more than their share of interruption at meetings, should examine their own consciences and see if they do not deserve them for the way they let the people down.</P>

      <P>The motion before this House is that the time for discussion on a particular measure should be cut down.  If one wanted an argument, an overwhelmingly strong argument, against the passage of such a motion, it would be the speech of the Deputy who has just sat down.  He treated this House to a long rambling speech and never once did he come to the point at issue and never once did he endeavour to put forward one single argument as to why the discussion on this Bill should be cut down as it is proposed to be cut down.  He, obviously, has been put up by his Party to waste the time of the House so that we may not even be able to utilise the short time which is left to us to discuss this measure.  And what a speech he made!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Deputy asked a question.  It is very easy to make insinuations in a question and then to run away from the insinuations in the way in which he ran away.  You make your false charge by means of a question, saying: &ldquo;Oh, I mean nothing; I only want information.&rdquo;  That is a cowardly way of setting about making charges.  I tell that Deputy that when he says that the Blue Shirts are subsidised by anybody outside this country, he is making a charge absolutely without any foundation.  It is false from beginning to end.  There is no party outside this State and no association of any kind outside this State backing the Blue Shirts financially.  The Blue Shirts are an Irish organisation&mdash;Irish right through&mdash;and they have nothing but Irish money to depend upon.  The Deputy wants to know who pays for the blue shirts?  The men who wear <Col N="553" /> the blue shirts pay for their own blue shirts.  He wants to know where the transport comes from.  The money to pay for the transport comes out of the pockets of the fellows that are being transported to and from their meetings.  They may have some small sources of income from such things as dances or social functions to help to pay for their transport, but they have nothing else.  It comes out of the pockets of themselves and their supporters. To get up in this House and to insinuate without any foundation, as that Deputy did, that the Blue Shirts are a subsidised body, and subsidised by a foreign power, is a cowardly method of procedure, and I say that the Deputy who made that speech is no credit even to the Fianna Fáil Party, and, in my humble judgment, is a disgrace to this House.</P>
    <P>Now we come down to the question which is really before the House.  It is this.  Why should not adequate time be given for discussion?  The Minister gave us no reason why there should not be adequate time given.  He said that there are a whole lot of amendments down.  Why should there not be a great number of amendments down?  Surely, if there ever was a Bill that needed to be discussed clause by clause and sentence by sentence it is this Bill.  He says that the Bill is urgent.  He gave us no reason for its urgency.  What can be urgent in a measure which is designed to create disturbance in the country?  I say that it is designed and deliberately designed to create disturbance in the country, because this measure is unique amongst all measures ever introduced in this House.  It is a measure, not to promote peace and order, but deliberately designed by the Executive Council to create disorder in this country.  Everybody knows it. Why should a measure of that nature not be fully and adequately discussed? Why should back benchers of Fianna Fáil be put up to waste time?  There is one answer, and one answer only, which the Government can give, and it is that they are afraid of open discussion. The Blue Shirts&mdash;the League of Youth&mdash;are the sole support that <Col N="554" /> freedom of speech has got in this country.</P>
    <P>We are told that the Guards can be sent to meetings.  Deputy MacDermot already said that we do not want meetings which can be pointed out as meetings that can only be held under the protection of the Guards.  We want to show, and we have a right to show, the people of this country and the people outside this country who are interested in this State that we represent the strongest body of opinion which there is in the State now; that we represent organised law-obeying against organised violence, and that this Blue Shirt association is the one back and the one solid support that liberty of speech has got in this country.  Take it away and liberty of speech has gone.  Take it away or destroy it and you will be in exactly the same position as you were in before this organisation was founded.  Destroy this association, if you can destroy it, and you will very quickly see that the Guards too are withdrawn from the preservation of peace and order at public meetings.  There were no Guards until the Blue Shirts rendered them unnecessary, and if the Blue Shirts could be destroyed there would be no Guards and no freedom of speech at meetings.  We are fighting here for liberty of speech and for the right of a citizen, a law-abiding citizen, to join with his neighbours in the furthering of a law-abiding purpose.  That is the great principle for which we are fighting. We are fighting for the existence of human liberty in this country and I do not think that this Fianna Fáil Government will be able to kill the spirit of liberty at any time in this State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with very considerable astonishment to the speech which was delivered here a short while ago by Deputy MacDermot.  Deputy MacDermot is, at any rate temporarily, the leader of the Party opposite in the Dáil, and he is expected to speak the policy of that Party.  I hope that in his speech to-day he was speaking the policy of that Party.  If so, there has been a very interesting change in that Party's policy in the last few days; certainly within the last few <Col N="555" /> weeks.  We would like, however, to get some evidence of that change other than a speech from Deputy MacDermot, because most of us believe that he is put up here to make speeches of that nature by a little group of designing men behind him who have very different ideas in their minds from those to which Deputy MacDermot gives expression.  Deputy Dowdall was forced to comment that Deputy MacDermot must be a very simple man. That, no doubt, is the charitable explanation, and it is the explanation I am prepared to accept; but one finds it difficult to reconcile the opinions he expressed to-day with those expressed last week-end by his titular leader and expressed every week by the official organ of his Party.</P>
      <P>He tells us here that he wants to abolish militarisation in politics and to end the regimentation of political supporters, and that he wants to abolish even the appearance of militarisation in Irish politics.  It is very interesting to know that he wants to do all these things, even though by his public political associations and by every speech he delivers outside this House he is endeavouring to develop the militarisation of politics in this country.  The Blue Shirts, he said, were formed for the purpose of promoting peace and goodwill and protecting democratic institutions. They were formed to support the policy of a group in the Party opposite that had in mind, first, undermining the authority of the Government of this State and, ultimately, the overthrowing of it.  I want to know from Deputy MacDermot if he reads the official organ of his Party and, if so, how he can reconcile the sentiments given expression to there with the sentiments he expressed to-day.  I am going to read from <i>United Ireland.</i>  This is an extract from vol. 1, No. 5, dated 14th October, 1933.  It runs as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;But it should not be understood that there is a breach between Mr. Lemass and his leader on this matter.  They are both quite at one. The policy of both is to make fine-sounding speeches, while at the same <Col N="556" /> time they prostitute the authority received from God to serve the ends of gangsters instead of Government. For, while quite conscious of the respect that is due to a Government, we assert that Mr. de Valera is a gangster leader as well as the head of a constitutional Government.  His office of President of the Executive Council is availed of by him to serve his personal political purposes and those of his gangster allies.  It was in the interests of gangsterism that the National Guards were suppressed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the method of promoting peace and goodwill, and preserving of democratic institutions, that the Party opposite is resorting to. The motive behind that was to destroy in the minds of the political followers they have recruited into their organisation any respect for the authority of the Government so that they might be ultimately induced to take the necessary action to destroy that authority.  That was not merely an extract from one week's issue.  It was not merely the ravings of the editor or whoever it is that writes these articles in that organ.  On December 30th, 1933, he wrote again as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If the Government misuses its power&rdquo;&mdash;and I want Deputies opposite to note very carefully the theories expounded here&mdash;&ldquo;If the Government misuses its power so that it injures rather than promotes the common good, then it may be that it can put laws on the statute book declaring it sedition to point out that fact, but it will still remain that the Government and not its critics is the Party guilty of sedition.  The Government has received its authority for the purpose of promoting the common good. In so far as its power is used for that end, it has the right to expect our loyal obedience to its laws.  But in so far as it departs from that end its ordinances have not the sanction of authority.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What is the idea behind that?  Why is that dope being handed out week after week to those people whom you are regimenting throughout the country? <Col N="557" /> Is there any possible purpose behind those articles except to instil in the minds of those people that the Government is not acting in accordance with lawful authority; that its authority can be disputed; that its laws can be disobeyed, and that it can be overthrown without a breach of law or without violating any moral principle?</P>

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave, when asked the other day, said he never called the Government a gangster Government; neither did Deputy MacDermot.  They take good care always to avoid phrases of that kind. But they subscribe to that paper and they circulate that paper.  They are paying the salary of the man who writes that stuff.  They are sending other people around the country to <Col N="559" /> preach in that strain at gatherings at cross-roads every Sunday.  Deputy MacDermot and Deputy Cosgrave may be, as President de Valera described them, merely corks on an angry sea quite powerless to effect anything. But whatever influence or authority they have they are putting behind the opinions which were expressed in those two extracts I have read.  Deputy MacDermot can repudiate them if he likes.  Until he does repudiate them, and repudiate them publicly, the speech he made to-day has got to be branded as nothing but the mere expression of the most contemptible hypocrisy.  It is all hypocrisy.  He cannot possibly reconcile that speech with those extracts I have read. Either he stands by the sentiments he has expressed to-day and repudiates these or else he brands himself as a hypocrite.</P>

      <P>If the Minister will allow me to intervene, I will say that I have heard a great many speeches delivered since the formation of the United Ireland Party, including speeches at purely Blue Shirt meetings, and at not a single one of them did the speakers fail to make it absolutely clear that they stood only for constitutional and democratic methods.  The Minister can put whatever interpretation he likes on his extracts from a frankly propagandist paper, which I dare say, like propagandist papers on the other side, frequently indulges in rhetoric that is capable of distortion by its opponents.  But the suggestion that there is anything in the general line of our propaganda in the country which makes hypocritical what I have said to-day in the Dáil, and what many others have said in the Dáil along the same lines, is sheer nonsense.</P>

      <P>The Deputy was given an opportunity to repudiate it and he did not do it.  Now he can sit down and take his medicine.  &ldquo;But in so far as it departs from that end its ordinances have not the sanction of authority.&rdquo;  That is the propaganda, <Col N="561" /> as Deputy MacDermot calls it, that is disseminated from the organisation to which he has now allied himself.  So long as that propaganda is disseminated, and so long as those opinions are being expressed week after week in that organ, anything that comes from Deputy MacDermot must be treated only with contempt.  It is, of course, very easy for him to come in at the beginning of the debate which is anticipated here to-day and mouth phrases about peace and goodwill and tell us that he wants to see the appearance for militarism abolished out of the political life of this country and to make other tentative offers and conditions.</P>
      <P>But the Deputy is unable to reconcile these expression with the talk about &ldquo;gangster Government&rdquo; and with this extraordinary teaching that Deputy Fitzgerald or somebody else has got the authority to decide when the Government is right or when the Government is wrong that when, in their opinion, it is wrong, it is without the sanction of authority.  So much for Deputy MacDermot.  We can now measure and weigh the sincerity of which he talks so much.  We can weigh accurately and to the full the opinions expressed by him and the pronouncements he makes with reference to the Party opposite.  If he has not the moral courage to repudiate this and to give expression to his opinions with regard to these statements, then he is not fit to hold the position he holds as Deputy Leader of the Party opposite, firstly because any person suffering from such moral cowardice is not fit to hold any public office and, secondly, he does not express the opinion of the Party opposite, and, consequently, he cannot act as their spokesman.</P>

    <P>This Bill is necessary for the purpose of preserving the public peace. It is necessary to preserve the public peace disturbed by the introduction of this militarising and marshalling of Irish politics and the uniforming of political organisations.

Not at all.  The Minister for Justice tells the Chief Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána that he is responsible for providing whatever forces are necessary to preserve order.

      <P>This Bill is necessary to preserve the public peace and I would ask Deputies opposite&mdash;no matter what they may consider to be the rights and wrongs of the position &mdash;if they have any due regard for the future, to bear in mind that they have not been given the sole right to put their supporters into uniform.  I <Col N="563" /> would ask them to remember that they have not been given a monopoly of this militarisation of politics.  Deputies opposite have no reason to believe if, for any reason, this measure does not become law, or this measure cannot be implemented, that matters can stay as they are.  Every other Party, as well as Deputies opposite and their Party, can have uniforms and drilling and militarisation of their supporters in militaristic associations.  If they think otherwise they are mistaken.  That was not the experience in other countries and it will not be the experience here.</P>
      <P>I mentioned on the Second Reading debate the manner in which this militarisation has developed in other countries.  We must assume it is developing in the same way here and if Deputies opposite insist upon the law remaining as it is at the present and insist upon their rights of militarising their followers they must not conclude that everybody else is satisfied to leave it to them only to do that.  As an almost inevitable result of any failure to get a speedy passage for this measure there is going to be created in the country a situation which cannot but lead to a revival of civil strife. Deputies opposite may want that. Some of them came into office as the result of that.  They went out of office when the memory of the civil war began to die out.  No doubt, those Deputies have a hope and, perhaps, their only hope of getting back again is by following in the same road they followed once before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney asked us were we afraid to discuss this measure. We are not afraid to discuss it. Adequate opportunity was afforded on the motion for the Second Reading for the discussion of the measure and it was fully discussed.  The question before the House at the moment is not whether another opportunity of adequate discussion is to be given here, but the question is whether time should be wasted upon 127 frivolous amendments, introduced not for the purpose of promoting a serious discussion but for the purpose of obstruction.  The Government is quite prepared to give the Dáil every <Col N="564" /> opportunity of expressing its views.  It is quite prepared to give the members, of the House an opportunity of discussing this measure, subject to not delaying the measure unduly, because the measure is important to the future of the country and to the preservation of the peace of the country.  For the preservation of the peace of the country it is necessary that the Bill should become law quickly.  I am not foolish enough to believe that the mere enactment of this measure is going to operate automatically in the future to secure order at every public meeting, or even to remove whatever elements of strife there are in the situation.  It will not do that.  The enactment of this measure is merely going to remove what the Government considers a serious source of danger.  When it has been enacted and put into operation there will still be cases of disorder in the country but the Government has resources for dealing with that disorder.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacDermot asked some questions concerning the I.R.A.  He made the extraordinary statement that nobody on the Government Benches had said that there was no need for the I.R.A.  That has been not merely said but repeated time and again both by the Leader and by other members of the Government. There is now no need for the I.R.A.  It has been repeatedly pointed out that the establishment and development of that organisation could have only one result and that that result was the fomenting of civil strife.  If those who are in that organisation have any other idea about it but that it can only be used for the purpose of fighting Irishmen, they are very foolish indeed.  There is now in the country absolute political freedom for all sections.  Any political party, no matter how fantastic its policy, which can claim a majority of the people of this State in support of it and can get that claim sustained at an election can get on to these benches and get full control of all the resources of the State, including the police forces and the Army. That applies not merely to the I.R.A. but to the organisation of which Deputy MacDermot is now a <Col N="565" /> member.  Let the Opposition bear in mind that the development upon which they are now proceeding, the militarisation of their supporters, is not necessary for their attainment to power as a political Party.  This Government did not find it necessary for their attainment to power.  They relied upon no militaristic organisation of that kind in order to secure power.  This Government developed a political organisation on orthodox lines.  It operated with considerable efficiency and it produced the desired result, as far as we are concerned. The Party opposite, subject to their getting a similar organisation and having a policy for that organisation, can hope to get the same results in time.  However, I want Deputies opposite to realise this, that we are not going to take any risks, that we are not going to take Deputy MacDermot as speaking the mind of all the members of that Party, when he comes to this House and makes the speech that he made only an hour ago. We have got to remember how events in other countries turned out.  When some shirted political Party succeeded in getting power by any means, they were not content to operate in accordance with established constitutional procedure.  In every case they were forced, or whether forced or not, they adopted the establishment of a Party dictatorship, and it was made quite clear by the speeches delivered by General O'Duffy, who is the elected head of that Party, that he had similar ideas in mind.  Whether he understood the ideas or not I do not quite know, but he gave expression to them.</P>
    <P>The Government has at all times endeavoured to secure even-handed administration of justice.  The best proof of its success in maintaining impartial administration of the law is that it is attacked by both sides.  If there were any truth whatever in the allegations continuously made by Deputies opposite, and by their Party organ, that the Government has been partial in its administration of the law, that proof would be discounted by the fact that precisely similar allegations are made by those whom they regard <Col N="566" /> as their opposite numbers in Irish politics.  We propose to continue to exercise the same impartiality.  We propose to continue to administer the same even-handed justice.  Deputies opposite will be unable to complain if, whenever they outstep the bounds of law, they get precisely the same treatment as all other law breakers receive. It seems to me that their attitude on a discussion of this kind, and on similar discussions, is directed towards supporting some extraordinary theory that in some way they are above the law, that in some way they are entitled to special treatment; that in some way members of that Party have been granted privileges in this country which no other citizens enjoy.  Such an extraordinary idea may not have yet penetrated the mind of Deputy MacDermot, but it has obviously got into the mind of Deputy Fitzgerald, who is solely responsible for the extraordinary theories they advance without seeing anything amazing or inconsistent in advancing them.</P>
    <P>The Government is going to preserve order at public meetings with all the forces at its command.  We will guarantee Deputies opposite the right of free speech.  We will not even ask them to talk sense.  We will allow them to go to the country at all reasonable times and to express any ideas they like provided they do not talk sedition on the one hand and blasphemy on the other.  They are getting dangerously near both offences on occasions.  There will be on occasions disturbances at meetings before the forces of the law will be able to deal with the disturbers. That has happened in this country before Fianna Fáil came into office. It happened at a number of public meetings at which I spoke, and at a number of public meetings at which other members of this Party spoke, and we did not find any evidence or any great anxiety on the part of our predecessors to supply the necessary forces to preserve order at these meetings. It not merely happened before this Government came into office but as Deputy Dowdall pointed out it happened before this State came into existence, and happened and is happening in other countries. <Col N="567" /> Deputies opposite may be very sensitive.  They may dislike being asked questions at public meetings. They may dislike some ordinary citizen telling them in plain language what he thinks of them but they will have to put up with it.  We will ensure that there will be no organised disturbance at public meetings and that even unorganised disturbance will be reduced to a minimum as far as the forces at the disposal of the Government will permit.  They would help us in that if they would occasionally try to moderate the language they use and cease to indulge in the low type of personal abuse of political opponents that characterises their Party meetings.</P>

      <P>The motion before the House is a reasonable one and it proposes that the Dáil should have until seven o'clock to-morrow evening to discuss this Bill in Committee.  That is a much longer period than was afforded the Dáil for the discussion of other measures which aroused political controversy, and which were in themselves of much greater importance than this Bill.  The Opposition was not given that period to discuss the Constitution (Amendment) Act.  All stages of other Bills of a similar kind were frequently passed through this House in one day, on a motion of this kind introduced by our predecessors.  We have been much more reasonable and moderate than that, and if Deputies will endeavour to confine their remarks to matters in the Bill, to deal with it in a serious way, and to express responsible opinions upon the various matters on which differences of opinion can reasonably exist, and announce that they are not going to introduce ridiculous and stupid amendments, they will get every accommodation from this side, but not otherwise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>We are opposing this guillotine motion.  The Minister for Justice in his short speech made the defence that the motion was necessary because there was a comic side to some of the amendments.  If there is anything <Col N="568" /> comical about the question, it is this Bill, because one cannot conceive that it originated anywhere except in the mind of a comedian.  It was certainly not well thought out as a means of preserving public peace, because the Bill cuts right across the liberty of the subject.  It is perhaps the first time in the history of democratic Government that it is proposed to bring in a law specially designed to place a weapon in the hands of one political Party for use against another political Party.  I do not believe there is any analogy for this Bill in any part of the world.  The Minister who has just concluded talked a good deal about impartiality.  The Minister is so impartial that his impartiality excited him.  He got into a frenzy of temper about his own impartiality.  In fact I do not think his speech would convince anybody that he was impartially minded.  The Minister stated that there was no need for the I.R.A. but we had a curious admission from the Deputy who preceded him.  When asked why the I.R.A. was not treated similarly to the Blue Shirts the Deputy said they represented the people.  So that according to a leading business man in the Fianna Fáil Party, the I.R.A. represented the people, but the Minister for Industry and Commerce had no use for it.  Obviously from the speech of that Deputy the rest of the Fianna Fáil organisation does not represent the people but the I.R.A. that the Minister has no use for does.  What bothers me is the method of distributing justice, as between the Blue Shirts and the I.R.A.  The I.R.A. may represent a fair section of the people. Deputy Dowdall seems to be impressed by the fact that they rose during a period in this country when passions were high, and so on, and that any other organisation that rises, of a nonmilitary character, cannot represent itself as being in any way representative of the people and should be banned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister talks of impartiality. The Minister's memory must be very short, because if we only go back eight, ten or 12 months before the Blue Shirt, or Young Ireland, movement <Col N="569" /> began to gain strength, there was no great anxiety to provide impartially for the liberty of people attending public meetings.  Every Deputy knows that not very long ago meeting after meeting was broken up and no anxiety was expressed by any of the Ministers, so far as I know, to have that state of affairs corrected until a certain organisation was established for the sole purpose of securing that every Party in the State got a fair hearing.  Just because that movement succeeded, the Government came along and said: &ldquo;We will protect your meetings; we will see that there is sufficient police, and military, if necessary, to protect the citizens and to provide every person with an opportunity for free speech.&rdquo;  To protect whom against whom?  To protect the blackguards who were interrupting the meetings against law-abiding people who never attempted to interrupt or interfere with meetings of their fellow-citizens.  That is the sole object of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister has described our amendments to the Bill as comic but it is, as I said, a comic measure, and could only be conceived by a comedian. We had such spectacles as were witnessed at Kilmallock.  The Minister twitted me about Kilmallock. That was mentioned by Deputy Mulcahy. If I may refresh the mind of the Attorney-General, the procedure at Kilmallock seemed to be that certain individuals were prosecuted and that the legal representatives of the State were, in fact, defending the culprits.  Witnesses who gave evidence in the case were treated as hostile. Deputies who got up to give evidence &mdash;I was one of them&mdash;were treated as hostile as against the pack of blackguards who marched four square, in military formation, with hurleys on their shoulders and flags flying, in pursuance of their prearranged plan for breaking up the meeting.  The Minister said that there was no militarism until the Blue Shirts came into existence.  Were there not men drilling in open fields?  Were there not manoeuvres carried on as big as the manoeuvres at the Curragh?  Yet there was no militarism in politics <Col N="570" /> until the Blue Shirts came into being! We had a similar spectacle at Limerick.  I am sorry Deputy O'Brien is not here.  I assume that he, like another Deputy, was in Limerick when we were stoned and pelted with bottles.  I do not like to make an untrue allegation, but Deputy O'Brien denied last day that there were bottles thrown at that meeting.  Deputy O'Brien was either at the meeting or he was not.  If he was not, then he cannot say whether bottles were thrown or not.  He says that bottles were not thrown.  The only assumption then is that Deputy O'Brien was at that meeting behind the blackguards who attempted to break it up.  Deputy O'Brien can take his own time in making clear whether he was there or not.  If he was not there, then it is not competent for him to get up here and deny a statement made by people who were.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowdall was very anxious to know who paid for the shirts.  The bulk of the people in the Blue Shirt movement&mdash;and they are the bulk of the young people in the country&mdash;paid for their own shirts.  If, in a branch of the Blue Shirts, there are a couple of poor members, the other members of the branch do not think that it is improper for them to subscribe for shirts for their poorer brethren.  They make no apology to any Minister or member on the opposite side of the House for doing that.</P>

      <P>There were batons, if you like to call them by that name, in the hands of the followers of Deputy Davin and members of that Party long ago.  Deputy Dowdall says that a weapon to which a string was attached was found on some member in Cork. I have had painful experience of weapons of that kind for the last five or six years and of weapons more dangerous still.  Deputy Dowdall and the Minister for Industry and Commerce took care not to allude to the weapons that, as Deputy Davin knows, are in the hands of the I.R.A.  Deputy Davin kept a long distance from the <Col N="571" /> lethal weapons which, he knows, are in the hands of his supporters and Fianna Fáil supporters&mdash;the I.R.A. Will Deputy Davin get up and say that the I.R.A. must be disbanded by force, that it is not legal for the I.R.A. to go out in the fields, engage in manoeuvres and drill openly, as they are doing, I believe, to Deputy Davin's own knowledge.  He is not so blind or ignorant of what is happening in the country not to know that the I.R.A. are drilling actively in different parts of the State and that they are heavily armed.  Yet, he supports a measure to disband an unarmed and a legal organisation, and he is content to allow the armed and illegal organisation to continue.  There was a time when Labour was honest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They are very near it, and Deputy Davin knows that.  They lost 60 per cent. of their strength at the second last election.  That was because you foreswore allegiance to the decent people of this State and got into the company in which you are. That was the beginning of your downfall. You clung on to about 50 per cent. of the supporters you retained then at the last election, but God help you at the next election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, a Chinn Comhairle, Deputy Davin is exciting me.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce referred to a Party which was undermining the authority of the State with a view to overthrowing it. I wonder to which Party he was alluding&mdash;the I.R.A. or the Blue Shirts.  I believe it was the Blue Shirts, because the Minister has always refrained from making such an allusion to the I.R.A. so that we must take it that he was alluding to us as the Party who were endeavouring to undermine the State and to overthrow it.  I have not the same experience, unfortunately, in military matters as the Minister, but I will not allow him, or any other Minister, to say of me <Col N="572" /> that I am attempting to undermine the authority of the State or to overthrow the State.  Nor will I allow it to be said that the people who are associated with me are trying to undermine the authority of the State.  If I had any belief that the young body of people that we are organising had any such purpose in view I certainly would not connive at it.  Deputies on this side of the House would not connive at it; we have more respect for the rights of the citizens and law and order than Deputies opposite have.  We have as much respect for the rights of the citizens as the Labour Party have and they are a respectable body of men. What has been the history of the Blue Shirts for the last four months? They have been faced with more provocation than any other body of men in the world were ever faced with. They have been faced with the active opposition and rival activities of the Opposition, and every blackguard, in every Party opposed to them, has connived against them.  Even the law itself has been put into operation against them by bringing false charges against them and making arrests. Every conceivable form of provocation and intimidation that could be instituted has been brought into play against them.  But the Blue Shirts have withstood these attacks.  All attempts of those bodies of persons to provoke them into one serious breach of the law have been failures.  And this is the body the Government tells us we cannot control.  If the Minister wants to control any body let him control the I.R.A. and let him control his followers and the parties who pelted us with bottles at Limerick and at Kilmallock; then let him come and talk to us.  Our young men and women are self-controlled and they need no control from any other body.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the truth and the Minister and his associates will fail to break their self-control.  These young people are a credit to this country, or to any country and the Minister who seeks to put down a body like that is discrediting himself, and when the <Col N="573" /> people of this country get a chance they will discredit him and his colleagues and his followers as they will very soon learn.</P>
      <P>There is urgency for this measure, we are told.  The Minister must bring in a Bill because the matter is urgent. Does the Minister fear that some day soon this organised body of young men and women are going to rise up and come into Leinster House in order to upset the Government of the country? The Minister knows there is nothing behind that argument.  The Minister says there is no necessity for amendments to this Bill.  If there ever was a Bill introduced that needed amendment it is this measure.  It is a Bill conceived in panic and is so ill-considered in its sections that it needs amendment in almost every line.  It was an evil thought that prompted the Ministry to bring in this measure and it will prove an unlucky measure for the Ministry.  If there is any superstition among Ministers and among members of the Labour Party&mdash;which I think is the case because they are always superstitious&mdash;the fact that this is a Bill of 13 sections should make them more superstitious still.  Why they did not put in a fourteenth section I do not know.  The last section, 13, is the title.  I suggest that we should put in an amendment altering the title as Deputy McGilligan suggested to &ldquo;The Blue Funk Bill&rdquo; because that is what it will come to be known by. There are only 13 sections in the Bill. I see Deputy Davin is already growing pale&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not grudge you your luck in connection with this Bill. It was an evil day that the Ministry brought it in.  Time will prove, I am satisfied, that this Bill was not only unnecessary but that a grave injury was done to the people by its introduction. It will lead to disorder rather than help to overcome disorder.  If it is passed it will be bound, in many ways, to lead to breaches of the peace. The Government are asking for power to coerce a perfectly orderly section of the community into unlawful ways and to commit breaches of the peace.  That is what this Bill proposes to do.  In conclusion, I submit that to ask this House to curtail debate on such a measure is something that the House ought not be asked to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we ought to get clear in our minds, at the outset, that this is not an ordinary closure motion that we are debating.  It is what is popularly known as the guillotine. I would like that those members of the Labour Party who always, and to my mind quite rightly, opposed any motion which could be used to stifle debate would bear in mind what is likely to happen to-morrow night at 7 o'clock if this motion is carried.  If there are 50 amendments on the Paper which have not been moved up to then &mdash;and it is quite possible that some of them may be amendments in the names of the Labour Party or of Independents &mdash;then at 7 o'clock that block of amendments will be put as one question. No Deputy will be allowed to move an amendment.  The remaining amendments will be put, as one question, and one decision will cover the whole lot.  Let us be clear, therefore, that this is not an ordinary closure motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this motion we heard two of the most amazing speeches that I think any of us ever heard in this House. We heard, of course, Deputy Lemass <Col N="575" /> in his usual style talking cant, humbug, hypocrisy and insincerity.  He talked about sedition and blasphemy; he worked himself into a sort of frenzy about sedition.  One would imagine that the Minister had been going round with a milk bottle in his mouth for the last ten or 20 years; that the Minister knew nothing about militarisation; that the Minister never preached sedition; that the Minister was always for the Constitution and for law and order; that the Minister who now holds up his hands in horror at the idea of young men wearing blue shirts never advocated or practised anything more dangerous against the Constitution, tells us that there is the fullest possible freedom for every Irishman and woman under the Constitution that we have to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, all the Minister's militarisation, all his drilling and everything else was simply because there was an empty formula in the Constitution in 1932 and that it was not in it in 1934.  The Minister charged Deputy MacDermot with hypocrisy and with a lack of sincerity. Surely, it is well known to every member of the House, and particularly to the members of his own Party, that there is no man better able to lend an air of sincerity to an insincere speech than the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It is well known that no man talks more humbug in this House than the Minister; he talks it well; sometimes he talks it in a delightful way, but it is humbug all the same&mdash;humbug of the kind that we have fewer unemployed in the country to-day than we ever had before.  When he said that he was not so foolish as to believe that the passing of this Bill would automatically bring to an end disturbances at political meetings, the suggestion, by implication, was that there were no disturbances at political meetings until the Blue Shirts came into existence.  The Minister knows quite well that that statement is not true, and that it would be utterly <Col N="576" /> impossible to hold a public meeting in this country to-day if it were not for the fact that the Blue Shirts were there to give protection to the elected representatives of the people.  I think that even the Minister will admit that the elected representatives of the people have the right to address their constituents at public meetings.</P>
      <P>But we had another speech this evening, a much more dangerous speech than the speech of the Minister. I will go so far as to say that it was an evil speech, one of the most evil and dangerous speeches that I ever heard delivered in this House. It would be a dangerous speech coming from any Deputy, but it was particularly dangerous coming from a man who is supposed to have a certain standing in this country.  Deputy Dowdall made this dangerous speech. As I have said, it was, in my opinion an evil speech.  He got up and said that we should have unity in this country.  He deplored the fact that there was bitterness in the country while, at the same time, he made himself one of the most bitter, one of the meanest and one of the most cowardly speeches that I have ever heard here. Deputy Dowdall talked about the Blue Shirts.  He talked in a mean way as to who would pay for the shirts.  He reached a low, mean level in his speech&mdash;a level that should not be touched by a man like Deputy Dowdall.  He asked who was paying for transport.  Deputy Dowdall is not very long associated with the Fianna Fáil Party, but if he consults with the Minister for Industry and Commerce he will be able to tell him a good deal as to how things are organised and as to how transport is arranged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That would not surprise me.  I have read, during the last few years, some of the Minister's publications from time to time.  But let me get back to Deputy Dowdall. The Deputy is terribly concerned about the Blue Shirts.  I am not surprised. He has reason to be concerned and so has every member of the Government Party, not, mind you, for the future of the country, but for their own political future.  They are not afraid, nor do they believe, that the Blue Shirts are going to create civil war. They are not afraid that the Blue Shirts are going to create trouble in this country, but what the Party opposite are afraid of is their own political future.  They know quite well that the U.I.P. has to-day, in this country, through the Blue Shirts&mdash; through the boys and girls of the country&mdash;an organisation such as even Fianna Fáil had not in its heyday, an organisation such as Fianna Fáil had not when the Minister for Industry and Commerce was stumping the country for it for a number of years.  I give the Minister for Industry and Commerce credit for this: that he is the man who was mainly responsible for building up the Fianna Fáil organisation throughout the country and for putting the Party on the Front Bench, opposite to-day. The Minister certainly worked hard. I can see, of course, that he, perhaps more than any other member of the Party, realises that there is now in existence an organisation much greater than the organisation that he was able to build up.  That is a fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dowdall told us that the I.R.A. represents the Irish people. Does the Minister for Industry and Commerce accept that, and does the Minister for Justice stand over it?  It may be said, and with a certain amount of truth, I think, that the I.R.A. represents a section of the <Col N="578" /> people.  Whether that section is great or small I do not know.  Is it treason or sedition for a Deputy to get up here and say that the I.R.A. represents the Irish people?  That seems to me to resemble the statement made by the President on a famous occasion, and to suggest that the present Government is not the legitimate authority in this country.  Of course, Deputy Dowdall, in saying that, probably had the President's famous statement in his mind at the time, and was thinking about the I.R.A. as being the representatives of the Irish people. Are we to take it now that even amongst the rank and file of the Government Party there is still the belief that the legitimate authority of this State is not inside this House but outside of it?  That is the only meaning that can be attached to what Deputy Dowdall said.  The Minister got up afterwards and, in his usual nice, soft way when dealing with armed forces outside the control of the State&mdash;he did not get into the frenzy that he gets into when dealing with the Blue Shirts &mdash;said that, of course, it was a bad thing that the I.R.A. were there.  His speech, in effect, amounted to this: &ldquo;Really, you should now be good boys; there is no reason in the world, now that the oath has been removed, why you should not come in here; you have complete freedom to come in.&rdquo; That is all very nice, but the Minister knows, much better than I do, what the actual position is and where the real menace to the State lies.</P>
    <P>What I object to most of all in this measure is the fact that it is being used against one side and not against the other.  The Minister prated to-day about the impartiality of the present Government, about the impartial administration of the law and of evenhanded justice.  The Minister does not believe one word of that.  He knows quite well that there has been the most gross partiality, not only in the Department of Justice and other Departments, but even in the filling of the smallest positions in the country. He knows quite well about that partiality, that it is utterly impossible for a man, even an ordinary working man, to get employment as a labourer in the <Col N="579" /> building of the beet factories unless he is recommended by a prominent Fianna Fáil supporter or has a Fianna Fáil card in his pocket.  That is true and the Minister knows it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

I do not know who the individual may be that the Minister has in mind, but whoever he may be he is not responsible for filling it exclusively with Fianna Fáil supporters.  The Minister knows that quite well.  To get back to the motion, I want to emphasise again that this is a guillotine motion, that if there are 50, 60 or 80 amendments left at 7 o'clock to-morrow night that is the end of it.  They will not be or cannot be moved if this motion is passed.  I suggest that that is an outrageous attack on the rights and privileges of this House.  Deputy Davin has, unfortunately, left the House, but I want to <Col N="580" /> put it to members of the Labour Party that they ought to make a stand for a big principle for which they have always stood in the past.  It was the one outstanding principle of the Labour Party in this House in years past that whatever inducements were held out to them they would not vote for a guillotine motion.  They never did in this House except in the last couple of years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce in the course of his speech, answering an interjection of mine, wanted to know what the Party on this side wanted to keep the Blue Shirts for.  I might couple that question with another question I would like to put to him: Why do the Government want to get rid of the Blue Shirts?  because the answer to the two questions is the same.  The Minister knows perfectly well that that body was started in order to protect the right of free speech in this country. I, myself, was present at a number of meetings and I remember that before that body became strongly operative, the right of free speech was denied by the allies of the Minister.  The answer to the Minister's question is: we want the Blue Shirts because we want free speech in this country.  As long as we had not that body, we had not free speech but we have it now in spite of the Government.  Why do the Government want to get rid of the Blue Shirts?  Because they know that that organisation is defeating them as a political body in this country.  They see that the young people all through the country are joining the Blue Shirts week after week in increasing numbers. That is why this present coercion measure has been introduced by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has said that there is absolute political freedom in this country at the present time for all Parties provided they do not talk sedition.  That is a very nice statement from the Minister.  I wonder if any of our people went out on public platforms or if we rose here in the Dáil and said to the Government: &ldquo;Do not interfere with the dumps; leave them alone,&rdquo; would that be sedition?  Would <Col N="581" /> the Minister for Industry and Commerce say whether it would be sedition for us here now to say to the Government of the day: &ldquo;Leave the dumps alone, do not attempt to interfere with them,&rdquo; because if it is sedition now&mdash;and we do not say it is &mdash;it was sedition four or five years ago, when the Minister for Industry and Commerce made that very remark to the Government of the day.</P>

The Minister wanted the Government of the day to leave the dumps alone, and the Minister went through the country saying the same thing.  Now the Minister, perhaps, wants to deny that.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is a champion of champions.  He would win one competition at any rate, and if General George Washington were alive and took part he would finish last.</P>

They are willing to answer any questions put to them.

The people who attend the Minister's meetings now would like to put him a number of questions which, no doubt, he would not like to answer.  We have heard a lot about all the industries he has created.  In fact, there are so many factories, and he is so blinded by the smoke of these factories, that he cannot count them.</P>

I accept that description of the Minister. He is the man undoubtedly, far more than the President or anybody else, who made the Party opposite.  He made that Party by going through the country, week after week, making speeches misrepresenting the policy of the Government of the day, and misrepresenting the acts of the Government of the day.  He got away with it because they were busy attending to the interests of the country, while he was busy misrepresenting their policy and their actions.  I read many of his speeches myself and I was amazed at their audacity.  I do tell the Minister now that I did call the attention of the Minister of the day to the misrepresentations of Deputy Lemass, and their answer was that they had not time to go out and reply to them, because they had too much to do carrying on the work of their Departments, and they thought that these lies and misrepresentations did not matter.  It all comes back to this. I congratulate the Minister on having made that Party, but it is a regrettable thing that he built it up on a foundation of lies.</P>

      <P>I am opposing this motion and I sincerely hope that the official Labour Party, who have so frequently in public and private paid lip service, at least, to the principles of democracy, will have the courage to support the opposition to this measure. I feel that this measure, if passed, will represent the negation of all that liberty lovers hold dear; it will represent the negation of the constitutional freedom which we have won; it will represent the negation of all parliamentary and constitutional practice in countries which have constitutional Governments.  In asking the support of the Labour Party on this occasion, I do it with all sincerity, for while it has been said that the rise of a certain organisation is anti-democratic, I would like to point out to the Labour <Col N="584" /> Party that that organisation, in so far as I know of its activities, has done its utmost and has succeeded latterly in bringing about that thing which all democrats hold dear, namely, freedom of speech.</P>
      <P>I feel that the Government, in putting up Deputy Dowdall of Cork and the Minister for Industry and Commerce as apologists for the introduction of this measure, have admittedly a very weak case.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce to-day worked himself into a fit of virtuous indignation in connection with some article that appeared in a propagandist journal issued by the United Ireland Party in which the term &ldquo;gangster Government&rdquo; was used.  I do not approve of that kind of language being used against any Government, but at the same time I would like the Minister to be a little consistent.  I would like to know from him if his Government approves of the language in his own Party's organ from time to time, in reported speeches particularly.  The language used against members of the official Opposition here&mdash;I wonder does the Government approve of that?  I have heard members of the House who are in opposition to the Government, myself included, being described as Imperialists and anti-Irishmen and as persons who should be got rid of at any cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite right, says the Deputy.  Now, this is something I would commend to the Attorney-General and the Minister for Justice. They have heard one of their own backbenchers dotting the &ldquo;i's&rdquo; and crossing the &ldquo;t's&rdquo; of the scurrilous and the dangerous language to which I have referred.  Quite right, says the Deputy, get rid of the Opposition; simply dub or label them as anti-Irish and Imperialist and get rid of them; get rid of that accursed crowd.  The Deputy, no doubt, will say &ldquo;Hear, hear&rdquo; to that.  Is not that an incitement to murder, to assault?  I leave the Attorney-General or the Minister for Justice, who are both legal gentlemen, to answer that question.  I do not stand for that kind of conduct or that kind <Col N="585" /> of language.  I am not defending that language on either side of the House.</P>
      <P>I say that the palm for histrionics in this House should be given, and very easily awarded, to the Minister for Industry and Commerce; but for absolute childish, bland, simplicity &mdash;whether genuine or not I do not know&mdash;the palm should certainly be handed to Deputy Dowdall, my colleague from the City of Cork.  The Deputy in his innocence almost suggests that we should have no Dáil in this country.  We should have, according to him, no Opposition Party.  I subscribe to his hope that in matters of great and urgent national importance we should all pull together and move as one team.  But Deputy Dowdall does not want any Opposition, constructive or otherwise, to anything that may emanate from the Government. He certainly waxed very indignant when he said there was some lethal weapon found on a supporter of the United Ireland Party.  He was very indignant, and he described in some detail the nature of that lethal weapon and condemned the use of such weapons.  Has the Deputy, in public or private, the same as I have in Cork, condemned the use of lethal weapons by any Party?  Has he condemned the murderous attacks made on Cork citizens who were not members of the Fianna Fáil Party?  Has he condemned the murder of a young man in the County Cork who got the most awful death that any man in the country could get?  Has he condemned the murderous attacks on peaceable citizens of Cork who were opposed to the Fianna Fáil Party?  Oh, no.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All Deputy Dowdall's criticisms are reserved for the United Ireland Party, because one man was caught with a baton of some sort.  But the Deputy does not condemn the use by Fianna Fáil supporters of revolvers and rifles, more lethal weapons than a baton.  We know that if one is approached by a man with a baton one may adopt some means of defence, but there is little or no defence whatsoever in the case of a blackguard with a revolver or pistol.  I fear that if this motion is carried it will be a bad thing for constitutional government in this <Col N="586" /> country.  One of the best reasons that I can give for opposing it is one of the principal reasons why the Minister suggested it should be passed, namely, the fact that you have 127 amendments on the Order Paper, which go to show not what the Minister suggests it is, an attempt at obstruction, but, in my view, it goes to show that you have an industrious and a critical Opposition. Of course, the view which is, apparently, now shared by some of the Back Benchers of Fianna Fáil, is that there is a far better way than by putting down 127 amendments.  I do not know what the strength of the United Ireland Party in the Dáil is at the moment.  We will put the number at 50.  The view held is that 50 bullets would get rid of them much more quickly than 127 amendments.</P>

      <P>I agree that there is at least one Deputy on the Government Benches who says what he really feels and thinks, and I am sure that he is simply giving vocal expression to what has taken place from time to time at his committee meetings.  I have said that if this motion is passed it will certainly deprive a number of members in this House, who are most anxious that the peace of this country should be preserved, from making useful contributions to the debate.  There is not such a great deal to be gained by a closure to-night or to-morrow night. There is not a whole lot to be gained&mdash; and the Attorney-General should be a good judge of that&mdash;by a closure of, perhaps, 30, 40 or 50 amendments.  Then we will have the sorry spectacle&mdash;I do not want to anticipate evil, but one can deduct certain things from established facts&mdash;of Deputy Davin, once the great upholder of freedom of speech, the great exponent of law and order in this country, slavishly following his masters into the Division Lobby in favour of this motion, and against all the things to which he gave lip service in the old, old days before the big bad wolf of Fianna Fáil devoured him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I just want to conclude by saying this: the Labour Party, I am afraid, has lost caste not alone in the country but in this House, and I should like to <Col N="587" /> know will they speak or act as one when this division takes place.  We know that they spoke some time ago in several voices.  We have the public statement of Deputy Alderman Pattison, a member of the Labour Party, in which he said: &ldquo;We thought we were going to get a Heaven on Earth, but it turns out that Fianna Fáil are giving us Hell upon Earth.&rdquo;  Yet Deputy Pattison, with Deputy Davin, will walk into the Lobby and slavishly support Fianna Fáil on this motion.  We had Deputy Davin from time to time in the country condemning the use of arms, and condemning all sorts of what he was pleased to term &ldquo;illegal organisations,&rdquo; but not one word of a mention of the I.R.A.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>In the same way to-night a very plain question was asked by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney. Neither the Minister for Industry and Commerce nor Deputy Dowdall had the pluck to answer that simple question, which demanded the very simple answer of &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no.&rdquo;  I should like to put this question again now in case Deputy Davin was out of the House at the time Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney was speaking.  Is Deputy Davin prepared to go all out, and is he prepared to invoke the aid of his Party to go all out, to suppress such bodies as the I.R.A., who are armed? I know Deputy Davin has some kind of external association with these people; he must have.  Will he tell the House, or will he ask his Party to tell the House, that they are prepared to do that?  Will they vote to take the shirts off the organisation led by O'Duffy, who by the way proclaimed consistently week after week, meeting after meeting, that they are a constitutional body, and that they will not have recourse to the use of arms to gain their political ends, whilst on the other hand, the I.R.A. have proclaimed week after week and month after month that they are the <i>de facto</i> and <i>de jure</i> Government of this country?  I am putting it to Deputy Davin now, if he has a last bit of guts left in him, that he should answer that question with a <Col N="588" /> plain &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no,&rdquo; without equivocation. It will not do to go down to Leix or any part of Leix-Offaly and make a speech there, where he is frequently mistaken for a United Ireland Party orator, and come along up here and vote with Fianna Fáil.  I must say to his credit that for some time back he is feeling very very uncomfortable, and we only see him here on occasions.  We had seven members of the Labour Party here to vote on what is now known as the &ldquo;Blue Funk Bill&rdquo;; we had only three, four or five, whenever matters of urgent material importance to the working class people of this country were under discussion.  Of course we will have Deputy Davin at any cost&mdash; health reasons even would not prevent him from attending&mdash;coming up here to support this Blue Funk Bill.  I never thought I would see the name of Deputy Davin or Deputy Davin himself associated with such a thing as funk.  He is and has been for a considerable period on the slippery slope. The one chance left to him to recover is that he should vote in the same Lobby with me on this matter.  He will then have done something big. Mind you, I say this quite honestly in the hope that Deputy Davin will realise, or at least that the part of the country which he represents will realise, that he is returning to sanity. I do hope that even some members of the Fianna Fáil Party will give evidence of sanity in this matter, and defy their Party Whips, because I do know that many of them do not agree with the principles underlying this Bill, any more than Deputy Davin I suppose. Deputy Davin does not believe in it, but he is going to vote for it; but he does not want the people of Leix-Offaly to hear about it.  Oh. no.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to give further time for the consideration of these amendments.  They are not all put down to obstruct.  They are not all, I submit, frivolous.  We have, of course, the Minister's definition of what is obstruction and what is frivolous. His definitions of those two words do not appeal to me.  There are two opinions on these matters.  I consider that in the main these amendments <Col N="589" /> are of a constructive character. They seek to take the greatest evil out of the Bill.  They are constructive, and they cannot by any stretch of imagination be considered frivolous.  Therefore, I wish again to appeal to the Labour Party to do what they have so frequently said they would do&mdash;act as democrats in this House as well as outside it.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party are prepared to consider their action in regard to this Closure Motion on its merits.  What are the merits?  This House has already taken up three full days of Parliamentary time in the discussion on the Second Reading of the measure.  With the time already occupied in that discussion, and the time provided for even under the terms of the Closure Motion, 32 hours of Parliamentary time will be given to the discussion of this measure by the time it is finally concluded under the terms of the Closure Motion at 10.15 p.m. to-morrow night.  Is that denied?

      <P>I believe that this Bill has been used and will be used, as other measures have been used, to make inciting speeches in this House which are calculated to disturb the peaceful minds of the majority of our citizens and to create demoralisation in the minds of the people outside.  If our people are to look at matters of this kind as they should be looked at to-day, they would, I think, be entitled, in the ordinary way, to look to their political leaders for good example and I say, quite advisedly, that good example is not being given to the people of this country by some of the inciting speeches that are being made in this House.  Look at the position.  We have already taken up the time since a quarter past three o'clock listening to speeches&mdash;six speeches from six members of the Opposition who never yet had the courage to wear blue shirts, although they are defending the existence of the Blue Shirt organisation. Has anybody yet seen Deputies MacDermot, Fitzgerald-Kenney, Bennett, Morrissey, Rice or Anthony wearing a blue shirt, or even their photographs in a paper wearing a blue shirt, and still, they have taken up the time of this House since a quarter past three to-day defending the existence of a semi-military uniformed party behind the principal Opposition Party in this country.  Let those who stand for the wearing of a blue shirt defend those who have the courage to wear it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I believe that the members of this Party will be able, if allowed by the Opposition, to ventilate their views on the Committee and remaining stages of this Bill within the reasonable time allowed.  I am prepared to listen very attentively to the speeches made in support of certain amendments on the Order Paper.  There are five or six amendments on the Order Paper from members of the Opposition which I want to hear discussed on their merits and free from Party prejudice and the history of the civil war or any of the other differences that exist and have existed between the two principal Parties in this country for the past ten years.  I go so far as to say that there are two or three important amendments in respect of which I shall be guided in my action and in my vote by the speeches made in support of them, but I believe that the time already taken up to-day and the time still to be allowed under the terms of the Closure Motion is quite sufficient for any intelligent Opposition to put their views fairly and squarely before the House and, through the House, to the people of this country.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin says that he is open to hear what case is going to be made for the amendments down on this Order Paper.  I ask him is his mind not open in any way to influence by the kind of case that is going to be made against the amendments on this Order Paper?  This guillotine motion, I want to tell Deputy Davin, is put down here simply because the amendments that are on this Order Paper, in names other than that of the Minister for Justice, are rejected, and the Minister for Justice and his Party are not prepared to give even ten minutes in explanation of their attitude in rejecting them.  The Deputy says that this is a measure similar to a measure that was dealt with here before.  Let us relate that outlook to the history of the last ten years and look at the measure as it stands, with simply the thoughts in the back of our minds that our people have stood for democratic liberty for centuries and have fought for it and have secured a position in which it depends upon themselves now and their own spirit to say whether they have it or not in this country.  One of the earliest amendments which Deputies are asked to discuss here is that, as a start off, this Bill shall be applied to bodies who set themselves out to overthrow or change the constitution of this State by force of arms.  The Deputy refuses a quarter of an hour to discuss that by his guillotine motion.</P>

      <P>The Government is asked to apply, as a start, this Bill to military organisations rather than to political organisations.  Deputies on the far benches reject that amendment and refuse, by this guillotine motion, to give even a quarter of an hour to its discussion.  The Government is asked by another amendment to secure that, when it places a political organisation within the ban of this particular Bill, it should give reasons why it places the organisation inside the ban of this Bill; and they refuse to give any time, one might say, for the discussion of that, because there is not a single one of <Col N="595" /> these things that will get any time for discussion.  The Deputy need not object to our pointing out, in a few minutes on this motion, what the effect of the motion is.  The Government, by their attitude, refuse power to allow this House to discuss the reasons why the Oireachtas itself should not have some power of criticism over the actions of the Executive when they take a particular body and proscribe it by the Bill as they have already drafted it.  They refuse time for the discussion of a proposal in the Bill that any Gárda can stop any meeting that is taking place in the country if, in his opinion, some of the people present at the meeting are acting illegally.  The position now is that the Guards will have power, if some of the rowdy tail of Fianna Fáil come to interrupt a meeting, to clear the whole meeting away&mdash;not to clear the interrupters away, but to clear the whole meeting itself.  Then, in the words of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to-day, the meeting will be considered as being held at an unsuitable time, and the restriction which the Minister considers should be put on freedom of public speech is the restriction of allowing people freedom of free public meeting or freedom of expression of opinion at some suitable time that will be imposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The guillotine motion proposes to prevent discussion as to why there should be no appeal from the District Court where the District Justice convicts a person of the manufactured crime of either wearing a blue shirt or being found at a public meeting with an ash-plant in his hand, coming from a fair or otherwise.  It proposes to allow no discussion here as to why these manufactured crimes should not be prevented from being tried before the Military Tribunal.  It proposes to prevent discussion here as to why, in the case of persons already driven into economic desperation, as some people in the country have been driven, there should not be some restriction put upon the whole of their stock being seized because they have been fined by a District Justice, for one of these manufactured <Col N="596" /> crimes, a fine that they are unable to pay.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows very well that persons in certain counties have had a considerable part of their stock seized because they were unable to pay rates. At any rate, Deputies from County Tipperary will tell the Minister that it is no comic amendment to put down&mdash; a restriction here in this Bill that will prevent the whole stock of a man or woman being seized simply because one of the members of their family is found guilty of one of the manufactured crimes under this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>For these crimes, persons, say, throughout the whole of our rural areas, may, and no doubt will, be convicted if this Bill becomes law; and a rural population, already crushed by the conditions brought about by the Party opposite, because they react against these conditions and because they go out to discuss their political and economic problems on platforms and get prevented from doing that, will be forced to commit <Col N="597" /> one of these manufactured crimes.  One of the reasons for the uprise of this movement is to secure for the rural population freedom of public speech as to the conditions to which the Government have brought them. Down upon that population you have these crimes to reduce them further to economic exhaustion, and we are being prevented discussing the reasonableness or otherwise of putting on associations and organisations restrictions that will take away practically the whole stock of some of our rural people because they will have been found guilty of acts that are declared crimes under this Bill.</P>
      <P>There is a whole string of amendments like that, which, I suggest to Deputy Davin, require careful and exhaustive discussion, more particularly because the attitude of the Government is to refuse every one of them, and more particularly as it would require a very big explanation from the Government Benches as to why they do refuse them.  I say that if the Deputy stands for any kind of democratic liberty in this country, then every line of this Bill requires to be discussed and passed. The Minister for Justice says that it is necessary and urgent.  Why is it necessary and urgent?  There is an attack on the foundations of the State. It might have been necessary and urgent when the Minister was drafting it on Thursday, but surely the situation has been somewhat saved since Thursday.  Has not the cook in the Detective Branch of the Gárda in Dublin been dismissed, and does not that give some breathing space?</P>

      <P>Yes.  It is simply one of the ways in which the Minister gives a gesture, and then &ldquo;the accursed crowd&rdquo; is swept out of his way.  At any rate, when the Minister was drafting this on Thursday last there might have been necessity and urgency, but I suggest that the dismissal of the cook in the Detective Branch here in Dublin at least gives the State breathing time for about a month.  It is coming to the period of Holy Week and Easter Week, and to members of this House that might bring back some kind of recollection of the fact that men worked and fought and struggled for democratic freedom in this country. They might consider that, sooner than hurry over this Bill, it would be worth while spending Holy Week discussing the Committee Stage of this Bill, and every aspect of the democratic freedom of our people here that it might or might not infringe on; and that they might give Easter Week to the discussion of the Report Stage of this Bill and its Final Stages, and then we would have some reason for thinking that they were not running away from their professions either of democracy or Republicanism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Before moving amendment No. 2a I should like to begin by addressing to the Government Benches the question which I asked before, namely, is there not enough undetected crime and are there not enough criminals in this country already without this Parliament of ours being engaged, day after day, in the attempt to create a new class of crime and inviting at least the creation of a new set of criminals in this country?  I put down this amendment asking for exemption of the blue shirt or blouse of the Fine Gael organisation, the organisation that carries out the teachings of Fine Gael.  I put down this amendment asking for the exemption of the blue shirt or blouse, not in any hope that it would be granted, not in any hope that a majority of this House would be found in favour of that amendment, but in order to bring out quite clearly the intention in this Bill, that it is a Bill designed for the simple purpose of victimising political opponents and impeding the political machinery of the Opposition Party in this country. The Minister for Justice, in introducing this Bill, to an extent told us that. He told us that, in fact, this Bill was aimed at the Blue Shirts; that it was framed and introduced for the purpose of making illegal the wearing of blue shirts.  I say that the reason why that is done is not because the Blue Shirt organisation is militarily dangerous but because the Blue Shirt organisation is politically successful and that this Bill is introduced not to save the State but to save the Fianna Fáil Party from political extermination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was some little chance last September when the first lash of the Government whip fell on the backs of the members of that organisation. There was some little hope then that <Col N="602" /> the general public, that the decent men or women outside politics and looking on impartially, might be satisfied that there was some real reason, that there was some military method, that there was some menace to the State in this organisation.  But the months and the days which have come and gone since have clearly proved to any impartial man, to any decent man or woman that there is nothing menacing to the State in the Blue Shirt organisation; that, on the contrary, one of the factors of which this State could be proud&mdash;no matter what Government sits over there &mdash;is the fibre and mentality of the types that go to make up the Blue Shirt organisation.  Many months have passed since the first Government ban was placed on that organisation and since the first Government bogey was started throughout the country.  Propaganda to the effect that we were contemplating a <i>coup d'état</i>, that we were a military organisation with ex-soldiers and young civilians, importing arms and distributing arms and with the intention of putting over there, by the aid of arms, a Government for this country.  At the time we could only emphatically contradict that and emphatically deny that.  But now we are in the position not only of denying that but we are in the position of pointing to our records, pointing to our teachings and challenging the Minister over there to produce a single utterance, one statement, one line of print to justify that assertion so recklessly advanced last September.  Every document, every letter written, every instruction issued, every pamphlet sent from the organisation is in the custody of the Minister for Justice.  Every document, every letter was taken over by his agents in the course of the various raids that took place on our premises.  I might suggest to the Minister for Justice that there was no necessity for any of these raids.  There was no necessity for any of this panic-mongering.  On the very first day that the Army Comrades' Association was established we invited the police to come to every meeting.  We invited them to come into the office day after day.  We invited them to go through our files.  We invited them to see the letters in and <Col N="603" /> the letters out every day.  We stated clearly that the one thing we aimed at was publicity, and that whatever we did, whether it was popular or unpopular, would be done in the light of God's sunshine, that whatever we did, whether legal or illegal, would be done openly and that the documents would be there to see what we were standing over.  There was no necessity for raiding, either by day or by night.  All the material that entered that office, or went out from that office, from the first day the organisation came into being, is in the custody of the Minister for Justice.  What material did he get to justify the <i>coup d'état</i> talk of last September?  What material did he get to justify the false statement that was hurled at us, that we were plotting an armed revolt in this country?  The ammunition he got to justify that was exhibited in his few mumbling sentences to-day, when he had not a word to say in defence of this guillotined motion, when he had no material to produce, and not one scrap of evidence to justify all the slander that was hurled at us last September.</P>
    <P>Does not every Deputy know, whether sitting on these benches or on the benches opposite, that if he had got one little scrap of justification for the slander hurled at us last September, no man in this House would be more pleased to get up and hurl it than the present Minister for Justice?  We must take his failure to produce any tittle of evidence in support of these charges as an admission of the fact that there was no evidence; that what we said last September was correct, and that what he said was false.  So we arrive at the point where, in addition to the Public Safety Act, we must have more legislation.  Is it to make the country safe?  More legislation to make the country more unsafe, more legislation calculated to succeed where bans failed, more legislation calculated to succeed in driving numbers of the Blue Shirt organisation into conflict with servants of the State.  From the very first ban, from the calling off of the Cenotaph Parade, every evil attempt has been made to drive the Blue Shirts into conflict with the authorities, to try to provoke <Col N="604" /> the Blue Shirt organisation into open defiance of the law, to force us to follow in their own footsteps.</P>
    <P>Thank God, thanks to the courage of those in control, and thanks to the real spirit of democracy that flows in their veins, up to this you have failed, and failed dismally, and the failure to provoke the Blue Shirt organisation into revolt has brought tens of thousands flocking to our standard. Now, because of that success, because of rapidly increasing political strength, we are to have another Bill to make the shirts on our backs illegal.  The Bill is introduced and is accompanied by the same old bogies, that it is a militaristic movement, that it is a movement along military lines, and that there is something dangerous, something anti-State about the whole thing.  Alongside of that organisation we have another organisation that declares openly and, I must say, honestly and courageously, its intention to overthrow this State by force of arms.  It declares in very clear and simple language in its publication, which can be bought for twopence, that the aims it intends to use are&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1) force of arms, (2) to organise, train and equip the manhood of Ireland as an efficient military force, (3) to assist, as directed by the army authorities, all organisations working for the same object.</P>
    <P>We have no legislation aimed at that organisation, and we have no bogey created with regard to State instability or the danger of the use of arms.  But when we have an organisation to wean the people away from the other type of organisation, to show them that there is something grand and noble in standing for their own State, no matter who rules it, that, after all, it is the only country any of us have, that we may as well be proud of it as ashamed of it, that we may as well build it up as tear it down, when we have, for the first time, an organisation preaching service to the State, pride in our own State, and opposition to anything aimed as a menace to the State, we have all the bitterness, and all the penalties that should apply to a criminal organisation.  We have all the ferocity of the Government machine <Col N="605" /> levelled at us, to try to provoke us to take the path of crime, to take the path opposed to the State.</P>
    <P>We have all that going on under the government of a man who invites us to put on the brown habit of St. Francis.  I hate humbug at any time. I detest humbug when it is associated with the name of a saint.  Instead of inviting us to put on the brown habit of St. Francis, it would be well if those on the benches opposite would cultivate the mentality of St. Francis, and have a little Christianity and a little charity, when dealing with those even politically opposed to them.  We have all these utterances about the brown garb of St. Francis intermixed with a slander that was never uttered by any member of the Fine Gael organisation, and that I think none of us ever heard even whispered about the country.  When we had that emotional opposition to slander, or whispered propaganda, in the same speech, we had levelled at the leader of the Fine Gael organisation, the old slander, the old lie, the old libel, that he stood for the establishment of a dictatorship in this country. If we are going to have no slander in public life, let us have that on all sides. Do not let one side claim the right of exemption from slander, and, in the same statement proceed to hurl a false slander at the leader of the political organisation opposed to them.  Is it not about time that particular slander was worn out?  Is it not about time to manufacture something else, or to think of some other slander? Wolf, wolf!  That particular cock will not fight now.  It served its purpose last September.  It is worn out now, and the Minister has not much powers of mental manufacture if he cannot think of something more original than that played out old hare that was run across this Assembly last September.</P>
    <P>We have all this talk of militarism in politics.  We have talk about an attempt to establish a dictatorship and of an organisation aimed at the overthrow of this State.  Might I ask what is the background of the organisation? What is its history?  What are its offences since it came into being? What have you got?  You have democracy expressed in every publication <Col N="606" /> and in every utterance.  You have democracy expressed in every action. You have support for the State, respect for and obedience to the law exhibited in every utterance and in every action, even though that respect for the State, and that obedience to the law, meant the most abject form of humiliation on the part of the members of that organisation. Not once, not twice, but three times in public and with every taunt thrown at them, the members of what is called the Blue Shirt organisation showed that they were not only democrats but that they were democrats of a particularly obedient and law-abiding type.  One would think that with all that record, with that public demonstration of their pacific intentions, and repeated exhibitions of their desire, at all events, to live their life within the law, no matter who made that law, this political vindictiveness would cease and that they would be given a chance, as citizens, to live their life within the law.  They lived their life within the law&mdash;the ordinary law and the extraordinary law, as expressed by the Public Safety Act.  But even that will not do.  There has to be more legislation.  It has got to be made harder for them.  They have to be further humiliated.  The very shirts are to be torn off their backs, the very banners out of their hands, and the very badges off their coats.  For what? Is it because those banners are menacing the State?  Is it because those shirts are indicative of armed revolt? While that shirt is being pulled off their backs, while that banner is being taken out of their hands, others are free to march and to parade, to go the road with guns in their pockets.  That is the act of an impartial Government! That is the act of a Government which is hypocritical enough to bleat about democracy and freedom while they are putting this type of legislation through the House.  The only sign of shame about the whole legislation and its introduction was the silence of the Minister for Justice, his failure to make any attempt even to justify the measure and his anxiety to guillotine it through the House.  It would have been decenter if the thing had been done by proclamation.  It would have been <Col N="607" /> decenter if it had been done by Order. It is only a humbug to claim a democratic mandate, or Parliamentary sanction for legislation of this kind, introduced into this House and put through by a guillotine motion.</P>
    <P>This Bill, as I have said, is likely to have one or two results and it is better to face up to them before it becomes law.  Many of you, or all of you, have, like myself, some knowledge of Irish history.  Remember that the impulses of a person depend, to a very great extent, on his traditions.  Our traditions are traditions of struggle against Government.  All our traditions, all our history, are built up of unconstitutional opposition to Government, of armed opposition to Government, at times overboard, at times under the surface.  That was necessary when an outsider was framing the laws of this country but that tradition remains and those impulses remain underneath the skin of every one of us.  You are dealing with material that it is far easier to throw up into active revolt than it is to lead in a disciplined way behind Government.  You should be very careful in a country of people with those traditions what type of legislation you enact.  Yet we have this Bill interfering with the moral constitutional opposition.  The only result of the Bill will be, or, at least, one of the big dangers of the Bill is, that you will drive a constitutional opposition into unconstitutional paths; not only that, but that you will drive an organisation whose desire and ambition it was to live above ground and to take what action they took in the broad light of day&mdash;that you will drive that organisation underground and that you will create, throughout the country, the most widely-flung secret organisation that ever existed here.  I am one of those who hold that no matter what the object, no matter how clean and above board the aims that initiated a secret society, in the long run that society, that was driven underground, became a menace.  I regard secret societies as a curse and a thing that should not be encouraged in this country of ours. One of the obvious results of this type of legislation is to drive a clean movement <Col N="608" /> underground.  Would the members of the Government not think of that as a reasonable and logical result of this kind of legislation?  Would the members of the Government not reckon that, even though the Fianna Fáil Party gain momentarily by this type of legislation, the State loses in the long run and the nation loses and that what we have got to do is to wean our people, young and old, away from secret societies, away from working in the dark and so educate them that whatever they have got to do, they will say or do in the broad light of day.</P>
    <P>I would feel happier if I were coming in here to stand for a Bill not making shirts or badges or emblems illegal&mdash;I should feel happier and feel that you were doing a better day's work if you introduced a Bill compelling all organisations to wear some shirt or some badge.  This country would be healthier if every organisation came out in the open, wearing its membership badge&mdash;whether it be a Communist, an I.R.A., a Fianna Fáil or a Fine Gael organisation.  We should all know where we stood then.</P>

      <P>I am dead against secret societies, and I think you are provoking the starting of a secret society if you bludgeon underground an organisation which, at the moment, is overground.  The Deputy knows that as well as I do.  That is one of the things that may happen.  Not only that, but it is one of the things that are likely to happen if this legislation, or legislation of this type, be put through.  We had some attempts made from the opposite benches to justify this Bill.  Every second attempt to justify it could be read as a strong argument against the Bill.  We had speeches from the opposite benches to the effect that the attacks on public meetings were due to the presence of Blue Shirts at those meetings.  We had Deputy Dowdall getting up to remind us that long before Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil were heard of, and long before the first blue shirt was worn, there were interruptions and rioting, and rowdyism at public meetings.  I <Col N="609" /> make the Minister a present of the Deputy and the Deputy's statement.  I agree with him absolutely.  There was always in this country a certain amount of violence associated with public political meetings.  That was the case long before blue shirts were worn.  The Minister's whole defence of this Bill was to utilise rowdyism as an excuse for stripping the shirts off the backs of his political opponents.  No attempt is made to deal with the rioters who come out and break up meetings.  The whole attempt is to deal with the organisation which is got together to stop that kind of thing.  Indeed, its one great crime is to have succeeded in stopping that kind of thing.  Yet there are Deputies who defend that action&mdash;the victimisation of the victims&mdash;rather than dealing with the culprits.  Supposing you applied that principle to any other class of crime.  Supposing a man walked down O'Connell Street and was attacked because he wore a gold chain, and that the Minister for Justice introduced legislation to prevent people from wearing gold chains because, he might say, gold chains are an incitement to robbers to rob.  What would be thought of him in the ranks such circumstances?  I do not ask what would be thought of him in the ranks of Fianna Fáil.  Probably they would say he was a great man.  But what would be thought of him generally? Now that is the type of action which has been taken against us.  I would suggest, even now at this stage, rather than passing a guillotine motion in favour of the passing of this Bill, that the Bill should be withdrawn and hung up for a month's consideration.  I would suggest, in these circumstances, that special consideration should be given, number one, to every document and utterance, to every statement and speech, made by any member of the Blue shirt organisation.  Secondly, that the fullest examination should be given to all the documents in the Minister's office, and, thirdly, that special steps should be taken, if necessary, to go out and examine the public utterances of everybody connected with the Blue Shirt organisation. Then the Minister could come back at the end of the month, either <Col N="610" /> with the material to justify this type of hardship and this piece of vindictive legislation, or else in the absence of such material, to withdraw this legislation. If this legislation is passed it can only have the effect of making people, who have no desire to come into conflict with the law, come into such conflict, and provoke them to such a state.  There are people who want to lead their own lives in the open light of day and give service to this country.  If this Bill were withdrawn for a month, and if all the evidence available to the Minister were sifted, and if the Minister can bring no more evidence than he has produced so far when he introduced this Bill, then he should make the first big gesture of impartiality, placing the State above all political parties, and say: &ldquo;The evidence is insufficient to support this measure and I will withdraw the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I wonder who were the political advisers from the country who advised President de Valera to sanction the introduction of what is known as the Uniforms Bill.  It is quite obvious, viewing it purely from the Fianna Fáil point or from the Government point of view, the introduction of this Bill will amount to nothing more or less than ultimate political suicide. All history, and God knows there is enough of it, whether right or wrong, that has been printed and issued in this country has shown, that once coercion is introduced it has in the most definite and final manner always failed.  This Dáil has a legal right to introduce any legal measure it likes. It can take one of the Commandments out of the Decalogue or it can add another but such law would be an immoral law.  The legislation that seeks to stultify and bludgeon nationalism in this country at any cost is throwing aside all regard for democracy, and as Deputy O'Higgins has said the ultimate result will be an effort to drive honest nationalism underground.  It is an effort to drive honest open nationalism into secret societies and impassioned elements into ultimate civil war.  Then, eventually leaders will be asked by influential people to bring about a settlement and a compromise when it <Col N="611" /> will be too late.  The danger that the Government pretend they feel of a civil war arising will never arise if they withdraw this Bill, but if they pass this Bill and they send it down the country to be implemented by the police authorities and by agents provocateurs it will bring about civil war and those who love their country and are anxious to stand by her will be ultimately cast aside.  That may be all very well for the Government game but it is a serious matter for those in this country who understand the feelings of the people.  Those of us who want to reason on these matters and who are endeavouring to make an appeal to reason will talk in vain because of the machinery that is set up.  We are never listened to.  The division bells are rung, and Deputies troop in to the right and to the left and vote us down.  It is, therefore, futile and a waste of time, to ask the Government to accept the amendment standing in the names of Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Mulcahy.  This Bill is intended as nothing more than a measure to enable the Fianna Fáil Party to hack and hew a political position for themselves in this country and to cause disturbance in the country and to drive us back perhaps to the periods of 1921 and 1922 that we are all so anxious to forget.  Every patriotic Irishman that I have ever met was anxious to forget that terrible unhappy history and to look to the future as one that we might be all proud of.  How are we to face the young people&mdash; young men and young women of the country&mdash;and ask them to stand down and to obey every kind of political legislation that the Government wishes to pass?  It would be asking too much of these young people with Irish blood and Irish tradition in their veins.  Anyone either inside or outside this House who failed to fight against this legislation would be false to the country and its traditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cleary</NameTxt>
      <P>The last outburst is not typical of Deputy Minch.  He talks of the blood flowing in the veins of the Irish people and the traditions they inherit.  To my mind, his blood has never flowed in his veins in the old <Col N="612" /> Irish traditional way, and I do not think it ever will.  If he is anxious to excite the young people of this country whose blood does flow in the old Irish traditional way, then I suggest to him that he is not doing the decent thing because he himself never gave support to any movement engaged in the national struggle in this country. Rather it went in the opposite direction. A man like him, coming here to excite young people in any organisation, should be ashamed of his own voice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate at all, but it is hard to hold oneself back when you hear a man of the type of Deputy Minch talking about the Irish people's blood flowing in the old traditional way.  I think that on the last occasion the Deputy spoke in this House he told us of some of his experiences in Flanders: of the one blue-funk night he spent in the trenches.  He told us of his presiding at the courtmartial of Australian soldiers because, according to him, they showed blue funk.  If there is one thing that stood out prominently in the Great War it was that, of all those taking part in it, the Australians did not suffer from blue funk, and the reason was that in the veins of many of them good Irish blood flowed.  Deputy Minch's experiences of his one blue-funk night in the trenches and of his presiding over a courtmartial are typical of a lot of the stuff that one has to listen to here. Almost every time Deputy O'Higgins speaks here he makes threats as to what is going to happen to the Government if they proceed in a particular way and as to what is going to happen certain organisations.  Since the present Government came into power Deputy O'Higgins has shown nothing but the most absolute contempt for every single Act they have passed into law, and for everything that they have done.  He has done his utmost to create in the minds of people contempt for the Government.  We do not expect that he, any more than Deputy Minch, is ever going to do the decent thing so far as the Government is concerned. But when they talk about forcing people into secret societies I would like them to face up to the facts.  Will they <Col N="613" /> answer the question that was put to them several times during the Second Reading debate on the Bill: what would they have done if, at any time since 1922, the people in opposition to them politically in the Republican ranks had militarised their political organisations; had marched out into the open with a certain part of their programme hidden behind in secret, had dressed themselves in uniform, and had put lethal weapons into the hands of their followers?  What would these two Deputies have done?  Would they allow the political organisations of the Republican movement to be militarised? Would they allow on almost every Sunday two or three lorry loads of those people, dressed in uniform, to drive through any town, say, in the west of Ireland and have them jumping off their lorries and smashing the heads of people who shouted political catch-cries at them&mdash;smashing their windows, breaking in their doors and pulling out guns in people's houses?  Would the Deputies opposite allow that to contine?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask Deputies opposite what they would do if they were the Government and if we put 100,000 young people, boys and girls who supported Fianna Fáil, into uniform? Would they allow us to do so?  They have told us what a fine manly thing it is to have young people in uniform. I know very well they would not allow us to do that.  Even if they had to bring out machine guns, and put them into the hands of the Army to mow us down, they would not allow it.  I think they should realise that any Government wanting to rule the country and to put its programme into operation could <Col N="614" /> not allow what they are attempting to do, and that the Government was bound to bring in this measure.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins, of course, thinks that every political party should put their young men into uniform.  I think it should not.  One reason why I am of that opinion is this: that we are not far enough removed yet from the very ugly bitter feelings created during the civil war to have political organisations militarised in the fashion that Deputy O'Higgins spoke of.  I think it would be a very dangerous thing to do.  I think that any Government would be very foolish to sponsor anything of the kind.  I think it is a very foolish thing, too, for an Opposition, claiming to have a certain amount of political prestige, to give its support to any such proposal. In the long run, its support of any such proposal is bound to militate against it.  The Opposition have seen the evil results that follow from getting school children to wear uniforms.  They have had to go back on that part of their programme.  As I have said, we are not yet far enough removed from the bitter feelings created by the civil war to allow of the militarisation of young people claiming to belong to political parties.  Such a thing would, in the long run, lead to very serious local disturbances, and I am convinced would inevitably lead to civil war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the people opposite who are now loudest in their condemnation of the Government action are the people who would suffer, because they know the feelings that remained after the last civil war.  I have met and talked to men who fought against us in the last civil war.  I have talked to many of them, as well as to many who were on our side.  These men made the statement to me&mdash;they made it in full sincerity&mdash;that the wrong men were shot in the last civil war.  If you have that sort of atmosphere created in the minds of the young, then undoubtedly men would suffer on both sides.  Let those who are now trying to hamper the passage of this Bill remember that if squalls and brawls take place, if you have a civil war atmosphere created, that perhaps the wrong men may not be shot in the next civil war.  I make a present of that to the Opposition, just <Col N="615" /> as Deputy O'Higgins has made a present of the statement to us that we are going to drive underground an organisation which may become a menace to the State.  I am just as sincere in my statement as he was in his, and I take him as being absolutely sincere in his.  I would ask the Deputies opposite to consider that point of view.</P>
    <P>The Opposition say they are opposed to the Bill because it is going to injure them politically.  There are two Mayo Deputies sitting on the benches opposite.  I make them a present of every single man who is in the Blue Shirt organisation in Mayo.  They have never been anything but opponents of ours.  I put it to the two Mayo Deputies opposite that it would be very much better for these people to organise themselves on political lines and not to mind about such titles as &ldquo;generals,&rdquo;&ldquo;commandants,&rdquo;&ldquo;adjutants,&rdquo;&ldquo;quartermasters,&rdquo; and so on. They will not cause us the slightest trouble in the County Mayo, and will not advance the cause of the Opposition one step more by being in the Blue Shirts than they would by being in the United Ireland Party.  Let them belong to the United Ireland Party.  This Bill is not directed against it.  It is directed against the military wing of that organisation, and every member in the military wing of the organisation is already a supporter of the political wing.  Let them remain in the political part of the organisation. They will not do us one bit more harm now than they did in the past.  The only difference, as we gather from the statements that have been made is that it is more spectacular to have them in uniform; that the uniform attracts youth; but cannot the same be said of the Black Shirts and the Brown Shirts as well as of the Blue Shirts?  But, surely, with the tradition that Deputy Minch talks of, the same could be said of the Green Shirts.  If the members of our clubs or of any other organisation were to put their youthful followers into a uniform of any colour, it would be, at least, as attractive as the Blue Shirts.  I submit that if we were to do that, we would sooner or later have a very nasty atmosphere in <Col N="616" /> this country, because we cannot all be as deadly deliberate and as coldly calculating as Deputy O'Higgins.</P>
    <P>I do feel, knowing the country as I do, that it would be a bad thing to have these organisations coming out into the open wearing uniforms.  I think if Deputies opposite could only take that point of view they would withdraw their opposition to this measure, and it should not take them a week or a month to do so.  We are asked in a sort of final appeal to withdraw this Bill for a month.  If in the meantime, some organisation comes out to put the members of their Party into another uniform, will the Minister not have a bigger task in a month's time than he has now?  All this talk about partial administration of the law, and about its being worked against the Party opposite is absolute nonsense, and they know it.  They can have their meetings; they can bring people in their lorries to meetings, but surely they ought not be allowed to bring them round in uniform encouraging other parties also to go into uniform? Any Government that would permit that would not be doing its duty.  This is a measure to stem the tide, and the Government is very wise in stemming the tide now.  Let Deputies opposite remember the heated scenes that we have sometimes in this House.  Unfortunately I must plead guilty to the charge that I do not give the best example myself.  Very often we have scenes of which we may be afterwards ashamed.  Then how can you expect peace out through the country where you have big meetings, where you have one of the parties trying to enthuse the crowd, and several other parties trying to irritate them?  I think the thing that has irritated and aggravated the minds of the people most, and that has driven them into losing their self-control, has been the putting of certain elements into uniform.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. O'Higgins congratulated the Blue Shirts on being self-controlled under very difficult circumstances in the past.  I can absolutely congratulate the people of this country on being wonderfully self-controlled when they <Col N="617" /> got every provocation to break the law, when they were faced with everything that could irritate the public mind by members of the Blue Shirt organisation. We had members of this organisation marching through towns, breaking in doors, breaking in windows, and hitting with iron bars those who shouted a particular catch-cry against theirs, and that in certain towns where the vast majority of the people were politically opposed to them.  Yet our people were self-controlled. They merely went to the barracks and lodged a complaint.  I absolutely congratulate the people on their self-control in these circumstances, but you cannot always hope that they will hold out in face of irritation of that kind.  I think it is time for the Government to have this measure passed and to prevent, not the wearing of blue shirts exactly, not the carrying of weapons by members of the Blue Shirt organisation, but to prevent any party in this country from organising in a military fashion, dressing in a uniform, and going about in public in uniform.  By doing that we will ensure a peaceful means of working out to its fulfilment the programme of any political party that gets into power here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the amendment moved by Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Mulcahy.  I hope that Deputy Cleary will not leave the House until I read for him something that might leave a more lasting impression on his mind than the words used by Deputy Dr. O'Higgins. Deputy O'Higgins, in urging the acceptance of this amendment, said that there was a grave danger that if an organisation like this were not allowed to proceed in the ordinary open fashion they would be driven underground, and he quoted several instances in which such things happened. In 1931, when certain people were shot in Tipperary, and when certain jurors were shot in Dublin, the Government of the day felt it obligatory on them, in the interests of the preservation of human life, to bring in a certain Act, the Constitution (Amendment No. 17) Act, which the present Government bitterly opposed <Col N="618" /> then, but which they have now in operation.  I should like to quote for Deputy Cleary's benefit what the present President of the Executive Council thought about that Act.  At that time the Government of the day were dealing with armed associations, not with people who were armed with nothing but blue shirts.  What did President de Valera say on that occasion?  According to column 56, volume 40 of the Official Debates, in opposing that Constitution Amendment Bill, he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If you deny people, who are animated with honest motives, peaceful ways of doing it, you are throwing them back on violent ways of doing it.  Once they are denied the peaceful way they will get support for the violent way that they would never otherwise get.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Perhaps that might make some impression on Deputy Cleary's mind. That is from the present President of the Executive Council in dealing with the Bill then before the House.</P>
      <P>On the same occasion, the present Minister for Justice, who introduced this Bill, spoke against that Act.  He will be probably surprised to hear now what he had to say about that particular Act, the Act which is now in operation and which he has defended, and which he apparently now believes is not harsh enough to deal with the Blue Shirts. He has got to bring in a further Bill to supplement this Act, which he so vigorously opposed then.  What was the Minister's opinion of those who brought in the Act at that time?  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I would be surprised if they could now get away from these dirty underhand tactics by which they have been always trying to trick and fool the people.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Could not we say the same thing of the Minister now?  What have we but dirty, underhand tactics now?  What are there but dirty underhand tactics in this Bill?  Nothing, in my opinion, has been produced to justify the particular section upon which this Bill stands.</P>

      <P>That is the one thing that terrifies them.  The other thing they are terrified about is that they do not know who is paying for them. They are afraid that it is the enemies of the country who are paying for them. Is not all the talk about the threat of civil war camouflage?  Is it not a smoke screen to hide the economic degradation to which this country has been brought?  Civil war!  The President spoke for three hours on this Bill. He told us, among other things, that he had the loyalty of the Army and, as a matter of fact, he told us that he had to pay a tribute to his predecessors for the loyalty with which the Army had served.  He told us he had the loyalty also of the Civic Guards, and for that again he paid a tribute to his predecessors.  He said he had also with him the majority of the decent people in this country.  Now, if he has on his side the Army, the new Army, the Civic Guards, that section of the Guards misnamed the Broy Harriers, the I.R.A., and the majority of the decent people of the country, who is going to fight against him?  The Blue Shirts must be hardy fellows if, armed only with blue shirts or even with bludgeons, they are going to fight the Army, the new Army, the Civic Guards, the I.R.A., and the majority of the decent people of the country.  Is not the whole thing a humbug so far as civil war is concerned?  Is it not all camouflage?  The President, the Minister for Justice, and the members of the Fianna Fáil Party know very well that so far as the Blue Shirts are concerned there is no fear of civil war, absolutely none.  Deputy Cleary talked about people going about in uniforms.  There is nothing at all about the people who go around with arms.  Apparently that is quite within the law; but if you go around with a baton or a blue shirt, it is God help you.  And this is a democratic Government!  This is the poor man's Government!  That is what they call themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="620" /> Of course, Fianna Fáil had to do something.  The economic situation had developed to such an extent that it had to be hidden by something of this sort.  Another important matter is that the bill of costs which the Minister for Finance is going to bring in&mdash;the sum of £35,000,000&mdash;has to be covered in some way.  When Fianna Fáil were here in opposition they made great speeches against Budgets of £21,000,000 or £25,000,000.  Now, when expenditure has increased to such an alarming degree, they have to get something to hide that, and they bring in this Bill. They are merely following the example of Eastern peoples who beat the tom-toms in order to create a war frenzy. They know well, and the Attorney-General knows, that there is no fear of a civil war.</P>
    <P>They tell us that there are the ordinary means of preserving order at public meetings, but they know perfectly well of the hearing we do not get at public meetings.  I remember in 1931, before this Government got into power, I was endeavouring to speak in my native town of Roscommon against organised opposition and the then forces of the law were not able to allow any of us an opportunity of being heard because of the Fianna Fáil opposition.  On Thursday and Friday of the week before last we had a speech lasting over three hours from the President. It was the President's pacifist speech and it was published in all the papers.  I am sure it was very zealously read by Fianna Fáil supporters in the country.  Here is my experience. On the following Sunday I was at a public meeting in a place called Clooneycolgan and the chairman who introduced me said I came there to address the people on political matters. He said that if any member of the audience wanted to ask questions he was sure Mr. Brennan would endeavour to answer them.  Further, he said that if any member of the crowd wanted to address the meeting he was quite welcome to address it.  President de Valera, when he was speaking here, said it was quite possible some of the things we mentioned off platforms riled his supporters to such an extent that they were bound to interrupt. <Col N="621" /> On this occasion I had simply said three words&mdash;&ldquo;Ladies and Gentlemen&rdquo;&mdash;when the local president of the Fianna Fáil club, not any of the ordinary I.R.A. scallywags, none of that crowd, but the local president said &ldquo;Come down, you traitor&rdquo;, &ldquo;Up de Valera.&rdquo;  That was after the President's pacifist speech.  The local president of the Fianna Fáil was a gentleman named Mr. White.</P>

      <P>Now, when President de Valera, who occupies the position which he now occupies, unfortunately for this country, makes a statement like that, it is tantamount to saying: &ldquo;You are unpopular; you deserve to be unpopular; you deserve what you are getting.&rdquo;  I would recommend Deputy Donnelly and President de Valera to remember that the popular cry of the mob was not always right, was not ever right, not since the crowd chose Barabbas was it right down to the present day.  This Bill seeks the creation of a new crime.  The Attorney-General was very wroth when Deputy O'Higgins or Deputy Mulcahy spoke about manufacturing crime.  What is this Bill aiming at but the manufacture of a new crime?  Was not every effort made by the Government to drag the Blue Shirts beyond the path of the law and they could not do it?  Did not the Government violate the law both by arrest and otherwise to try to drag the Blue Shirts beyond the path of the law and they could not do it?  Now they have to create a new crime and that is what they are endeavouring to do to-night.  They are creating a new crime so that they will be able to bring <Col N="622" /> the Blue Shirts outside the law in some shape or form.</P>
      <P>There is an old saying that those whom the Gods wish to destroy they first set mad.  I think that if ever there was a decent opportunity to use that saying it is the present opportunity and in regard to the present Government.  I do not think there ever was such a mad proposal brought before any House.  There is no use in Fianna Fáil trying to camouflage the issue.  There is no use in pretending that there is evidence of a civil war breaking out.  The one redeeming feature of the Bill is that it is directed plainly and unadulteratedly at their political opponents.  They are out to try to put down their political opponents. That, and nothing else, is the object of the Bill.  They could not attain that object in any other way and they must now create a crime so as to involve their political opponents and put them outside the law.</P>
      <P>If Fianna Fáil were a non-militarist party it would be a different thing, but the fact is, as was said here recently, they have been bred on it. We refuse to accept the statement that the Blue Shirts are a military or even a semi-military organisation.  The one thing that they have to be put down for is not because they are a military organisation, because they are not, not because they have the uniform, not because they have arms, because they have not got them, and not because they are a danger to the State, but because they are a direct danger to the political life of the present Government. For that reason alone the Government is endeavouring to try every act of aggression and even brute force to put them down, instead of decently accepting their defeat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dowdall told us that if the Blue Shirts were allowed to develop they could not be controlled.  If the Blue Shirts are allowed to develop on the lines upon which they have been founded and upon which they now exist, is there any reason to control them?  If they are constitutionally within the law, have they not the right to alter the Government of this country?  Is that not their right?  Is <Col N="623" /> that not the liberty for which we fought and which this country thought it had won?  Apparently, the Government want to carry out a sheer act of aggression. Coercion seems to be their policy. When an Act which is now in operation was being discussed here, President de Valera declared that it was the worst coercion Bill since the time of Hamar Greenwood.  Speaking of the Government then in power, he said: &ldquo;As Carlyle said, squelch them, by God, squelch them.&rdquo;  That is the policy of the Government, but the Government will wake up to find that they are a bit late in their policy.  No steps that the Government can take with regard to this Uniform Bill or any other Bill are going to stem the tide of the League of Youth.  They will not do it.  I certainly would not like to prophesy that the Blue Shirts are going to be driven underground into a secret society.  I do not want to say any such thing is possible, but there is a real danger there, and I think&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If it is ever to become a secret society it is this policy, or something like it, that will drive it to do so.  The League of Youth has been above board.  All its acts have been open, and even the most terrifying picture that Deputy Cleary can paint, with regard to lorries going through the country, men jumping off them and beating up people as they meet them on the streets, will not have any weight with the people of this country.  Everybody knows they are unreal.  I suppose it would be too much indeed to expect that the Minister is going to accept this amendment, but I certainly would say that the Minister is, in my opinion, doing a very bad day's work for the State when he is allowing that section to go in in that particular way. The decent thing for the Government to do is to ensure equality of law.  Let every person who is within the law have equal service in this State.  There is no <Col N="624" /> use in trying to bring in a Bill like this.  It is not going to get you anywhere. It is possibly going to make a lot of trouble in this country, and, of course, if the trouble comes the Government will have to put up with the responsibility for it.  I do not want to delay the House any further, but I do think that that amendment moved by Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Mulcahy ought, in the interests of the country&mdash;certainly not in the interests of Fianna Fáil but in the interests of the country&mdash;be accepted and inserted in the Bill.</P>

      <P>With regard to the last few remarks made by Deputy Brennan as to whether there was any possibility of a change of mind on this Bill on the part of the Government, I am quite satisfied to have this whole matter reconsidered if the Deputy and the people on his side of the House are prepared to give up wearing uniform. That is all we ask for.  We ask for nothing more.  I have been listening here during all these debates to attacks concentrated on the Government that all they are doing and everything that they aim at under this Bill is purely and simply to injure an opposing political party.</P>

You carried on here for ten years as the Government of this country.  You said that the people loyally backed you.  Did you secure the backing of the people at that time by going round in peculiar uniforms? You did not think of any such assistance then.  We were in opposition in this country during those ten years, or the most of it.  As the strongest opposing Party during all that time it never struck us to try to get some continental dodge to try to help along our policy.</P>

      <P>It was lawful in other countries up to a point.  We are supposed to be acting here all through as if we were the most tyrannical people in the world.  I have pointed out, and the Attorney-General has pointed out, on the Second Reading debate that other countries have adopted similar uniforms to the uniform adopted here. We did not hear anybody protest against the Bills that were brought in in those countries.</P>

      <P>We are not without precedent.  We did not hear anything about manufacturing crime in those particular instances.  In connection with this Bill we have brought in here, do not try to assess blame on this side of the House.  Other countries have made moves to deal in the same way with the brown shirts, the green shirts, and so on.  The Governments in those countries have had to deal with them in the same way as we are dealing with them here.  If you send people away on cruises or something like that, and they get ideas abroad, when they are bringing back to you that stock-in-trade to have it adopted in this country they must also be prepared to take the risk that the Government in this country will have to deal with it in the same way as the Governments in the countries they are getting it from.</P>

      <P>You must be prepared for that.  There is no use in complaining about it.  When you were moving along in this Blue Shirt idea you knew the way other countries had <Col N="626" /> regarded those movements, and how they had dealt with them.  It was stated by the ex-Attorney-General that the word &ldquo;political&rdquo; was not mentioned in those Bills.  It is the very thing which is emphasised in every one of those Bills.  It is emphasised in Belgium, in the Netherlands, in Switzerland, and all the rest of them. Everyone of those Bills was brought in to deal with opposing political parties who try to get along in this way by donning a uniform.  The main point is this: does Deputy Brennan or any other Deputy on that side of the House think for a moment that any Opposition, when Cumann na nGaedheal were the Government in this country, would be permitted to assign to themselves duties which were the duties of the State's servants?  If you were to again become Government in the morning, do you think you would allow us to go out in green shirts, or some other form of uniform, and to excuse ourselves by saying: &ldquo;There is a lot of trouble at political meetings.  We are not as popular as we were.  Your police force are not able to deal with it, and we want to build up a police force of our own?&rdquo;  Would you stand for it?  I put it honestly to any Deputy on the other side of the House, if he wants to give me a straight answer.  There is not one of you who would now commit himself to giving such an answer as that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what way the Deputy wants the question to be put.  I made it as clear as I could. We are not going to permit in this country&mdash;and I say that no responsible Government could permit it&mdash;people to dress in uniform and assign to themselves police duties.  It could not be done.  Somebody said that this Bill was directed against the Blue Shirts.  I admitted that candidly when introducing the Bill, but I did state also that this Bill, while it had to deal with this particular problem of the Blue Shirts at the moment&mdash;it is the only problem it has to deal with at the moment&mdash;was designed to meet and deal with any other people who tried <Col N="627" /> to go out in uniform in this country.  I have seen, and everybody else has seen, reports in the papers that a number of other people were thinking of going out in some other sort of garb. This Bill, as drafted, covers, and is designed to deal with, any body which tries to assign to themselves uniforms and the duties that should be performed by the servants of the State. If you were as successful for ten years as you claim you were, and if you carried on so well without uniforms, is it any hardship on you now to get back to where you were?  There is no question of interference&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Consider also what is the position if you are going to have two or three rival factions in this country, with faction fights developing, where people will go out in different coloured uniforms and settle matters between themselves.

      <P>What is going to be the logical outcome of that?  Batons, in certain circumstances, might not be sufficient.  If you claim the right to use lethal weapons, are you going to define to what extent that use is going to be brought?  Against certain force that might be used and in certain circumstances, you would take machine-guns to keep order?  Is that not so? Are you going to stop at that?  You claim that these people of yours who are not under the control of the State must be allowed to carry lethal weapons.

      <P>Deputy Doctor O'Higgins here, on the Second Reading, talked about the wearing of <Col N="628" /> uniforms being the greatest card ever thrown on the political table.  I suggest to Deputy Doctor O'Higgins that he took that card, not from the ordinary political pack, but from his waistcoat pocket and that he has put it in, more or less, as a forged joker and that he is playing it away from the recognised political pack.  If he wants to play what he calls a political card game, he must use the cards that are authorised according to political tenets and political understanding about these matters.  There is no difficulty in the way of his falling back on the regular stock-in-trade that his Party has and carrying on its political propaganda.  Nobody is interfering with that and the Government is doing everything it can to protect them.  I know that interference has occurred at political meetings.  Nobody has ever attempted to deny that.</P>

I remember, even in 1923, when we were very much hunted about the country, our people were interfered with at meetings&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>We are charged here every other day with not providing protection for meetings.  Let us take the case of the President of the Executive Council on the first occasion on which he tried to appear in public, in Ennis.  Shots were fired at him and nobody was brought to justice for it. We are charged with winking at various things done in the country and with not having people brought to justice for them.  There were shots fired at the President of the Executive Council when he was addressing a meeting from a platform and when he was going out to assert the right of liberty of speech in this country.  There was no question raised in this House as to why somebody was not brought to justice for it.  There were other incidents <Col N="629" /> later on.  You had the incidents that happened in Ballinamore when the President was attacked.  All those things were happening during those years and you are trying to fool the people that you had order at meetings during all that time.  The building up of forces is not the way to get order at meetings.  The State must do its best to preserve the right of holding meetings but if it is going to assign that function to other people, it must, inevitably, lead to civil war, because it will mean that two or three people will be playing the same game.</P>
      <P>There is no hardship in this Bill and no necessity for all this talk about driving people underground.  There is no use in people talking that way.  I think it was Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney who, on the Second Reading last week, tried to picture for us the terrible position that would arise if some lady were attacked in the streets and an effort made to take a garment off her.  That was based on the assumption by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney that that particular person would not obey the law.  This suggestion of driving people underground comes very badly from people who have talked so much about constitutionalism in this country and obedience to law.</P>

      <P>Since the last election we have had plenty of crime in Galway. We have had from ten to 12 outrages in Galway for the last 12 months and in at least six of them guns have been used.  The Guards, I know, are in a position to give information as to the people using the guns.  In cases in which guns were not used, our people were beaten up.  In two cases out of these ten or 12, within the last 12 months, people have been brought to court.  In one instance, the people who committed the outrage of beating up an old man of 73 years of age, were put under arrest.  They were later released and it was not until after a question in the Dáil by Deputy Hogan that they were re-arrested, tried before the Tribunal and sentenced.  The same evidence was there beforehand.  It was admitted by officers of the present Government, in a case recently in the northern end of County Galway, in which an old man was beaten up, that there was a factory for the manufacture of batons and knuckle-dusters by local Fianna Fáil and I.R.A. supporters. It is well known to the authorities that there are drilled Republicans in that area under arms.  Is it not known that two Deputies in the town <Col N="632" /> of Loughrea six months ago headed a parade of I.R.A. men in the case where a doctor was being appointed to a position in that town?  Is it not known that two Deputies of this House headed that crowd?  Is it not known also that after the parade, quite recently, ordinary law abiding people, for just shouting &ldquo;Up&rdquo; the name of one particular person, have got nine months in jail and that people who had revolvers and who beat up a man in that locality were not arrested?</P>
      <P>All we want is that the law should be administered as it should be.  That is all we want, and that is why the Blue Shirt organisation is there.  The Minister for Justice tells us that we are taking the powers of the police.  We never attempted to take the powers of the police.  We attended our own meetings and all we did was just to attend our own meetings.  The Minister for Justice was prepared to send sufficient Guards to protect the gentlemen who were out to cause trouble in the country.  At every meeting in the last six months, if the Attorney-General reads the reports, he will find that, whether the Civic Guards are ordered for that duty or not, their real duty is to protect the gentlemen who are interrupting the meetings and who are out to cause trouble.  Those are the conditions that we have down the country and no matter what Bill you introduce, the colour of blue is going to last in this country, and the colour of blue is going to win out.  Mind you, the Minister for Finance has done more than anyone in the Front Bench to ensure that the blue colour will win out.  He has done more for us than anybody else.  As Dr. O'Higgins stated, we went into the Blue Shirt organisation.  Our people went into it.  There is no secret about it.  What is this secret about the guns? We are going to meetings every other day and it is well known that we are not armed.  If you take County Galway you will find that no later than last November up to 20 houses of supporters of the Blue Shirt organisation have been raided upside down for arms, ammunition or documents.  What has been seized in these raids?  Everybody knows that no arms or ammunition have been found.</P>

      <P>It is a long time since the Deputy was in the know.  That is the position and, on every occasion on which the Blue Shirt organisation went out, they kept the law.  Deputy Cleary stated, and it is typical of the statements that come from him, that men of the Blue Shirt organisation jumped off their lorries to beat up people with iron bars and broke into their houses when going to public meetings. At the same time, he is not prepared to give the name of one single case.  We have not seen it happen, but we have seen our own supporters being badly beaten up.  They were beaten up a fortnight ago in Galway.  We have seen where an ordinary political meeting was held in Galway and where you had to have forces of Civic Guards protecting the railway line to see that people would not be injured or lives lost through people taking up the railway tracks.  That is the position down through the country, whether the Government knows it or not.  All we ask is that the law should be administered fairly to every one, and if the Government of the country does that they need not worry about what colour of shirt is in it.</P>

      <P>I listened to the Minister for Justice when he was introducing this motion and he said he was introducing it because he considered it was urgent.  I must confess, to his credit, that that is in accordance with statements made by him in the recent past at a street corner in the town of Ballina, when he said: &ldquo;Clear this accursed crowd out of the way, so that we may get on with the work.&rdquo;  That is a statement made by the Minister for Justice in the town of Ballina.  It was published in the local Press and therefore I can challenge contradiction. As far as matters of that kind go, I will say also, to the Minister's credit, that he is a very able lieutenant in leading a mob in that town, and no man, or very few men, as far as I know, were more capable of acquitting themselves in that way than the Minister for Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We heard Deputy Dowdall here to-day, and he made statements which, <Col N="634" /> I think, were well worthy of him.  He considered that this measure was needed, but in another breath he said that it was not unusual and that we should not be surprised if we had disturbances in this country as we have been accustomed to faction fights in this country in the past.  I do not know whether it is Deputy Dowdall's idea that such a state of affairs should continue.  Notwithstanding that he said we were accustomed to faction fights in the past and to disturbances of the peace and disturbances of public meetings in the past, still Deputy Dowdall considers that it is consistent and honest on his part to support this tyrannical Bill that is now before this House.  Deputy Dowdall goes further and says that it is of very little consequence what would happen in a matter of that kind.  If we only reflect on the position and on the statements made here in the past when the Minister for Justice was in opposition, we will see a great difference between his statements then and now.  What was his statement then in regard to the Constitution Bill?  According to him then, it was provocative; it was intolerable; it was a tyranny that should not be entertained by any people and that should not be obeyed by any people.  Let anybody look over the Official Reports and read the Minister's words and he will see there, almost word for word, that that is what the Minister said.  I do not say that I am actually giving his very words, but that, in substance, was the meaning of what he said.  To-day he says that this Bill is urgent and very necessary and that it should be pushed through in a great hurry.</P>
    <P>We have heard something from a Deputy whose name, owing to the respect I have for him, I very seldom mention.  That is Deputy Cleary.  He stated here this evening that certain things occurred in the County Mayo. Certain things did occur in the County Mayo, I admit.  The Attorney-General knows what was proved and has full cognisance of what happened in Mayo, and he knows pretty well what occurred there.  I do not know, and I am not going to criticise, what was the result of the investigation into <Col N="635" /> crimes committed in the County Mayo. I will not dwell on the fact that the people over whom the Attorney-General and the Government stand were the perpetrators of those crimes. One of those crimes was an attack on the house of a man named Pat Gavin, in Belcarra, County Mayo.  He happened to be a man who was able to defend his house on that occasion, as he was capable of defending himself at all times.  I will come now to something that happened more convenient to the Attorney-General's own home.</P>
    <P>What occurred in the vicinity of the Attorney-General's home?  When the Blue Shirts were trying to establish a branch of their organisation in a town only six miles away, or within gunshot, I might say, of where the Attorney-General was born and reared, an attack was made on the house and it took the Guards all their time to defend it.  That was in the town of Balla.  I think the Attorney-General knows all about that.  That was investigated.  I am not going to criticise or to say anything with regard to the merits or demerits of the decision given on that occasion.  The outcome of it is still pending.  Whatever criticism that deserves, I do not desire to go into it.  I prefer to pass that by.  At all events the fact remains that people were wounded on that occasion.  The Guards were barely able to defend people who had assembled to carry out their lawful business in a lawful manner.  That matter came up in court, but we know what the result was.</P>
    <P>These are the people who support the Fianna Fáil Government.  These are the people who are out for law and order.  These are the people whom this Bill is supposed to defend.  I wonder was there any necessity for the creation of some organisation that would combat the onslaught of people with that disposition?  They were not willing to let any man express his views.  I think every man in the country should be entitled to express his views.  As far as I am concerned, I challenge anyone to say that I have ever interrupted a public meeting.  I have never advised anyone to interrupt a public meeting. <Col N="636" /> I do not know what the Attorney-General did in his day, but if we are to take what we have seen I am afraid that the Attorney-General has sometimes not altogether lived up to the position that would lead any impartial-minded man to believe that he has discharged his duties in an efficient and impartial manner.  In saying that I do not desire to cast any reflection on the Attorney-General.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davis</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot look on silently when we note the things that are happening.  Taking note of those things, it is our bounden duty as public representatives to remind the Attorney-General from time to time that there are certain things happening&mdash;certain things that do no credit to the Attorney-General or those with whom he is associated, and which certainly do not tend to improve the position in this country, politically or constitutionally. The Blue Shirts are going to be banned.  What is their crime?  Have they irritated the Attorney-General or the Minister for Justice?  About that I have no doubt whatever.  I know that this organisation to them is like a red rag to a bull.  While they are doing this I wonder what else they have in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder has any undertaking been given to the I.R.A. that the Blue Shirts would be banned.  At all events, the I.R.A. can carry on.  To their credit I must say that there are some honest and respectable men in the I.R.A. If they have been misled, they have the courage of their convictions and they have never hesitated to live up to those convictions.  Their opinions are contrary to the opinions of those of us on this side of the House.  I do not know if they are contrary to the wishes and opinions of those on the Government Benches.  From all that we can see, I am afraid that is not the case.  That is the sad part of the story.  I think it would be accurate to say that the I.R.A. are demanding terms.  &ldquo;If there is going to be a republic in this country,&rdquo; the I.R.A. say, &ldquo;declare the republic.&rdquo;  The people on this side of the House have not said, &ldquo;Do not declare a republic,&rdquo; but, &ldquo;Why do you <Col N="637" /> not declare it if you think you are entitled to declare it?&rdquo;  I suggest that there is an undertaking and that there is some understanding.  I want to be perfectly fair and impartial, but as far as I can judge that understanding is, &ldquo;Suppress the Blue Shirts and we will not be hard on you.&rdquo;</P>

When a Deputy, coming from the same county as I do, said that certain things have been done by Blue Shirts in that county I challenged that Deputy to give particulars, but there was no reply to that for the simple reason that no particulars can be given, except particulars of the crimes that are being committed by the people with whom the Party opposite are identified.  Those crimes have been committed, they are on record.  If they are proud of that record, I wish them luck.  As far as the Government Party are concerned, I admit that the Blue Shirts are a terrible menace.  They are a menace that will sweep the Government out of office.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate until I heard the speech of the Deputy who has just spoken.  I certainly consider that that speech was a very audacious one coming from that Deputy.  He talks about the administration of justice.  In another place I told the Deputy at one time about a certain piece of so-called justice which was brought about in his own native town.  A prominent supporter of his Party was put in the dock on a criminal charge, and after the first hearing the prosecution was dropped and nothing further was heard about it.  It would be interesting if the Deputy would tell us who pulled the wires in that case.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's respect for free speech was exemplified a few days ago when he ordered a Press reporter to whom he objected away from one of his meetings.  The Deputy's respect for free speech was also shown when the chairman at that meeting called on the crowd to deal forcibly and in a physical manner with anybody who objected to any statement made from the platform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDavis" hpid="Mr. Davis Mr. Davis">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I suggest that you stood by while the chairman made it, and did not object.  In other words, you stood there while the crowd were asked to assault physically any person who objected to anything that was said from the platform.  With regard to things that happened in County Mayo, there was a deplorable and dirty raid on Pat Gavin's house.  I condemned it then, and I condemn it now.  But that was dealt with by law, and nobody condoned it.  I did not approve of the action of this man in the other case that is still pending.  I do not approve of it now.  Will Deputy Davis tell us about people coming away from the Blue Shirt meeting in Swinford who went into a house in Kilkelly and wrecked it?  Will he tell us about the Blue Shirt mobilisation in the town of Ballinrobe about a fortnight ago, at which iron bars and knuckle-dusters were used?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDavis" hpid="Mr. Davis Mr. Davis">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the priest's house in Straide.  I agree that was absolutely wrong, but I am not afraid to tell both sides of the story.  I am not afraid to face up to both sides of the story, but the Deputy took care not to face up to both sides of the story.  I am a great deal younger than the Deputy, but I have a fairly long memory in Irish politics.  As several speakers remarked here to-day, interruptions at meetings and rows at meetings are not new in <Col N="639" /> Ireland.  I was a very small boy when I saw rows at meetings, and very ugly rows, too.  I will recall to the Deputy's mind the ugly political fights he was mixed up with from time to time.  I will recall to his mind the famous O'Kelly fight in the County Mayo. There was no military organisation in those days and no I.R.A. in those days.</P>
      <P>I have a distinct recollection of meetings where only for the large force of R.I.C. present lives would have been lost.  I have always seen rows at political meetings.  I myself have attended meetings and got very rough handling at them.  I took my medicine.  I had the doubtful pleasure of being pulled off a platform one time and getting a damned good kicking.  I did not grouse about it.  I did not go down the country moaning about it and talking about the terrible outrage on free speech. Any person who ever entered politics and is not prepared to take his does of these things, must be a very innocent person indeed.</P>
      <P>I have listened here to-night to a number of speakers who were mixed up with certain movements with myself in the past.  Anybody who did not know them would imagine from the plain innocent way in which they spoke that they were all dear little innocent children, lighthearted boys who were only going into these associations in the happy spirit of fun, donning blue shirts to see how well they would look in them, and to see how they would attract the nice girls and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and with no thought in their minds of a military organisation. They had nothing at all to do with these things in the past.  They knew nothing about them.  They were totally innocent of them.  But a good many of us had experience relating to those things in the past, and we know from what small beginnings they have started.  None of us had any illusions when we went into them at the start. We had very definite objects in our minds.  We kept those objects in our minds all the time, and we pursued them, and we built up an organisation. <Col N="640" /> But we did not hesitate to use every bluff and every pretence that would cod the other fellow.  The people on those benches opposite who were in organisations of that type with me, and who did the things I am now speaking of, used every bluff and every pretence to cod the British and take advantage of every technical flaw in the law and to bluff them.  They knew what they were doing as well as I knew what I was doing, and they did it, and I did it. Now they want everybody in this country to believe that they are not doing the same thing, that they are not trying to play the same game.  Let them be honest about it at least, and admit the truth.</P>
      <P>If there are Deputies in those benches, like Deputy MacDermot, who knew nothing about those things, who had no experience of them, it is different.  It is quite possible that they may be throwing dust in Deputy MacDermot's eyes, but I can assure them that they are not throwing dust in some of our eyes.  Certainly I am glad to see that there are men on the Government Benches who have had a little bit too much experience of those things to be blind to the implications behind such movements as the Blue Shirts.  We know well what they are, and what they mean.  We know well what the men who thought of them, the men who designed them and who are the driving force behind them, have in mind.  It is because they are a danger and a menace to the rights of the ordinary citizens in this country that I am voting for this Bill.  As long as I have been in Irish politics I have always voted against coercion of every sort.  It is because I know the dangers in them, and it is because I know the men who have thought them out that I am supporting this Bill.  I call on every Deputy in the House who has the interests of the country at heart to support the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>The obvious comment on the speech we have just listened to from Deputy Walsh is that it is not always wise and fair to judge other people by ourselves.  Several speakers on this and on former occasions have enquired: &ldquo;What is the use <Col N="641" /> of the blue shirt, what is the garment for, tell us that?&rdquo;  They have gone so far as to say that nobody has attempted to answer their question. That is not true.  Deputy Dr. O'Higgins, a week or two ago, gave one answer to that question.  He said that the blue shirt uniform, if you like to call it so, had been found convenient for the purpose of maintaining peace, order and discipline amongst our followers, and seeing to it that illegalities were not committed.  That is a perfectly sensible answer as far as it goes, but I will admit freely that it does not go the whole way.  There is another reason, and I do not see why we should not frankly admit it, and that is, that we consider ourselves justified in making use of any adventitious aid in making virtue attractive. Virtue needs to be made attractive. We are preaching very dull doctrines to members of the League of Youth, doctrines that hitherto in Ireland had absolutely no glamour; considered to be entirely lacking in romance, lacking in spirit, and lacking even in patriotism.  We are teaching them obedience to the law.  What could be duller, I suggest, than teaching obedience to the law, love of the law, and determination to see that individual citizens get the benefit of the law? When we have forces existing&mdash;no matter what the Minister for Industry and Commerce may say&mdash;with any amount of connivance and encouragement from Government Benches, when we have revolutionary forces existing, and roping in the youth of the country by means of the glamour that hangs around them, we are justified, and more than justified in doing whatever we can to invest law and order, and decency, with glamour too.</P>
      <P>I made at the outset of the debate on the closure motion what I thought was a conciliatory speech.  I dare say it might have been more conciliatory than many members of my own Party might like, and my reward was to be denounced by the Minister for Industry and Commerce as a hypocrite. I think this will be a fair test of hypocrisy.  Does one say different things in the Dáil from what one says down the country to one's supporters?</P>

      <P>That would be stupidity rather than hypocrisy.  I claim confidently that the dull doctrines that I have been preaching in this House I have been preaching consistently in the country, and there is not a single thing of a conciliatory character that I urged in this House I have not also urged in the country. The Minister considers it to be my duty, apparently, to act as a censor of the publication known as the &ldquo;United Irishman.&rdquo;  I do not consider that to be my duty, nor do I consider, because he reads aloud some fragment from a report, that I am therefore equally bound to get up and to denounce that publication on the strength of the fragment. There have been much more obvious duties resting on the members of the Front Benches opposite that they have not fulfilled.  When I spoke on this Bill a fortnight ago I quoted utterances delivered in this House, and outside of it, that have never been disowned by the Minister or by the Front Benches.  There was one utterance in particular, in regard to the I.R.A., which was made here in the presence of the President, that I never heard specifically denounced or disowned. Another utterance was made in the Seanad by Senator Comyn that I never heard disavowed.  Not only that, but there were utterances of Ministers in the country, such as that of the Minister for Finance, which I referred to on the last occasion, which I never heard denounced by them in the Dáil.  If I wanted to indulge in that kind of language, surely that would justify me in accusing all of them of being hypocrites.  Is it right for us to be using language of that type at all?  I suggest that it is not, and that when somebody gets up and seriously puts forward a serious offer to deal with this matter in a conciliatory and co-operative spirit, if it can be done, it is not a very sensible or a very patriotic thing for the Minister to get up and call it hypocrisy.</P>

I am prepared to accept that as a test of the Deputy's hypocrisy. We heard a speech from Deputy MacDermot to-day, in which he talked about promoting conciliation and goodwill, in which he described the Blue Shirt organisation as being maintained for the purpose of invoking respect for law and securing the maintenance of peace and order.  He spoke for quite a considerable time in that strain.  I put to him the acid test that he has laid down, to reconcile that speech with the various extracts I read to him from the official organ of his Party, and the reports of speeches made by members of that Party throughout the country.</P>

I do not want to accuse Deputy MacDermot of being a hypocrite, and neither do I want him accused of being lacking in moral courage.  One or the other must be correct.  Either the Deputy spoke here with his tongue in his cheek, knowing that no other member of his Party was prepared to subscribe to his sentiments, knowing that different sentiments were continually being expressed by his colleagues, or else he spoke honestly, but when given the opportunity had not the courage definitely and openly to stand up to his own <Col N="644" /> views and to repudiate the contrary views expressed by those with whom he is allied.  Is it going to promote peace, goodwill and respect for law to have this organ of their Party definitely challenging the authority of the Government, contending that the Government's right and authority to make laws is open to question, asserting that the Government is in fact a mere gang of gangsters, and that they use the power to feather their own nests?</P>

      <P>&ldquo;But it should not be understood that there is a breach between Mr. Lemass and his leader on this matter. They are both quite at one.  The policy of both is to make fine-sounding speeches, while at the same time they prostitute the authority received from God to serve the ends of the gangsters instead of Government. For, while conscious of the respect that is due to a Government, we assert that Mr. de Valera is a gangster leader as well as the head of a constitutional Government.  His office of President of the Executive Council is availed of by him to serve his personal political purposes and those of his gangster allies.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Peace, goodwill, conciliation and respect for law!  Will Deputy MacDermot at least admit that the views and sentiments that he gave expression to to-day cannot be reconciled with what I have just read?  That is obvious to any intelligent man.  Either the Deputy knows that, and yet made that speech deliberately for the purpose of deceiving members of the Dáil and the public, on the attitude and policy of his Party, or else he made that speech while, at the same time, because for reasons best known to himself, he would not associate with the speech what is required, namely, a repudiation of these sentiments.</P>

      <P>This is another example of how respect for the law is promoted by Deputy MacDermot and his associates. This is a reference to a section <Col N="646" /> of the police force, established under the authority of this Parliament and acting under the authority of the elected Government of this nation:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;On the other hand, it is likely that the reason for sending ordinary Guards along with the Harriers, instead of entrusting the raids entirely to the latter, was to prevent the occurrence of violence and looting by the Bashi-Bazouks.  It is, however, impossible not to feel that the employment of the Harriers on such raids presages evil and bloodshed. There are not a few who think that the Harriers were used in last week's searches for the purpose of familiarising them with the internal geography of houses into which they will later make midnight incursions without the check supplied by the presence of ordinary police.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Respect for the law, support for authority, the promotion of peace, conciliation and good-will!  Is it any wonder that I described Deputy MacDermot, not only as a hypocrite, but also as a humbug?  He will not succeed in humbugging Deputies on this side, and I doubt if he will succeed in humbugging the people throughout the country with speeches such as he delivered to-day.  I do not know whether or not he makes speeches like that throughout the country.  I do not trouble to read the reports of his speeches in the Press, but I must assume that the speeches he and his associates make are similar in tone to the stuff they write in their weekly propagandist sheet.  Since Deputy MacDermot cannot reconcile the extracts I have read with the speech he has delivered, either he has got to be condemned as an arrant humbug, a conscious hypocrite, or he has got to repudiate publicly these sentences and dissociate himself from the writers of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true, as Deputy Walsh pointed out, that we have behind us a certain amount of experience which enables us to test the sincerity and to discern the motives of those with whom Deputy MacDermot is associated which he has not got.  It is not the first time in Irish history that a military organisation was brought into existence and <Col N="647" /> organised to undertake certain operations without the knowledge of the leaders of the movement.  It is not the first time that an organisation which had high sounding principles set out in its literature and which was nominally controlled by people of honest purpose, was, in fact, controlled by a secret organisation, like the resurrected I.R.B., with which General O'Duffy, Deputy Mulcahy and others have been associated.  We doubt very much that Deputy MacDermot knows anything about the real intentions of those who are the effective masters of the organisation he is defending here to-day. We know these people quite well, and Deputy MacDermot cannot pass them off on us as enthusiastic youths anxious to spring to the defence of constituted authority and to help the forces of the peace in preserving order.</P>

I tried to point out to Deputies here before that, if their aim is to achieve power by the ordinary methods of political agitation, they do not need uniforms, and that, in fact, they will find, in due course, the uniforms are a handicap.  It is, certainly, clear that they are not necessary. Fianna Fáil got into power without the aid of uniforms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that most of them did not vote at all.  I do not think that the number of votes they influenced was very great, but, whatever influence they could use, was not used in the manner Deputies opposite allege.  However, that is not the point. The Fianna Fáil organisation was constituted on normal lines, and, proceeding by normal methods, reached a very high degree of efficiency and succeeded in achieving its end&mdash;putting the Fianna Fáil Government into office.  It was able to do that because it had a policy.  Deputy Morrissey and Deputy Rice tried to explain away to-day the Fianna Fáil victory in the last two elections, on the ground of the efficiency of its organisation.  They said some things about myself in that connection. That is all bunkum.  If Deputies opposite think they can achieve power merely by the efficiency of their organisation and by holding a number of public meetings, they are on the wrong track.  I can speak with some authority on this matter, because I know that the Fianna Fáil organisation would never have achieved its object, no matter how efficient its organisation, or how many public meetings it held, if it had not had a solid, constructive and attractive policy to lay before the people.  The first thing the Party opposite must get before they will be even seriously considered by the people is a policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>You have not one policy but twenty policies.  You have got to have one policy, whether it be Deputy MacDermot's policy or Deputy Cosgrave's policy or General O'Duffy's policy or Deputy Morrissey's policy. You have got to stick to that one policy.  You can add to that policy later if you like, but at the present <Col N="649" /> time we can get, on any single question of public interest, not less than twenty policies from the Party opposite. A uniform, we were told, is necessary for them.  It was not necessary for Fianna Fáil or other political parties, but it is necessary for them in order that they may be able to maintain discipline amongst their members. Judging by some of the youths I have seen photographed in the newspapers, it will require more than a shirt to maintain discipline amongst them.  Is it necessary that, in order to get discipline, the supporters of the Party opposite should be regimented in the way in which they propose to regiment them?  One gets discipline in an army by such tactics, but members of an army are not supposed to think.  In fact, their instructions are not to think. The private in a company or the officer in a unit has only one function, and that is to carry into execution the plan decided upon by those higher up.  If he has any doubts about the plans and he writes up and asks the general why he decides upon such a course of action, he becomes subject to discipline.  Presumably the only way the leaders of the Party opposite can hope to get any unanimity in policy is to occupy the minds of their followers about coloured shirts and new salutes.  If the followers of the Party opposite give the slightest consideration to the reason why that Party failed, as a Government, and the prospects for this country, if they were ever returned as a Government, not one of them, even in the glamour of a blue shirt would take any steps to put them back upon the Government Benches again.  They are justified, therefore, says Deputy MacDermot, in making use of any adventitious aids that come to them, to make virtue attractive.  They will want a lot of adventitious aids to make their type of virtue attractive.  That is the kind of argument that we had from Deputy MacDermot and from Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney at a previous stage of this Bill.  They told us it was necessary to regiment and uniform their supporters, in order to secure, not merely discipline amongst them, not merely to attract in enthusiastic youths by the glamour of the uniform <Col N="650" /> but, also, to maintain order and to enable order to be maintained wherever they assembled.  Again I want to be told where they think that should stop, and why they think the sole right to act in that way should be conferred upon them.  If the Party opposite feel they are entitled to establish a military or a semi-military organisation in units, and wear uniforms for this purpose, why stop at loaded sticks and knuckle-dusters? Will they not, in due course, think they are entitled to add a machine-gun or two as another adventitious aid in promoting the kind of virtue that the Deputy is in favour of?  Again, I ask them, if they are not ready to answer why they are prepared to stop at loaded sticks and knuckle-dusters and not go further, why they should have that right to organise their supporters, and expect no similar development to take place in regard to another party if this Bill does not become law?  Is it not the common experience in every country where militarism is progressing and developing, where one party is trained and regimented that another party adopts the same methods, until you come to the state that the nation concerned is divided into two disciplined and armed camps, and that civil war is the outcome?  And however Deputy MacDermot may talk, the certainty is that if this Bill does not become law a similar development may be expected here.  And no matter what influence he or the Government, or any other responsible people may exercise to prevent that development, it will not be sufficient.  If he thinks this preposterous method is going to lead to peace and goodwill and conciliation, he is a simpler man than Deputy Dowdall believes he is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate upon this Bill is beginning to lag.  I think everything that can be said about it has been said. I know now that Deputy Dillon has entered the House that it is all going to be said again.  That is inevitable. You could no more stop the tide coming in by drawing a line across the sands than prevent another debate now that Deputy Dillon has arrived.  He will have nothing original to say, and I advise Deputy MacDermot to have a <Col N="651" /> little conversation with him before he rises to speak.  He may not be aware of the line that Deputy MacDermot took to-day, and it is well to have these two, at least, speak with a unanimous voice, even though they are contradicted by other members of the Party.  Deputy MacDermot referred to the utterances occasionally made by members of the Fianna Fáil Party and even by certain Ministers on occasions, and which have not been repudiated. I do not know whether these utterances, to which he referred, were made here or had any bearing upon matters of policy.  There were, in the main, remarks of a nature that one says in the play of heated debate.  Very frequently one regrets the provocation that induced these utterances.  But the quotations I read were not of that description.  They were written in cold blood, set up in type, read and checked by proof readers, printed and sent out to be read in the country&mdash;Bashi-Bazouks, included.  Deputy MacDermot again explained these statements as irresponsible statements uttered in the heat of some political controversy. They were not; they were written in the calm of the editorial office under the presidency of the grand high council of the Fine Gael Party.  They were published and distributed by the grand high council which paid the editor his salary in connection with them, and in recognition of the good work he had done to promote respect for the Party and to spread comfort and consolation amongst their followers. If Deputy MacDermot should speak again or if he could induce Deputy Dillon to speak I hope we may get from either of them withdrawal of the Deputy's previous speech or else a repudiation of the sentences that I have read to him from the official organ of his Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to spend one or two minutes upon the complaint that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has been laying so much stress upon in regard to <i>United Ireland.</i>  To begin with, so far as I am aware the editor has no salary, <Col N="652" /> but that is a minor point.  The expressions &ldquo;gangster Government&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bashi-Bazouks&rdquo; do not happen to be quite in my style, nor can they be described as peaceful or conciliatory. But I never claimed that a political party could conduct its campaign, all the time, in an atmosphere of peace and conciliation, and it is absurd to suggest that one has to reconcile inconsistencies between peaceful terms used one day and more vehement terms used another day.  The use of violent expressions of that kind I, personally, do not like, but there is nothing in that which involves any point of principle.  There was another quotation made which might be regarded as involving a point of principle, and that is one that seemed to imply that private citizens have the right to stop and consider whether a law should be obeyed or not. Personally, I utterly disagree with that.  Of course I am dependent on one or two sentences the Minister read aloud to me.  There may be other things in the article that modify what he read, but as he read it it is either a truism&mdash;not worth saying at all&mdash;or else it has a dangerous tendency to encourage private citizens to discriminate between the laws they choose to obey and the laws that they do not choose to obey.  In that latter sense I do not hesitate to repudiate it absolutely and completely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister need not have been in such a hurry to accuse me of moral cowardice, because if he had attended more closely to what I said earlier to-day, he would have found that I did at one important point, without any encouragement from him, flatly contradict something that had appeared in the columns of <i>United Ireland.</i>  I am not in the least afraid to do that if I consider that the occasion warrants it. It is absurd to suggest that things printed in a propagandist paper&mdash;it has often to be got out hastily, and has not got the funds to have elaborate arrangements such as exist in the case of ordinary weekly papers, where you have a calm editorial room, and so forth&mdash;are on a different basis altogether from ordinary speeches down the country, and that you have a <Col N="653" /> right to expect something more deliberate.  You have not.  I leave the matter at that, except to say that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is quite wrong if he supposes that we think that the blue shirts, or any kind of uniform are necessary to enable us to whip them at the next general election. We will whip them in shirts of any kind.</P>

I have no hesitation in saying that if the Minister were to undertake to accept it, I for one would undoubtedly vote with the Government on the rest of the Bill.

I accept Deputy Davin's statement now as to what I did say, and all that I want to say is that the significance of that remark, coming from me, was that it was just as relevant for me to argue that the Deputy was precluded because of the fact that he was not earning 24/- a week&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Now I leave the incident at that, because after that remark by me a scene ensued.  Remarks were passed in respect of which withdrawals were made unreservedly on both sides under the rules of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fundamental of this Bill is touched on by this amendment.  It is new to me that legislation of this type should be introduced, because the ordinary principle which governs the initiation of legislation, as I understand it, is, first of all, that the intended legislation should have the support of a large body of public opinion in the country, and, secondly, that it is the criminal, and not the victim of the criminal, who should be dealt with by legislation.  Deputy O'Higgins to-day gave us a very good example of what I mean.  He said that if an epidemic of stealing gold watch chains broke out in the City of Dublin, and that the Government, instead of utilising the ordinary law for the apprehension and conviction of the thieves, were to legislate so as to prevent ordinary peaceful citizens from wearing watch-chains, that such a course would be equivalent to the sort of legislation which we are now discussing and which this amendment is designed to cure.  So far as the support of a large section of the community is concerned, I have no hesitation in thinking that such support is non-existent for this measure. The idea of this Bill, and the idea <Col N="655" /> which this amendment is designed to destroy is, that because Blue Shirts are objected to by a certain small section of the community&mdash;that section being a rowdy and hooliganistic section&mdash; therefore the Blue Shirts must be banned.  Everyone knows that the solid, decent support behind the present Government is not in favour of this Bill.  Everyone knows that the thinking Deputies on those benches do not believe that this measure is going to do the Fianna Fáil Party any good throughout the country.  There is no doubt whatsoever about that.  The President is very fond of speaking of mandates, but there has been no mandate from the people for the passage of this measure.  The Government, before passing such a measure as this, should, I submit, go to the country and get sanction for it from the people.  We all know what has been happening in this country since the last general election. At the last general election, from the first week of the election campaign, it was absolutely impossible in the South City of Dublin to secure a hearing.</P>

      <P>What is happening here is perfectly obvious.  This Bill is dictated from precisely the same quarter as that from which the dismissal of General O'Duffy was dictated.  If General O'Duffy were not leader of the Blue Shirt movement, I have absolutely no doubt but that this measure would not have come before the House.  The same people who, through the columns of <i>An Phoblacht</i> week after week, demanded the dismissal of General O'Duffy have been crying out for the suppression of the Blue Shirts and, just as General O'Duffy was dismissed at their beck, so now the Blue Shirts are being banned, at precisely the same dictate.  If that principle is going to be introduced into legislation, all I have to say about it is the sooner the Irish people learn about it, as they will undoubtedly learn about it at the next general election, the sooner will the present Government be driven out of office.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 13 has nothing at all to do with badges, but it desires to exclude the possibility of an association being regarded as an association under this Bill if it was a trade union which was in existence on the 23rd February, 1934.  The Minister is rather puzzled, I think, by the reference to badges.  I wonder if he has anything to say with regard to those trade unions to which this amendment referred.  I understood the amendment was moved.</P>

      <P>That being so, and in view of the terrible danger that threatens trade unions in this country according to the Labour Party, I would expect a more vigorous defence of the trade unions to be put up on the section.  I understand a political levy is to be raised from trade unions at the present time for the purpose of fighting the Fine Gael Party, and for the purpose of defending trade unions against the attack that the Fine Gael Party propose to make on them.  It is very depressing to those of us who have the interests of trade unions and trade unionists at heart, and whose attitude towards them is entirely different from what members of the Labour Party suggest, to think that the defence of the trade unions in this important measure is as futile as the Deputy would show that it is.  I do think that it ought to be put completely outside the range of the present Executive Council to include trade unions in the bodies which they propose to attack under this Bill.  I, for one, object to this amendment being withdrawn, having been moved, and I think the House should divide against the Minister if the Minister keeps up the attitude he is taking up on the matter.</P>

      <P>It is exactly the same thing&mdash;&ldquo;or badge.&rdquo;  Under the amendment which the Minister has accepted he agrees that a person wearing a trade union badge would not come within the ambit of this Bill.  I feel that even under its altered form the section is capable of being misconstrued if the words suggested by Deputy Mulcahy are not inserted.  I, therefore, support the amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not know if Deputy Mulcahy knows what a trade union is. Certainly he does not know what a trade union is for the purposes of an Act of Parliament.  There are very extraordinary associations registered as trade unions, a number of which have nothing to do with labour, or the organisation of labour.  The effect of the amendment proposed would, of course, be very largely to nullify the Bill, inasmuch as it would be open to any organisation to adopt to itself one of those associations which are in existence and which have nothing to do with the organisation of labour.  I think the Deputy is aware of one well-known person in Dublin who adopted this attitude and made quite a lot of money out of it.  The effect of the amendment would be to open the gate so wide that the Bill would be entirely futile.</P>

      <P>We have come to a very desirable position, and it is a very good thing that this point has to be decided.  Now, the Labour Party is beginning to feel coercion.  Now, the members of the Labour Party are being brought to a realisation of what the significance of this Bill is.  The Labour Party are going to be put to the test now of voting in this House whether that Government should have the right to suppress every trade union in this country, or whether they should not.  Deputy Corish got up in Wexford a few days ago, and announced that he had voted for the Blue Shirts Bill because he was satisfied that Deputy Cosgrave and others were aiming at setting up a dictatorship in this country.  I wish Deputy Corish were here to repeat that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not look it up again.  I know very well what the Deputy said.  Deputy Davin cannot deny that he said he voted for the Blue Shirt Bill because he knew, or <Col N="662" /> believed, that Deputy Cosgrave and others were trying to set up a dictatorship. That statement Deputy Corish cannot have believed.  That statement everyone in Wexford knows was made without the belief which would justify making it.  To-day we have the position in which Deputy Corish's own colleagues are going to walk into the lobby for the purpose of giving that Government the right to set up a dictatorship in this country, and to suppress every organisation, labour and otherwise, which may seek to defend the rights of the citizens of this country against that Government, or against any other force which seeks to suppress the rights and liberties of working men and every other man in the country.  The Labour Party ought to realise what they are going to do. Deputy Norton has opened this pit under his own feet.  It is up to him now to show the country whether he has the courage of his convictions, or whether he has any convictions at all. There are a good many people in this country beginning to doubt whether he has any, or whether he ever had any. There was a time, in this country, when the Labour movement stood resolutely and consistently against coercion.  They sold their souls to the Fianna Fáil Party and they alone know what they got for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They have sold their souls to Fianna Fáil, and they are now being required to pay the price.  They are now being required to deliver themselves. They are now being required to sell every labouring man in this country into the bondage of the Ministers on those seats.  They are now being required to set their names to something which for the first time in the history of this country, since trade unions were set up, gives the Government the right to suppress a trade union because it is a trade union. And the Minister knows it.  The Minister <Col N="663" /> tries to make the case that there are more forms of trade unions than one.  It will be a poor consolation to the working men of this country to know that their rights, which every Labour leader in the history of the Labour movement of this country, and every other country, has fought for, have been bartered away to-night by the Irish Labour Party.  There is no Labour representative in the whole of Europe but would vote for that amendment, except the Labour representatives of the Irish workmen. There is not a Labour representative, no matter how depraved, in any country in the world but would resist that attempt on the part of that Government to take the powers they seek to take under this Bill.  It is up to Deputy Norton now to show whether the stand he pretends to take is a fraud or not.  He has got his chance, and he ought to demonstrate to the working men of this country that he is prepared to defend them when it costs something to defend them, or he ought to clear out for ever from the working men movement in this country.</P>

      <P>Nobody opposite will be able to answer that question and no member of the Fianna Fáil Party will be able to answer that question because no person in this House knows how deeply and how sincerely in his heart Deputy Dillon hates the cause of Labour.  His unguarded word has exposed for the first time in this House the real mentality of Deputy Dillon. He said that if the Labour Party do not vote for this amendment they will vote to hand over the control of the Labour movement to the Ministers sitting on these benches.  I do not know whether Deputy Dillon was as insincere in May, 1932, as he was sincere to-night when he let slip that unguarded expression which reveals his true mind, because I remember him voting here for a Budget, introduced by members of the Government on these benches, because it was a good Budget and a Christian Budget, as he said, and a Budget that was going to do something at last for the workers. He believed then that we could do something for the workers and that we had the cause of Labour and the labouring classes at heart.</P>

It is that gentleman, who has changed his position but who has not changed his spots, and who remains still as he was then, the enemy of Irish labour, the enemy of Irish freedom, who now ventures to condemn the Labour Party in respect of this amendment.  It is pointed out that General O'Duffy to-morrow might <Col N="665" /> take over one of these moribund organisations and call himself a trade union&mdash;and there is nothing to be wondered at in that, because the General has the audacity to call himself many things and poses as many things before the Irish people; one of his latest poses is to exhibit himself as a friend of the workers&mdash;it would not be any sort of difficult transformation for that gentleman to change himself to-morrow into, as I have said, a trade union and claim exemption for any association of persons, who might band themselves together under one of these resurrected names, from the provisions of this Bill.</P>

      <P>This is an important amendment.  I do not think there is any use in endeavouring to cloud the issue by rising to any heights of oratory on this simple amendment.  Anybody who has any experience of trade unionism knows that the things referred to by the Minister for Finance could not possibly happen.  The wording of the section as it stands is very clear.  This section will apply to the members of any trade union in this country and it will give the Government power to prevent the members of a trade union from wearing the badge of the particular trade union to which they belong.  I do not think there is much use in going outside the scope of the amendment or of bringing in matters that are quite irrelevant.  The wording is very clear.  It refers to &ldquo;any combination of persons&rdquo; and Deputy Norton's amendment has one purpose and one purpose only&mdash;to ensure that before the Bill is passed, this section will not apply to the members of trade unions in this country.  I think it is quite obvious that, as it stands, at the moment, it can apply and can be made applicable to the members of a trade union and prevent them from doing anything in furtherance of the objects for which trade unionism stands if those objects might, at any time in the future, be at variance with opinions held by Ministers at present.  I think the thing is very clear and I would ask the Government to accept the amendment proposed by Deputy Norton.</P>

      <P>If one did not know that Deputy Dillon could not stop talking, and was a kind of political parrot in this House, one would be inclined to take, at its face value, the concern which he pretended to display for the trade union movement to-night.  But look who is displaying the concern for the trade union movement&mdash;Deputy Dillon, who was one of the prominent people, in Ballaghaderreen, associated with a lock-out a few years ago, and one of the people associated with a wage-cutting campaign in Ballaghaderreen a few years ago.  This is the gentleman who is interested in the trade union movement to-night. Insolence and hypocrisy never went further.

We had Deputy Mulcahy bubbling over in his anxiety to assist the trade union movement to-night&mdash;the Deputy, who, as a member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, prohibited a trade union from going on strike and issued a proclamation to that effect and who, when speaking in this House on the Saorstát Eireann United National Health Insurance Bill, made a most disgraceful and slanderous attack on a trade union insurance society which proved to be perfectly untrue and in respect of which the Deputy had subsequently to make a kind of apology. His dignity would not enable him to make a decent apology.  These are the two gentlemen who are concerned about the trade union movement tonight&mdash;one Deputy who prohibited a strike and slandered a trade union insurance society, and another Deputy who was associated with a wage-cutting campaign in Ballaghaderreen and <Col N="668" /> with a lock-out of the workers there. Those are the two advisers we have to-night.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon knows now that the statement he made was incorrect in that respect, and that even if the Bill went through without amendment there was no section in it giving power to proscribe trade unions. I have not the slightest fear that trade unions will be proscribed by this Government; but if the Deputy's Party were in power, having regard to their known record in the past, I would have considerable doubts as to whether they would not exercise their powers and probably arrogate to themselves powers to suppress the trades union movement.  If one had any doubt on that, we have had it recently proved by the statements of the leader of that Party outside.  He has a scheme of his own&mdash;a new Italian scheme.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the ice were on the leader's head when he was making those statements there would be less nonsense in them.  To give us an idea of what the Party opposite stands for in the matter of trade unions, we have the leader of the Party outside stumping the country with a ready-made Italian system to enable the trade unions to come in close contact with their employers, and to get a line on Deputy Dillon and his Party in the matter of trade unions, we have only <Col N="670" /> to read the statements of General O'Duffy at Kildare, that the dearest right of workers, the right to withdraw their labour, is going to be prohibited under this great corporative State that the General talks about in Kildare.  The Deputy talks about trade unions and his concern for them, and the leader outside says in Kildare that they are going to organise the State on such a basis as to withdraw from the workers the right which they fought for since the beginning of the trade union movement, namely, the right to withdraw their labour.  It is a nice state of affairs when we get a Party of that kind, represented in this House by Deputy Dillon, with the leader outside wanting to suppress the trade unions and Deputy Dillon inside pretending to be concerned about them. Is not the whole attitude of the Party opposite towards trade unions abundantly illustrated by this corporative scheme of General O'Duffy, which is going to have Deputy Good and his bricklayer in the one organisation?  Deputy Good laughs. Of course he laughs.  Why, a cat would laugh at the scheme of organisation. We are to have Deputy Good and his bricklayer in the one organisation. There is to be no right to strike at all &mdash;no right to strike for the bricklayer. He may be permitted to work for his employer but he can never withdraw his labour, and, being economically inferior to his employer and having no right to withdraw his labour, what is going to happen is that the employer will have the right to dictate to him all the time.  And we have this from a Party that to-night pretends to be concerned about trade unions.  Deputy Dillon above all people on that bench, after his activities in Ballaghaderreen in connection with strikes and lockouts, ought to be the last to stand up and pretend to be concerned about trade unions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I just rise to say a word or two about Deputy Norton. He has got up in this House and, like a good lawyer with a bad case, he directs all his attention to abusing the Opposition, but does not say a single word about the amendment <Col N="671" /> before him.  He simply asked one question in connection with it and made no statement whatever.  He asked one question, and that was to state one section under which trade unions could be prevented from winning a battle.  I am not a lawyer.  I am a layman, but I think that it is quite evident that the Executive Council can do so under Section 2 and I think under Section 1, taken together. Section 2 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>It shall not be lawful for any person to wear any uniform or badge which is indicative of membership of, affiliation to, or support of a political party or an association ancillary to a political party.</P>
      <P>Now, what is to prevent the Executive Council declaring any Labour Party or any Labour organisation to be a political party or an association ancillary to a political party?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>Supposing Deputy Norton and his Party came over here to the Opposition, could not the Executive Council declare that his organisation was an organisation ancillary to a political party?  Deputy Norton, on this occasion, sells his liberty and gives himself over completely to the Government.  He sells his independence and freedom and the independence and freedom of all those he represents.  I challenge him to deny it.  I shall leave it to others now because I am only a layman.  The simplest man in the Assembly can see that under Section 2, taken in connection with Section 1, they have power to declare the organisation the Labour Party represent an ancillary to a political party, if the Labour Party do not do what they want them to do.</P>

      <P>I listened with considerable astonishment to the discussion which has taken place here.  It <Col N="672" /> is quite evident that, after spending three days on this Bill on the Second Reading and the whole of to-day on the Committee Stage, Deputies opposite have not yet found out what it is about.  I suggest to Deputies opposite that before they come in here to waste the time of the Dáil making speeches on a Bill they should at least read it. You cannot proscribe or suppress any organisation under this Bill, whether it is or is not a trade union.  This is not a Bill to suppress any organisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Section 5 or any other section a trade union or any other type of organisation cannot be suppressed under the Bill.  This is a Bill that prohibits the wearing of uniform.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And to prohibit the wearing of badges under certain circumstances. Now Deputies will perhaps realise how relevant Deputy Norton was when referring to amendment No. 18, because amendment No. 18 takes badges out of the Bill except under Section 5 where a proclamation is required in order to proscribe a particular badge, in particular circumstances, in a particular district.  I am sorry Deputy Dillon is not here.  He might have found out what the Bill was about and saved himself the trouble of coming in to make another stupid speech based on ignorance, like all the speeches from Deputy Dillon.  I am certain that if I had not intervened in time we would have the same type of stupid and ill-informed speech from Deputy McGilligan.</P>

      <P>We got a lot of what the Americans call &ldquo;Chicago bull,&rdquo; but no information.  We have heard about a &ldquo;royal flush,&rdquo; but I think the Minister can be called a &ldquo;four flusher.&rdquo;  Deputy Norton continually talks about a parrot.  It is very easy to teach a parrot small, simple words like &ldquo;withdraw.&rdquo;  I am sure he has said &ldquo;pretty polly&rdquo; to himself very often, but &ldquo;withdraw&rdquo; is the word he has learned best. Deputy Davin talked about getting a red shirt.  It would fade to the <Col N="674" /> faintest white with a tinge of yellow in it if any Minister held up his hands to the Deputy.  Really nobody should have any interest in trade unions if trade unions have any interest in the two Deputies who have put up such a craven show to-night.  What was the meaning of putting down the amendment? Did the Deputies apprehend some danger?  They surely did, and they are now relieved because the Minister for Industry and Commerce stood up and said they must have power to suppress trade unions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Those were his words.  Whether he read the Bill before he used them or not I do not know.  He distinctly used them.  He said that there were many associations masquerading as trade unions and that there must be power to suppress. These are the very words he used. The Minister for Finance talks about translations.  When he is translated I hope he will be expurgated, as he tried to expurgate others.  They will not expurgate that.  That is what the Minister for Industry and Commerce wanted.  Do not let cravenness overcome the trade union representatives in the House too soon.  There is something to be stood over; there is some danger.  The man who drives away speeches, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who has not made a good example of himself, told us to-night that &ldquo;badge&rdquo; has gone from the Bill. It has not.  I will make the statement without fear of contradiction that &ldquo;badge&rdquo; has not gone out of the Bill.  &ldquo;Badge&rdquo; has not gone out of the definition clause; it has not gone out of Section 5; it has not, in effect, gone out of Section 4.  With the repercussion of all these sections, one on the other, there is not the slightest doubt that if the Government want to get after a trade union they can get after it.  Any Chief Superintendent of the Gárda Síochána can prohibit the wearing of trade union badges in his functional area.  That is clear.  It will be an offence under the section for a trade unionist to wear a badge. Notwithstanding the amendment accepted, notwithstanding the parrot <Col N="675" /> cry of &ldquo;withdraw,&rdquo; it will be an offence to wear a badge, and under Section 9 any member of the Gárda Síochána may enter any trade union premises and search.</P>

It that what the Deputies think is safeguarding the trade unions? Will they say that in any of those areas inside the functional area of a Chief Superintendent a search warrant may be issued and under the warrant premises may be raided and private homes may be raided?  Is that safeguarding the trade union organisations?  You need not go so far as Section 5. Section 4 gives the Executive Council power to declare any association a political Party and once that has happened anything that can happen under the Bill can happen to trade unions.</P>

      <P>I am glad to be able to join in that compliment to the workers, but not in the compliment to some of their representatives.  It is worth while considering why the Deputy put down the amendment about badges.  He said that it was to prevent the wearing of such badges relating to trade unions being made an offence.  He thinks he has got his point.  That is either due to a lack of intelligence or else he has realised for some reason that the words were not sufficient.  He wants by the amendment to get an association of persons defined in such a way that these associations could not include trade unions which were in existence on 23rd February, 1934.  The Deputy withdrew that amendment.  Why?  Does he still see no danger in the operation of Section 5, no danger in the operation of Section 4, no apprehension, with regard to Section 9, and has he no possible apprehension under Section 11, <Col N="682" /> which allows any member of the Gárda to seize a trades union badge worn in contravention of the Act.

In that connection he has referred particularly to the risk of search, but he has not disclosed to the House that there is nothing in the section about searching or anything about raiding for these badges.  There is something about wearing them but, for the rest of Deputy McGilligan's speech, there was no foundation whatever in Section 5.  It was merely dragged in in order to conceal the anxiety&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of the gentlemen on the benches opposite&mdash;to use trade unions as a last hope, as camouflage.  In the course of the debate on the last amendment, Deputy MacDermot said that they wore blue shirts because they thought they would be an adventitious aid in making their peculiar virtues attractive.  In that connection, if they want adventitious aid why not use rouge or lipstick or patchouli?</P>

      <P>Is it that they may create around their dying movement the glamour of trade unionism that they are now anxious that the words in the amendment should appear?  It is quite true, of course, that they could quite easily convert themselves.  Fine Gael, having undergone so many transformations, might easily reappear in public life as a trades union, say either as the Land and Labour League of Deputy Belton, the Farmers' and Ratepayers' League of the Centre Party, Cumann na nGaedheal, or the United Ireland Party.  Why not form themselves into a trade union of discredited politicians?  They could do so quite easily.  I can see them remaining a political organisation if the words in the amendment were inserted, but remaining outside the scope of the Bill. They would then have around them the <Col N="683" /> glamour not only of the Blue Shirt but also the glamour of a trades union.</P>

      <P>Glamour is a word that has been used frequently in this debate.  I think it used to be associated with the poets of the Celtic twilight.  Now, we are having associated with politicians of the Cumann na nGaedheal eclipse, the glamour of trades unionism.  Do these people think that a blue shirt, or any sort of shirt, will make the dead walk, or imagine they are going to get away in the guise of trades unions?  Is that the reason Deputy Dillon, Deputy MacDermot or Deputy McGilligan and the rest were so concerned about the amendment&mdash;because they saw in it a way of escape?  They have proved themselves quick-change artists.  They are adepts in changing names.  They can have as many aliases as they like. They have no difficulty there, as the name or the object does not matter to them.  They are going to appeal to the most virtuous purposes, as Deputy MacDermot indicated, and to try to lend to it a little adventitious aid like a blue shirt or a set of trade union rules.  Under it all, we know the real motive.  The Labour Party knows that no organisation that the gentleman who made the speech in Kildare is associated with is going to be friendly to the cause of the workers in Ireland. I think they are well advised not to allow this amendment, which was put down when the word &ldquo;badge&rdquo; was in Section 2, and before amendment No. 18 was accepted by the Minister for Justice, to be misused.</P>

      <P>I want to ban the wearing of uniforms or badges to indicate membership of, affiliation to or support of a political Party which aims at overthrowing or changing the Constitution of Saorstát Eireann by force of arms.  I think that we should all set out to prohibit the use of arms. We should all set out to establish that the only parties that will be given any countenance in this State are those who are going to operate by ordinary, democratic methods&mdash; deliberation, argument, persuasion, even, if necessary, by the rather heroic method of trial by error, which we are going through at the moment.  If we are to reach sanity and sense in the end, one thing we should stop at and one thing that should be prohibited is the use of arms by anybody for the purpose of changing the Constitution of the country or trying to convert people's minds by terror.  One of the Fianna Fáil posters which were scattered amongst us before the last election, asked &ldquo;What is the alternative to Fianna Fáil?&rdquo;&ldquo;The only alternative to Fianna Fáil,&rdquo; we were told in that poster is &ldquo;Government by coerction.&rdquo;  It was an alternative then; it was not identical.  The poster went on to state as the alternative to Fianna Fáil Government,&mdash;&ldquo;the renewal of the régime of the military courts, special prisons, widespread raids, the revival of the civil war atmosphere, which is so deadly to all progress.&rdquo;&ldquo;Fianna Fáil,&rdquo; we were told, &ldquo;gave you peace.  Cumann na <Col N="686" /> nGaedheal only gave you coercion.&rdquo; Now Fianna Fáil gives us the Blue Shirt Bill.  That in one hand and this poster in the other.</P>
      <P>All I seek is that if there is going to be coercion the coercion should be properly applied.  I have in my hands a pamphlet which contains the governmental policy and constitution of Oglaigh na hEireann, as adopted at the general army convention held in March, 1933, and issued with a foreword dated January, 1934.  This is, I suppose, the most up-to-date of these documents.  I hope it is not an official secret.  It is sold for a penny, not like the other &ldquo;official-secret&rdquo; document, for which twopence had to be paid.  This document states that the army is to be known by a certain title, that membership is to be open to all Irishmen of particular ways of thought and so on.  The objects include the establishment and upholding of the lawful Government in sole and absolute control, and the means by which Oglaigh na hEireann shall endeavour to achieve its objects include (1) by force of arms.  Is that organisation with its open profession regarding the use of arms for a particular purpose going to be tolerated and this Bill left in a state in which trade union badges can be coercively abolished?  Do Deputies want to have this Bill limited to useful purposes?  Is there anybody who would not in his sane senses agree that the crying need of this country is to get rid of those people who are endeavouring by force of arms to do what they cannot do by persuasion?</P>

      <P>Will there not be general agreement that, in this particular year of enlightenment, we should look to argument, to persuasion, to the effect of the clash of mind on mind, to speeches, to democracy and appeals to their reason and intelligence?  That is the proper way to convert people to a change of the Constitution, if it has got to be <Col N="687" /> changed, but one thing that everybody who believes in man as a reasoning creature and believes in appeal to the highest part of man should be against is the use of guns and this business of people professing to attain their objects by force of arms.  Why not make a start with them?  There is an organisation which flaunts itself before you.  It is going to bring about certain changes by force of arms.  It is not content with your puny methods of democracy&mdash;talking to people, arguing with them, trying to get a man to see your point of view, trying to get a man to believe that your course is the better one and is going to lead to a better situation for the country.  They despise that.  That is not their method. Their method of attaining their object is what they have stated in the forefront&mdash;force of arms.  Why shirk the issue with them?  Does the Government believe that it is a democratically elected Government?  Does it believe that it holds power because the majority of the people, freely and of their own accord, have chosen it to be the Government?  Do the members of the Government believe that in a new election their appeal to the people to reinstate them to power should be based on reason, telling them what good they did for the country, telling them what progress they had made, telling them what difficulties they encountered and how they got over them.  Or do they think that appeal should be made to the people merely on grounds of terror&mdash;&ldquo;if you do not do something, we will see that you, or the people belonging to you, will suffer; we will see that certain people will be shot; we are going to have guns produced from dumps and produced for use.&rdquo;  Is that a position that anybody wants to have in the country?  Is not that the biggest evil we could have and one which should be put down?  Why has there not been a bigger approach made towards dealing with that evil than there has been? The Minister for Justice knows that there are guns in the country.  The Attorney-General knows that there are guns in the country.  Both of them had experience of a recent case in which <Col N="688" /> guns were used to fire volleys over a grave.  Those guns did not come from lawful custody and were not sent back to lawful custody?  Were the men interrogated as to where the guns came from?  Were the men interrogated as to where they had gone to?</P>

      <P>The Nyham case. There might have been other cases and somebody might consult them.  The Minister for Justice is looking embarrassed.  He might know of other cases.  At any rate he knows of that case.  Can anybody object to my amendment?  Is it not a good and proper thing, in this democratically constituted House, to say that people ought not to be allowed to coerce other people in the country by force of arms? Or are other people so slow to admit their own deeds, or to face the things that might be said about them if they suddenly turned round and took that line?  Are they not going even now to attempt a decent statement that they themselves should welcome the disappearance of armed forces other than the forces of the State?  Will they go further and say, not merely that they would welcome such a statement but that they will take active steps to see that such forces shall disappear? Will they say that?  Will they, even at this late moment, assert the power and majesty of the law so that the only armed organisation in the country shall be that which is under lawful control?  or will they go on with the pretence of being a democratically elected assembly in this country.</P>
      <P>We were told, in February, 1932, by the President of the Executive Council:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;During the ten years since the Treaty ... there had been put on the Statute Book of the Free State no less than six Public Safety Acts, three Firearms Acts, three Infringement of the Law Acts, four Jury Acts, one Treasonable Offences Act, one Protection of Community Act and the Perpetual Coercion Act recently passed, entitled The Constitution (Amendment) (No. 17) Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="689" /> How many of these Acts have been withdrawn since the present Government came into office?  How many of them have been actively withdrawn by any action on their part?  Does that mean that the present Government find that they have to keep this list of Coercion Acts on the Statute Book and to add this proposed new Act to them so as not to limit themselves?  I want this Act limited to the suppression of those who aim at the overthrow of the Constitution in this country by the force of arms.  We used to hear about &ldquo;Bloody Balfour&rdquo; and about &ldquo;Buckshot Forster.&rdquo;  Are the Government bloodier than Balfour?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the present Government to have one more weapon in their hands?  Are they fuller of buckshot than &ldquo;Buckshot Forster?&rdquo; The President also said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;They did not believe that in this country they were so vicious minded that there was a large section of the people that had to be governed by Coercion Acts.  That was the British attitude to the country.  Was it to be their fate in this country that they were always to have Irish Governments like that?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I re-echo these words.  It was the British attitude to have coercion always here.  What they wanted was plenty of Coercion Acts and any amount of enforcement of them in the country.  The present Government are to-day presenting that point of view to the people.  If their point was to oppose people who want to overthrow constitutional Government by force of arms, and if they want help against such people they will get it, but they have not shown themselves inclined to proceed against such people.  Instead of that they are going out to suppress a political association because its members are wearing uniforms or badges. Is there any harm in the wearing of badges or is there any harm in the wearing of uniforms indicating membership of a political party if the aims of that party are proper?  Is there nothing good in having aims like these?  Are objects only to be <Col N="690" /> achieved and are aims only to be achieved by force of arms?  Would it not be a proper thing to attack the big danger first?  When this Bill was introduced there were comments about foreign States and about what Belgium did, and what Sweden did, and what other countries had to do.  In the end the Minister for Justice was forced to fall back upon what Britain had to do and Ministers followed up the discussion in regard to what are called private armies when this matter was discussed in the House of Lords. There you got a unanimity which you might expect in any democratic assembly.  There should be, and was in fact, a junction of opinion by all parties upon this: that it was a good thing to have political parties in the open, indicating their points of views even by emblems and objects and devices of that kind; and that the only thing that was to be feared was that any section of the people, either small or large, should decide to found its policy, not upon argument and reason, but upon coercion by arms and by force.</P>
    <P>If the President is looking for a precedent that private armies are disliked he has that example to follow. Let him follow the words that were used there which, as the discussion shows, were words that were meant. The only point that was queried about the particular organisation on the other side was whether or not it had armoured cars, as alleged against it. And even those who said that they themselves would not appear in a political uniform or wear a badge, indicating a political association, also said that they could see no harm or danger except in the case of a political organisation which became confounded with one that relied upon arms, or force of arms.  They all agreed that once force was shown as the background of any association it ought to be put down by the forces under the control of the State.  I want associations like that to be declared in this House to be unlawful associations.  I want Ministers to forget their past and to say that this armed association shall have no place in Ireland at this moment.  And I <Col N="691" /> want them not merely to say that but to include that association if they can be brought to do so in this measure. No matter what they are going to do against an association of a harmless type, with badges and devices indicating the bearing of that political association, let them show that they are certainly going to use the full force of any power the law, the <Col N="692" /> police or the military affords them against those who set out to overthrow the Constitution of the country by force of arms.</P>
    <P>I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported.  Committee to sit again to-morrow.</P>
