      <NameTxt>Mr. Peadar S. Ua Dubhghaill</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state the total amount of the moneys withheld or liable to be withheld from each county council because of the non-payment of land annuities due to be paid during (1) the year ended 31st March, 1933, and (2) the year ended 31st March, 1934; and the total amount so withheld or liable to be withheld from each county council on 1st April, 1934.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O'Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>All arrears of land annuities payable in the year ended 31st March, 1933, were funded under the Land Act, 1933, and out of the sum of £300,000 proposed to be paid in respect of grants absorbed in the Guarantee Fund on account of arrears of annuities that have been funded, county councils will receive credit for all grants accruing to them in that financial year.</P>
      <P>The full agricultural grant was issued within the financial year.</P>
      <P>As regards the year ended 31st March, 1934, a sum of £398,996 2s. 4d. was absorbed in the Guarantee Fund in respect of arrears of annuities for the November/December, 1933, gale.</P>
      <P>I will arrange to have sent to the Deputy particulars of the share of each county in this sum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, am I correct in thinking that he calls the £300,000 promised for the relief of rates, or whatever it is, a grant?  Was there not an undertaking <Col N="2190" /> given by the Minister in charge of the Land Bill that these moneys would go as a matter of right to the county councils in lump sums to be paid by the Minister for Finance? Further, might I ask the Minister when is it proposed officially to inform the councils that this money will be available, and will he indicate the amount available in each county?  As the Minister knows, the rate books are being written up and it will mean scrapping a lot of work done if the rate books have to be altered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be no question of scrapping the rate books or re-writing or altering the rate books, because the sum allotted to each county council will, we hope, be used by them for the purpose of being put to the credit of their overdrafts. The details of the sum available for each county will be notified to each county council in a few days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is going to be used in relief of the current rate, surely the rate struck on the basis of not getting this £300,000 must be altered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy misunderstood me.  I expect the £300,000 will be used by the county councils in order to be put to the credit of their overdrafts&mdash;in relief of their overdrafts&mdash;not for the purpose of the reduction of the rate now about to be struck.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>But surely that cannot happen.  If a county council gets a sum of money within the financial year that it was not expecting to get, surely it can reduce its rate for that year to the extent of that amount?</P>

      <P>The Corporations of Cork, Dublin, Limerick and Waterford; the Corporations of Clonmel, Drogheda, Dun Laoghaire and Wexford; and the Urban District Councils of Athlone, Bray, Carlow, Cobh, Dundalk, Galway and Tralee.

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he can state the local authorities which provide a special allowance to persons in receipt of home assistance who are certified to be suffering from tuberculosis; the average amount of the special allowance in each area, and the total expenditure of each local authority under this head for the financial year ended 31st March, 1934.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>As the allowances of home assistance granted to such persons are not segregated in the accounts of the Poor Law Authorities I am not in a position to give the information desired by the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the reply given by the Parliamentary Secretary, might I ask if it is possible to obtain the information by means of a questionnaire to the local authorities, asking for information from those authorities who are paying this special allowance in the case of patients suffering from tuberculosis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>It would, I presume, be possible to submit such a questionnaire to the local authorities, but I doubt if the information would be worth the expenditure of time that would be involved.  The amount of assistance is determined by the Poor Law Authorities after consideration of all the relevant circumstances of the case, having regard, doubtless, to the health of the applicant which would be an important consideration, but there are many elements other than tuberculosis in the case of recipients of home assistance where it might be desirable to give a special allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not possible for the Department to ascertain even the number of the local authorities precisely and precisely where this amount is made available?  Is it not easy to identify these allowances because tuberculosis is the only ailment for which special grants are made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to take it that no protest will be forthcoming from the Labour Party with regard to the Government's action in proposing to take Private Members' time, particularly in view of the fact that there is a motion on the Order Paper, in the name of the leader of the Labour Party and other members, calling the attention of the Government and asking them to take special steps in view of the widespread unemployment in the country?  I must confess that I find it hard to understand the attitude of the Labour Party in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this motion was put down on the Order Paper there was, undoubtedly, a considerable amount of unemployment in the country.  I think it will be admitted by members of the Labour Party themselves that the numbers of unemployed have increased very considerably since the motion was put on the Order Paper first.  Surely, if it were thought necessary 12 months ago&mdash;and I am sure the motion was put on the Order Paper because it was thought necessary&mdash;to draw attention to this matter and to ask the Government to take special steps to deal with the problem, it is much more necessary now.  When the President moved a similar motion on Friday last he said that, on the Vote for the Executive Council and on other Votes, we would have an opportunity for discussing all the motions standing in the names of private members, and that the Government had no intention and, certainly, no desire to burke discussion. I am suggesting that, quite obviously, it shows that the Government have no desire whatever to face up to this matter of having this motion discussed and brought to a conclusion in the House.  The motion, as far as I remember, was allowed to be opened <Col N="2200" /> by Deputy Norton, and since then we have heard no more about it.</P>
    <P>The President and the Vice-President and the members of the Labour Party know quite well&mdash;at least, they know better than I do&mdash;that the motion is more urgent and that there is more necessity for special steps to be taken now than there was when the motion was first put on the Order Paper.  I certainly would like the Government to give us some good reason as to why they are not prepared to provide at least an hour and a half to-night for a discussion on this very important matter. I am not prepared to go into the question of the urgency or necessity of the other motions on the Order Paper, but I am particularly concerned with the urgency of this motion, and I think we ought to get more than a mere bald statement from the Vice-President to the effect that they propose to take Private Members' time to-night.  I think that the Labour Party ought to insist on this motion being taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The postponement of the discussion on this motion to-night was done in agreement with the Labour Party for the purpose of facilitating other business and with the knowledge that this motion can be disposed of in the course of a couple of weeks. Deputy Morrissey, of course, is again in the grandfatherly role in this House that he has been enacting in the country lately.  He has been trying recently to give the impression to everybody in the country that he is the one person in the country who is really concerned with the trade union and labour movement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy opposite cannot do that, because he has no recollection.  As I was saying, what <Col N="2202" /> is being done to-night in connection with the taking of Private Members' time has been done in agreement with the Labour Party, and we have no apologies to offer to Deputies Morrissey or Mulcahy for our action in that respect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the unemployed are concerned, they have much more faith in this Party or in any other Party than in the Party opposite, because they made sure to kick that Party out in 1932 and again in 1933.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Granting that the people opposite have the greatest faith in the Labour Party, and assuming that there is no urgent necessity for discussing the motion standing in Deputy Norton's name, I would ask the Deputy to look further down and see the other motions that are on the Order Paper.  Will he the Deputy tell the county councils of this country and the ratepayers of this country&mdash;the farmers and the business people&mdash;that there is no urgent necessity for discussing, say, the motion down on the Order Paper as No. 15?  There is a motion standing there in the names of Deputies O'Higgins and O'Donovan to the effect:</P>
      <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that owing to the increasing distress of the farming community arising out of the continuance of the economic war, the Executive Council should take steps to relieve agricultural land of rates during the financial year 1934-35.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Did it not occur to Deputy Norton that, before agreeing to support the Government in taking Private Members' time, he should consult Deputies O'Higgins and O'Donovan, or did he think of the position in some of the counties, and even in his own County Kildare, where the county councils are now dealing with the financial business for the year and assessing their rate and where the position is such that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health has to get up and say that he will promise them £300,000 more?  We find that that £300,000 is not going to be applied to the relief <Col N="2203" /> of rates.  Under No. 15 on the Order Paper alone, there is a very urgent matter to be discussed and I think that the workers throughout the country will not thank the Deputy for entering into an agreement to take Private Members' time for Government business to-night without consulting other Deputies who are at least equally close to the position of things in the country, and who have motions on the Order Paper which require to be dealt with and upon which a decision should be given at the earliest possible time.  We were in the position last year as regards the rates question, that two long-distance Ministerial speakers talked a motion over November, December and January that ought to have been decided before the rates were struck in the beginning of the year.  Are we to be in the position now, by the type of action in which Deputy Norton acquiesces to-day, that we will be discussing No. 15 some time in November and December?  I submit that it shows a great want of consideration, both for the other private members in the House and for the condition of the people in the country, for Deputy Norton to take the action he proposes to take of supporting the Government in taking Private Members' time.</P>

      <P>If they cast their minds back, the gentlemen on the Front Bench opposite, and I think Deputy Morrissey ought to remember that at this time of the year it has been the practice to give Private Members' time very rarely when the Estimates and other financial business are coming on.  Unless the matter was very urgent it has been the custom very rarely to give time for private business to be discussed.  Of course, one must understand that both Deputy Morrissey and Deputy Mulcahy, to use a common expression, must do their stuff.  It is the normal thing to expect.</P>

      <P>Of course Deputy Norton, to quote the Vice-President, has done his stuff.  He has asked a question concerning cheap meat.  That is the stuff to give them.  But Deputy Norton does not realise that agricultural labour has to be employed to produce this meat which, if sold under the cost of production, must reduce the wage of the agricultural labourer down to an uneconomic wage.</P>

      <P>It is quite true that at this time of the year public business is not usually interrupted.  But it is also true to say that the Dáil is supposed to meet each week on Wednesday and continue in session until Friday.  We have had some early adjournments, because the Government were not ready with their business. Apart from the time wasted in lengthy adjournments such as these, we have had a waste of time on the part of Ministers, Parliamentary Secretaries and so on.  We had a discussion here a short time ago in which the President took nearly three hours to deal with a matter which could be compressed into half an hour.  If there is a waste of time by Ministers or members opposite they cannot complain if Deputies who see resolutions appearing on the Order Paper for a long time think some opportunity ought to be given for their discussion.  The question is whether or not the Opposition or the people who put down these resolutions are being fairly treated.  I submit that, in all the circumstances, there has not been fair treatment given, that there has been a deliberate crowding out of these matters on the part of the Ministry or their supporters in order to prevent discussion of them.  If there were fair treatment accorded in connection with these matters we could guarantee that the Government would be treated generously when the financial business comes on.</P>

      <P>I can quite understand the anxiety of a Government to get through its own particular business during any given session.  I have a good deal of sympathy with the attitude taken up by the Vice-President, but I should like to have the position clarified somewhat.  First of all, I must express amazement at the complete want of consistency on the part of the Labour Party, who taught me that the business of an Opposition was to oppose.  That was the negative policy adopted then.  I feel now that they are doing something positive, because they are enabling the Government to get through their business, and if there is a division on this matter <Col N="2206" /> I will vote with that Party&mdash;not because I believe in the Party as represented by Deputy Norton, because they are finished.  I want, however, to have the position clarified in this respect. I am prepared to give the Government time, and if a vote is taken I will vote in favour of giving them time.</P>
      <P>I should like, however, to refer to what the President said a few days ago.  Amongst other things he stated that Deputies would have an opportunity of discussing most of the things contained in the various motions on the Order Paper in the names of private members.  My experience of the Chair indicates that if, for instance, any Deputy were to attempt to relate unemployment to some of the Votes and to bring in certain matters relating to unemployment into the discussion, the Chair would very naturally rule that Deputy out of order.  I should like to have the position clarified in that respect so that we shall know where we are.  For instance, a statement was made in the course of a discussion some time ago by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance that the St. Vincent de Paul Society in Cork had no occasion to make a special appeal during this year for necessitous people.  I have a document to prove that a special appeal has been made.  I want to know clearly from the Chair whether the President's statement is correct in this regard when he said that I can discuss on the Votes at present on the Order Paper the matters to which these Private Members' motions refer. I want that position made clear before I go further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with this Department, I should like to raise a point as to the legality of a certain payment of £600,000 which has to be <Col N="2208" /> paid annually to the Board of Works by local authorities and I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to reassure the House with regard to his legal position in collecting that money. The money, I take it, is collected under the authority of Clause 5 of the Ultimate Financial Settlement between this country and Great Britain in respect of local loans outstanding on 1st April, 1926.  All the local loans were then funded or an agreement was come to with the British that instead of paying the debt on the basis of local loans, it should be liquidated in 20 years by annual payments of £600,000.  I have not had time to make an accurate test of one local authority and apply it all round as an average, but I should say that anywhere from 80 to 90 per cent., at least, of this money is raised by the rates of the county councils.  That £600,000, when collected, is paid over to the Board of Works.  The Board of Works, according to this agreement, was to be only the second collector, as it were, who was to pay it to somebody else and the passing on of that money to somebody else gave the Board of Works the authority to receive it themselves, but they have not passed that money on to somebody else.  In this case, they have not paid it to the British.  I am not finding fault with their not paying it to the British but I want to know what authority the Board of Works has for collecting it when they are not paying it to anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go into the details of a rating question on this but we had recently published a statement of arrears of rates for the year just ended and it is connected with rates. For the year ended 31st March last, the local rate was, roughly, £3,000,000. £2,000,000 was collected and we are told £1,000,000 was outstanding. It included this sum of £600,000 which was to be paid by the county councils on foot of a debt to be paid to somebody else in liquidation of that debt.  It has not been used for that purpose but has been included in this sum of £3,000,000 of rates and the collection of this money, I hold, was an illegal assessment when it was not being transmitted <Col N="2209" /> to the destination originally intended for it and to the destination intended by the authority under which the Board of Works claims it.  To collect this money, illegally, as I claim, the Gárdaí and the sheriffs&mdash;I do not know whether the military were used&mdash;were called in to seize people's cattle and to sell them at £1 apiece to blacklegs in Prussia Street. They had all the paraphernalia of the old evicting landlord, except the battering ram, around the homes of South Tipperary to collect this money, this illegal assessment.  The Parliamentary Secretary is an adept at justifying his position in other matters and he will probably attempt to be equally adept in justifying his attitude in this matter.</P>
    <P>Further, on this point, assuming that all this rate was legally and morally due and that there is a sum of £1,000,000 in arrears, here is a sum of £600,000, which was, I hold, an illegal and, certainly, an immoral assessment on the agricultural ratepayers of the country, which would pull down the £1,000,000 of alleged arrears to £400,000.  We have had a glimmer from the Vice-President of what is coming.  We have had an indication from him that the £300,000 of our money which the Government holds&mdash;and by our money, I mean the money of the local authorities&mdash;in respect of arrears of annuities from which grants to which the local authorities were legally entitled have been deducted and the Land Commission, in that manner, paid&mdash;is not coming back to its legal and rightful owners to be used by them in the ordinary course of their business for the easing of the position with regard to the rates.  It is going to be given over to them to reduce their overdrafts&mdash;to reduce the arrears of rates, I presume, and to help the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance to get his illegal £600,000. Nearly two years ago when our Government refused&mdash;I am not questioning their right to do it, or their wisdom in having done it&mdash;to pay England the moneys on foot of this Ultimate Financial Settlement, England said: &ldquo;Well, I will collect <Col N="2210" /> them,&rdquo; and England has set about collecting them.  Last week we had the unequivocal statement from the British Chancellor of the Exchequer in the House of Commons that he has collected those moneys.  He has collected every penny of them including this £600,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to have defined with as few words as possible, and without obscuring the issue, the legal authority of the Board of Works to collect this money.  Why should not the local authorities, in building up their estimates for the rates, exclude from their estimates this £600,000 which the Board of Works is taking from them, and which they are not utilising for the purpose for which it was given to them?  They are making revenue out of it; in fact, they are putting a special tax on the local authorities for money for the Central Fund.  I am not pleading that local authorities, which got loans from this Government or its predecessor and used the money for some purpose or other, should get out of their obligations. No local authority wants to get out of its obligations, notwithstanding all the accusations that have been levelled against them that they were in conspiracies not to pay rates.  There was not a word of truth in those <Col N="2213" /> allegations.  I do not know that the Parliamentary Secretary has a clean record on that either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>How does such record arise on this motion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chinn Comhairle, you probably have mistaken what I meant to convey.  What I meant to convey was that the Parliamentary Secretary often gave us a hint that there was a conspiracy not to pay rates.  It is that record I am referring to, and not any other.  I just wanted to give him this reminder.  Now we have the authority, unquestioned and unquestionable, that the British have got this £600,000; or otherwise they have foregone their claim to it.  If they have foregone their claim to it, what right has anybody to come in and demand it from us?  Either the British have collected it or they have not.  If they have not, they have not protected the British taxpayer.  The British Minister said in the British House of Commons that their job was to protect the British taxpayer, and that because of the default of the Free State Government the British taxpayer would lose nothing.  Those Minister have assured the British taxpayer in the House of Commons that not only has the British taxpayer lost nothing but that we have over-subscribed our default to the British.  In fact, coming near the end of the year, things were looking so brisk for the British that they had to stop us from sending over too much. They had to devise quotas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case I am making is that the British have got this £600,000.  I am not concerned at the moment with all they have got, but I want to emphasise that they have put up figures to show that they have got all they needed.  In no other way can I prove that they have got this £600,000. I cannot say that one bunch of cattle or anything else of that sort was taken and the £600,000 was lopped off for the purpose in that particular instance.  I can say, however, that all the British wanted to collect on foot of the debt arising out of this agreement, they have got.  I do not want any hair-splitting about this when the <Col N="2214" /> Parliamentary Secretary attempts to refute the case I am submitting.  I know he will only attempt it, because he cannot get away with it.  The sum the British say they want to collect against their claim is less than that indicated in this agreement.  I want to emphasise that the British taxpayer is concerned only with current expenditure.  Consequently, the special duties operate to collect on land purchase loans and local loans only the interest on those loans and not the sinking fund, so that the £4,500,000 collected by the British, though less than the paper claim under this agreement, includes all that the British taxpayer is liable for from year to year.  The difference is made up of various sinking funds with which the British are not concerned. I take it the £600,000 is an annual payment.  No part of it is a sinking fund; it is simply an annual payment and the original debt has been varied and consolidated at this amount.</P>
    <P>As far as the ratepayers are concerned, they have paid the British. Whether they liked it or not, they have honoured Section 5 of the agreement of 19th March, 1926.  They had to, because British Customs officers, acting as bailiffs so to speak, seized their goods.  While the British Customs officers were confiscating the butter from the South Tipperary creameries to the extent of 40 per cent., the Government, of which the Parliamentary Secretary is nearly a member, was seizing for the very same debt the furniture, the cattle and the famous Clonmel heifers down around South Tipperary and Waterford.  This money, although paid to the British, is still being collected by the local authorities and paid to the Board of Works.  The Board of Works are not paying it for the purpose for which this contribution was originally intended and therefore I hold that the Board of Works has no legal authority to collect this money.  The county councils would be quite within their right in refusing to strike a rate for this money because it is not going to its original destination and because the British have got it already.  I do not conspire in those things; I do not <Col N="2215" /> believe in conspiracies, I believe in doing things in the open and I am going to inform the Parliamentary Secretary that I have a motion down for consideration next Tuesday night at the Dublin County Council urging that the £600,000 be struck out of our estimates.</P>

Let me remind the Parliamentary Secretary that last year, in order to force the Dublin County Council to strike this illegal assessment, we were mandamused.  I would be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary will justify the collection of this money.  He and his Government have been champions in the matter of illegalities over the last 12 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to the necessity for the preservation of ancient monuments.  In the County of Meath there are many ancient monuments and, although the Act passed some years ago has gone some distance towards keeping those monuments in a state of preservation, in good order, occasionally it is found that some damage is caused through carelessness or otherwise.  I know of one case where some valuable stones with carvings on them were smashed.  They were, as a matter of fact, under lock and key.  It might seem that there was not sufficient supervision by the caretaker, but I do not think that any caretaker could overcome the difficulties that exist.  In many cases, where those valuable stones are loose, some steps should be taken to have them built into walls.  These stones that I have referred to are extremely valuable.  One was smashed into three pieces.  I think if it were built into a wall it could be preserved in that way. These stones were mentioned by O'Donovan in 1835.  It would be a calamity if they were allowed to disappear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">

    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite recently.  As regards old churchyards, in County <Col N="2216" /> Meath it is not possible, for one reason or another, for the county council to take charge of them.  There are three or four extremely ancient churchyards not under the control of any particular body which might be made amenable. It seems that because of tenure or something of that sort the county councils are unable to get control.  I think steps might be taken under the Ancient Monuments Act to take control of those places and preserve them.  I have three ancient churchyards in mind.  Visitors last year and the year before complained bitterly of the condition in which they found those places.  One is connected with Blessed Oliver Plunket, who may very soon be canonised. A great many visitors have come to see those places.  It was painful at all times to see the condition in which they were kept.  The real reason is that nobody seems to be able to get any control there.  The landlord is nominally in control but no effort is made to keep the place in a reasonable state of repair.  I think if it were possible that such places as these could be brought in under the Ancient Monuments Act they would be kept in better condition than they are.</P>
      <P>The next matter to which I wish to refer is the condition of Tara.  Some time ago I asked the Board of Works to put up some signposts there because visitors coming to see the place found themselves lost.  I suggested to the Board of Works to put up some signposts, and pointed out to them that there was nothing there to show that the place was Tara at all, nothing beyond the fingerpost pointing to Tara.  When you got up to the hill of Tara there was nothing to indicate the place, or to indicate the site of Tara itself.  Were it not for the fact that the visitors themselves had some idea of the place there was no one there to give them an account, or to tell them anything at all about Tara. There is nobody in charge.  The place is simply vested in the Board of Works and they have some kind of control of it.  A private gentleman owns the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the time has come when the National Government might reasonably consider taking some steps in this matter.  It would be only right that <Col N="2217" /> Tara should be acquired for the nation and kept and maintained for the nation.  Some authentic books should be written and made available in connection with the place.  Very few, except those well-versed in the history of Tara, know how far the site extends. I know that it extends very much further than the ordinary visitor believes.  It extends a good deal outside what is thought to be Tara.  Many people from other countries complained to me that when they got there they were completely lost, that they could get no information.  There are amateur guides there who could tell them some history about the place, a great deal of which may be true and some not true.  The time has approached when we might reasonably consider the steps to be taken which would ensure the purchase of places like Tara for the nation.</P>
    <P>The next question to which I wish to draw attention is the very serious grievance that exists over very many areas since the passing of the Drainage Maintenance Act of 1924.  This Act provided that the Commissioners of the Board of Works could send down inspectors to any of those old drainage schemes to satisfy themselves whether any changes or improvements were needed in that drainage area.  The control of these drainage schemes was originally vested in a number of trustees, but after the passing of the Act they became vested in the county councils.  That meant, of course, that the county councils were to be made the beasts of burden to collect the double charges, one arising out of the payments in connection with the carrying out of the work and the other out of maintenance.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately this change in legislation happened at a time when the Free State Army was being disbanded and when naturally there was a great deal of need for employment.  I know of three of these schemes which were promoted by the Board of Works inspectors simply for the purpose of giving employment.  They were schemes which were not necessary.  In one particular case the inspector thought he would change the whole course of the river, which would create <Col N="2218" /> a great improvement and be much better than the old scheme.  He succeeded in taking the flooding off land on which nobody lived and putting it on land on which people lived.  In North Meath a number of people planted trees and made their living by raising quicks. It takes three years to raise them.  The scheme carried out in these cases created flooding, the river overflowed its banks and that flooding did damage to the extent of £3,000.  Cases in connection with the matter have often been brought into the courts. The people asked the magistrates to look at the injuries done to the area by these floodings.  I was asked to go myself and have a look at the damage done.  In my opinion, this matter should be met just in about the same way as the expense in connection with the maintenance of the main roads is met.  A debt is contracted in the same way and it should be met in the same way.  This is really a hardship on the farmers.  I wish to make a plea to the Parliamentary Secretary to set up machinery to consider this question. These schemes were carried out largely for the sake of giving employment to the soldiers who were disbanded in 1924.  It is tough luck on the farmers that they should be asked now to pay for the whole of it.  The expense should be spread all over the county.  Cases of this kind are coming up constantly in the courts.  The farmers make a plea to the magistrates, who can do nothing in the matter.  I would be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary would set up some machinery to consider these things.  There are two charges, one for the work and one for the maintenance, and the charge for the maintenance is a great deal.</P>

      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to a question in connection with the administration of the unemployment schemes.  These schemes have been absorbing a lot of unemployed and giving a good deal of work.  I <Col N="2219" /> would like to see them administered fairly and well.  A good deal of dissatisfaction has been caused by an abuse of the methods of recruiting labour in the country.  First of all, there was the difficulty that some unemployed people had about signing up in the labour exchanges.  People signed on for some time but not being accustomed to this thing they discontinued signing.  Others who were more astute continued signing and even continued signing up when they were in employment.  Then when a job turned up those who had been on the live register got work to the detriment and exclusion of people who had so far got no employment.  This sort of thing was a great abuse of the regulations because it was robbing the legitimate workers of their turn at employment.  I, personally, like a good many others, was anxious to get some of the too clever people brought to book but it is difficult to get information against a particular man who abuses the regulations in that way.  I advised several people to get particulars of those cases, but the information was not forthcoming. Eventually I succeeded in getting a general complaint made by the Secretary of the Labour Party in Abbeyfeale, in connection with two men who had been in employment and continued signing on at the exchange.  Immediately they became unemployed they got work on a relief scheme.  An inquiry was to be held, but when a further list came out these two men were still retained pending the inquiry by the Gárda.  When the first job was completed these men continued on.  The complaint was eventually investigated by the Gárda. As far as my information carries me, they carefully avoided visiting the houses of previous employers of those people.  Everything was done above board, but the only recompense given to the people was that we were told an inquiry had been held.  But the scheme was then finished and the report of the inquiry has never yet been communicated to those concerned. A letter was written to the President and to Mr. Lemass, the Minister for <Col N="2220" /> Industry and Commerce.  I have seen the reply sent back.  It conveys actually nothing.  I have since written to the Minister but have not got the courtesy of an acknowledgment. I could get no information as to how this inquiry was carried out. I should have been entitled at least to be told the result of the inquiry and how it failed to get justice for the men concerned.</P>
      <P>I fear that if the Department are not sincere and are not determined to insist on having their regulations carried out in their entirety, it will be difficult to avoid the abuses of overlapping and the causing of additional grievances and friction.  The minor relief schemes are doing very useful work, but that is all the more reason that the regulations should be insisted upon in carrying out these schemes.  I am quoting this particular case for the guidance of the Parliamentary Secretary, and I should be thankful if he would look into the matter and see that the necessary steps are taken to see that these abuses will not be allowed to continue.</P>

      <P>There is one matter on this Vote to which I should like to refer.  Although it is a local matter, it is important.  I should like to get from the Parliamentary Secretary some information as to the attitude of the Board of Works at present towards the drainage of the Nenagh river.  That matter has been before the Board of Works for some years and, as I say, while it is a local matter, it is very important.  I think that the Parliamentary Secretary can be informed by his officials that it is one of the most important rivers, from the point of view of drainage, that we have in Munster.  The estimated cost of the first scheme was pretty large, and I want to say, quite frankly, that I think the Government and the Department concerned went a considerable way to meet the local people in the matter.  However, the cost was so high that even the very substantial grant offered by the Government was not sufficient to induce the farmers <Col N="2221" /> and the other people concerned to go on with the scheme.</P>
      <P>As the Parliamentary Secretary, I am sure, knows, or as he can be informed by his Department, there are, I think, some thousands of acres of land which are flooded annually by this river and flooded over a very long period.  The matter is aggravated, of course, by the fact that the river passes through the town of Nenagh. From the sanitary point of view it is very important, because the sewerage of that town, I am sorry to say, is of a rather primitive type and when the flooding takes place in winter time the sewage is brought all over the place and very close to houses occupied by working men.  I should like to know whether the Department has dropped the scheme altogether, or is considering any alternative scheme, or whether there is any hope of anything being done in the matter.  I should like to know also whether the charges proposed to be put on the occupiers of the lands that were proposed to be benefited under the last scheme that was submitted could not be reconsidered. We had in certain areas a charge as low as half-a-crown per annum, whereas in and close to the town itself the charges went as high, I think, as 25/- and 26/- per acre.  I think it will be admitted that a charge of 25/- or 26/- for a drainage rate is absolutely out of the question.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would be good enough, when replying, to say what is the attitude of his Department towards that scheme.</P>

      <P>I have only a few words to say on this Vote.  I did not think that we would have a discussion on the economic war in connection with this Vote.  Deputy Belton spoke about £600,000, in respect of local loans, which, he said, should not be collected when their destination would not be across the water.  It appears that the notion over there is that we in this country have no longer authority to collect anything unless that money is sent over across the water to England. I think there was no justification for that attack on the part of Deputy Belton, and no wonder the sky darkened when he spoke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2222" /> Before coming to a few matters which affect the welfare of my own constituency, I should like to congratulate the Office of the Board of Works on its efficiency for the past 18 months, especially that section dealing with minor relief schemes.  Every time that we put up proposals to them for the carrying out of works of public utility, such as bog roads and things of that nature, our proposals always met with sympathetic consideration. I should like, in passing, to give expression to the hope that there will be a continuance of those relief schemes, especially as far as the turbary areas of this country are concerned. In my native county there are still vast tracts of turbary that are as yet inaccessible.  Even, in some cases, people who have turbary from the Land Commission have to buy turf elsewhere when they cannot get access to their own.  That is why I give expression to the hope that there will be a continuance of such schemes and that they will be continued increasingly for the future.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested from the opposite benches also that in the administration of these relief schemes an attitude of partisanship has been adopted.  Some of the Cork Deputies spoke on the last day in connection with that and they repudiated the assertion absolutely.  I must also say, speaking on behalf of Kerry, that I have never seen anything like partisanship or an attitude of victimisation towards our political opponents in connection with this work.  As a matter of fact, the contrary has been the case.</P>
    <P>There is one question of vital importance to Kerry, and especially to North Kerry, that I would like to bring to the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary, and that is the question of the drainage of the Brick and Cashen.  Of course, I do not expect the Parliamentary Secretary to be in a position to give a full answer to my question to-day, because I expect that the scheme, on account of its magnitude, would require a lot more time than is at the disposal of the Parliamentary Secretary to-day.</P>
    <P>However, I would like to point out that the question of the drainage of <Col N="2223" /> the Brick and Cashen has been in the offing for the past ten years.  I was just looking over some of the Dáil reports and I saw that questions were asked in the House in regard to that scheme as far back as 1926.  Seeing that this scheme was discussed both in the House and outside it nearly a decade of years ago, I would be inclined to come to the conclusion that the time is now at hand when the engineers, engaged in the work of surveying and investigation down there, would be in a position to give us a definite reply as to whether the work is going to go ahead or not.  I know well, of course, that the work is complicated, but however complicated it may be, the investigations must come to an end some time, and I should like to point out that there are thousands of acres of land involved in this drainage scheme.  Perhaps some time when the Parliamentary Secretary has the time, he may be able to make a tour around that district, and he will see a huge lake before his eyes in that particular locality.  There is another matter which I should like to bring to the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary and that is a grievance of the people of Bannow, near Ardfert.  Complaints have been made to me that the sand along that coast has been drifting in over the holdings of the people to an enormous extent lately.  It was suggested to me that the erection of a paling or a wall of some kind would prevent the recurrence of such damage. If there is an engineer available in that district I hope he will be asked to see if anything can be done towards remedying that condition of affairs.  I again wish to congratulate the officers of the Board of Works on their efficiency during the last two years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFinlay" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary with regard to the river Gully in Leix.  The work on this river was done some four or five years ago.  The Leix County Council has to collect the rate for that drainage and deputations have come before that council several times asking for some relief in connection with the charge. Of course the council have not the <Col N="2224" /> authority to make any reduction.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider the matter of the payments which these farmers have to make. Some of them have to pay as much as £13 per annum and at the present time that is a lot of money.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, owing to the present conditions, it is an impossibility for those farmers to pay this excessive rate.  Some three or four months ago I came here on a deputation from those farmers which was told that the matter would be considered, but I have heard nothing about it since.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to see, at any rate, that the sheriff will not be allowed to make seizures from these people.  It is the duty of the county council, of course, to collect this money, but I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to request the county council not to press these people and, if possible, to give them some grant out of this Vote to help them to meet this charge.  In the present conditions, as I say, it is an impossibility for these people to pay this charge and at the same time pay their rates and annuities.  I shall not stress the matter further, but as I know these people to be in distress, I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to come to their aid.</P>

      <P>So far as the relief works in Kerry are concerned, the different schemes are working out in a satisfactory manner.  They could not have been carried out in a fairer or better way than they have been under the supervision of the Parliamentary Secretary.  There are one or two points I should like to stress with regard to relief schemes in the congested districts.  Some time ago I suggested the allocation of a grant for the inauguration of a scheme for the supplying of lime in those districts. While the scheme I suggested might look more or less a commercial one, at the same time I think it would be a hundred times better than any ordinary relief scheme because it would be the means of supplying lime at a very moderate cost over a very wide area.  That would be better than any temporary relief work, if I might put it that way, in that particular <Col N="2225" /> district.  I would again press on the Parliamentary Secretary that, if at all possible, he should consider the question of allocating money for the inauguration of a scheme for opening lime kilns in areas where land would be practically valueless if lime were not made available at a moderate cost.  I should also like to draw attention to the Maine Drainage scheme, which has been reported on. I have had an opportunity of examining the report and to my mind the estimated cost is exorbitant because the area of charge will be limited.  I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary should ask the inspectors to go into the matter again and see if the expenditure could not be spread over a wider area, as that is the only way in which it can be made an economic scheme and work out satisfactorily both for the Board of Works and for the local authority.  Speaking generally, as I say, the relief schemes in our part of the country have worked out very satisfactorily and have been of great benefit to the people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether it is the considered policy of his Department whenever they have a house to let to invite applications from people and give it to the highest bidder.  In my opinion it is not right that the Board of Works should put themselves in the position of extorting excessive rents from people who, perhaps, are not in a position to pay high rents but who, owing to the fact that they are very badly off for housing accommodation, are sometimes forced to offer to pay a rent above what they can afford and which the house is not worth.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to say whether or not that is the practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the question of the military barracks at Dundalk. I think that I could almost fill a cart, or, at least, the well-hole of one of the cars belonging to the Dublin jarvies of whom my friend, Deputy Kelly, spoke so sympathetically, and rightly so, last week, with the correspondence that has passed between the Parliamentary Secretary and the Dundalk <Col N="2226" /> Urban Council.  It is a very large volume of correspondence, extending over the last few years, and when one considers the absolute necessity for housing accommodation at the present time, particularly in the area in which the barracks is situated, it is very difficult to understand the attitude of the Board of Works in regard to the disposal of these buildings.  I can quite appreciate the sympathy bestowed by certain societies on the wild birds of the air in providing sanctuaries along our sea-coast for them, but I cannot understand the solicitude shown by the Board of Works at the moment for such birds as jackdaws and sparrows. These fine buildings provide at the moment a very comfortable home for jackdaws.  I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary knows what a jackdaw is, but it is not a very prepossessing bird.  It is a very healthy type of bird and I think it could do with less accommodation than is provided for it at present.</P>
    <P>These building were formerly the married quarters attached to the military barracks in which were housed the families of married members of the Army.  They are a very fine property; they are stoutly built, with fine fronts of punched stone and with very nice brick coigns.  The rooms are very healthy, the ceilings being high, and most up-to-date annexes were built about 20 years ago which have added greatly to the letting value and comfort of these buildings, of which, I think, there would be about 24 altogether.</P>
    <P>The urban council, time and again, have, through the medium of correspondence and numerous deputations, raised the question of this property but they have made absolutely no headway.  I am very sorry to say that it is the opinion of the members of the council that the Parliamentary Secretary is most unsympathetic towards the point of view put forward by their members in regard to the handing over of this property.  In the immediate vicinity of these houses, there is a very large space which would be very useful for building purposes, and there also exist in the same area some very fine buildings which were formerly known as the <Col N="2227" /> officers' quarters, and adjoining these there is another excellent building which at the moment is in a very dilapidated condition, due to certain alterations that took place during the civil war, and if it was for no other reason than to wipe out the memory of those years, I think the Parliamentary Secretary should lose no time in coming to some definite understanding with the Urban Council of Dundalk in connection with the disposal of this property.</P>
    <P>I understand that there is at the moment a question of price involved. The Parliamentary Secretary has put a certain value on those buildings and on the land, but surely, in view of the fact that the Government is advancing from the General Fund 66? per cent. of the annual loan charges on houses built by public authorities to get rid of slums and pays also from the General Fund 33? per cent. in respect of other types of houses and gives, in addition, very big grants, ranging from £70 to £80, to private people who build houses, one can come to no other conclusion but that the Board of Works should immediately hand over this property for nothing to the urban council.  It would save the Government in the matter of providing accommodation for people at present living in slum areas and whose houses have to be condemned before new houses can be built for them.  Surely, from that point of view alone&mdash;the saving to the national Exchequer&mdash;this property should forthwith be handed over to the urban district council for conversion into housing accommodation for the workers in that area.</P>
    <P>Another point to which I would draw the Parliamentary Secretary's attention is that in the barrack itself, as the Parliamentary Secretary may know, there is a very successful boot factory established.  It employs, I am glad to say, from 400 to 500 workers, young and old.  There is very little housing accommodation for those workers in that area and most of them have to travel long distances.  I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should not take my word <Col N="2228" /> but go down and inspect the place for himself.  After all, inspection is much better than letterwriting or deputations and he will see for himself that what I have put to him is substantially correct.  I hope that having drawn his attention to this matter there will be some definite understanding come to between the Urban Council of Dundalk and the officials of the Board of Works.  I may also state that Dundalk has always been in the forefront with the regard to the provision of housing accommodation for its people and I know that they feel this matter very much, in view of the efforts they have made during the past five or six years to have proper houses built for the people of the town.</P>
    <P>In connection with relief schemes, I think, without any display of egotism, that I may say that the Deputies from Louth do not give the Parliamentary Secretary or his Department very much trouble.  We do not vie with each other as to who will get the credit for the schemes, nor do we take much interest in the people who get the work, and because of that fact I should like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary what is the actual procedure before relief schemes are put into operation.  Does he send down inspectors to inspect the schemes or does he ask for the advice and opinion of the county secretary, which would be a very wise proceeding?  I do not want to speak politically, but would the schemes put up, say, by secretaries of political clubs on both sides be considered?  Would I, as a Deputy representing the county, be entitled to take a scheme, say, put up to me by a deputation of people living along the road and send it on to the Board of Works?  Would that be considered in a favourable manner?</P>

      <P>There are several of those schemes which have been sent to me, and as far as I know, although I have sent them on, they bore no fruit.  I can quite understand that there would be a reason for that. Probably all the money that was voted in the last Vote had already been allocated to schemes which were sent on before those in my name reached <Col N="2229" /> the Board of Works.  There is one local scheme which, like the military barracks housing scheme, has been the subject of very great correspondence between the Department and the council, and that is the Rampart river.  I am sure the engineers of the Board of Works know something about that.  To carry out the work as originally intended would provide many engineering difficulties.  However, I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will not lose sight of the position of that river, because in a period of abnormal rainfall it overflows its banks, and is the subject of great trouble and annoyance to the people who live in the immediate vicinity of the river.  There is another and even more important aspect of the situation, and that is that the breweries known as the Cambricville Breweries are in the same vicinity, and are subject to very great annoyance from the flooding of this river.  I am told by the manager there that during some few weeks back, when the rainfall was very abnormal and continuous, there was great anxiety that possibly the brewery would not be able to carry on its malting operations, as it is built on a low site, and the water from the river has a very injurious effect on it. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will give instructions to his engineers, and that they will again inspect this river, so as to ascertain whether or not anything can be done to prevent the losses and inconveniences that have been occasioned by its overflowing its banks, as it did some few years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think I have very much more to say, except to congratulate the Board of Works in regard to the minor relief schemes that have been carried out in the county.  Those schemes have been the means of providing very large improvements for the people of the areas in which they have been carried out.  As regards the procedure adopted in the giving of employment, I am happy to state that there has been very little grievance on that head, as far as I know.  I hope that happy state of affairs will continue. I want again to emphasise what I stated to the Parliamentary <Col N="2230" /> Secretary, especially in regard to the military barracks.  I am very keen on that.  Members of the urban council are very keen on it, and, in fact, the people of the town are very keen on having that question dealt with one way or another.  It is really an eyesore to have such fine buildings going to loss, especially in view of the fact that they could be put to such good use in providing proper housing accommodation for the people who are in need of it.</P>

      <P>In connection with those schemes I should like to refer to what I might describe as a hardy annual.  For many years, on the Vote for Public Works and also by questions, we have been endeavouring to get something done with the Dromore drainage.  It was suggested by a Deputy some time ago that the money spent on calculations alone would have gone a long way towards relieving the flooding.  Up to the present, as far as I know, nothing has been done.  It is really a sanitary matter.  Happily last year the lower rainfall favoured it, but where we have a normal rainfall the flooding is very extensive.  One does not need to go into details as to how unpleasant that is.  Some miles out towards the borders of Cavan and Monaghan there is a tremendous acreage of meadows, which is continuously flooded when there is any considerable rainfall.  I understand the Board of Works contemplated going to Lough Erne for that scheme, but we in County Monaghan, at any rate, would like to have something done.  We should be glad to hear that the scheme has been furthered, or that any progress has been made in the matter.</P>

      <P>I should like to endorse the compliments which have been paid to the Board of Works in this discussion.  There are a few matters to which I wish to draw attention in the interests of my constituents. We have in Kilkenny a disused military barracks with married quarters attached.  While the Corporation are doing a good deal to solve the housing problem it must be remembered that the rents we have had to charge are <Col N="2231" /> beyond the reach of a good many people&mdash;such people as old men or women whose only income is the old age pension.  Recently the Corporation made a proposal to the Office of Public Works to take over those married quarters, as they are called, and let them at rents of 1/6 per week to people of the old age pension class.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to use his good offices to facilitate the Corporation in this direction.  I am quite sure the Office of Public Works does not want to make a profit out of these buildings.  They will admit that it would be much better to have them occupied by those poor people, than to have them idle as they have been for a number of years under the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  There is also the matter of the proposed drainage of a river called the King's River in Callan in County Kilkenny.  I understand the proposed scheme would be too costly, and that the county council would not be able to provide the 50 per cent. contribution.  It has been suggested to me that a scheme of cleaning could be carried out at a very small cost, and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to look into that matter with a view to making a grant for the cleaning of that river.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with the building of national schools, there is one very bad case in the County Kilkenny, which has been the source of agitation for a long time, namely, Boolyglass National School.  I do not think I could find words to describe the appalling conditions in that school.  I understand that at last plans for a new school have reached the Office of Public Works, and I hope they will be attended to with all possible speed.  I do not think there is another case of such urgency in the State.  We have in Kilkenny City a portion of the old city wall.  I would like to know if it would be possible to have this wall made safe or some grant given to the local authority to have the old wall taken away.  We have had the opinion of the borough engineer recently on the subject.  The <Col N="2232" /> street there is very narrow, being about nine feet wide and the wall is about 25 feet high.  It is very dangerous from the point of view of the residents on the other side of the street and, being an old monument, I wondered if anything could be done to make it safe.</P>

The Nore drainage is an important matter and I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to review his decision and see whether he would be inclined to increase the State contribution a little more.

      <P>I think they will change their minds now and I am glad to have that statement from the Parliamentary Secretary.  As regards the minor relief schemes, I am glad to say that wherever they were carried out in County Kilkenny the money was spent usefully.  Unfortunately, we have a good deal of unemployment amongst agricultural workers.  I know that in some places it is not possible to get such work as the cleaning of drains and streams, the widening of lanes, etc., but I think a grant might be made for some particular work in every district where there is unemployment amongst the agricultural labourers. I believe the minor relief schemes are mainly for the relief of unemployment amongst agricultural labourers.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="2233" /> to have the grants in Carlow and Kilkenny more widely distributed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to direct attention to the need for proceeding as soon as possible with drainage schemes in County Cavan.  I know there are complaints from all over the county in relation to flooding.  There were schemes passed by the County Council as far back as 1926 and 1927 and, beyond the maps prepared by the engineers, not a thing has been done in connection with them.  There are some minor schemes in connection with the River Erne and work might be begun on them.  There is one large scheme at Belturbet.  To the west of Belturbet large areas of land are ruined.  Along that area the unemployment is rather serious.  The Parliamentary Secretary can verify that if he looks up the list of names registered at the Belturbet exchange.  I believe the same condition of things applies to other parts of the county. Several drainage schemes have been approved for a number of years but no one seems to know why they have been held up.  At one time it was within the power of the County Council to carry out minor drainage schemes without having recourse to the Department, but I believe that is not the case now and all these minor schemes have to be carried out by the Board of Works.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will give us some information as to why these schemes have been held up.</P>
      <P>I would like to mention in particular the Brackley lake scheme which has been approved for the last seven or eight years.  The County Council did not go on with the work because they were waiting for the major scheme lower down on the bed of the river to be first attended to.  There is no reason why that particular scheme should be held up because there is a drop of something like 25 feet.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to expedite all those works.  If those schemes could be undertaken soon it would tend to relieve the unemployment that unfortunately seems to be growing every day.  The farmers are complaining bitterly about their lands being flooded.</P>

      <P>I would like to point out that Sligo has not benefited very much through the relief grants.  If there is any money to be distributed by the Government, I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will consider the claims of County Sligo.  There is no doubt there are many people unemployed down there.  I have drawn the attention of the Board of Works to several schemes that might well be undertaken.  For instance, as regards Kilmactranny bog, a lot of the people in the locality have applied to have the bog drained.  As regards the bog at Mount Irwin, representations have been made for the construction of a road.  Some two years ago a sum of £100 was spent on the construction of a road at Carrickbanagher, but the work was not completed and if it is not completed it might have been just as well to throw the £100 to the winds.  No doubt Sligo has got some portion of the relief grants, but in certain districts they have not got what they should get.  In the town of Ballymote there are a lot of people unemployed and they have no opportunity of earning money.  There might be something granted there for the making of roads or the drainage of bogs.  In portions of South Sligo there was very little money distributed, and in North Sligo there were many complaints that the districts there did not get a fair share of the relief grants.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will give sympathetic consideration to the claims of County Sligo.</P>

      <P>I am quite satisfied, from a very careful investigation of the position, that Sligo got last year and this year all that it was entitled to get. I am perfectly satisfied about that and <Col N="2235" /> I may say that I have that information as a result of very careful calculations. Deputy McGovern referred to schemes in County Cavan and asked why they were not being carried out.  A large number of the Cavan schemes are included in the Erne scheme, which is going to cost about £64,750.  There were a large number of other schemes submitted by the county council and the Deputy may take it that the Cavan schemes are having full attention. Deputy Pattison mentioned the Kilkenny military barracks.  That question will have further sympathetic consideration. As regards the King's River, I am not satisfied that we can say the King's River will be done, but the matter will be looked into.  As regards the national school case, I understand that is bad.  It is being considered now by the Education Department and we have the plans. The Deputy did not specify that particular national monument to the extent to which I would be able to identify it. I know Kilkenny fairly well.</P>

      <P>As regards the Nore drainage, a very representative and very reasonable deputation came up from Kilkenny some years ago.  We went into four alternative schemes for the Nore.  These were fully and completely investigated and every possible effort was made to meet those who required the work to be done. Eventually, we came down to the most practical scheme, which is unattractive, and that was one of about £90,000.  I offered to recommend the Minister for Finance to make a grant of 50 per cent. for that scheme. That is the most that has ever been made for any scheme.  That is the difficulty.  The very first time that we make a breach on that wall of 50 per cent. there is nothing to stop us from going to 60, 70, 80 or 90 per cent. There is to be no stop then.  However, a fair offer was made to the people <Col N="2236" /> interested in that scheme.  I am speaking now with full knowledge of the question and I do not hold out personally much hope of any increase being made on that offer.</P>
      <P>Deputy Haslett raised the question of the Dromore scheme.  He raised something else as well.  He said the money spent on calculations would be enough to do the scheme.  I hardly think so.  The estimate of that scheme is between £20,000 and £30,000 and I am perfectly sure we have not spent anything like that amount on calculations. Calculations made in the Board of Works are for the purpose of saving money.  I will give the House later an outline of some of the schemes put up and Deputies will see how little ground there is for the suggestion that the Board of Works is holding up drainage schemes.  For the particular scheme in Dromore I will submit a proposal to the Minister for Finance that he should make a grant of 50 per cent. of the cost.  Two county councils, Cavan and Monaghan, are to be asked between them to pay 43 per cent. of the cost of the scheme.  Those two added together make 93 per cent. of the cost.  The balance of seven per cent. represents the ascertained value of the improvement of the land due to that particular scheme.  In other words, the Dromore scheme is 93 per cent. uneconomic. That is the scheme which we accepted and put forward to the Minister for Finance.  I think the House will recognise that when a scheme of that kind is capable of being put forward the schemes which we have rejected would take a great deal to justify.</P>
      <P>It was Deputy Coburn who spoke of the Rampart river.  That has been considered from every possible angle but no scheme that is practicable has yet been put forward.  I have had that matter on my desk 15 times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flynn spoke of the lower part of the River Maine drainage scheme.  The portion of the river for which a petition has been received would cost £37,000 and would benefit 2,050 acres: that is a cost of about £18 per acre which is altogether too much. The full scheme would cost £47,650 and would benefit 3,400 acres, which would mean about £14 an acre, which is <Col N="2237" /> also too high.  Each of these schemes would require a grant of 103 per cent. of the cost.  In other words, the benefit derivable from the scheme would not be enough to pay for the cost of maintenance. Personally I do not hold out much hope of getting those particular schemes put into operation.</P>
    <P>I should like to assure the Deputies concerned that those schemes are not rejected without very careful consideration. I think Deputy Coburn would recognise that the money spent on calculations is very well spent money.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coburn wants to know the particular method by which schemes for relief works are dealt with.  He wants to know whether they come forward from individual Deputies or otherwise. They can come forward from anybody who chooses to send them forward so long as they send them in the form in which we can identify them.  Those schemes are scheduled in the area to which they belong and periodically we send out inspectors to go down and inspect the job on the ground.  In relation to these schemes inspectors are required to answer some 20 very specific and definite questions.  From the information which we get on that particular form we are able to see whether or not a particular scheme should be put into operation and to what extent it should get priority.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coburn was also worried in relation to cottages and the rents which we get from them.  There is an illusion that the Board of Works is a sort of philanthropic institution, that it is an institution that has been given a whole lot of property and that we can do what we like with that property.  Unfortunately, the property is not ours to give away.  We have certain very definite responsibilities and very definite rules in relation to cottages and so on.  We are bound to advertise them and see that we are getting a reasonable price for them.  The question of the military barracks was raised and it was suggested that the married quarters be handed over for the purpose of housing.  I should like gratefully to acknowledge the fact that Deputy Coburn has put in a nutshell the point of view of the average person <Col N="2238" /> who comes along asking for Government property.  He says that he thinks it should be handed over for nothing. That is generally the estimate of the value on Government property.  It is the general attitude of mind in relation to the property which we hold in trust &mdash;that is that it is of no value whatever. The mere fact that it is not in immediate use means that it should be handed over.</P>
    <P>In practice, we put an estimate on the property held by the Board of Works.  We have professional valuers whose business it is to know the value of the property.  We are bound to take the advice of these valuers.  These valuers put a value upon that property and then we attempt to get something approximating to that value.  If we have to go below that value we have very stringent regulations to deal with. In certain cases we would have to come here to the House for a Supplementary Estimate to enable us to let below a certain value.  The House will be familiar with cases in which that has been done.  For instance, our value on certain property is £100 a year, but for a specific purpose it is desired to let that at £80; we would have to come to the Dáil with a Supplementary Estimate of the capitalised value of the difference between the £100 and £80. There is no property that we have that we are not anxious to let, but there is no property in our possession which we are privileged to hand over to anybody for nothing.  The offer made by the Dundalk Urban Council was not a reasonable offer, in our opinion.  If they will make a reasonable offer, we shall be most glad to deal with it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coburn also, very wisely, I think, raised the issue which is in his mind.  He said that, if the State is paying somewhere about 66? per cent. of the rent of houses for the purpose of housing, therefore, they ought to hand over any other property they have for housing.  That is exactly my argument why they should not.  If the State has decided, as it has decided, to spend somewhere about £3,200,000 this year on housing, and has done that with the knowledge and with the authority of the Dáil, we in the Board of Works are bound to assume that they knew what <Col N="2239" /> they were doing and that that was the nature of the subsidy they wanted to give.  We have neither authority nor right to give hidden subsidies in other ways.  It arises continually that we are asked to hand over our property at an unreasonable rent.  If we have a value on a certain property, and a local council wants it for a tenth of that value, which is fairly approximate to some of the actual experiences I have had, it simply means that the Board of Works is asked to go outside the authority of the Dáil and give an additional subsidy for housing or works of that kind.  We have no authority and we have no right, nor have we any intention to do it.  Within those limits, we are anxious to let our property, and we shall be glad to give the most sympathetic consideration to any offer that is put up.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kissane raised the question of the Brick and Cashen.  It is estimated to cost £115,000 and will require a free grant of 88 per cent.  In other words, the actual improved value of the land, when the drainage is done, will be 12 per cent. of the total cost.  In addition to that, as Deputy Kissane said, the question is complicated in other ways.  The valuation is in hand and will be proceeded with as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey raised the question of the Nenagh river.  This scheme was estimated to cost £34,000.  It has been exhibited already to the local occupiers, but rejected by a majority of them.  In other words, they were not prepared to pay their proportion of the cost which was represented by the actual, ascertained, improved value of the land. Requests for a modified scheme have been refused.  The Deputy also raised the question of the high valuation of some land.  There are some very small areas, in the immediate vicinity of the town of Nenagh, which have been valued for as high as £1, but the average assessment is about 5/3.  A fresh petition would be required before a modified scheme could be prepared, but I doubt if such a scheme would be effective It would be better either to do the whole job or leave it alone.  The suggestion that there is a <Col N="2240" /> lot of guesswork about the assessment is entirely wrong.  It has been done with great care, and is open for examination when the time comes.  The total grants in this case would be 67½ per cent.  In other words, the improved value of the land would be, after paying for maintenance roughly speaking, a third of the total cost.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin raised the question of a place called, I think, Crowdrummin Pass.  He said that this was a scheme which would only benefit one person.  He also informed us that, to the best of his recollection, he had brought that matter to the attention of the Board of Works.  In fact, no such complaint has reached the Board of Works in regard to the scheme, and the original report of our inspector, who was down there, does not bear out what Deputy MacEoin says.  I take it, of course, that he is speaking quite sincerely, but the testimony is to the contrary.  We will have the actual facts reviewed in view of the statement made by Deputy MacEoin, with a view to examining into the conflict between his statement and the report.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keyes raised the question of individuals who remained on the register after they had got employment and who, to that extent, were liable to do damage to those who were genuinely unemployed.  He also mentioned the difficulty of bringing those cases home, owing to the fact that people were not prepared to come forward and give testimony.  He said also that in a particular case, in which he had succeeded in bringing forward that evidence, it had been sent through the local employment office and that he had not received any satisfactory report.  I shall make it my business immediately to enquire into the circumstances of that case and shall inform Deputy Keyes of the result of my enquiries.  I can only say now that I welcome the complaint and am obliged to Deputy Keyes for the trouble the took in bringing it to an issue.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Reilly said that there had been damage done to a national monument, apparently, in our care.  He referred to Skreen.  I cannot charge my recollection as to whether or not it is in our charge, but assuming that <Col N="2241" /> it is in our charge, we certainly will look into the matter and communicate with the Deputy about it.  The suggestion is that some old stone of historic value actually has been broken up while in the custody of those whose business it was to take care of it.  If that is so, it is a very serious suggestion and will be treated very seriously.</P>

      <P>The question of the rotation of labour has been raised by Deputy Goulding.  Rotation is practically universal on minor relief schemes and I must say that it has been an extraordinary success.  You all know the difficulty in selecting men for a scheme of that kind.  We have found in practice that so long as men know that they are going to get a reasonable chance they are prepared both to go on to a scheme and to come off a scheme without difficulty or trouble or anything of that kind.  There was an extraordinary psychological experiment performed in Europe many years ago which people did not notice very particularly&mdash;that is, the queue system. It was one of the basic human experiments. The fact that people knew there was going to be a fair deal has done away with the crowding, obstruction and trouble which used to take place in connection with entertainments and gatherings.  In the same way in regard to minor relief schemes, both in regard to rotation and otherwise, the fact that we have succeeded in getting it over that there is going to be a fair deal has made this year extraordinarily peaceful and comfortable from our point of view.  Rotation is a general practice.  It is not followed always in regard to work done by local authorities.  I mean that where we do a minor relief scheme we are directly responsible; but where we hand it over to a local authority they have very considerable responsibilities.</P>
      <P>It would be worth while having on record the actual circumstances under which it is dealt with:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Rotation of labour. (a) Rotation of labour is not to be forced on contractors to Government Departments or to local authorities.  (b) In the case of work financial wholly or partly from central funds undertaken by a State Department or by a local authority the adoption of a system of rotation of labour is to be optional and entirely at the discretion of the employing authority both in regard to its introduction and its incidence, but where there is in existence a scheme of rotation, 75 per cent. of the vacancies filled must go <Col N="2243" /> to married men who, <i>inter se</i>, will take precedence in the order of their ascertained need for employment, and 25 per cent. to single men, placed in the same order.  When all the eligible men in the respective categories have had the periods of employment prescribed by the employing authority, then they may be employed over again in the same order as before.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I may say further in relation to relief works and Government financed works that the tendency is for the custom of rotation to spread.  Deputy Dockrell asked where provision appeared for the maintenance work on national monuments.  It appears in Vote 11, in a sub-head at the top of page 51 of the Estimates, and the amount is £4,500.  The maintenance of these monuments involves a good deal of care and expenditure and is supervised by specially selected clerks of works.</P>
    <P>The estimate does not make provision for excavation.  Normally a certain amount of work of excavation is carried out from private funds and the Government takes care that only properly skilled persons are allowed to do it.  Out of the Unemployment Relief Grant for this year, to the extent to which approved works of national excavation are put up, and to the extent to which we are satisfied that they can properly be done by that means, an effort will be made to finance them.  The Deputy also raised the question of Ballymote Castle, County Sligo, and Swords Castle, County Dublin, and wanted to know if these had been taken over.  In general, the Government takes over monuments offered to it; these have not been offered to it.  If either of these castles was offered to us we would sympathetically consider the matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell is evidently apparently under a wrong impression in regard to Ship Street and the headquarters of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  The reference to Ship Street in the Estimates, which apparently misled him, is in italics because it refers to work provided for and carried out last year.  It is contemplated that the new headquarters for <Col N="2244" /> the Department of Industry and Commerce will be in Kildare Street, although the matter is not absolutely settled.  The Deputy was worried about some traffic difficulties.  We are satisfied that those will not arise.  The Deputy also referred to a suggestion for a new post office, instead of the post office at College Green, to be at the corner of St. Andrew Street and Trinity Street.  The matter is not settled and there is no provision for it in the Estimates.  He can be satisfied that if the scheme proceeds special care will be taken to see that it is properly planned for post office purposes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin raised the hardy annual of the Douglas river drainage scheme.  That is one of the schemes subsidiary to the Barrow.  It cannot be dealt with until we are finished, not merely with the Barrow, but with the inquiries after the Barrow and all the financial questions which are involved. It is not being forgotten and it cannot be done until these are out of the way.  As I said, it is not merely a question of waiting until we are technically, as it were, finished with the operations on the Barrow; we have certain legal and other inquiries to face before we can do it.  Deputy Davin also raised the question of stamping the cards of men working on arterial drainage schemes.  It has been decided that the ordinary labourer working on an arterial drainage scheme is not insurable under the Unemployment Insurance Act, although tradesmen working on a particular class of job are insurable.  Those who are insurable are insured, and those who are not insurable are not insured.  The Deputy also raised the question of the dismissal of certain men due to the withdrawal of one of our dredgers. The actual principle which the Deputy advocated in relation to the letting loose of men who had to be discharged was the scheme actually adopted.  The men who had the shortest length of service were dismissed.  The only real problem there was whether or not that dredger should have been retained as long as it was.  Deputy Davin also raised the question of the completion of minor relief works left unfinished <Col N="2245" /> owing to insufficient funds.  A definite instruction has been given that in relation to all schemes next year the actual state of existing unfinished schemes shall be examined before allocations are made to other works and, in addition to that, surveyors are asked to report on the completion of their minor relief scheme programme in relation to any work which is incompleted and on which they think more expenditure would be wise.  I will be quite frank about it.  I have just come across, in wandering over the country, works which just finished where they began to be effective.  That may seem to Deputies to be a confession which one ought not to have to make.  As a matter of fact, it is the most natural and right procedure in the circumstances if we are to look on this money which we have as relief money.</P>
    <P>The House will remember that last year we put up a map showing the whole of the relief schemes through the country and showing the allocations to all districts prepared from a consideration of the geographical conditions, etc., and other such data as we got from local authorities, unemployment exchanges, etc.  In other words, it was an empiric method of distribution and, broadly speaking, it was successful.  This year, we attempted to provide a system which would be more minutely accurate in the fairness of its distribution.  As some Deputies have said, the main object of minor relief schemes is undoubtedly rural (as distinct from urban) unemployment relief, and we took out the agricultural valuation of every single district electoral division in Ireland.  We divided that by its population, getting by that means the valuation per head and then was fixed, depending on that average population per head, a &ldquo;poverty factor&rdquo; or &ldquo;need factor&rdquo; for each of those electoral areas. That &ldquo;need factor&rdquo; was then multiplied by the population of that district giving a new factor &mdash;what one might call, an allocation factor.  The total of those allocation factors were divided into somewhere about 75 per cent. of the total <Col N="2246" /> amount which was available for minor reliefs and the money allocated on that basis to each of those electoral areas. The remainder was allocated on the basis of the actual ascertained agricultural labouring population in the district, with a certain allowance for the cases in which it was obvious that these calculations were not giving correct results.  For instance, technically, the calculation of the need factor, multiplied by the population and divided into the total, would give an accurate figure but what we found was that, in certain electoral areas, the valuation might be thrown out altogether by the fact that there were three or four very big and, in some cases, very valuable, estates with high rateable valuations in it.  A portion of the remaining 25 per cent. was used to correct obvious discrepancies of that kind.</P>
    <P>On that basis, we have divided out the money this year and, while I think it has had one defect, that it has tended to make the size of the schemes smaller than they ought to be, it is, undoubtedly, judging by the indications we have of the general satisfaction given, an immense improvement. That would give you an explanation of unfinished works.  You find that a work would cost £200 and that, in respect of one electoral division, to be fair, the only amount that you can allocate would be £100 and you have either got to do an inferior work or start a work you cannot complete, but in so far as the factors of need are pretty well constant, they are not caused by any sporadic effects of the circumstances through which we are passing at the moment.  Broadly speaking, that is so. You will find that you have other proposals in the particular area in which, this year, you do work, and our intention is to follow up all unfinished works and as between two works, to give a strong preference to the work which was unfinished and to press it forward to its proper point.  A good many of these works which are unfinished are operative and are actually doing good work, even though they have not gone as far as we should like to drive them.  It is only a question of £100.  For £200 you can get a certain amount of bog and <Col N="2247" /> bring about the relief of a certain number of people, in providing passages to one place or another, while for £300, you may be able to relieve twice as many.  The House may take it that there is a definite intention to see that there are no what might be called dead-end works left unfinished that we can avoid.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly suggested that motor cars should be excluded from the Phoenix Park in order to help the hackney coach trade and he specifically asked me not to give him a sympathetic answer.  I cannot give him the answer he requires and I do not know that much can be done at all. After all, the Phoenix Park belongs to every user and it should be for every user and to subsidise that particular section, however much we should like to do it, does not seem to be a proper user of our authority in the matter. Deputy Brodrick raised the question of the Gárda Síochána barracks at Ballinasloe and Turloughmore.  At Ballinasloe, efforts are being made to obtain a suitable site for a new building or a suitable building for adaptation. No time is being lost.  The Deputy wanted a Gárda barracks built at Turloughmore.  I am not the Minister for Justice.  Ask him.  If he says so, we will build them.  With regard to the national schools at Colewood and Recess, the school at the former place, undoubtedly requires improvement. The matter has come to us and we have made suggestions.  It is under discussion by the Department of Education and the school manager at the present time.  The question of the school at Recess is not before us at present, but we understand that it is in the possession of the Minister for Education who will probably come to us shortly.</P>
    <P>Another Deputy wanted to know why the Vote for the Marketing Board for rural industries had been increased while the Vote for carrageen and kelp development had been reduced.  The Deputy is, apparently, under a misapprehension. The provision in Vote No. 11 for each of these services has been reduced, mainly, so far as the Office of Public Works is concerned, <Col N="2248" /> because the originally approved scheme of building is very far advanced and the cost is thus reduced.  The Deputy also complained that no provision had been made for volunteer instruction halls.  He will find in the Estimates that £50,000 was provided for buildings. Under sub-head A, a portion of £8,000 is also provided for the purpose of those halls.  Naturally we are not in a position to give exact final information at the present moment, as the thing is actually under development. In connection with Athenry Agricultural Station, the Deputy wanted to know whether the work was done by contract or direct labour.  The work has not yet been put in hand, and the method of doing it has not been settled. He wanted to know the cost involved in the change over from coal to turf in Government buildings.  There is an increase of £1,000 in the Estimates under that head.  I think it was he who also wanted to know whether there had been any experimental adaptation of grates for the purpose of turf burning, and whether the cost was justified. Only a very small part of that work has been done in the Board of Works, but a considerable amount I think has been done by the Ministry of Defence. The money expended has certainly been justified by the results.  My own experiments have brought me to believe that the old people who burned turf flat on the floor, without any of the fancy provision that is now common, showed very great wisdom, and a good deal of scientific sense.</P>
    <P>He also asked for an extension of the period for the repayment of charges under the Drainage Maintenance Act, 1934, to 35 years.  That is not desirable from the point of view of the people whom the Deputy desires to benefit.  The work done under the Drainage Maintenance Act is restoration only, and is really deferred maintenance, that is, maintenance which should have been done and paid for before.  To ask the people to continue, for 35 years, paying for the deferred maintenance, having regard not merely to the change which was going on but to the compound interest piling up, would be very unjustifiable.  The Deputy complains that the county <Col N="2249" /> council is raising the maintenance rates, and not maintaining the river. That is a matter for the people who elect members to the County Council. It is the County Council's business to do it, and it is the business of those who elect members of the County Council to see that the County Council does its business.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Lough Corrib Drainage District, I think I met a deputation from Galway in relation to that last year.  We went into the matter very carefully. That is a huge scheme. and the actual ascertained value of the improved land on any one of the schemes that were put up was so hopelessly out of line that they could not be considered.  On that district we could spend anything up to £300,000, and the value to be got for it is inequitable. He also raised the question of the development of bogs for the turf industry.  In addition to the money spent on bog roads for the purpose of enabling a man to get into his own turbary, there has been a considerable expenditure this year, and there will be a considerably greater expenditure next year, on the provision of roads into turbary, and the drainage and development of bogs for the commercial production of peat.  I think the total amount we have spent this year on commercial turf production, as distinct from mere bog roads and drainage to enable a man to get his home supply of turbary is more than £24,000. That sum will be very considerably increased next year.  Deputy Norton complained of the heating and ventilation of Leinster House.  I know that when we sat over there our knees were frozen, and we had to put in some cardboard protection, which is now inuring to the benefit of our political opponents.</P>

      <P>I am strong on benefiting the Deputies.  The scheme for this place was very carefully considered, and was an expensive scheme.  The people in every single parliament house in the world, as far as I know, complain about ventilation.  Possibly the members are somewhat responsible <Col N="2250" /> in the amount of gas which they let loose into the atmosphere.  I went over the building last year, and the place in which I found the ventilation was worst was certainly the restaurant. We did something there last year to try to bring the atmosphere below boiling point.  I will look into the matter and see if anything can be done.  We have tested the air in all chemical ways, and there is nothing wrong with the ventilation from the scientific point of view.</P>

      <P>No one has proposed that. With regard to the tributaries of the Barrow, Deputy Norton, in common with other Deputies, wanted other tributaries of the Barrow done.  I think the original estimate for the Barrow was £425,000.  We added to that another £90,000 or £100,000, by which we did 90 miles of additional tributary.  The actual ascertained value of the agricultural improvement due to all the money spent on the Barrow, is somewhere in the neighbourhood of 10 per cent. of the total. We have to come to an end with the Barrow, for the purpose of getting all the questions of assessment, contributions and everything else, cleared up.  Nothing is going to be allowed to delay that now.  We must get that finished.  Then, if any question of doing anything further arises it will be under some new and separate scheme.  Deputy Norton was concerned with the Sorting Office in Pearse Street.  The plans of this building are under consideration between ourselves and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, and are having every possible attention, but I do not expect that there will be much expenditure on it this year.  He also raised the question of the post office of Thurles.  It is <Col N="2251" /> hoped to make a start on this building during this year, and to spend about £1,000.  The question was also raised of doing the work by direct labour as distinct from contract.  As far as general work is concerned&mdash;the building of schools and all the rest&mdash;the more of it that is done by contract the better for everybody concerned.  I have no doubt whatever about that. I am speaking now with a considerable amount of experience as Chairman of the Contracts Committee. There is only a limited amount of money to be spent upon public purposes whatever you do, and I am satisfied that we are getting down to the basis of a very good tender.  I am quite satisfied that, on the whole, work of that kind will be better done by contract, in the interests of everybody concerned.  That does not apply in relation to work which we are doing directly ourselves, but, broadly speaking, the more work done by contract the better for the people in the State, in my opinion.</P>
      <P>In regard to the particular question which he raised in relation to the Curragh Camp, we have nothing to do with that, because that is administered by the Department of Defence. Deputy Norton also required the reconstruction of the military barracks at Kildare, and he wanted the military barracks at Newbridge pulled down for the purpose of unemployment relief.  We will not pull down a barracks merely and solely for that purpose.  To the extent to which there were certain portions of Newbridge barracks which required to be removed, it has been done for the purpose of unemployment relief, and will continue to be done, but there certainly will not be a general policy of pulling down buildings for that purpose. I do not think that would be the best way to employ the people you want employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Minch raised a question about the Barrow.  It was practically the same as Deputy Norton's, but for the information of Deputy Minch I will put it on record that the Barrow Drainage Act of 1927 and the Act of 1933 make provision for <Col N="2252" /> the maintenance of the works by the drainage board to be appointed by the county councils concerned and to be financed by the Government to the extent of one-half of the expenditure.  He referred to Athy and its position as a centre for engineering purposes.  That is under consideration.  Deputy Goulding drew attention to lime.  I was very anxious to include lime schemes under the relief schemes, but I found it very difficult indeed.  We got through about a dozen since we started&mdash; possibly not quite a dozen&mdash;and in every case I ran up against such difficulties as ownership and who was going to get the benefit of the scheme. The whole question is under the consideration of the Department of Agriculture. We are prepared to co-operate with them in anything that can be done.  Deputy Goulding raised the question of the maintenance of relief work roads when they are done.  We try, as far as possible, to get them maintained by those whom they benefit. In a number of cases the works are taken over and afterwards maintained by the county councils. One of the things that prevented us from running the relief schemes entirely through the county councils was that if the county councils directly, through their officers, as distinct from through us, did those works they would have to maintain them all.</P>
    <P>The hardy annual of the coastguard stations and the asking of too high rents for them was introduced.  Those stations that were not destroyed before they came into the hands of the Board of Works are maintained and, if not used for Government purposes, are let as cottages and there is a fair demand for them.  As regards those which were destroyed before being transferred to the Board of Works, we endeavour either to surrender them to the landlord on fair terms or dispose of them on building leases, as may be thought fit in the circumstances of each case.  We are bound to obtain as far as possible the economic value of them as estimated by our valuers. Deputy O'Leary also raised the question about lime, and he mentioned the Ballingeary drainage scheme in County Cork.  We did carry out a <Col N="2253" /> minor relief work of that kind, but I hardly think that is what he has referred to.  If the Deputy will send particulars to me I will look into them.  I cannot identify the scheme through the information he supplied to me.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde referred to aerodromes and asked what is the policy with regard to them.  The policy the Government is the policy of the Department of Industry and Commerce, to whom that question should be addressed.  He asked about the final use of the Viceregal Lodge.  The present intention is to use it for a folklore museum under the Department of Education.  He also wanted to know what happens to the vegetables in the gardens of the Viceregal Lodge.  These vegetables are sold in the market.  He also mentioned the practice of sending bucks from the herd to Ministers, Parliamentary Secretaries and certain civil servants.  The herd is there and has to be thinned.  I understand there is no market for venison and, therefore, it is apparently worked off on the digestion of the members of the Executive Council who, I should imagine, transfer the bucks to some benevolent institution. I do not know any member of the Executive who could eat a whole buck.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with Deputy MacEoin's observations.  It is very remarkable that there are very few recorded cases in addition to the one mentioned by Deputy Keyes, which we will go into, in which there has been direct complaint to the Department in relation to the works carried out under the relief schemes.  A Deputy wrote to the Board of Works, not to me, to ask who was the unmitigated rascal in charge of the distribution of the money. He mentioned that no relief works had been done in a particular place, certainly none of the relief works put forward by himself.  I give this case because it was the only case of the kind that came to my notice in which it was complained that no relief work had been carried out.  I regarded the matter as serious, and I looked into it. I found that about six works had been put forward by that Deputy.  There were at least five, three of which had <Col N="2254" /> gone to the Board of Works and two to the Land Commission, and they eventually arrived with us.  The Deputy had in his possession at the time the complaint was written a list of relief works actually being done, and that list covered the actual places where he said no work was being done. In fact, one of the actual relief works which he asked to have done was being done.  The other two works which he had put forward were actually on an additional list.  Of the two which were rejected one fell right on top of the work which he previously said was not done, and the other dropped into another relatively well-to-do area. The Deputy's letter ended up by saying that he intended, as a result of the scandalous conduct, to make himself as big a damned nuisance as he possibly could to the Board of Works.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it was not.  I am putting this in a semi-humorous vein, because I think the Deputy himself has since repented.  Deputy MacEoin complained that the farmers are assessed to pay for the maintenance of drainage schemes from which they got no benefit. A whole lot of schemes were carried out under the 1924 Act.  I have got a lot of complaints.  It is probable that a certain number of those were carried out for the purpose of relieving unemployment. But the law is that those schemes should be carried out.  We were entitled, as the Board of Works, to do these works.  The charges for doing the works must be met in proportion to the previous benefit received.  In a certain number of cases perfectly genuine complaints are made as a result of those restorations.  These complaints have a very simple explanation. In those cases the maintenance of the river and the drainage had been neglected, and the effect of the maintenance being neglected was that the upper reaches and the smaller drains into the river were overgrown.  As soon as we started in to clean the upper reaches of the river, the result was that the water which had been held back caused floods in the lower portion of the river.  Previously the water had not flowed down into the main part of the river.  It seeped down. <Col N="2255" /> As soon as we went in, cleaned up the river and put the drainage back into the position in which it ought to have been we naturally opened up the upper drains and let the floods down into the lower river&mdash;the place where the water was supposed to come.  For this reason very often there is a certain amount of legitimate ground in the complaint that the people in the lower part were not only not benefited by the work, but that, to a certain extent, the work did much damage to them.</P>
      <P>That is what has happened: while the people in the upper portions are benefited, the people below are damaged.  Any advantage to the upper part of the river is bound to react on and is not to the benefit of the people below.  That is why we are not often able to carry out minor schemes on the upper reaches of a river until a very big uneconomic scheme is made lower down, so as to enable the water from above to be carried off.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEoin raised the question of the Camlin river and arterial drainage in Longford.  The question of the restoration of this was considered, and it was thought to be uneconomic. The county council has suggested that the drainage be made a national charge in this case.  But if you have a national charge in this case where will you stop? If any money is to be spent as a national charge it ought to be spent upon the main arteries of the country. From the employment point of view these are going to be very unsatisfactory, because they will be machine jobs, and from the local point of view they will be more unsatisfactory, because the machine gangs will have to be imported into the district.  But if national money is going to be spent on drainage it ought to be in clearing the big rivers into which the smaller rivers can be effectively drained.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEoin wanted to know why there was an increase of £100 in the maintenance charge of the Viceregal Lodge as against last year.  The reason is that the fuel and lights figure last year was under-estimated.  We thought it necessary to burn fires in order to keep the place in proper condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin also wanted to <Col N="2256" /> know what is the cost of the present residence of the Governor-General and what the Government had done with it.  The Government has not acquired any house for the Governor-General. He has leased that house himself and pays for it under sub-head B, Vote 1, of the Estimates.</P>
    <P>I have answered as far as I could the questions which have been asked and frankly, I would like somebody to devise machinery by which those questions could be put in another form.  If there were a certain day in the year in which everybody sent in queries to which they wanted answers in writing perhaps it would be more effective.</P>
    <P>The House may like to know, before I sit down, the actual amount of the expenditure under relief schemes for this year.  The total amount sanctioned in the schemes for all Departments was £400,000.  The total number of separate relief schemes undertaken was 2,540. The maximum number of men employed at any one time was 24,000, but if the housing is included that 24,000 would be increased to 42,000.  As Deputies know, the housing schemes were the main provision this year for unemployment. A very satisfactory and successful provision it was.  The total sanctions for the minor relief schemes, including the county surveyors, were £134,284.  The number of applications for schemes received was 5,400.  That was the actual number sent in this year.  The number inspected and reported on was 4,500.  Those schemes which were examined were not necessarily out of the 5,400 schemes sent in this year, because a good many of them were for last year. Deputies who are wondering why their schemes were not carried out have this explanation.  We carried out altogether out of the 4,500 examined 1,900.  The maximum number of men employed at any one time on minor relief schemes was 16,400 in December last.  In connection with the peat schemes, which are intended for the commercial development of peat, we have completed, or are in process of carrying out, 73 schemes.  The amount of money involved in those schemes in £24,000.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The practice on this Vote for some years past has been that a brief outline is given of the various branches of the <Col N="2258" /> Department and that the discussion on a particular Vote is allowed to go over all the ground that may be covered by this Department.  As Deputies will observe, it is anticipated that the cost of maintaining my headquarters' office&mdash;Vote No. 32&mdash;will be substantially less this year than in the preceding year.  Savings are also being effected in the Vote for Prisons, Vote No. 34; the Vote for the Supreme Court and High Court, Vote No. 36; the Vote for the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds, Vote No. 37; and the Office of Charitable Donations and Bequests.  The District Court Vote, No. 35, and the Public Record Office Vote, No. 39, are practically unchanged; whatever little change there is is on the right side.  The Circuit Court Vote, No. 38, shows a comparatively small increase.  None of these variations is of any importance; they merely reflect the ebb and flow within a small compass, which is always to be expected.</P>
    <P>On the administrative side, as on the financial side, there is nothing of importance to report as regards these offices; they continue to do their work to the general satisfaction.  The courts are, as a whole, more up to date in their work than courts of justice in most countries usually are; the only arrears are those in the Circuit Court in Dublin and in the hearing, in the High Court, of appeals from the Circuit Court.  I hope that before the Long Vacation arrives legislation will have been passed which will remedy these defects and also some other points in the judicial system which have been the subject of complaint.</P>
    <P>On the whole, however, speaking after a year's experience as Minister for Justice, I feel that the machine generally is working satisfactorily. The only Vote in the group which unfortunately represents a serious increase on the charge on the taxpayer and which, unfortunately, also reflects a state of affairs from which nobody in this House can derive any pleasure, is the Vote for the Gárda Síochána, Vote No. 33.  The estimated increase in net cost as compared with last year is £70,460.  That increase will not come in any way as a surprise to <Col N="2259" /> Deputies; its existence and the reasons for it were fully explained and discussed on previous occasions in this House&mdash;most recently when a Supplementary Estimate in respect of last financial year was presented to and passed by this House some months ago.</P>
    <P>With regard to the details of the Estimate for the Office of the Minister for Justice, the reduction of £2,076 as compared with the Vote for last year is almost entirely under the heading of salaries for Headquarters' Staff.  It is accounted for mainly by the abolition of the post of Second Assistant-Secretary (£907), the reduction of the number of junior executive officers by one (£335), the reduced provision for bonus (£616), and the transfer to the Revenue Department of two clerical officers, who were seconded for service in the Customs and Excise. Of the two clerks in Habitual Criminals Registry shown on the Vote for last year, one has been transferred to the Gárda Síochána Vote and the other is shown as a clerical officer.</P>
    <P>Ministerial control of the various services of the Department of Justice &mdash;including Police, Prisons, Court Officers, etc.&mdash;is exercised through the Staff, for which provision is made in this Vote.  The District Court Branch, which is shown separately, controls the work of the District Court Clerks throughout the country and checks the receipt of all fines paid in District Courts, Circuit Courts and High Court.  These amounted to about £10,000 last year.  In addition, the sum of approximately £1,280 was transferred to the Exchequer in respect of fees received in cash in the Dublin Metropolitan District Court. The Accounts Branch, also shown separately in the Estimate, is responsible for the payment of the salaries and expenses of the Gárda Síochána, the Prisons, the District and Circuit Court staffs, the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds and the Supreme Court and High Court of Justice.  All the accounts work connected with the activities of the Department is performed by this Branch.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2260" /> The only staff provided for outside Dublin is in the Immigration Office at Cobh.  A full-time officer is required there to carry out the provisions of the Aliens Order, 1925, made under the Aliens' Restriction Acts, 1914-1919. He is assisted by a part-time assistant, who is paid an inclusive allowance of £100 per annum in addition to the salary he receives from Vote No. 35 as District Court Clerk.</P>
    <P>In addition to the provision of £1,620 in sub-head A (2) for the Film Censor's Office, the expenditure in connection with this service is estimated to amount to £521, as shown in Note K on page 107 of the Estimates. The fees received in stamps (i.e., the fees charged for film-censorship) are, however, estimated to amount to £2,500, so that, allowing for overhead charges, such as the time of the staffs in various Departments who are occupied in connection with film-censorship and for provision for insurance of films and machinery, consequential damages, etc., this service is in fact self-supporting.

      <P>The Minister, in his general remarks, referred to the great increase in the amount of the Vote of the Gárda Síochána&mdash;£70,460&mdash; and said, very truly, that no one in the House will get any pleasure from considering that increase.  He said that the reasons for the increase were fully explained on previous occasions, and on a recent Supplementary Estimate. Surely, the Minister will admit that there are few items in the Estimates that, as a matter of general policy, from the point of view of public confidence, could better, or had better, be lingered over in an explanation by him than the great increase in the amount of money voted for the police force.  I suggest that the reason the Minister slurs over the increase in the Police Vote is that the Minister does not care to turn around and discuss it, because it would <Col N="2261" /> be too unpleasant and too unpalatable a matter for him to discuss, and, perhaps, too difficult.  I propose to draw the attention of the House to certain things in connection with the Minister's Department and the administration of the police, for the purpose of seeing if we can find out where there is located, either in the Ministry or in the general headquarters of the police, the centre that must exist there of spite, insolence and incompetency, that shows itself in the working of the police force in certain ways throughout the country. I will read the House here an affidavit relating to an incident in Cork.  The affidavit reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I, John Murray, of 109 Dillon's Cross, Cork, aged 21 years and upwards, make oath and say as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  In the month of January, 1934, three men, two named Curtin and one named Aherne, came to my parents' house where I reside, at night, and committed an armed raid, and endeavoured to murder me.  They were charged before Constitution (Special Powers) Tribunal, convicted, and sentenced to imprisonment.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  In the same month James Kendillon, Stephen Walsh and John Condon came to my said residence and fired shots at the house and into the house, and wounded a man inside named Robert Peglar, who was a friend of mine.  The said men were charged and convicted before the said Tribunal and sentenced to imprisonment.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  After the events set out in paragraph (1) hereof, the police authorities placed a guard of police, which included two uniformed men and one member of the special branch lately recruited.  The surname of the member of the special branch was Flaherty.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  Since the events up to the night of the 7th April, 1934, hereinafter deposed to, the house has been guarded whilst I am at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(5)  On the night of the 7th April, 1934, or morning of the 8th April, 1934, I retired to bed about 1.45 a.m., leaving two members of the special branch in plain clothes and two <Col N="2262" /> uniformed men on guard.  The names of those two members of the special branch are Lawlor and Sullivan.  I did not lock the hall door of the house, so as to allow the police an opportunity of entering the house if they wished.  When I was about ten minutes in bed, I heard the hall door being opened, and then heard an argument between the two members of the special branch, Lawlor and Sullivan (whose voices I recognised) about a revolver.  I heard Lawlor say: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go up and shoot him,&rsquo; and I heard Sullivan try to stop him from coming up to me.  Lawlor kept on insisting that he would come up and shoot me.  I heard them come up the stairs and could see from my bed on to the stairs.  Sullivan had a hold on Lawlor and was endeavouring to keep him back, and Lawlor kept on saying &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll shoot him and put an end to him, and you can give evidence against me then.&rsquo;  This time Lawlor had a revolver in his hand pointing upwards towards my room.  I then saw Guard Seán Kelly try to hold him and prevent him from coming up, and reasoning with him, and finally Lawlor put the revolver into his pocket and said: &lsquo;If I go down without shooting him it will break my heart.&rsquo;  He went down and went out with some Civic Guard.  I dressed and left by the back door of the house and went down to McCurtain Street Barracks, where I complained to the orderly there, and told him what had happened.  In my presence he rang Union Quay Barracks and asked for the special branch, and told them what had happened. The orderly also sent a guard to Inspector Diggins' house to report the matter to him.  Inspector Diggins came to the barrack about an hour afterwards.  I was still there, and spoke to him and told him about what happened and the threatened shooting, and stated I wanted Guard Lawlor taken off my guard.  Whilst I was in MacCurtain Street Barracks Detective Sergeant Moore of the Civic Guard came from Union Quay Barracks, and I told him the facts, and then made a full statement thereof to Sergeant McWeeney, and <Col N="2263" /> I told him the facts.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(6)  I am a member of the political organisation known as Fine Gael, and I believe that it is because of my membership of the said organisation that the attempts on my life hereinbefore deposed to were made.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;Sworn at 62 Dame Street, in the City of Dublin, the 13th day of April, 1934, before me, a Commissioner to administer Oaths for the High Court of Justice in Saorstát Eireann, and I know deponent.</P>

    <P>Here you have the case of a man murderously attacked in his home on two occasions.  On the second of these occasions he was under police protection when he was attacked.  He was still under police protection after the second attack.  Leaving the door of his house open at night, so that if the police wished they could enter the house and, if necessary, keep themselves warm at the kitchen fire, he finds one of his guards proposing to come up and shoot him&mdash;that it would break his heart if he did not shoot him. What on earth is the position among the Civic Guards in Cork or at police headquarters here when in the case of a man, whose life is threatened by his political opponents, Guards are selected to guard him who are political opponents of his; who are so much his political opponents and so utterly unfit, apparently, to be members of any police force, that his life is actually in danger from one of them, and that he would have been murdered that night but for the fact that a second Guard came into the kitchen with him?</P>
    <P>The Minister states that this £70,000 is a symptom of things that certainly are very bad and very undesirable and very much regretted by every person in this House.  A reason why that sum was required is that there are people in this country whose lives are threatened, whose liberties are threatened, and whose right to go about their business in an ordinary decent <Col N="2264" /> way is threatened.  Surely in circumstances like these the Gárda authorities should have very definite principles of thought and action; there should be a definite demand for discipline; there should be some consideration by the responsible Gárda authorities as to the type of persons put on such protection duty and some consideration in that matter for the feelings and the position of the people whom the Civic Guards are forced to place under police protection.  Here you have one sample in Cork that illuminates to my mind the whole position there.  Quite a number of other matters happening in County Cork and neighbourhood give evidence of the fact that the whole thing is carried on in a cynical and almost in a brutal way.  I think it discloses such a state of affairs in Cork that the Minister ought to treat this House to some very serious explanation of it and tell us what change has taken place in the situation in Cork as far as Murray is concerned and, particularly, what steps have been taken to enquire from the police authorities in Cork how it was possible to have a set of circumstances like that.  The Cork people may not be to blame.  The difficulty that you find amongst the police at present is that they do not know what is expected of them and that brings us to the position with regard to the Minister himself and the Ministry and the position with regard to the Gárda Síochána general headquarters here, and that I think can best be discussed on certain matters connected with myself personally.</P>
    <P>At the present moment I have what I understand the Minister and the Gárda authorities would call police protection.  At least nine members of the Gárda Síochána and two motor drivers give me full-time attention. Deputy Cosgrave is in a similar position. I probably get the attention of a greater number of men than he does for the reason that on the night on which President de Valera made his famous charge that I was in Glasgow seeing a British Minister, arranging for armed help from Great Britain against some of our own people here, although there was a military guard on my house who, probably, had two revolvers <Col N="2265" /> and a machine gun between them, a policeman was turned out of the Rathmines police station at 11.30 p.m. with a revolver in his pocket, and every hour of the 24 hours of the day since, about 250 yards of the pathway outside my house has been patrolled by a plain clothes policeman in the most ostentatious way.  He was no very great addition in the matter of protection. As a matter of fact, what he was intended to do then and since is to protect the President's political reputation while, at the same time, creating as much unnecessary unpleasantness as he could for myself personally. For that reason, I may have at the present moment an addition of three more men&mdash;that is for the whole 24 hours one man more than Deputy Cosgrave has.  Both of us are suffering the same type of insolence and intrusion into our privacy and the same kind of general personal inconvenience.  I deal with the details of my own case because less research is involved.</P>
    <P>Let us take just another affidavit which is as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I, Michael O'Connor, of Number two New Road, Inchicore, in the City of Dublin, labourer, aged 21 years, and upwards, make oath and say as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  On the night of 17th April, 1934, at about 11 o'clock, I was standing in the vestibule of the Abbey Theatre, Dublin.  The performance at the theatre had ended.  A man entered the vestibule and addressed me, and asked me if everyone had left.  I said: &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; and he then said: &lsquo;Is Mulcahy gone?&rsquo;  I pointed to where General Mulcahy was and said: &lsquo;No, he is talking over there.&rsquo;  He then said: &lsquo;Can I get cigarettes here?&rsquo; to which I replied: &lsquo;Yes, in the café.&rsquo;  I learned that the man who spoke to me was Guard Maguire, one of General Mulcahy's escort.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  I watched Guard Maguire. General Mulcahy was standing at the entrance to the café, and Guard Maguire walked about the vestibule, went outside the door, almost immediately returned to the vestibule and again asked me about getting cigarettes.  I again told him he could get them in the café.  He then said <Col N="2266" /> to me: &lsquo;Will you get them for me, because we're scorching this f&mdash;&mdash; up,&rsquo; referring to General Mulcahy.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(3)  I got the cigarettes and gave them to Guard Maguire.  I then told General Mulcahy what had happened, and what the man (Guard Maguire) had said.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(4)  On the following Friday, 20th April, 1934, at about 9 p.m., I was again standing in the vestibule of the same theatre, when Maguire came in and approached me, apparently being very friendly, and suggested to me that he had not said anything of General Mulcahy.  I told him that I would not make any statement to him.  He then invited me out of the theatre for a drink, which I refused.  After passing a few general remarks, he went away.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I make this affidavit from personal knowledge save where otherwise may appear.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&ldquo;MICHAEL O'CONNOR.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Sworn at 12 Dame Street, in the City of Dublin, this 23rd day of April, 1934, before me, a Commissioner to administer Oaths, and I know the Deponent.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&ldquo;FRANCIS DEVINE.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the type of person who is on full duty to look after me and my home, and to keep closely in touch with us the whole day long.  Let us see what the position is.  If I go out of my house at 6.30 or 6.45 a.m., there is a Ford car with its nose just beside my gate, so that its occupants can see up the passage to the house and keep the house well under view.  There are probably two detectives in it and a driver, all armed.  They have the whole road to themselves.  They do not have a placard out&mdash;&ldquo;protection on here&rdquo;&mdash;but, as I say, they have the whole road to themselves. If I go out, they follow me. If I go down town, at a quarter past nine, and, if I walk, the car noses after me down along the road.  If I go to my office, the car parks outside the house.  If I visit a friend's house, the car parks outside the house.  If I go out at night, it is there at 9.15 to 10.15 and at 11.15. p.m.  There are three armed men and, as I have said, there is probably a fourth.</P>
    <P>After the late Kevin O'Higgins was murdered, guards were put on <Col N="2267" /> Ministers.  Military guards were put on them, because it was found that police guards were unsuitable.  That continued from August, 1927.  When the present Party came into office, a situation was gradually brought about in which guards were left on just two ex-Ministers, Deputy Cosgrave and myself.  In June last year, the officer in charge of the guards came to me and said that police were being put on duty in future.  He introduced one guard and one driver, and said that these were taking over from the military party.  I met the guard; I asked him was he armed and he said, yes.  I asked had he any instructions and he said, no.  I asked the driver was he armed&mdash;yes; any instructions&mdash;no.  I addressed a letter to the President stating that I did not think that, considering the precautions the Executive Council had been taking up to then for my safety, and without any explanation whatever, the change gave a guard inadequate for the situation as it seemed to me they envisaged it.  Up to that time, I had had a car placed at my disposal.  It was considered that I should travel as far as possible by car.  There was an armed driver, and there were two armed guards.  If I went down the country, there was a third armed guard attached, together with a machine gun, and there was a machine gun at night. It sounds rather elaborate&mdash;a very difficult thing to live with, but there were conveniences about the house that made it tolerable for the men themselves, and not quite intolerable for me.</P>
    <P>In June, as I say, two armed police and an armed police driver were to be put on.  The protection was to be handed over to the police.  In relation to what was provided for before, I did not think the arrangement, without some explanation, quite adequate, and I asked to be informed what were the instructions given to the driver, and what were the instructions given to the guards; what particular type of danger I was being protected against, and under what circumstances it was considered that the men who were being sent with me might be expected to have to use firearms.  Neither the <Col N="2268" /> President nor anyone else was apparently prepared to answer these questions, and I got an answer, more or less by return, stating that the military guard was being restored, and I lived with the military guard for a while longer.  True, in August of that year, I was asked to hand up my revolver, for when I came home from the famous Glasgow visit, I was told that a policeman had called to collect my revolver.  My time for a permit was up, and I went to the police station in Rathmines to renew it.  It could not be renewed there.  I phoned Donnybrook station to say that I was sending on the fee, but that it was not convenient for me to call across.  I was told that they would be sending a man to collect it from me.  I went to Donnybrook police station, and it was confirmed there that the instructions were to take up revolvers, and that they could consider applications afterwards. I said what was the fact, that, if I had a military party likely or liable in any way to incur any risks because of their defence of me, I was going to be in that defence, and that if I was not allowed to have the wherewith, they could take the whole caboosh.  However, Donnybrook's instructions were that they were to take up the guns.</P>
    <P>I went to the Castle and the instructions of the Superintendent in the Castle were that they were to take up the guns.  I went to the Gárda Síochána headquarters and I told the Commissioner that there was a particular type of protection party outside his gate there, more or less on his advice, protecting me and that if I had not the wherewith to protect them if they got into any difficulty because of me, he could take the whole lot.  I showed him by taking my gun from my pocket that I was looking for a certificate for a gun which I had and which, if necessary, I was prepared to use.  That was all they wanted, he said.  A rather interesting sidelight on police administration.</P>
    <P>However, time passed and we then had, as I say, the additional plain clothes police put ostentatiously on duty every hour of the day and night outside my house after the President had made his famous Glasgow charge. Then we come to 27th March last.  I <Col N="2269" /> was having a game of golf and suddenly the place around rather crowded up a bit.  There were unexpected and additional people around.  What had happened?  The usual two members of my military protection party were about the place but two plain clothes policemen, men who had been on my protection party and had been transferred to the police, came out.  They came out to take over charge of me from the military.  The military had no information about it.  They stayed where they were, and we had a joint military and police party for about 14 or 15 holes.  Then we came back to the club.  What had happened? There had been sent out from police headquarters a uniformed policeman, and two men who had previously been on my military protection party, and who had been transferred to the police. These had been sent out to bring me home.  I wished to have nothing to do with them.  I told them if they were police I had no instructions about them, and that if they wished to enter my home they had no permission from me to do so.  I went home.  Ten days passed.  During those ten days I had those police and others with me everywhere I went. Night, noon and morning, they were outside the gate, nosing around the place after me.  I had no approach from the Army that the Army men were going.  I had no approach from the police that the police were coming. Ten days passed, and I had a ring from a police inspector that he wanted to see me.  He came down and told me that he was to be in charge of my protection from the following day. He said he should like to know the day beforehand where I would be going the next day, so that I would be splendidly protected.  I asked him &ldquo;If I am walking down Grafton Street what protection will I have?&rdquo;  He answered.  &ldquo;Three men.&rdquo;&ldquo;Will they be armed?&rdquo;  I asked.  &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; he said.  I said, &ldquo;Do you mean to tell me that you&mdash;a responsible police officer coming to tell me that I require protection, that you are responsible for giving it to me, and that you are going to give me three men&mdash; do not know whether they will be armed or not?&rdquo;  They would be armed, <Col N="2270" /> he thought then.  When asked what they would be armed with, he did not know; what they would be armed against&mdash;he did not know; under what circumstances would they be required to use arms&mdash;he did not know.  There would at any rate be three of them for the 24 hours of the day, as well as a few motor drivers!</P>
    <P>I was in 5 Parnell Square on the night of the 9th April.  I was holding a meeting there.  Stones came in through the window.  The protection party was outside&mdash;the whole lot of them, car and all&mdash;but the windows could be broken with perfect impunity. On the other hand, I went with General O'Duffy and Deputy Cosgrave to pay my condolences at the American Legation, and was followed right up to his hall-door by a police car with three detectives in it.  I went from that to pay my respects to the Nuncio, and they followed me right up to his hall-door, but the windows of our offices may be broken with the most perfect impunity.  Now I want to know from the Minister, if he does consider that protection is required, say for myself, what is wrong or what is difficult about the protection that had been provided so successfully since August, 1927?  It was provided because experience of police showed that this was not fair work to have them on, and that whatever inconveniences were run, either by the members of the protection party themselves or by the persons who had to endure it, would be less &mdash;they certainly would be less for me &mdash;with the military protection party than with the police party.  It was the same with any other person who had anything to do with them.  If a change must take place, what kind of mentality brings about the change in the way in which the change was brought about&mdash;the change to plain clothes police with a uniformed driver?  What kind of co-operation could be expected in a difficult and delicate matter like that when the administration is such that the unfortunate police inspector who comes to discuss the matter with me does not know whether his superior authority wants him to say whether the men who are going to be with me will be armed or not?  What kind of <Col N="2271" /> protection is it that can allow the windows of the house in which you are sitting to be broken with complete impunity?  I would tell the Minister that I walked out of my own house, with my wife, without their seeing me. You cannot have men sticking in a car or hanging around the streets from one end of the day to the other without their minds getting obfuscated in some way or another. They cannot always keep their eyes open.  It is a most unfair position to put any police officer in.  It is particularly unfair&mdash;because the Gárda Síochána have been trained as an unarmed force&mdash;to put a police officer into a position where as far as I know, at any rate up to a day or two ago, two 45 revolvers and a machine gun were thought to be necessary.</P>
    <P>I spoke of a particular man about whom I made an affidavit.  He and another were with my military protection party.  There was quite a large number of men on military protection duties with various Ministers in their time.  Those men remained until some months ago.  I was then able to be told from Press connections that it was proposed to change some of the men on my military party, and to add a person who was going to be a spy on my movements. I did not pay any attention to that, but the change was made.  I then went to the officer in charge of the party, told him what I had heard, and asked him about it.  I was told that the man who was being added to the party was an ex-officer; that he was an Irish-speaker; that he was in poor family circumstances, and that it would be a charity to allow him to be in any position in which he could get a few little additional emoluments. I had nothing to say.  By that statement I was prevented from making any objections, even if I wished to do so.  A second man was put on, and I asked to be assured that he was not a man who had fought with the Irregulars.  I was told most politely and officially from the Chief of Staff that I could get no official particulars with regard to the men who were on the party.  The Minister has now a statement of fact in regard to the <Col N="2272" /> type of person that was put on that duty, the type of person that was transferred to the police for the purpose of acting as the spear-heads, the guides and trainers-in of this new police party.  Either the Minister or the Commissioner of Police has, in this matter, shown himself to be brutal-minded and insolent, without any consideration&mdash;good, bad or indifferent&mdash; for the feelings or the position of persons in public life, or for their families.  There has been an enormous amount of incompetence shown somewhere.</P>
    <P>If it was not done deliberately, then it was scandalous incompetence, and I think that at the present moment, the full time and attention of about eleven members of the police force is directed to my movements, and to the goings on in my home.  I have sufficient appreciation of what Irish liberty is to tell the Minister that I am not going to have that.  The Minister may take the police that are hanging around me and send them to find the murderers of O'Reilly, of Daly, and the perpetrators of the Dundalk outrage.  If he thinks that any particular person in this country does run a danger of any kind, then he ought to have police with some sympathy for that person.  Even if there was no particular connection with the past of himself or his colleagues in connection with the matter, any person who runs any type of danger ought to have a certain amount of sympathy from the police.  If they have any opinions as to what private life ought to be, or what liberty ought to be, they ought to try to make the burden of protection as light as they possibly can for those who may have to have it.  I would like to hear some explanation from the Minister as to the attitude that has been taken up in this case.  I speak of my own case, because it is one I know personally. I think it is a very illuminating case.  When you put the Dublin side of things with the Cork side of things, as shown by the Murray case, this House ought to know what the Minister and the police mean, when they talk about protection, when they offer you an extra bill for £70,000, for the <Col N="2273" /> purpose of enabling them to give it to people that they say want it.  I move the amendment: &ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that nobody in this State thinks that all is well in the Department of Justice at the moment.  Nobody in this State thinks that the law is being properly and impartially administered, and that the police are, in all respects, doing their work efficiently and well. At the outset, I want to say, that I do not believe that the faults are faults due to the ordinary rank and file of the Guards at all, or to the majority of their officers.  I think the administration of the Guards is such &mdash;whether they are not being permitted by the Minister for Justice or by those in high stations in their own force I do not know&mdash;that it certainly appears that the great change which has come over the Guards is not a change in the personnel merely.  It is a change which is due to those in power, a change due to instructions which they must have received.  After all, there was one thing upon which all Parties, and upon which everybody who took a real interest in the affairs of this State a few years ago could agree, and that was that we had probably the best, the most impartial, and the least corruptible police force in the world.  Though certain men may have been put out, fairly or unfairly, and though a certain number of new men have been drafted in, I do not think the number put out or the number put in is anything like sufficient to bring down the police force, in the doing of its work, in the way it has gone down, and, in consequence, I am satisfied in my own mind, and I believe the majority of the people of this State are satisfied, that there are instructions going out from the headquarters of the Guards, or from the Department of Justice, that the Guards are not fearlessly, fairly and impartially to do their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a very notorious example of that, which has been already mentioned in this House, and which the Minister has repeatedly tried to dodge.  Until he comes out into the open I will on every possible occasion bring this matter up. <Col N="2274" /> That is the extraordinary conduct of the Guards on a certain occasion, in the month of February, in Parnell Square. As to the facts of that happening there is very little doubt&mdash;no doubt.  The Minister for Justice has admitted practically everything.  He admitted in this House that there was a meeting of I.R.A. officers in Parnell Square.  He admitted that the Guards knew that there was going to be such a meeting. He admitted that the Guards, with field-glasses, watched what was happening from another house.  He admitted that the Guards knew there were going to be instructions given in the construction of land mines, and that a land mine was actually going to be constructed on that occasion for use the next day.  None of these facts are in dispute.  The Minister admits that everyone of them was known to the. Guards.  There was one matter which was a matter of conclusion rather than anything else.  It was known to the Guards that a bomb would be exploded somewhere the next day.  The only mine that was exploded anywhere in Ireland the next day was the one which was exploded in the streets of Dundalk. If it is known to the Guards that a mine is going to be constructed in Parnell Square; if it is known to the Guards that that mine is going to be exploded somewhere the next day, and if the only mine exploded was the mine in Dundalk, I think the perfectly fair conclusion&mdash;in fact, the only logical conclusion&mdash;to be drawn is that a mine was constructed, one might say, under the very eyes of the Guards&mdash;because they were watching the house in which they knew it was being constructed&mdash; and that that was the mine which caused the death&mdash;the murder&mdash;of an unfortunate woman in Dundalk on the next day; a murder which was occasioned because a son of hers had the audacity to go before the Military Tribunal to give evidence against certain gentlemen, or supporters of the present Administration.  We have it that this mine was constructed, that it was going to be used, and that it was used the next day.  I ask any Deputies who exercise ordinary reason and intelligence: will they come to any other conclusion, except that that mine was the mine that was used in the <Col N="2275" /> appalling outrage in County Louth? The Minister, on a previous occasion in this House, declared that the Guards did not think it was the same mine.  In matters of this nature, every person in the community can draw conclusions just as forcibly as the Guards can draw them.  If there are any facts in the possession of the Guards or in the possession of the Minister which would go to show that the land mine constructed in Parnell Square was not the land mine used the next day, let us have these by all means.  Let us get any further facts.  It is due to the House that we should have the full facts.  Until there are further facts brought before the House, if that can be done, there is no conclusion that I, or anybody else, can draw save that this land mine was the mine which caused that diabolical outrage.  If that be so, is there not blood-guilt upon the men who could have prevented the construction of that land mine and did not?  Is not the responsibility there? A terrible outrage has been committed. That terrible outrage could have been stopped by the Guards and was not stopped.  The land mine would never have been constructed if the Guards had raided that particular place upon that particular day.  They did not raid it.  Why not?  Was it the fault of the individual Guards?  I do not believe it was, and I challenge the Minister to deny that, in spite of all the knowledge which he admits the Guards had, these Guards were instructed not to raid. They got their instructions when going out.  They were told what to do.  I am perfectly certain that, if they had been instructed to raid, they would have raided.  Because they did not raid, I am perfectly certain they had been instructed not to raid.  Who gave them these instructions, I should like very much to know, and we are entitled to know.  I am told that that unfortunate body of policemen were taken out of plain clothes and put into the uniformed force.  That appeared in the papers.  It has been stated also that some three or four of them, as a protest against the injustice of that step, have resigned the force.  I do not know whether that is correct or <Col N="2276" /> not, but I should like the Minister to inform the House if it is correct.  When a terrible affair like this has taken place, there is no use in making scapegoats of subordinates, because every person in this city knows that it was not subordinates who were to blame. It was the person who gave instructions to them.  It is all in keeping with the general policy of the present Executive Council that such a thing should happen.  We had it stated plainly here by President de Valera on more than one occasion that he did not mind whether the I.R.A. had rifles or guns of any sort, provided they did not use them in public.  It was stated here in this House that the Guards were not to raid the I.R.A. premises for arms. They were to do nothing about their arms unless these arms were shown publicly.  The I.R.A. were to be allowed to keep their arms in private. Is it not a part of that policy that they cannot be raided for land mines either? They are allowed to keep as many arms, as they like.  The Guards, we know, are instructed not to raid their houses for arms; not to deal with arms at all in their case unless the arms are shown in public.  The President has said that more than once in this House. That is the professed policy of the Party and, obviously, in the same way, I conclude&mdash;I believe that everybody else in this State concludes likewise&mdash; that the Guards have received instructions not to raid for land mines either. With what result?  This unfortunate woman was done to death, poor little children, playing harmlessly in the streets of an Irish town on a Sunday afternoon, were terribly injured.  And all because instructions had gone from somewhere to the Guards that they were not to do their duty.</P>
    <P>When you have a scandal of this nature, it should be probed right down to the bottom.  A scandal of this nature should not be hushed up.  If the Minister will not come out openly in this debate&mdash;he can no longer plead that he has not had sufficient time&mdash; if the Minister continues his policy of hushing this matter up, then I shall draw the conclusion, and I believe every fair-minded person in this State will draw the conclusion, that the <Col N="2277" /> blame lies upon the shoulders of the Executive Council themselves.  That is, blame for an appalling scandal.  It should not be hushed up.  If an individual is to blame, let that individual bear the brunt of what he has done. Has there been any inquiry at all? Has anything been done publicly or privately about this matter?  We hear of nothing except that nine unfortunate men are made scapegoats of, and I believe that is done because they obeyed the instructions of their superior officers.  That is a scandalous state of affairs.  How on earth can the people of this State have confidence in the administration of the law, how can they retain the confidence, so deep and so well-founded, which they always had in the Gárda Síochána, if the Gárda are to be prevented from doing their plain and obvious duty by orders that come to them from somewhere?</P>
    <P>The Minister some time ago explained that all the persons who had been brought into the new force were to be treated precisely as ordinary members of the Gárda.  Have they been so treated?  Can things be right in the administration of the Gárda when we have regard to the affidavit made by a reliable person like Mr. Murray?  That affidavit was read here to-night and showed that one of the persons put on to guard him is a menace to the life of the man he is supposed to guard.  How does such a thing happen?  We have had an account, when that very house was fired upon, that there were Guards outside who did not interfere.  The Minister, on another occasion, told us that officers were satisfied that it was not wise for them to interfere while a house was being fired at.  But here we have it that a Guard&mdash;I do not say one of the Guards on duty while the house was fired on, I am not to be taken as making any suggestion that he was one of the two&mdash;was struggling with another sent to protect him, because that other was seeking to murder the man they were sent to protect. Has there been any inquiry about that?  And if so, what was the result of the inquiry?  The name of that particular Guards is mentioned. He was endeavouring to injure, to <Col N="2278" /> murder or to shoot the man whose life he was supposed to be protecting. How long has he been in the police force?  What was his training?  Why was he sent out on this particular duty?  Surely if you are going to give a person whose life is in danger protection, or whose property is in danger protection, as you ought to, it is your simple duty to give adequate protection and to give it to anybody whose life is in danger or considered to be in danger.  That is your plain duty.  But in carrying out your plain duty you must select men who are prepared to do that duty.  If you send men to protect the life of an individual you must send men who are prepared to risk their lives in saving the life of that individual.  Thank God there are men in the Guards who are quite willing to risk their own lives, if necessary, in protection of the lives of those they are minding.  I am glad to say that in the Civic Guard we have a body of men, and it is only just that you should have such a body of men, who will risk their lives in the performance of their duty.  It is from such men that you must select those whom you are sending on protective duties.  What is being done, according to the affidavit we have heard read here?  You are obviously choosing individuals who are not willing to risk their own lives in the performance of their duties.  You are choosing persons who probably, because they are steeped in politics themselves, are an actual menace to the individuals they are supposed to be protecting and guarding.  Is it not a terrible thing that from your force, at the present moment, you are selecting such men? I should have said from our force, from the nation's force.  Yet you are sending out, as if from this force, men who, instead of doing their duty, are a menace to those whom they are supposed to be chosen to protect.</P>
    <P>Another case appeared in the papers the other day in which a District Justice made some very strong remarks. One of your new Guards started a prosecution against some members of the League of Youth. When that whole case was over, the District Justice, in dismissing it, is reported to have said: &ldquo;It is the <Col N="2279" /> other men you should have in the dock.&rdquo;  There you have a Guard bringing a prosecution against men who should not have been prosecuted at all, according to the findings of the District Justice, and you have men going off scot-free whom the District Justice, after the hearing of that case, said should have been prosecuted.  If you are going to allow politics to get into any considerable number of the Guards you are doing a tremendous amount to the detriment of this country.  Since you have taken in those new 400 men there are many of them on whom you ought to impress the fact that they should fling aside their politics the moment they put on a Guard's tunic, because politics that twist them in the discharge of their duty are inconsistent with the wearing of the tunic of a Civic Guard.  It is perfectly obvious that you have not done that.  I am not surprised.</P>
    <P>Already in this House I have had occasion to draw attention to the extraordinary way in which the new force was recruited.  They were not chosen, or selected, in the ordinary way by the Commissioner of the Gárda; they were chosen and selected by a Deputy, a member of this House.  That is not denied.  It is not surprising that in choosing and selecting these men that particular Deputy did not look&mdash; he would be more than human if he did &mdash;at what was their particular suitability or capacity to be members of the Gárda.  He looked to see that they were good and staunch supporters of the present Administration.  These are some of the first fruits of the present Administration that we are getting. You are destroying the spirit of a portion of the Guards, because I do not ever believe we will destroy the spirit of the whole of the Guards.  It is too fine a spirit, too deeply rooted to be forced out and destroyed; but you are undoubtedly attacking the <i>esprit de corps</i> of the Guards.  I mentioned a moment ago that the increase in the number of the Guards is very substantial. The Minister, in the opening remarks he made&mdash;the only remarks he made upon this large Vote to the Gárda Síochána&mdash;gave no reason for the increase. The Minister has never given <Col N="2280" /> any reason in this House for that increase.  I challenge the Minister to go through any of his speeches made on the Gárda Síochána Vote, supplemental or otherwise, or on any other occasion in the House, and show that he gave any reason for the increase in the force.  While the number of sergeants and the number of officers has remained pretty constant there has been a very considerable change in the number of the ordinary grades.  I find that in the year 1931-32 the total number of Guards was 5,443, but I find that we have estimated this year for 5,864.  That is an increase of well over 400 men as compared with the figure of four years ago.  I remember when the Minister was on this side of the House he used to talk of a reduction of 2,000 in the number of the Guards.  In the course of the election speeches all these things were mentioned, and in those days the Ministers used to declare that there could easily be a reduction of 2,000.  What attitude are they adopting now?  I move to report progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Part II, in the second column relating to Article 41, to add after the word &ldquo;Eireann&rdquo; the words &ldquo;the insertion after the words <Col N="2282" />&lsquo;Executive Council shall present&rsquo; of the words &lsquo;not earlier, in the case of Money Bills as hereinafter defined, than seven clear days, or in the case of any Bill other than a Money Bill, three clear days after the passage of such Bill.&rsquo;&rdquo;; the insertion at the end of the Article of the words&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A Money Bill for the purposes of this Article means a Bill which contains provisions dealing with all or any of the following subjects, namely, the imposition, repeal, remission, alteration or regulation of taxation; the imposition for the payment of debt or other financial purposes of charges on public moneys or the variation or repeal of any such charges; supply; the appropriation, receipt, custody, issue or audit of accounts of public money; the raising or guarantee of any loan or the repayment thereof; subordinate matters incidental to those subjects or any of them.  In this definition the expressions &lsquo;taxation,&rsquo;&lsquo;public money&rsquo; and &lsquo;loan&rsquo; respectively do not include any taxation, money, or loan raised by local authorities or bodies for local purposes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This measure was introduced in order to take the Seanad out of the Constitution. The taking out of the Seanad would provide a fairly easy passage for Bills.  Under the Constitution, so far, a Money Bill could be considered by the Seanad and recommendations could be made in connection with it. There is a period of 21 days after which, if no recommendations come from the Seanad, a Money Bill becomes law.  This amendment provides that seven clear days shall elapse from the introduction of the Money Bill until it becomes law.  The most important Money Bills of the year are the two Central Fund Bills.  One is introduced some time in March and the other should be introduced and passed into law before 1st August.  As the Bill that is now before us stands, it would be possible to introduce the Money Bill and get it through all stages here on the day of introduction and it could be signed that night.  I put that point before the Dáil on the Second Reading. In the course of the President's speech <Col N="2283" /> on that occasion he indicated the intention to set up a commission and said that it was intended to amend the Standing Orders.  I think that was merely trifling with the position.  In fact, the whole procedure in connection with the introduction of this measure indicates a certain trifling with the Dáil.</P>
    <P>It is really a major measure and it simply lops off portions of the Constitution which enshrined certain safeguards for the people.  If it be not intended to have Money Bills passed through the House within 12 hours, then there should and there must be some consideration given to an amendment which would prevent any Administration from doing that.  The 21 days provided in the Constitution to enable the Seanad to consider and make recommendations in connection with Money Bills were really a safeguard. This Bill, when passed, provides no such safeguard.  Aftering the Standing Orders will be no safeguard.  In the case of certain local authorities,, where they have Standing Orders, it is provided that they cannot be waived or suspended without a two-thirds majority.  The Standing Orders here can be suspended by a majority of one.  Altering the Standing Orders is simply begging the question.  You could pile up Standing Orders here to the number of 1,000 and a majority of one would suspend them and enable the Ministry to carry through any legislation it pleased, as long as it possessed a majority, within any space of time that the resolution which they would put would confine the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Money Bills are, perhaps, the most important things that could come before the Dáil or before a Parliament in any country.  If we mean to make an effort towards having stable conditions we could only ensure stable conditions by letting the people understand that economic considerations, economic changes or taxation changes are not going to take place overnight. It is quite true that no matter what safeguard one provides in legislation an irresponsible Ministry, an unscrupulous Ministry, can evade or get over it.  Notwithstanding that, it <Col N="2284" /> is necessary to ensure that we tax their ingenuity in that connection.  If the desire is to achieve stable conditions, then this amendment or some such amendment is required in order to satisfy the people that no such intention is under consideration.  In most countries under normal conditions taxation proposals are introduced at one period of the year.  There have been departures from that in recent years, but recent years were not normal years.</P>
    <P>The aim of a legislature should be to get to the normal conditions as quickly as possible.  People in business realise the importance of knowing prices so that they can purchase their goods and do their business without the fear of a change taking place overnight. Nobody can question the fact that Money Bills, taxation and so on, are the most important business that Parliament can transact.  In view of these considerations I am proposing this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Evidently we will have no reply to the points raised by Deputy Cosgrave.  I pointed out on the Second Reading of this Bill that the proposal to abolish the Seanad has given rise to very considerable uneasiness, financial and economic, in the country.  Since the Bill has passed its Second Reading that feeling has been gravely accentuated. Anybody moving around the city must certainly be aware of the very serious unrest and uncertainty that exists.  It is not a matter about which we want to talk very much.  This amendment in the name of Deputy Cosgrave and myself is designed to allay, in some way, that feeling of uneasiness and to show that there will be at least in this Bill when it becomes an Act some brake put upon hasty financial legislation, something which will enable people to realise whither they are going and what is happening them before the thing actually descends upon them as a matter of law.  This amendment is a very serious consideration put forward from that point of view and it deserves equally serious consideration from the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I hold that no case whatever has been made for this amendment by the mover.  We are told just now that there is considerable <Col N="2285" /> uneasiness abroad.  Well, certainly, if there is not uneasiness abroad it is not due to the Opposition that there is not. This is a scare amendment.  It can do nothing.  It would be no help whatever if there was this unscrupulous or irresponsible Ministry which the leader of the Opposition said could exist and against whom there could be no safeguard. I have said that all the time. Everybody who considers the question of a responsible Government is satisfied that there is ultimately no safeguard for the public except in the integrity, the honour and the commonsense of the people's representatives. That is the position here.</P>
      <P>What is the point in waiting for seven days?  What is the point in waiting for three days?  A Bill is passed, it is about to be presented.  Is there any suggestion that within the three days it would be withdrawn? I have seen no case whatever put forward by the mover.  It is the most surprising amendment to a Bill that has ever been put forward.  We are told that Money Bills are most important. Yes, they are most important, we will admit it, but what is the Constitutional position at the present moment in regard to these Bills?  Is the Seanad allowed to stop or curtail the will of the Dáil in the matter? It is not.  A certain period is given.</P>
      <P>I indicated on the Second Reading speech that in all probability the Standing Orders would be changed so as to give, perhaps, a somewhat longer time for the consideration of the Bill on the Report Stage.  But these important Money Bills with the Constitution as it stands have to be passed in the form in which the Dáil wishes.  There are 21 days' consideration allowed. Recommendations can be made.  In the alterations which I expect will be made in the Standing Orders with regard to the special consideration of the Bill on the Report Stage, a certain period will elapse.  But in all probability the recommendations, if there are any recommendations, can be put before the Dáil before it passes and can be made by the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say that I am amazed that anybody could put forward an amendment of this sort.  I suggest that it was <Col N="2286" /> brought forward simply to make and to emphasise the point made by the leader of the Opposition which was to create a scare.  There is no real safeguard in this amendment if it were passed.  None whatever.  I suggest that it is an amendment which has been brought forward with no real saving purpose behind it.</P>

      <P>There are none so blind as those who have eyes and will not see.  The whole procedure in connection with the introduction of this measure and the speech made by the President in introducing it were most reprehensible.  He brought in his measure, and he had practically nothing to say to it.  Is it his defence to say &ldquo;I propose to answer whatever is said at the end of the debate?&rdquo; There was no indication and no assurance to the Dáil, that there was going to be any attempt at allaying any public apprehension there might be in connection with this measure.  &ldquo;In the course of my observations I said these are satisfactory.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The man who shuts himself up in Government Buildings and has his bed there does not know what is happening outside.  What are the facts of the case?  Is it not a fact that a Bill can be introduced here at 3 o'clock, passed at midnight, and sent immediately to the Governor-General? If that is admitted is it a danger or is the amendment a safeguard for the people who are looking for stability in this country?  There is no scare about my statement, because if you do not mean that, if you want to ensure the people against that happening, tell us what you are going to do about amending this measure here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here is a Bill which acts improperly towards the Constitution.  It practically tears the clothes off the Constitution. It is on a part with the other measures introduced.  There is here a Constitution&mdash;Bunreacht&mdash;and it can be changed in less than nine hours.  All <Col N="2287" /> you require in connection with that is a sufficient number of heads or bodies on the far side of the House to get their own whim through.  They will pass any Bill that the Executive Council tries to impose on the President or that the President tries to impose on them.  What is the position in the country at present with regard to finance?  How many millions of Savings Certificates are there?  How many millions are there in the Post Office? What is to prevent a measure coming along here to deflate our currency and presenting those people with a half or three-quarters or any other fraction of the sums they have advanced to the State?  Is that the intention?  If it be not the intention give them that security.  That is possible, before this measure passes into law.  If it be not your intention to inflate or deflate, if it be your intention to pay back the money borrowed, if you want the people to keep their money where it is in the Post Office or in the Savings Certificates, assure them that you cannot within nine hours reduce the value of that money which they have lent to the State.</P>
    <P>No case has been made for this amendment.  What case is required to be made for it?  It is admitted that a Bill can pass into law in the space of four or five hours.  The banks close at 3 o'clock.  The Post Office Savings Bank is closed at some hour in the evening&mdash;6 or 7 o'clock&mdash;and they cannot get out their savings certificates and so on.  We want to ensure stability and to give the people every possible safeguard known to the law, and the answer is that no case has been made for this.  What is their case at present?  There are two Houses.  Supposing, for a moment, that there was a corrupt majority in the Seanad, at the worst it will occupy two days before a measure passes.</P>

      <P>No, I did not, and I will remind the Minister of his opposition and of the opposition of his Leader and his Party, and all the condemnations they uttered about it. They have falsified and swallowed them all, but, to use a phrase in the Gospel, the dog has returned to his vomit. If that were a bad Bill, why do you use it?  The people who used those phrases, and who were responsible for all that condemnation and opposition, know now that they were wrong in their criticism and condemnation. They tell us now that they know what constitutions are, and what is necessary to safeguard the people's interests, and so on.  They are the guardians of stability and so on.  When I was a Minister of this State, I was informed by the Ministry of Finance of the seriousness of big sums of money that were borrowed by the State under savings certificates and in the Post Office.  I did not put up this when opposing this measure, because I thought there was some little common sense in the Ministry.  Why not let the people in at once?  It is admitted that a measure can become law here in a few hours.  That is admitted, and it will not be extended for the reason that it is our amendment &mdash;only because they did not think of it. Just look at what is introduced here&mdash; a continual series of chops&mdash;and it took a fortnight to consider it.  That Bill is probably a tribute to the consideration measures get that are brought in by the Ministry to this House.</P>

      <P>I do not know if there are going to be any further speakers, or if we are going to have any more of this repetition.  I say again that the only aim is to suggest that any majority of the people's representatives were going to do such things as the Opposition have suggested.  I hold that it is throwing contempt on the whole idea of responsible government and representative government to make the suggestions that have been made. If there is going to be this irresponsible majority in this House, then I say that there is no protection, and the Deputy who has spoken has just admitted that there is no protection.</P>

      <P>It is nearer to what he said originally, that it was going to tax their ingenuity, and the suggested protection is that the ingenuity of an irresponsible and corrupt majority is going to be taxed.  We know that where measures of the kind suggested have been taken, they have been taken hurriedly, and that there are ways and means by which the proposed method of delay could be defeated if there were an irresponsible Ministry which would be supported by a majority.  It is no protection.  It is simply a suggestion that there are intentions, on the part of the majority here in this House, to despoil citizens.</P>

      <P>That is the suggestion behind it, and I say that if there are sound financial conditions in this country, and if there is stability, it certainly is not due to anything that the Opposition have done to bring about a situation of that sort, because the whole of their attitude has been to try and bring about unstable conditions. Every one of their public speeches has been aimed at that object. As I say, therefore, no case whatever has been made out for this, and we are not going to give way to the suggestion that there is going to be here, or that there is going to be elected by the people, an irresponsible Ministry of the type suggested.</P>

      <P>As usual, the President has only to get up to make a case for one of his Bills to persuade any person, who is not led away by his mere logic chopping and who looks at the full facts in the case, that the case he is making is unsound in itself and unsound for the country.  No majority should be given the absolute powers that are proposed <Col N="2290" /> to be given here, and that the President thinks a majority ought to have. There ought to be some checks.  I do not care what Party is in power, whether it be our Party or the President's Party, there ought to be some checks.  Party despotism and Party bossism is very often worse than the bossism of one man.  There ought to be every safeguard for the unfortunate people of this country to protect themselves from the powers even of a passing majority of that kind to do what they wish.  What is the position of the President? The position is that nobody dare criticise him when he brings in mad measures undermining the stability of the country, no matter how deleterious to the country the measures may be, or no matter what damage they may inflict on the country, because by doing so you lay yourself open to the charge of undermining the stability of the country.  In that way the President has tried again to down every criticism in this House and through the country.  Everybody listening to him must be quite clear, not merely from what he says but from the way he says it, that the man brooks no opposition or criticism. His plea always is that any criticism, or any attempt to open the eyes of the country to the danger of the part the Government is pursuing is damaging the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is our duty to tell the country whither the policy of the Government is leading and whither this particular policy is leading.  It is usual to say, in connection with measures of this kind, that no matter what the Government may do there may be other Government that will abuse the powers that are proposed to be given. I am convinced that the present Government will abuse the powers now being given in every line of this Bill. They themselves were the first to oppose the granting of similar powers to a Government and, as Deputy Cosgrave has pointed out, no Government has so abused those powers as the men on the opposite benches. What guarantee have we that they, backed up by their followers, will pay the slightest attention to the wishes of the country or to the welfare of the <Col N="2291" /> country?  Personally, I do not believe they will pay the slightest attention. It is usual to pay a sort of tribute that, though these powers are there and may be abused, they are sure that the present Government will not abuse them.  I wish I could feel that way about it, but I am perfectly sure that the present Government will abuse these powers.  Such powers as these should not be given into the hands of the Government&mdash;powers, as Deputy Cosgrave said, from night to morning to ruin the whole economic fabric of this country.  There should be something that would make the Government pause, and up to the present the necessity for such a pause has been there.</P>
    <P>I am not going into the question of whatever efforts are being made for the building up of the industries of this country and so on.  That can be dealt with some other time, but I say that the very policy and politics of the head of the Executive Council are not giving a fair chance even to that policy of building up our industries. He is undermining, as far as any man can do it, the whole sense of responsibility and stability in this country, and when an effort is made to save the country from that mad policy he gets up here and tries to throw the blame on the other side.  That dodge is time-worn by this time.  That is the man who thinks he can tear up the Constitution and who removes one House of the Oireachtas altogether&mdash; a most fundamental change&mdash;and what is his attitude?  He has to make no case.  He can come in here and tear up fundamental Articles of the Constitution and it is not his business to make a case.  When an effort is made, as this amendment tries to do, to put a limit to certain powers that this Bill gives into the hands of the Government, we have a tornado of had argument and abuse from the President.</P>
    <P>It is time that the country should be allowed to see precisely where it is going.  The plea of the President is that we are adding to the instability of the country, whereas our main purpose, in and out of office, has been <Col N="2292" /> to secure stability in this country for industry and everything else.  The President, if he has his ears to the ground, must know that he is undermining any confidence that the people have in this country and its future. Now that the Dáil has accepted the principle of one House, I think we will be the only country in the world left with those supreme powers in the hands of the Executive, in the hands of one Party in a legislative body. I do not think there is in the whole of Europe&mdash;there may be in Russia, as is suggested here, but I cannot say the President possibly knows a great deal more about that than I do&mdash;any country in which such power is given into the hands of a majority in a single legislative Chamber as this Bill proposes.  When an effort is made to ward off some of the damage that this Bill proposes to do we have to listen to speeches such as the President has given us this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another case which I have to make in this connection. I expected that there might have been an argument that a week was not sufficient time to give in connection with a Money Bill.  I took the precaution of looking up the dates on which the Central Fund Bills were introduced into this House since the foundation of the State and the dates of their passage.  In the year 1923, which is practically the first year, the Bill was introduced on 26th March; in the year 1924, on 27th March; in 1925, on 25th March; in 1926, on 25th March; in 1927, on 15th March; in 1928, on 20th March; in 1929, on 7th March; and in the remaining years on 7th, 18th, 15th, 15th and 7th March respectively.  There was ample time in every case, with the exception of the first two years.  That is the test in respect of our experience over 12 years&mdash;ample time with the exception of the first two years.  On the question of time, can there be an argument made against this amendment that will stand, having regard to our experience?  Out of the 12 years only the first two years would have been a day or two short, supposing that this were the law then. I am prepared to concede at once that <Col N="2293" /> while the Seanad had 21 days under the Constitution, the Dáil did not give them 21 days except, perhaps, on one occasion.  Nevertheless, they never held up one of these Bills and nobody went short of his wages or salary by reason of a delay taking place in connection with one of those measures.</P>
      <P>Let us understand exactly where we are.  The two Appropriation Bills, which provide money for the expenditure during the year, should pass into law by 1st April and 1st August respectively.  If there has to be a third one you can go down to 1st October or November, as the case may be.  These are the only two occasions in respect of which any case can be made, regarding interference with the ordinary administration of State funds. On examination you will find that it was only in the first two years out of the 12 that the time would not have been sufficient.  You may get a case in which in future a Central Fund Bill will be introduced on 31st March and passed that night.  Normally, the representatives of the people here have a right to express their opinions upon the expenditure of public money.  They are, one and all&mdash;no one more and no one less than another&mdash;responsible to  people.  They have been sent here by the people.  They have to account for the money.  It is not the Government's money.  It is not money belonging to the Government Party.  It is not money belonging to the various branches of their organisation or to any political organisation which returns a sufficient number of members to form a Government.  There should be sufficient time for the discussion of the expenditure of public money.  If this Bill passes into law, as I said the Central Fund Bill can be introduced on 31st March to be law on 1st April. They have a sledge-hammer over the heads of the members.  If they do not vote the money, old age pensions cannot be paid; labourers in the service of the Board of Works, people entitled to pensions of one sort or another, even the humble office-cleaner, cannot get paid.  You will have the option of saying whether you will vote it or have more discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2294" /> A case might possibly be made if it could be shown that even in recent years a week would not have been sufficient.  But the President has not got even that piece of solid ground to stand upon in connection with this amendment.  Other than that, the passage of this amendment would have no effect and no force by way of hampering the Administration in connection with the ordinary transaction of public business here.  Everybody knows that the Government can to-morrow introduce tariffs and proposals for taxation into this House and, once the resolution is passed, it is operative the next day.  That is not interfered with by this amendment. The safeguard, as I have said, with regard to this amendment, is that people will know that not overnight is the law of this country going to be changed, particularly with regard to the things that must matter most in these difficult economic times&mdash;public moneys and so on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The President has suggested, in the first place, that no case has been made out for this amendment and, in the second place, that the whole object of the amendment is to throw contempt on the idea of representative Government.  I should like to recall to the President that it was the mover of this amendment who gave representative Government to this country in the teeth of the opposition of the present President of the Executive Council.  To suggest that the mover of this amendment, after the service he has given to the State, is bringing in an amendment for no other purpose than to throw contempt on the fabric of the State that he himself helped to build up and gave to the people of this country is an unworthy suggestion, to put it at its very mildest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No case has been made out, says the President, for this amendment. Perhaps not, but he made out the best case for this amendment by his own words and by the attitude he adopted towards it.  He relied on the fact that he had stated to the House on Second Reading that he proposed to amend, or to have amended, the Standing Orders of this House to enable certain delay <Col N="2295" /> to take place between the various stages of controversial and important Bills.  Is that not making out a case for this amendment?  Is it not admitting the very reason at the back of this amendment proposed by Deputy Cosgrave, that there must be some delay, some chance for the people to get breathing space and time for consideration? When the President admits, as he admitted in his Second Reading speech, and as he has admitted to-day, the necessity for delay between the various stages of a Bill, is it not just making the case for this amendment, the whole fundamental reason at the back of which is the necessity for delay?</P>
    <P>Then the President asks if there is a suggestion that in three days a Bill may be withdrawn.  There is such a suggestion.  A Bill may be rushed through this House some afternoon very seriously prejudicing the financial structure of this State.  After the present Executive have finished carving up the Constitution and have left its bleeding corpse to die, there will be only one safeguard for the people of this country, and that is the safeguard of public opinion&mdash;strong, militant public opinion&mdash;and if a measure is passed by a majority in this House that outrages public opinion, it may be that the Executive, corrupt as they may be and strong as they may think they are, will have to bow before the storm of public opinion that may arise in this country in three or seven days if this amendment were passed.</P>

      <P>There is no difference, of course.  When we speak of delay, it is all the same whether the delay is after a Bill has passed this House or delay during the stages before it passes.  Now, we find that the purpose of the amendment, as we are told, is to bring about a situation in which, <Col N="2296" /> when the majority of the elected representatives of the people, in the national interest, as we must assume, or otherwise we have no hope in responsible Government at all, have passed a measure, we are to allow people who are opposed to that measure and who may think themselves somehow or other aggrieved by it, to stir up a condition here which would make government impossible.  Is that not it?  That is clearly the argument put forward, and it is, I must say, a very interesting contribution to this debate, because now, for the first time, we have got what is at the back of the minds of those who have moved this amendment. I said that no case had been made.  I had a suspicion that the real reason was something like the case made by the former Attorney-General, and now the cat is out of the bag.  Now we understand why it is going to be proposed here that, when the Dáil has passed a measure, when a majority of the people's representatives have passed a measure, in the national interest, as we must assume it to be, we are going to have elements ontside trying to defeat them by stirring up a condition of practical revolt.</P>

      <P>A number of Deputies have been listening to the statement made by Deputy Costello, and I think they can interpret it fairly well for themselves, and I leave it to those as to whether or not I have given a fair interpretation of what the Deputy has said.  Our attitude is that, in the long run, there is only one safeguard for the people, and that is in the responsibility of the people's elected <Col N="2297" /> representatives.  There is no other safeguard, and the sooner everybody recognises that the better, and the sooner that every Deputy realises that on him and on his general attitude towards the interests of the people depends the welfare of the people, so far as law can make it, the better.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder has the President any sense of responsibility or any sense of the ridiculous when he talks about stirring up revolt against the elected representatives of the people?  Will he look into his heart and see what it answers him on that point.  &ldquo;Stirring up revolt&rdquo;&mdash;that was the neat phrase about militant public opinion.  If some of the learned Deputies on the other side think that when the word &ldquo;militant&rdquo; is used it has something to do with appearing in arms, let them ask <Col N="2298" /> some of their priestly friends what does the &ldquo;Church Militant&rdquo; mean. But there was a military revolt in this country against democratic Government by the man who is now prating about responsibility and about Deputies beginning to realise how much on each individual depends the welfare of the country.  That was not his old time song.  Then we have instability, and we are the cause of it.

The President has spoken of instability being caused.  By what?  By this amendment?  Does anybody here say that there is no possibility that a Government at its wits' end with <Col N="2299" /> regard to taxation and unable to get a loan will commandeer?  In the circumstances of a Government harassed by its inability to impose further taxation, because the exaggeration point has been reached, and by its inability to get a loan because of its policy, is there any reason to suspect that there might be measures of the rather forcible loan type introduced?  Is it harassing the Government to say that, having regard to those things, Money Bills should be subject to a particular delay, and that other Bills should be subject to a certain abount of delay?  Will the passing of such a clause make for stability?  Will the failure to permit such a clause to be discussed even moderately and calmly not make for instability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Costello has referred to the President's statement that he would introduce Standing Orders.  We should like to see them.  They should have been produced at the time this measure was produced, so that we could see the alternatives.  The President realises the necessity for putting off the anxieties of the people by some nonsense about Standing Orders, but he has not indicated that he has an idea in his head as to what should be the contents of those Standing Orders.  In a representative Government&mdash;we have examples of it elsewhere than here&mdash; as conducted in most countries, and in countries where there has been a bigger tradition and a longer tradition with regard to that than there is here, they always had a Second Chamber and consequent delay.  There are some countries which have not dumped their Second House.  How many are there? What is their type?  What is their recent history?  Would the President enquire how many of the countries that have not a Second Chamber, or that have precluded their Second Chamber from interfering in financial matters, have not some alternative method of delay in the passage of financial resolutions? Here we are supposed to be condemning or finding fault with the representative Government because we say that there should be some period of delay allowed in respect of <Col N="2300" /> Money Bills.  The President must remember his own recent experience in regard to the finances of this country. There was an attempt to get a loan. The Minister for Finance, in looking for that loan, referred to this country as one of the members of the Commonwealth. He compared our situation with that of other members of the Commonwealth.  He failed to get the return.  He certainly paraded himself before groups in this country as the Minister who had brought about a good financial situation here.  He then said that, whether it was of his making or of others' making in handing over to him, there was a good financial situation here, and one that should tempt people to lend.  His colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, could say here a few weeks later that people were fools to have put their money into that loan. Nobody but a fool would expect persons to invest at such a low rate of interest if&mdash;he did not say there were&mdash; there were other investments in which money could be placed.  There, at any rate, you have the wheedling first and the denunciation afterwards.  There was an attempt to coax money out of the people.  It did not succeed.  In his usual brazen fashion the Minister for Industry and Commerce said afterwards: &ldquo;No wonder it failed.&rdquo;  Supposing even his methods failed, the Government must get money.  Where is it to be got?</P>
    <P>Can we forecast their conduct in relation to such a serious thing as the people's property and the people's money by what they have done in other respects?  Has it not been only at the last moment and with great difficulty that they have been prevented by the courts of the country from infringing on personal liberty?  They have no shame about what they have attempted.  Judging from the arguments on this Bill the fact is that the courts, in their minds, have apparently done wrong.  Why should we think property will be more sacred than people's liberty?  This amendment does not take away power.  It stops a measure, for a period, from coming into force.  It provides for a necessary period of delay in order to <Col N="2301" /> allow the people to understand a measure.  We are told, of course, that it is laughable at the moment to consider the probability of a measure being brought in here at three o'clock, with a guillotine resolution, and passed at 10.30 that night.  Stranger things were to happened.  If such a thing were to happen is it unreasonable that if it is not a Money Bill three days should be allowed so that the people would get to know what was on, and that if it were a Money Bill there should be seven days' delay for that and other purposes?</P>
    <P>The President sees red over the phrase &ldquo;militant public opinion.&rdquo; Did he object to it all through his life?  Does he think it is not right to have public opinion militant in the country?  I think it is.  I think it is the duty of the Opposition to a measure&mdash;where they have had demands for the creation of such an opinion&mdash;to create it.  They can do that, must do it, have been doing it and will continue to do it within the law.  It is part of their duty, and the public opinion they create may be more or less militant according to the importance they attach, or that they can make the people attach, to a particular measure.  Do not let there be any confusion or any fear of this word &ldquo;militant.&rdquo;  It is a good word. It has a recognised meaning and a limited meaning.  That is the meaning which Deputy Costello gave to it, and which I gave to it.  This amendment gives us an opportunity of delay.  It is a reasonable thing to ask for on the case that has been made for it.</P>

      <P>The President has apparently objected to something that I stated.  He appears to think there was something illegal in the few statements I made, and that there was something very disgraceful in the former Attorney-General having made those statements.  I made those statements very deliberately, and chose the words &ldquo;strong militant public opinion&rdquo; very deliberately for the purpose of drawing the President, and I successfully drew him.  On the Second Reading of this Bill I again pointed out that one of the dangers that were facing the country if this <Col N="2302" /> Bill were passed into law was the fact that Article IX of the Constitution would be placed in serious jeopardy &mdash;Article IX which guarantees the right of free expression of opinion.  I hold&mdash;and because I hold very strongly I made the statement which I made to-night&mdash;that the constitutional right of free expression of opinion is the strongest safeguard which exists in this country against unconstitutional and illegal action.  It is perfectly clear from the President's statement to-night that he has no use for the free expression of opinion, and that he regards it as sedition&mdash;the present Government are very found of the crime of sedition&mdash;to criticise Government measures when they become law. A hundred years ago it was laid down by British judges, even at a time when democracy was in its infancy in England, that one of the great constitutional liberties of the British subject was to criticise Bills that had been passed by the King and his Ministers and Parliament.  It was proper for the British subjects, in the exercise of their constitutional rights, to criticise the King's Ministers, and the measures which the Ministers proposed to the King for his adoption.  It is perfectly obvious now that in this Irish Free State the Irish citizens are not to be allowed to criticise the King's Ministers, or the measures which the King's Ministers will propose for the King to give his signature to after they have passed, in a few hours, through this Dáil.</P>

      <P>A couple of things were said by the President that, I think, should not be passed by without letting in the light.  As Deputy Costello stated, it was quite evident an attempt was made to create confusion between the word &ldquo;militant&rdquo; and the word &ldquo;military,&rdquo; and while that was not obvious to those on the back benches it was quite clear to the President himself.</P>

      <P>I cannot look into his mind.  But let us come to the attitude of the President.  What is it? According to his statement what, in fact, is it?  All the time it has been that he is head of the Government, that criticism of himself is not legitimate, criticism of the man chosen by a majority of the Irish people, or of his policy, is not to be allowed.  That is the obvious position that has been taken up by the President.  It is the full force of his arguments here.  If a majority of this House, possibly a chance majority of five or six, without the full support of the Labour Party, or possibly the casting vote of the Ceann Comhairle, pass a law jeopardising the future prosperity of this country, according to the President once that happens to be passed there can be no public opinion loudly expressed against it.  That would be wrong.  It cannot be done.  The chosen of Heaven and the chosen of the people have said so.  He has pronounced <i>ex-cathedra</i> a verdict on the whole thing.  He has got a majority here.  We have listened this evening to some extraordinary lessons from the President.  He often gives them to us. Apparently, according to the new democracy, the rights of the people are completely identical with Single Chamber Government, without any delay whatever to what they do.  In that case, I am afraid there is hardly any democracy, with the possible exception of the one not mentioned&mdash;and I cannot speak for that&mdash;existing in the world at present.  Is there any country in the world in the recent past where you have democracy existing, where such powers are given into the hands of a momentary majority in one single House as you have in this case?  Surely the President's argument carries him a great deal further than he is prepared to blazon forth now, that he has got a mandate for his policy.  Is not that so?  Have not the Fianna Fáil Party been elected merely to support him and his policy?  Is not that the verdict of the Irish people?  If the Seanad dares to oppose him it can be wiped away <Col N="2304" /> because it flouted that pronouncement? Can we not do without the Dáil?  Is not that the policy that has got a mandate?  What is the necessity for the Dáil?</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>If you allow me, Sir, I am answering the precise arguments of the President, in which he pointed out that our amendment is devoted towards doing away with democracy.  If you remember the arguments of the President, I am pointing out what they mean.  Not merely would they mean that in theory, but I am convinced they are going to mean that in practice, so far as Money Bills and so far as interference with the property of the people is concerned, I am quite convinced that he will get his tame majority.  If he does not he will dispense with it.  He is chosen; they are not chosen.  They are merely elected to support him.  If there is any foundation, or if there is any genuine belief in the arguments he urged, that this amendment is put forward merely to cause uneasiness, let him accept it, and the uneasiness will disappear to a large extent.  Why can he not do that when he knows perfectly well that the amendment is justified?  That is the reason he is not accepting it.  The President's whole line is that he is the chosen of the majority, and, therefore, the majority is right.  The argument does not go the other way round, as the President knows.  He has proved that in the past.  He was always in favour of majority rule.  He told us so.  God help majority rule in that case.  We know now what he meant by the majority rule that he prated about, that he was always in favour of, and we can only hope that he will not be as favourable to it in the future as in the past.  If so, it is a poor look-out for the majority in this country, and a poor look-out for the people, if they can trust that he will not abuse, and grossly abuse, the powers given here.  It is not by any means necessary for democratic Government that the whim of a majority should be given immediate effect to, without the people <Col N="2305" /> being allowed to express an opinion. I have not yet read of any country where that is the conception of democracy. The steps the President took suggest that.  Therefore, that has become a democratic gospel and he puts forward this particular abuse of opponents on a complete misunderstanding. It is quite obvious that he is not going to allow criticism of any measure once he has support.  That is much more fundamental than any law of morality, of the Church or of anything else.</P>

      <P>I can only repeat what I said at the beginning, that there has been no case whatever made for the amendment.  There were suggestions of delay, and a general case for the advisability of delay, but there was no case made for the amendment we are discussing.  I asked Deputies to look at what was proposed.  It proposes that every Finance Bill that passes the Dáil should be suspended for seven days, before it can become law; not one introduced here in the morning and passed at night, but that for every single financial measure passed by the House there should be given to the Opposition seven days in which they can do everything they may think will serve their purpose as a factious Opposition.  I suppose Deputies will say that such things are not conceivable, that there are no such things as factious Oppositions, that are ready to oppose everything the Government does.  There are factious Oppositions and irresponsible Oppositions that have to be guarded against, just as carefully as irresponsible Governments. I suggest that Governments have responsibility, that they have something to sober them, but that there is nothing to sober a factious Opposition.  This amendment, if accepted, would give a factious Opposition at any time seven days in which they could do everything they wanted to stir up panic and to create this militant feeling.  I did not have to wait until now to be told the meaning of the word &ldquo;militant.&rdquo;  Of course, we are all babies, and we have to be lectured on simple English words.  We have got to be told the meaning of the <Col N="2306" /> word militant.  The Professor of English is going to tell us what it means at this hour of the day.  What did the ex-Attorney-General suggest?  He suggested that this action would compel an Executive that got a majority of the Dáil in favour of its measures to give up because of the trouble that would be created by a factious Opposition. That is the meaning I take of this. I am not prepared to put such a weapon into the hands of any factious Opposition. That is a thing we have to expect with every finance measure passed here, and some few other measures. There are three days or seven days, as the case may be, in which the Opposition can do their utmost to try to create opposition; people without any responsibility who want, as some members on the other side said, by every means in their power to put the Government on the rocks.  Irresponsibility would damage the country as a whole.  I, for one, and this Executive Council, am not going to put such a weapon into the hands of such a factious Opposition.  We have not yet adverted to the second part of the amendment, that referring to the new definition of a Money Bill.  It is no harm to see what would be the effect of that part of the amendment.  It deletes the word &ldquo;only&rdquo; from the definition of a Money Bill.  That means that in future any measure under which any one of the powers indicated would be taken, makes such a Bill a Money Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not provide for any court or any person to determine whether it is or is not a Money Bill.  It places on the Executive Council the responsibility of saying whether or not the measure is a Money Bill.  If it were a Money Bill, it would be held up for seven days.  If it were not a Money Bill, it could be put through in three days.  If the Executive Council decided that it was not a Money Bill and presented it to the Governor-General for signature within three days, then the question of whether the Executive Council was right or not would have to be determined, by the courts if the Opposition decided to contest the matter.  That would bring about an almost impossible position.  I have not <Col N="2307" /> referred to it before, because I should oppose this amendment, in any event, on account of the first portion.  It would equally have to be opposed on account of the second portion because of the unworkable position which would be created by it.</P>

      <P>It is rather interesting to follow the President's reasoning. It is necessary to prevent a factious Opposition&mdash;and there may be factious Oppositions&mdash;from doing certain things. Let us consider that argument from another angle.  Is it necessary to prevent an iresponsible Government&mdash; and there may be irresponsible Governments&mdash;from taking certain courses of action?  The President said that the Government had something to sober them.  They have also, at the moment, a great deal to intoxicate them.  Many men&mdash;and I suppose Governments&mdash; have been driven to drink by despair. Where is irresponsibility more apparent at the moment?  Compare recent history, compare records or anything you like on any subject akin to this&mdash; the question of the liberty of the subject. Who has been the more irresponsible, the Government or the factious Opposition?  Let us take the line of reasoning the President has adopted. He is not here to be taught the meaning of simple English words.  There were&mdash;if we were allowed to go into history we could show this&mdash;many simple English words of the correct meaning of which the President clearly had no idea until force taught him what the meaning was.  Force, operated by a Government functioning in the name of the people, gave him an appreciation of the meaning of English words and other things.  It may be that the President does not want to be told the meaning of these words. He knows what the meaning of the word &ldquo;militant&rdquo; is, but there is to be a variant and gloss put upon the whole thing.  What did the late Attorney-General suggest?  What a field is open to the imagination when one is allowed to think of what the President suggests any time he even attempts to speak plain English.  The late Attorney-General, according to <Col N="2308" /> the President, suggested that this factious Opposition would do all they could and then, with a few more fumbling words, we are brought to a stage of panic, in the President's imagination.  He speaks of &ldquo;the panic that has been created.&rdquo;  What precisely can the Opposition do in the circumstances suggested?  They may hold meetings.  They may engage in what, in their opinion, is the education of the people regarding the dangers inherent in some measure that has been passed.  Is that wrong?  If it is, say plainly and openly that freedom of speech is going to be put down, that the right to assemble peaceably, to hold meetings and join associations within the law is not going to be allowed.  We suspect that is coming. The right of free speech and the right of peaceably and in an orderly manner to assemble can be put down on foot of the same arguments used here tonight, because you can import into a plain phrase like &ldquo;getting a militant public opinion&rdquo; all the suggestiveness the President has introduced regarding the late Attorney-General's use of this phrase about the seven-day delay in the case of one type of Bill and a three-day delay in the case of another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the President think that it is open to him to talk about the Government as if nothing could be alleged against it when we have present to our minds the memorable phrase that it pleased him on one occasion to serve out gall and wormwood to his opponents.  Suppose the Minister for Industry and Commerce wants to serve out gall and wormwood to those people who were not foolish enough to subscribe to his colleague's National Loan. That was the phrase that was wrapped round one measure.  That was the mentality behind a particular piece of legislation.  We are told that the President is not going to allow the Opposition to operate even in the seven-day delaying period against the Government because somebody used the phrase that the object was to &ldquo;put the Government on the rocks.&rdquo;  Whoever used that phrase had not much appreciation of English words, because the Government is there already.  Has not the cry gone out during the past few <Col N="2309" /> months that it is the duty of everybody to come and man the pumps.  The ship is rammed home on the rocks, leaking badly and everybody has been called in to man the pumps.  A big leakage may possibly occur hereafter in a part not yet broached&mdash;the financial part&mdash; and all that is required is that the people should know, over a period of seven days, what is happening and be allowed to do what they may do in that period.  The President thinks, with all the suggestiveness he has read into the proposal, that it is an attempt to create a panic.  The country has survived many things.  It will even survive the present Government.  Its credit will even survive the failure of the last National Loan and the way in which that was brought about.  It will get over those things&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In Part II, in the second column relating to Article XLI, to insert after the word &ldquo;Eireann&rdquo; the words &ldquo;the insertion after the words &lsquo;Executive Council shall present&rsquo; of the words &lsquo;not earlier than three clear days after the passage of any Bill&rsquo;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Much of what was said on the previous amendment has reference to this amendment also, with perhaps this difference, that only three days are stipulated for in this amendment.  Of course, the amendment is framed to deal with hasty legislative action on the part of the Dáil.  In essence, the President in his reply on the Second Reading of the Bill, admitted that some consideration would be given towards amending the Standing Orders to provide for some delay.  I do not know exactly what was meant by the words &ldquo;provide for some delay.&rdquo;  If they meant that it is not proposed, in the alteration of the Constitution which is now taking place, to facilitate hasty legislation, then he has admitted that there is a case for this amendment.  As I said before, the Standing Orders can be suspended by a majority of one in this House.  One may have all the safeguards necessary or desirable and they can be taken away at the same sitting of the Dáil which would pass a Bill. Three clear days afford an opportunity for consideration of a measure that is passed, either on the part of the Executive or their advisors or on the part of members of the Dáil, and provide an opportunity also of making representations in connection with the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be that occasion may be taken by the President or his supporters to point out that in 1923 a Bill was introduced and passed through the Dáil and the Seanad in a single day authorising the Governor-General to put his signature to a Bill.  It must be remembered that that Act authorising the Governor-General to put his signature to a Bill had reference to a set of circumstances and to another measure which had been under the consideration of the Dáil and of the Seanad for a considerable period and the Constitution, as it then ran, provided that a measure could be held up if a petition were presented within a week, either by, as far as my recollection goes, two-fifths of the members of the Dáil <Col N="2313" /> or a number of members of the Seanad.  As it was enacted that that petition or those delays should be provided for, it was found by the Courts that one week should elapse from the passage of an Act through the Oireachtas before it could be signed by the Governor-General.  As I have said that Bill had been before the Dáil for a considerable time.  This amendment which is now proposed, ensures that four days will be occupied from the time of the introduction of a measure, or 3½ days as the case may be, until it is signed by the Governor-General. The principle of this amendment stands confessed by the President himself.  I am not wedded to the particular form in which it is presented here.  To the principle of it I am wedded&mdash;that a Bill should occupy at least three days from the date of its introduction until it becomes law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no use in repeating the arguments which I have already used on the previous amendment. They apply almost equally to this amendment.  My view is that if a delay is deemed to be necessary, the point suggested in the amendment is not the point at which delay ought to occur.  When a majority of the Dáil have decided, having considered a Bill in its various stages, on the passing of a measure I think there should be no delay proposed at that stage in making the measure law by having it signed and the whole legal procedure completed.  If there is to be a delay, the delay ought to be at some point in the consideration of the Bill by the Dáil.  I have admitted only one thing&mdash;that a case can be made in the Dáil, in the sole Legislature, for a certain delay and a certain more mature consideration, if you like, about the Report Stage where, for example, a Committee of the Dáil would examine the Bill from the point of view of the possibility of changes in drafting or changes of that sort and perhaps an examination to see whether there were not some implications that had possibly been missed in the Committee Stage and on Second Reading.  I admit that a case <Col N="2314" /> can be made for delay about that stage but I am not going to admit that any case has been made at all for delay when a majority of the Dáil has passed the measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears then that the argument is not that the delay in itself is dangerous; it is only the point at which the delay will occur.  That point of view has now been expressed with the peculiarly implied argument that it is right to hold up the majority from committing a mistake but that it is not right to point it out to them once they have committed it. Perhaps I misunderstood the President. I understood him to say that there was a case for holding a Bill up for better examination about the Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When that better examination has not been given and the Bill has passed, then it is wrong, even though something objectionable may be found in the measure, to hold it up: to have a period of delay.  That is the only argument that the President used.  At any rate it is not clear that the President envisages the necessity for getting measures through in, say, 48 hours, because he does feel himself that there is a case some time hereafter to be made and some time hereafter to be met for introducing a delaying period round about the Report Stage. Therefore, delay itself is not the objectionable feature.  It is the point at which it is introduced.  What other argument is there from what the President has said except what I have indicated?  It is a good thing to have delay on the Report Stage for better examination, but it is a wrong thing to have mistakes pointed out before they are committed and before the Bill has been acted on.  At any rate the delay here suggested is not the dangerous matter.  The President has not brought that other proposal forward. In regard to ordinary measures he is moving away from the stage in which there is considerably more delay than three days.  At present there is a minimum delay of three days after the passage of a Bill by this House and the taking of it by the Seanad.  That is the situation at the moment.  No argument has been used <Col N="2315" /> against the three days.  The President thinks it would be better to have some delay on Report Stage but not after the Final Stage.</P>

Of course, there is a big difference between delay before the Final Stage has been taken by the Dáil and delay at a later period. Suppose that after the three days and when a Bill had become law it was still found there were mistakes, were we to wait then for a further period: for the three days to be extended to six days, the six days to nine days, and so on?  Surely there ought to be a certain finality where making a measure law is concerned.  If the law is felt not to be a wise one there will be all the ordinary political agitation in regard to it.  I would point out to the Deputies opposite what their own experience has been: that with all their care, even after Bills had passed the Seanad, they had to bring in amending legislation.  What I object to is keeping a Bill suspended with inducements to a factious Opposition, if it were so minded, to create a dangerous situation from the point of view of public order, public peace and good government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say then that there is no Deputy on the opposite benches who ought not to be able to realise the difference there is between delay introduced in the consideration of a Bill here and this suspending of a Bill for no reason.  Why was the period of three days chosen?  Is that to be taken as a magic number in which the people can be so organised as to bring sufficient pressure on the Executive to withdraw the Bill?  In practice it would mean that whatever Executive was in office would have to come to the Dáil and say: &ldquo;Now that there has been such public disapproval of this measure it will have to be withdrawn.&rdquo; The thing would be quite impossible in practice, and the Deputies on the opposite benches know that as well as I do.  They would resist any such amendment just as I am resisting this, because of the power that it would <Col N="2316" /> give irresponsible persons to do harm at a critical stage.  When a Bill is passed that is not the end of it.  There are the ordinary methods of political agitation to get a change of policy and to get a Bill improved.  There is no suggestion that all that would not go on.  The point at which delay is introduced is then an important one and that is why the Deputies opposite in their arguments did not advert to that. As I have said, no case has been made for this particular amendment.</P>

      <P>There is no end to hair-splitting.  It is dangerous to introduce a period of three days' delay after a measure has passed the Final Stage, but it is not dangerous to introduce it between Committee and Report.  What is the difference?  The President talks of a factious Opposition.  That is now a fixed idea with him.  He had others, but we got rid of them for him.  His fixed idea at the moment is that a factious Opposition may do damage in the three days.  How?  By agitation. Will they know the purpose of the Bill after it has passed Second Reading and after it has passed Committee Stage? Will they be in a position, at that period, to raise all the agitation that will be possible for them after it has passed the Fifth Stage?  Where is the difference?  It is incomprehensible to me, I confess.  It is not to him.  The President gives me up I know.  That is all right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to see it!  I do not get into the turn of reasoning the President has.  I would like the President to expound the difference between the agitation that may be raised to a measure after it has passed Fifth Stage with the three days' delay, and the agitation that may be raised to a measure between Committee and Report Stage.  Let us assume, for the sake of argument, a most factious Opposition, with none of that responsibility that a Government have or that even the present Government had when they were in Opposition.  Where is the difference?  The President has forgotten to make any comment upon  <Col N="2317" /> that at the moment there is delay.  We are moving away from that without a case being made for avoiding it.  There is a minimum delay of three days between the passage of a Bill by the Dáil and the taking of it by the Seanad.  What is the case for doing away with this minimum three days?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has rightly assumed that the President has despaired of explaining the matter to him.  I am a little bit more optimistic. In any case, I think that with a little effort we may make the Deputy understand the precise difference, as he states, as regards delay between Committee and Report Stage and after a Bill has passed its Final Stage.  If there is any case for agitation, any ground for public concern, or any need for amending a measure, at what stage is it desirable that that fact should become known?  Surely, while the measure is still before the Dáil when amendment can be made to it.  If there is delay between Committee and Report Stage, and any interest outside the Dáil wants to draw attention to the fact that it is being prejudicially affected by a particular measure and wants amendments inserted, the time in which it can make its wishes known is surely when the Bill is before the Dáil when amendment is still possible. After a Bill has passed, amendment of it is not possible.  Now that is the precise difference between the two proposals. Deputy MacGilligan says that he cannot understand that.  He probably can, but he is arguing for the sake of argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this amendment were adopted, what is going to happen in the three days after the Bill has been passed? The Bill cannot come back to the Dáil. If there is a case made for its amendment at that stage, what good is it going to be?  If the Deputies opposite merely desire an opportunity in which to criticise a Bill, they can keep on criticising it long after the three days have passed.  They can criticise it between the date of its passage and the date of the next general election.  I cannot contemplate what ideas they have in their minds at all.  Let us <Col N="2318" /> imagine the situation that will exist when this Bill is passed and another measure comes before the Dáil.  If this amendment were inserted in this Bill and another measure is then introduced and given a First Reading. It gets a Second Reading, passes Committee, Report and Final Stages, and then there are three days' delay.  For what?  On the first day Deputy Cosgrave will make a speech saying that the Bill was the worst ever introduced by the Government.  I think that is his usual speech.  On the second day General O'Duffy will say it is a good Bill and will criticise the Government for not having introduced it earlier, and on the third day Deputy MacDermot will make a speech trying to prove that there is no difference between Deputy Cosgrave and General O'Duffy.  It may be of some use to the Party opposite to have three days in which to engage in these exercises, but it is of no importance to anyone else, and I submit to them that, if they seriously consider this matter and are anxious to propose reasonable amendments to this Bill, they will withdraw the one now on the amendment paper, because it should not be produced even before a third-rate debating society.</P>

      <P>We have had two speeches from the Government's two leading lights, perhaps the two leading competents, if I might use those words, in the intellectual sphere, dominating the Executive Council.  We have had a confession from them that they did not read this measure when they were introducing it.  Both of them subscribed to the admission that some delay should take place.  They are now proposing to mutilate the Constitution. They are not proposing to correct in any respect the mutilation they are about to make.  As I said on a previous amendment, a Bill can be introduced any day at 3 o'clock and can be passed at 10.30 that night.  As I said in supporting this amendment, I am not <Col N="2319" /> wedded to the terms of it.  I want three days from its introduction until it becomes law.  Who has brought in this measure?  Is it the Opposition or the Government?  The Government has introduced a measure which, on examination, they now admit is faulty.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Then, if it is all right, there is no necessity for the President's statement that he proposed to examine the Standing Orders, after the measure had been criticised in this House on this basis; there is no necessity for the statement by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that it is on the Committee Stage there should be a delay. All you need do, apparently, is to bring in a measure, and it is bound to be all right.  But there is one Minister out of the whole lot who has admitted that the Seanad improved their measures, measures hastily conceived, hastily introduced and hastily passed by this House.  As soon as this Bill passes into law, there will be no Seanad to which you may look for improvement. What is the Government's contribution towards remedying the situation they are provoking?  I do not care by what method they settle conditions, but it is their business to introduce a Bill that will not make a laughing stock of the Constitution and of this Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard a very amusing speech, indeed.  This Bill is not a Bill dealing with the principle of delay.  The principle of this Bill is to have a one Chamber Legislature, to get rid of the Seanad as at present constituted.  The intention at the present stage anyhow is to have a one Chamber Legislature.  In that connection I said we were quite ready to listen to any argument that might be put forward against it.  I said on the Second Reading that the responsibility for putting forward arguments as to why there should be a Second Chamber rested on those who believed in it.  The ordinary idea of representative government does not carry a Second Chamber with it at all.  I said that historically it had no connection with it, that so far as reason and commonsense were <Col N="2320" /> concerned, and the whole idea of representative government was concerned, a Second Chamber did not come into it. One argument was put forward from the other side with regard to delays. I said that if that was the only point showing any justification for a Second Chamber, delay could be provided for in the Dáil itself, that it was quite consistent with the main idea of a Single Chamber Legislature.  I indicated also that we expected our Second Chamber was going to hold up this Bill as it held up others, that it was not going to vote its own demise and, therefore, that the question of changing the Standing Orders could only be properly approached when the Dáil has signified by a majority its desire to have a Single Chamber Legislature.  I said that when the Dáil has so indicated its desire, the question of the Standing Orders that would be consistent with a possible revision in relation to the period between the Committee and Report Stages and providing for a delay could be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the idea is that there should be delay, then I said that this was not the point at which delay should be introduced.  After all, those who put down an amendment are responsible for it.  In this instance I am refusing a specific amendment which has been introduced by the Opposition and I have given my reasons for voting against it.  That is all I intend to do.  That is all that is germane or appropriate to the debate.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has pointed out what, I am sure, Deputy McGilligan could quite easily see for himself&mdash;the difference between meeting opposition at the stage when amendments would be possible and meeting it at the stage at which amendment is practically impossible.  I would remind Deputies that further consequential changes of the whole Constitution would have to be introduced if this amendment were passed, in order to make it effective at all.  As it stands at the moment, if the Seanad disappeared, we could not withhold from the Governor-General a measure that had passed the Dáil. Suppose the Opposition were such that it was deemed advisable to make a change, all that could be done would <Col N="2321" /> be to introduce an amending measure. That is the only way in which the thing could be met.  Consequently, I say there is no case whatever made for the amendments tabled here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The President makes an extraordinary proposition.  When a Bill is introduced here for the purpose of making some change, it is everybody's duty to examine the conditions that are likely to exist when that Bill becomes law.  The President seems to me to dodge the question as to whether the condition that will be created if this Bill passes without this amendment, will be a desirable condition. He does not commit himself to any promise but he suggests that if this amendment is passed he will have the position examined, thus admitting that to pass the Bill without this amendment is going to create an undesirable situation in this country which will require to have something done to remedy it.  The Government has carefully jumped on one possible advantage to be got by this measure and they have assumed quite illogically that there can be no disadvantage.</P>
      <P>It does seem to me that that is quite an important matter.  The Government at this moment has power and uses it to change the law of the land at a moment's notice and without notification to the public.  They meet in the Council Chamber and they state that in their opinion a certain organisation is an unlawful association.  When they have done that the people who have not heard of it are actually breaking the law though they are not aware that they are doing it.  The Government has made use of that power to wreak vengeance on a specific citizen of this State.  They made an Order and before there was any opportunity in the case of one man at any rate of getting out of the position&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to show this is relevant because I am going to point out that one thing necessary is that the Government are not to pass laws making anything a penal offence without the people, first of all, having <Col N="2322" /> an opportunity of knowing about it. Will you allow me to develop the point?  What the Government has done is this: it passes an Order in the secrecy of the Council Chamber and by passing that Order it puts the Military Tribunal in the position of having to accept, as full conclusive evidence, the statement by the Government that that Order has been passed. They made use of that when they put a man against whom they had personal spite into prison against all justice.</P>
      <P>The Government may introduce a Bill at three o'clock and have it passed by six o'clock making something that was previously legal, illegal.  They may introduce it on Wednesday and it may take some time going through. A person may be doing a perfectly legal thing but the Government are putting themselves in the position of depriving that person of the right he has under the Constitution, depriving him of the right to what is perfectly legal.  If the Bill is passed this House makes it illegal for a man to wear the clothes he wears so that he will have to spend money on new clothes.  The citizen has the right to expect that there is no possibility of such injustice being inflicted on him.  Until this Bill is passed this cannot be done.  He will have three days in which to know that the Government are desirous of outraging justice.  He has three days in which to save himself from the operation of the law.  But when this Bill is passed the Government, in the secrecy of the Council Chamber, can make an Order to have that man brought before the Military Tribunal and the Military Tribunal must find him guilty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the mind of the Government that is perfectly compatible with justice. The Government say they have a right to pass legislation creating anything an offence, but the citizen has a right to expect that the Government will not pass legislation creating new offences which will inflict hardship on the people.  The people should not be asked to change their manner of living until the Bill has actually passed this House.  In these three days the people will be able to save themselves from victimisation by the Government by <Col N="2323" /> putting themselves within the law. At the present time there are all sorts of Bills.  The Government pretend that they are not wishing to act tyrannically.  They do not wish to create a dictatorship.  Not merely now do they want not to have the Seanad but they want the full power to pass a law and to have that law imposed upon people before the people have any time whatever to adapt themselves to the law.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that I missed portion of the President's speech.  As I was just coming in he caused me great amusement when I heard him repeating an argument of the old sophists.  I never expected that the President of the Executive Council would repeat that argument in this House, but it gave me great pleasure to hear it from him.  It is characteristic of the man and of the whole manner in which he approaches this question.  He is now fond of the saving formula by which he can trample on his opponents.  That saving formula is &ldquo;factious opposition.&rdquo;  What is factious opposition?  All those who disagree with him are guilty of factious opposition.  If you agree with him, that is constructive opposition.  Now we all know that is the way he will apply it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He does not believe that himself, but everybody knows that is what the President means by factious opposition. Factious opposition is the opposition that dares to disagree with him.  Once a Bill becomes law it cannot be amended.  Agitation for its amendment is treason.  That is the line taken by the Government of late.  The sovereign Executive Council has spoken.  What business have people to criticise the Government?  Is not the decision of the Executive Council that a certain thing is good enough for the nation, good enough for all?  Is not that argument enough for it?  Is not that the whole contention of the President here every day&mdash;that certain things are good for the nation?  When he says they are good for the nation, therefore, they are good for the nation.  Any criticism of that is factious opposition. Any criticism of that is treasonable. <Col N="2324" /> The only business left for the people of this country is to say ditto to the President, and throw up their hands in admiration that they have such a wise man to look after all the business of this country.  It is a fine saving clause to enable him to trample on the people of this country to say they are a factious opposition; they are interrupting him and, therefore, interrupting the nation.  He is the nation and the nation is him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is pedantic.  That is exactly like what your master might say.  If it came from the President I would not be surprised, but I am surprised to hear it coming from a back bencher.  The nation and the President are identical.  He has spoken, therefore the nation has spoken.  That is really the whole case he has put forward.  He could not even on this Bill give a straight statement of what this Bill stands for.  He still pretends it is &ldquo;for the abolition of the Seanad as at present constituted.&rdquo;  He could not even at this hour refrain from trying to throw dust in the eyes of the people.  This Bill is a Bill to abolish the Seanad.  It is abolishing the Second Chamber.  It is to prevent any delay for three or four days, or any number of days.  That is the purpose of this Bill.</P>
      <P>To make it quite clear, democracy for him means not that the people of Ireland or the settled will of the people of Ireland shall be triumphant, but if he gets a chance majority he will be triumphant.  Why is it that no democracy in the world has found it necessary to take these powers?  There are countries with Second Chambers.  I asked the President to name them. Let him name them.  He is not slow to go to other countries for precedents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be very slow to make a Second Reading speech on this Stage, but I should like to point out, Sir, that the question of the Second Chamber was introduced by the President when debating this amendment, and I am now replying to <Col N="2325" /> the statement made by him, and showing what the purpose of the Bill was. I have suggested to the House what the purpose was.  He has not justified the purpose of the Bill.  He said in his speech here that it was the business of the Opposition to justify the existence of the Second Chamber.  The experience of all democracies in the world is in favour of Second Chambers.  To what does the President appeal?  His reason?  We know what kind of reason that is.  On the question of delay he says he is willing to give delay, but even on the last amendment he was hedging on that question.  On the last amendment we debated, he said he was prepared to amend the Standing Orders.  If there is necessity for delay he will amend the Standing Orders. This is the great Constitutionalist.  He thinks one of the most fundamental matters in any Constitution in the world&mdash;whether there is to be one or two Houses&mdash;is of the same moment as the Standing Orders.  This apostle of democracy, this apostle, lately awakened to the virtues of democracy, comes here and puts the fundamental alteration of the Constitution on a level with the Standing Orders of this House.  That is his idea of the settled will of the people.  There are many reasons why delay is necessary. Every effort should be made to see that the people are given an opportunity of realising what the Bill is about.  I have seen measures passed through this House in the period during which this and the last Government have been in power, and they were passed into law before the people woke up to know what they meant.  It was then they began to become critical and to see what they were let in for.  Deputy Fitzgerald has made the point that that may mean a very serious thing so far as the liberties of the people or of the country are concerned, and it is not a mere possibility, but an absolute certainty that abuse of that will be made by the present Government.  There is every reason why this amendment should be accepted.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has asked for concrete examples of what might be <Col N="2326" /> done in the three days after a measure became law.  Then he got personal. Let me retort that it would give him an opportunity of saying, as he usually does, that this was the best measure ever introduced and far better than any measure ever introduced by their predecessors.  If it were a measure dealing with the question of sedition or treason, it would afford an opportunity to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to tell the House that he knows more about it than the Attorney-General. If it were a Finance matter, it would give him an opportunity to say that he knows more about it than the Minister for Finance, although he might admit that he was a fool about the fourth National Loan.  No matter what the subject might be, the Minister would take it as an opportunity of showing his superior knowledge and saying &ldquo;The more I say it is good, the better it is.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an argument the Minister should accept.  If I were to accept it, I would have to get something that would suppress the Minister as well as the Seanad.  Will the Minister give us his reasons for saying that there is some necessity for delay on Report Stage?  There is no delay after it.  We are not asking for an alternation of delays.  It is still being assumed that all Bills are not going to be forced through the House, and that there will be the ordinary delay as between the Second Stage and the Committee Stage of a Bill and between the Committee Stage and the Report Stage; but, in addition to all that, at the moment the situation is that there is a minimum period of three days except in very special circumstances, and then only by agreement.  The onus is on those who are seeking to remove that to make a case. We have not got it.  The Minister holds that it is an objectionable thing to give any period to an Opposition to raise even public opinion against a measure once it is passed.  The Minister did not always hold that view, nor was he always so obedient to the law <Col N="2327" /> or such an admirer of representative Government and democratic Government. I remember the time when he was thrown out of his position of Chief of Staff and he questioned whether Acts ought to be re-enacted or whether he had to get any legitimisation as to what he had done, although he was acting contrary to the wishes of the people at the time.  He is going to use the law now because he thinks it is in his favour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let it be assumed that there is going to be the ordinary delay as between the Second Stage and the Committee Stage of a measure and the ordinary delay as between the Committee Stage and the Report Stage, and even some delay as between the Fourth and the Fifth Stages.  In the case of concrete measures founded on concrete legislation, what is there against permitting the minimum three days which are there now?  Deputy Fitzgerald has given one case, not merely a concrete case, but a concrete case that must hit the Ministry very hard&mdash;their attitude towards Commandant Cronin and the way they abused the law in his regard. I find that there is still here an Article of the Constitution to the effect that it shall not be possible for the Oireachtas to declare a thing to be a crime which was not so at the date of its commission.  The Oireachtas shall have no power to declare acts to be offences which were not so at the date of their commission.  Who is to decide that particular point?  Who is to decide whether a measure, passed through this House, has transgressed that, if it is allowed to remain here as an Article of the Constitution? Surely it is the courts.  Is it better to have a period of delay during which the Minister might be precluded from putting it into force and during which its validity might be examined, or to have it enforced first and questioned afterwards?  If they are so anxious for representative Government and for getting the proper view of it from the people, they should not run the risk of having such a thing occur as I am suggesting might happen.  There is that possibility.  There is the possibility that the courts might have to be <Col N="2328" /> appealed to against Acts that have been passed.</P>
    <P>Supposing we assume that every question of different treatment for Money Bills is gone and that they are going to be treated in just the same way as any other Bill and that no more care of Money Bills will be taken than of ordinary measures.  Take one of these constitutional amendments. Here, at any rate, is one provision, that there shall be three days' delay. The Minister, who, as I say, previously did not care whether laws were passed by this House or not&mdash;and, I think, recently held that there was a flaw in this House in relation to law-making &mdash;is terribly keen now that a law, passed by this House with a flaw in it, should get obedience from the people and that no opportunity should be afforded of getting up agitation against such laws once they are passed; that there should not be the three days' delay.  The suggestion is that this was an attempt to get some delay transferred and made occur after the measure has passed the Fifth Stage. That is not what is proposed.  Of course, the mentality that suggested that and jumped to that conclusion is the mentality of one who is clearly looking forward to a period in which measures will not be subject to any delay, even the ordinary delays, in their passage through this House, and that the passing of measures in two days or a week is going to be the ordinary thing.  The Minister jumped easily to the conclusion that there had been accepted here the idea of no delay in the different stages in the passage of measures.</P>
    <P>Now the Minister can be put up here, and has been put up here from time to time to do many things.  He has been put up here from time to time to give his views on matters of finance and sedition and so on.  I think he was made even the herald of the call slaughtering.  But brazenness does not carry him anywhere.  His brazenness is breaking down in regard to certain matters he used to boast of.  It is breaking down in regard to industry, and that is why there is this diversion of the Minister from the affairs of his own Department and his remarkable <Col N="2329" /> glibness in regard to other matters, and his eagerness to debate the affairs of other Ministers who are supposed to be specialists in their Departments. The three days' delay might give a very valuable breathing space to people in this country, but not what was aimed at.  Supposing, for instance, there was a further attempt made, such as had been made previously, to get some sort of settlement of an economic war with England, and that the Minister had been more successful in his attempt than he was on that occasion, and had actually achieved something and succeeded in getting a scratched-together majority in this House to get that agreement through, would it not be well to have a three days' delay in order to let the people find out all about the agreement and how it was accomplished; who were the intermediaries, who were appealed to, how the agreement was arrived at, and so on?

I can see my novels having a pretty pleasant ending from my view-point in relation to the Minister.  We have taken more than three days to get the Minister to assent, at least not to deny that he had a part in this type of negotiation. Suppose all that sort of thing had to be included in the measure.  Does the Minister think that, pushing that through behind the backs of some of his colleagues, as would have to be done, it would be held over for three days as between the Committee and the Report Stage?  The whole thing would have to go through quickly for the Minister &mdash;the upholder of democracy, the man who stood for representative Government, for decent activities in connection with his colleagues, the man who did care about making use of certain people as instruments and defaming them afterwards.  To have <Col N="2330" /> that sort of thing revealed to the people might do types like the Minister a lot of good.</P>

      <P>It has been admitted in all the speeches that we have heard from the two Ministers that there should be delay.  In the course of the President's speech on the Second Reading we had extracts from the Abbé Sieyes, whom I referred to before as one of the unfrocked priests of the French Revolution.  He said that if the Second Chamber is in agreement with the first it is superfluous; if it is in disagreement with it, it is a nuisance.  The President went on to say then that he had never seen or heard of a suitable or ideal Seanad and that he was waiting to be presented with one. From my knowledge of him, I can suggest one that will suit him, if it will not suit anyone else, and that is, the board of the <i>Irish Press,</i> with himself as chairman, with all the powers that he has under the articles of association, or whatever they are called.</P>

Are you going to give them one day, two days or three days?  Are three days too many? That is what you are taking out of the Constitution as it stands, and you are making no provision instead of it, as far as this amendment of the Constitution is concerned, which is now being perpetrated by the Ministry in this measure. The Constitution of this State will have no more power and no more strength in it than the ordinary law.  It can be repealed, changed, altered and amended in a night. Things which are not now offences may be made offences.  There is such a thing known to the ordinary people <Col N="2331" /> of this country as the Opposition.  As soon as this measure is law, by decree they can be regarded as an illegal association.  (<i>Deputies: Hear, hear.</i>)</P>

They admit that there ought to be delay.  The whole case that we are making is a case to prevent legislation being passed into law in six hours.  The President tries to argue from that that you are going to hold it up for three days; you hold that there is a mistake and at the end of the three days it is held up for another three days; then you will find out that there is another mistake and you hold it up for another three days. He wants finality&mdash;not justice, not correct laws, or decent legislation.  The whole history of this Administration can be written in a few words.  It is an Amending Bill Government.

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave says he wants to make a case for delay and all his arguments are based on the assumption that the existing Constitution provides for delay.  He assumes that there must be a delay between the Second Reading and the Committee Stage, and the Committee Stage and the Report Stage, of a Bill and Deputy McGilligan even stated that there must be three days between the passage of a Bill by the Dáil and its introduction in the Seanad.  Deputy Cosgrave is remarkably ignorant about the Constitution which he fathered. There are no such provisions in the Constitution as he appears to think. He complained that this Government introduced seven Bills to amend the Constitution during its term of office. He introduced 17.  I want to give him the time-table for the 17th Bill to amend the Constitution which he introduced.  The necessity for delay and the existing constitutional safeguards against speed have to be considered in relation to this particular time-table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill for the 17th amendment to the Constitution was introduced on Tuesday, 14/10/31, with a time motion which was debated for a considerable length on that day <Col N="2333" /> and passed after seven hours' discussion. Following the passage of the time motion the Bill was introduced on the Tuesday and circulated to Deputies on the Wednesday.  The Dáil assembled on Thursday the 15th to discuss it and was allowed to discuss it on Second Reading from 3.30 to 6.30.  Immediately after the conclusion of the Second Reading, without giving any Deputy time to submit an amendment for the Committee Stage, it was discussed in Committee from 6.30 to 10.30.  It was passed through Committee at 10.30 on the Thursday. The Dáil met again on the Friday at 10.30 in the morning and was allowed to discuss the Report Stage from 10.30 until 12, and immediately following the conclusion of the Report Stage, the Fifth Stage was taken, concluding at 1 o'clock and the Bill had passed the Dáil.  Introduced upon the Tuesday, circulated on the Wednesday, passed through the Dáil by 1 o'clock on Friday&mdash;then came the delay, the delaying sections of the Constitution then came into operation.  All these constitutional safeguards against hasty action by the Executive Council were then called on to do their part.  The Bill introduced on the Tuesday, discussed in the Dáil on Thursday, and passed through the Dáil on Friday at 1 o'clock was considered in the Seanad at 3 o'clock on the same day and it passed its Second Reading and Committee Stage in the Seanad by 10 o'clock on Friday night.  The Seanad met on Saturday&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Deputy McGilligan has been talking about my past, and as he has mentioned the past, I think that there are some things of which Deputies opposite want to be reminded.

That is their policy; that is what they are defending.  They are not defending the Seanad because they think the Seanad is a safeguard or a check or an occasion of delay.  They know that it is nothing of the kind and they would not care a snap of the fingers for the Seanad if there were a Fianna Fáil majority in it.  They are defending the Seanad because, in the present composition of that body, they are able to exercise an effective veto over legislation desired by the majority of the people and enacted by a majority of this Dáil.  That is their case for delay and they know quite well that if the composition of the Seanad were changed to-morrow, that if, after the elections which take place on 6th December next, a Fianna Fáil majority were in the Seanad&mdash;not a majority of their own Party but a majority of their opponents&mdash;they would be most enthusiastic for the passage of this Bill.

The measure which he complains the Seanad passed, and for passing which he condemns the Seanad, is a measure which they condemned and which they used.  After telling the people it was bad and that they repudiated it and condemned it, and denounced it as being an outrage on our liberties, and all the rest of it, they have used it and abused it.</P>

      <P>And on finance, they have been better educated than anyone else by reason of the more frequent mistakes.  Let us consider that Bill and how it was introduced. It was passed very hurriedly and it has all the marks of imperfection on it at the moment because it was passed hurriedly.  Why was it passed?  There had been murders committed and these murders were ascribed, and rightly ascribed, to two organisations in the country which had been condemned by the Hierarchy in this country as sinful and Godless.  Was that a case for rushing a piece of legislation through, no matter what imperfection there might be about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We have never rushed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister rushes his fences too often, with the obvious and inevitable result.  There were murders committed about that time to such an extent that this condemnation by the Hierarchy of the country had come about and it was in those circumstances that the Bill was introduced.  Even introduced in those circumstances and even rushed as it was rushed, the Minister has not made a case, using that, against this three days' delay amendment.  Brazenness can go to a certain point but facts catch up on it.  The Minister has grown a hard shell but it can be pierced by facts.  There are certain things on which he does not talk with the same fluency as before.  On other things, where ignorance is to a certain extent something in the nature of bliss, he can be blissful in his <Col N="2338" /> fluency.  We have to get back to this idea of a representative Government and whether the people have any right to do wrong.  The Minister apparently accepts the phrase which the President has so often and so vehemently denied.  I do not know that anybody on this side has ever denied that the people have a right to do wrong.  They definitely have a right to do wrong. Certainly they are not going to be prevented from doing so because of a doctrine put forward by a man who is setting up, as the standard of right and wrong, what he himself thinks&mdash;a man who holds that people have no right to do what he thinks to be wrong: because that was the use of the phrase.  Nobody here considers that majority rule is wrong.  Nobody here considers that the minority has the right to prevail over the majority. That has never been stated; it has never even been implied.  The object of Parliamentary Government is to try, by reasoning, to prevent the majority from doing wrong.  All that is requested is time to indicate what errors there have been, and the possibility of harm accruing to the State through those errors.  That is what is feared. The mentality of the people opposite is such that they want to get measures through whether they are right or wrong.  If they are wrong, or there is a likelihood of their being wrong, the less time there is to enable people to expose them the better.  A reasonable Government might be able to mend its hand by promising an amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that there is virtue in those three days.  One Minister made a confession in the Seanad&mdash;and other Ministers by their conduct have agreed with it&mdash;that after a Bill is brought through this House a more contemplative period ensues.  It was the experience of all my colleagues and myself and has been confessed to have been the experience of one Minister over there&mdash;not through any virtue in the Seanad, but because there is another House to go to&mdash;that the period of delay has often been useful; it has been useful more often than anything else.  I think there is no doubt that once a measure is introduced here, particularly if it is of a controversial <Col N="2339" /> nature, and a Party attitude is taken up&mdash;as it has to be taken up strongly on Second Reading&mdash;that attitude colours every argument used on the Committee and Report Stage.  It is only when the struggle is over, and the passage through the House has been secured, that Ministers begin to think about the Bill and want to find out if any errors have crept into it.  It is only in that contemplative mood that errors are discovered.  That has been the experience of every Minister in the last Government.  It has been confessed to be the experience of one of the present Ministers, and the conduct of most of the Ministers implies that they recognise the truth of what I am saying.  We were told here that the whole thing is over once a measure has passed the Fifth Stage.  With a Government amenable to reason that is not so; they may be convinced that there have been mistakes.  They may not be convinced by what happens here, but they may be convinced by the accumulated opinions of different representative bodies outside adding force to whatever is said here.</P>
    <P>Three days may permit of a point assuming such importance as the Government, if it is reasonable, cannot withstand.  That is objected to.  Why should it be objected to?  Why should the three days period of delay be made a Party point here?  Why should anybody fear delay?  A case might be made here&mdash;founded upon one or two measures of exceptional urgency and importance&mdash;that there may be certain measures which it will be imperative to get through within a certain period, even within 24 hours, and that it is wrong to stop them.  Make exceptions in these cases if necessary.  Generally speaking, with regard to ordinary Bills, has any case been made, either by concrete examples from the past or any philosophy in relation to legislation in the future, to show that three days' delay is an abhorrent thing?  That is what you are up against.</P>

      <P>This is a new excuse. It is a rotten Bill, and, therefore, you have to get a rotten amendment to it! What sophist used that as an argument? I said that the question of giving to the Dáil, when it is the sole legislative Chamber, a further opportunity for careful consideration of a Bill that has passed its Report Stage, will be gone into.  The proper time to consider it is when the question of a Single Chamber Legislature has been dealt with.  We want to have that settled.  There are occasions&mdash;members on the opposite benches would say there was one at the time of the Constitution Amendment Bill&mdash;on which it is imperative that there should be a short period between the time when a Bill reaches its Final Stages and when it becomes completely law.  I hold that the wrong time to impose delay is after a Bill has passed its final reading here, and has, as far as this Chamber can make it, become law.  There should not be delay at that period. There should not be delay imposed on all sorts of Bills.  We are told now that we might consider exceptions if this amendment were accepted.  I think that is not at all the proper way to proceed.  I think that if there were any consideration of that sort it should apply in regard to each particular Bill. The time at which it would begin to operate should be indicated in the Bill itself if there were to be any exception, but ordinarily a Bill ought to be signed by the Governor-General as soon as may be after it has passed this Dáil. That is the only position consistent with the Constitution as it stands.  Any arguments that have been put forward here in favour of this amendment are really effective, in so far as they have any force at all, as showing that it would be desirable at a point about the <Col N="2341" /> Committee or Report Stage to ordinarily interpose some period for this consideration which Deputy McGilligan has suggested might be useful.  I have not denied that at all.  I have indicated from the start that we were fully alive to that consideration.  We did not need to have it pointed out to us by the Leader of the Opposition as he suggests, because I myself indicated long ago that that consideration was clearly before my mind.  We are opposing this amendment as being of the worst type, and the worst point at which delay could be introduced.  I have explained our attitude fully, and I do not think there are any arguments on the opposite side which are going to change it.</P>

      <P>I am glad the President has at last recognised one thing, that there is a distinction between Bills, and that the situation in the country may be such that haste is necessary.  My difficulty with members of the Government, and with their able lieutenant, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, is this, that they have not taken what the wisdom of ages, and the wisdom of other countries, has shown, on the whole, to be the method of securing proper consideration of measures, that is, a Second Chamber.  If they by this Bill wipe out what is the best method of securing proper consideration for Bills, undoubtedly they can make laws which confessedly, at their best, will be merely second-best.  This amendment, confessedly, is only second-best, and it is only put in to secure some consideration for measures before they are hastily passed into law.  A Government without sufficient reason could put forward any case, by a mere appeal on some abstract reason, that the President is always appealing to, and could ignore the experience of democracies all over the world. It is because there might be that impossible position that an amendment of this kind is necessary. I am afraid experience will prove to this country, to its cost, that the best method of securing proper consideration for measures is a Second Revising Chamber.  Undoubtedly that has been proved in most countries to be the <Col N="2342" /> best.  I admit that there are some modern democracies where they have not a Second House.  That system has not yet been proved in this country. Even these other countries have safeguards against hasty legislation. According to this Bill, we will have none.</P>
      <P>This amendment is put in as a substitute, because the House in its carelessness for the good of the country has chosen to follow blindly the lead of the Executive Council.  In less than two years this House has shown that on all occasions the majority is prepared to follow blindly the leader of the Executive Council.  There is no consideration by the Party opposite of the measures that come before the House.  Have we got any criticism or any suggested amendments to the measures that the Government introduced here?  Where is the consideration? It is not government by this House we are going to have; it is to be government not merely by the Party opposite but by the Executive Council.  This amendment tries to make this measure a second-best one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce went into all sorts of reasons why the House should reject the amendment.  He had even the hardihood, too, to rake up the old saying of the President that the majority has no right to do wrong.  He takes good care not to let that phrase die.  The President used that phrase, according to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. That phrase was used, and was understood by the Minister and by others to mean the right of the minority to take up arms against majority government.  That was the interpretation put upon it, whatever the President may say, six years later, by explaining what he did not mean. That was the meaning others put upon it.  Whether the President put that meaning on it or not I do not know, but by their actions that was the one meaning they put upon it.  It was in that sense we objected to it.  We, in no sense, object to the view that the majority is not open to full criticism. Neither the Minister nor the President has the slightest ability to make most important distinctions.  The one meaning <Col N="2343" /> of that phrase, as understood by the young men of this country, was that people were justified to go out in armed rebellion against the Government of a majority.  That was the reason every young man read out of it.  It was years after they knew that what the President merely meant was that obviously the majority outside might do wrong.  That was not the meaning the President and his followers attached to it.  The President shakes his head.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody has a right to do wrong.  That is obvious. Let us be quite clear about it.  If a Government elected by the majority passes a certain law a minority has no right to resist it.  Apparently, Ministers do not yet see the distinction.  It is lack of ordinary vision.  Where a minority is concerned that case may disappear.  We must look for responsibility to Ministers who are responsible for Government; to those responsible for putting forward the arguments that were put forward, and to a man like the President, who was capable of using that phrase, that the great bulk of the people understood to mean one thing, and that years after he said meant a different thing.  I say that man is a public danger.  I know that the President always wants to speak about himself, all his speeches are about &ldquo;I.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I understand that the Minister is quite jealous.  If he thinks that other people can have a discussion in this House without the President being the principal, he is making a mistake.  The President's one desire is to explain what he meant, not what the country wants.  He was always in favour of some delay.</P>

      <P>I suppose the Minister is in full command of his <Col N="2344" /> senses.  I take it for granted that he is.  This amendment tries to give a certain opportunity, to see that hasty legislation is not passed.  The President says that he was always, apparently, in favour of some delay.  Why does he not make provision then?  No, he wants to destroy first.  That is always his line.  It is his line here. Destroy first and then build up.  We have never seen the building up.  It has always been destruction.  That is what he has accomplished, destruction, destruction, destruction.</P>

      <P>So that there will be nothing left.  That is precisely the policy of the President.  It is his policy regarding the Constitution, and the future of the country, to clear away until there is nothing left.  That is precisely the line he takes up here.  We can do nothing except propose an amendment that will, to a certain extent, minimise the evil.  We are perfectly justified in putting forward the amendment.  We do not pretend that the amendment meets by any means our case to the full.  We are not perfectly certain that there will not be drawbacks.  Of course that is inevitable from the nature of the Bill.  That fault is inherent in the Bill, and is inherent in the amendment because the Bill is bad.  It may be taken for granted that a Second Chamber for a number of years will not run counter to the wishes of the people.  Unfortunately the Government has taken away that particular method.  We are trying to ensure some kind of preservation, some opportunity for proper consideration being given to measures that come before this House.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce indicated some measures in which he said there was haste.  Will anybody deny that we had to make on one measure, as in most measures introduced in the Seanad, a very strong case before they accepted it.  We made out a case, which is more than can be said for Ministers opposite when they put that Act into force.  They made no case and did not attempt to do so. <Col N="2345" /> They did not come before this House or the Seanad before putting that Act into force.  They say they had a mandate from the country for doing this.  The one thing they had a mandate for was for the removal of the Act altogether.  Did they do it? They had no justification for putting it into force.  There are occasions when <Col N="2346" /> it may be necessary, even in 24 hours, to pass a Bill.  I move to report progress.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; the Committee to sit again to-morrow.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Thursday, April 26.</P>
