      <P>Could the Minister give the House any information as to what revenue has been derived from the previous Finance Bill dealing with the same subject, and whether he anticipates any revenue to be derived as a result of this Bill; also what were the imports of butter during the currency of the previous Bill or Act and what he anticipates will be the imports of butter under this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not anticipated that any revenue will be derived from this, because at the same time that this Bill is in operation there is a prohibition against the importation of butter under the Stabilisation Act.  However, there is a legal formality which makes it necessary to have this Customs duty because, under the Stabilisation Act, the bounty must not exceed the amount of duty in operation.  It is not necessary, from a protective point of view at all, but is necessary in order to fulfil the obligation under the Stabilisation Act and to keep the duty at a certain height so that it will be at least as high as the bounty; but, as I said, as the importation of butter is prohibited, it is not anticipated that any revenue will be derived.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister tell us whether or not it will have the effect of keeping up or raising the price of butter in the Saorstát; and could he tell us also what amount of money he anticipates will be raised by way of the levy and paid out in bounty during the current year, and what amount will be paid as subsidy on export?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not have any effect, certainly, on the price of butter, because that would be regulated entirely by the levy and bounty.  If there were not any levy or bounty in operation, of course, the price of butter, naturally, would go down to the export price level, because there is a surplus in the country.  Accordingly, this duty would have no effect whatsoever during the summer months, at any rate, on the price of butter.  With regard to the question asked as to the amount collected by way of levy and paid by way of bounty, roughly it may amount to somewhere between £600,000 and £700,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the levy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, both of course.  At the end of the year they amount to about the same.  At any one period during the year they may be quite different; the bounty may be much higher than the levy, but at the end of the year it is supposed to balance out, and for the last two years we have succeeded in getting it to balance out within, say, £4,000.  I have not got the exact figure yet for last year, because the figures have not been audited yet. The amount that it is expected may be paid by way of subsidy, as apart from bounty, probably will be between £400,000 and £500,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night the Minister for Local Government stated that the Government of which I was a member ignored the Constitution with regard to the division of electoral areas.  I do not know whether the Minister realised what he was saying. Either the Constitution required that such a change should be made within a fixed time, and we failed to do that, <Col N="385" /> or else we did not ignore the Constitution. If what the Minister stated was true, it would mean that he is not a Minister and that I am.  It would mean that the 1932 and 1933 elections were illegal and, as one Government remains in office until another legally takes its place, in that case everything that the present Government has done during the last two years and more would be illegal.  It would be a great godsend to the farmers and a great many other people to know that they had a legal claim against any action taken by the Government.  Of course, we know that the Minister was not really bothering about truth.  He said that any change that was made would be described as gerrymandering.  He seemed to think that the use of the word &ldquo;gerrymandering&rdquo; was a cliché. It may be a slang word, but that is all that can be said about it.  There is one clear way of avoiding the suggestion of gerrymandering, and that is to have the same principle governing the whole Bill in this redistribution of seats.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that he likes small constituencies.  He knows as well as everybody else that the system of proportional representation that we have is not compatible with small constituencies.  He knows that, on the one hand, he has got rid of proportional representation where it suited him and that, on the other hand, he has retained big constituencies where it suited him.  There has been no principle whatever governing the matter.  The Minister thinks in regard to each case put up that he can invent some excuse.  For instance, he says with regard to the change made in the constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny that it goes back to some ancient Gaelic arrangement and that the barony of Idrone was associated with certain other places.  On the one hand, he goes back to Gaelic times just when it suits him; another thing he will excuse on the ground of small constituencies: another on the necessity to maintain proportional representation and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The word &ldquo;gerrymandering&rdquo; means, as far as I understand it, an attempt so to arrange constituencies that a <Col N="386" /> given Party will receive more representation than is due to it.  The Minister stated last night that we had a Bill ready before we went out of office.  I do not remember the details of the Bill.  When it was pointed out to him that just one minor dishonest thing in their manifesto at the last election was their ardent desire to reduce the Dáil in the interests of economy, and that what they did was not to reduce the Dáil as much as would have been done if they had not been elected, he went off at a tangent and said that we ignored the Constitution.  He knows that is untrue because, if it were true, he knows perfectly well that he would have no right to introduce this or any other Bill&mdash;that this Bill would not be a legal Bill and that the Government would not be a legal Government.</P>
    <P>He says that the Constitution requires that the representation per population must be identical as far as possible.  Just note that in regard to this constituency.  If the constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny is retained as it is, it will work out, as far as my figures go and the Minister can correct me if I am not right, at one Deputy for 21,093 inhabitants. That means that there is a certain amount of leeway allowing for a diminishing population.  It would mean that there would have to be a drop in the population of 5,446 before it would be necessary by law to diminish the representation.  With the constituency as it is, it would mean one Deputy for 21,093 inhabitants. With this arrangement, so far as Kilkenny is concerned, it will require 23,663 inhabitants to elect a Deputy; so far as Wicklow is concerned, it will require only 20,498, less than the number in the case of Kilkenny to the amount of more than 3,000; as far as Wexford is concerned, it will require only 20,358; and as far as Carlow-Kildare put together are concerned, 20,663.  He has split this constituency so that, on the one hand, Kilkenny will have to have a larger number to elect a Deputy, namely, 23,663, and on the other, Wexford will require only 20,358, more than 3,000 less.  If he leaves it as it is, the whole constituency will <Col N="387" /> require 21,093, which will be almost half-way, as you might say, between those two extreme numbers which he uses.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that as far as the constituencies which he is anxious&mdash;if I may, without upsetting his literary sense, use the word&mdash;to gerrymander, the number required to elect a Deputy is brought down to the very minimum. That means that if there is the slightest change in population, in the way of a reduction in numbers, there will have to be at the first opportunity another Bill introduced and another change made in this constituency.  He leaves no margin for change of population. He is taking a bit from Carlow and&mdash;he can talk about Gaelic times, but geographically it is ridiculous because the two places are separate&mdash; and adding it on to Wexford, so that Wexford can retain its five seats. He would like us to believe that he is moved by no Party motives in desiring to retain five seats for Wexford.  The population in Wexford diminished between 1911 and 1926 so that, by the Constitution, it was not due to have five seats.  It is, therefore, due to have only four and by the figures which I have got and which I do not guarantee, it means that if Wexford County is retained as a county constituency, as at present, it will require 23,962 votes to elect one Deputy.  The difference between that and what he proposes with regard to Kilkenny is about 300 and he is taking from Carlow and adding on to Wexford when he should retain Wexford County as a constituency, as it is at present, and give each the representation that is due to it.</P>
    <P>What excuse can he give for this elaborate arrangement?  That it would be unfair to Wexford to have only four, because Wexford would require in that case 300 more people to elect a Deputy than he proposes in the case of Kilkenny.  I do not like to throw the word gerrymander about, because, strictly speaking, I have no feeling on the matter.  So far as I am concerned, it seems to me that once a Party has a majority and is going to <Col N="388" /> get a majority elected, it does not matter twopence if they get the whole lot.  With regard to Kilkenny, I have satisfied myself that the reason that constituency is made is because it is hoped that Fianna Fáil, or Fianna Fáil and Labour, by having possibly one-half of the support of the people, would be able to get two-thirds of the representation.  Personally, I do not think it would be so, but that is only a matter of guesswork and judgment, but if it is so, I, personally, have no objection to an electoral system that would give the Party which is going to get two seats out of three the entire three seats, because the whole point of elections is to create a Government.  So far as an Opposition is concerned, my own view is, and has been always, that the real purpose of an Opposition is to be there as an alternative Government if it becomes necessary or if the people desire that the Government be changed.</P>
    <P>The idea of an Opposition struggling for one seat here or there seems to me to be more or less purposeless and so far as that is concerned, I have no great feeling about it.  I would not mind if the Government introduced a Bill which set out that whatever Party got the maximum number of votes should have the maximum amount of representation.  But this tricking about, this pretending to retain proportional representation when it is not there&mdash;and, as I have said, I have no feelings whatever about proportional representation except that I dislike the system we have&mdash;this pretence that the Minister is moved solely by the most meticulous desire to fulfil the most rigid requirements of the Constitution is dishonest.  He breaks up the constituency I represent so that one portion will require 3,000 votes more than the other portion to elect a Deputy and then cuts up County Carlow, arbitrarily adds a portion of it to Wexford, which is geographically very much separated from it, while if he did not do that, if he left the Wexford constituency as it is, it would only require about 300 more inhabitants to elect a Deputy than is the case as he proposes it shall be in Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="389" /> I should have been quite satisfied to listen to what the Minister had to say if he had one principle governing the whole Bill, but this business of dragging in old Gaelic times and what happened 100 years ago, the largeness of an area and one thing and another in one district when he has quite another argument for another shows that he has no such principle.  We can all of us justify anything as long as we can change our grounds of justification and that is what the Minister has been doing in his argument on this Bill all through.  He said that we all said that personally we had no fault to find but that was a careful misrepresentation of what was said.  A number of Deputies explained that they had not any personal feelings on the matter, so far as they individually and their own personal interests were concerned.  My interest in this is, first of all, that I should like to have used any power I have to get the present Government to depart from the system of geographical representation.</P>
    <P>The present Government was in a much better position with regard to this Bill than we were.  The present Government under this Bill&mdash;except in Clare, where they wanted a big constituency, so that President de Valera would have a big poll and so on&mdash;in the vast number of constituencies have abolished proportional representation. They could have done that straightforwardly. If we had done it in our time, there would have been an outcry all over the country, that, for purely Party purposes, we were abolishing proportional representation so as to get an unfair advantage in the elections. For myself, I think, that once it is certain that one Party has a majority, I do not mind what advantage they are given, but this Government has a splendid opportunity.  The Minister then argued that we, for some devious or some occult reason, had failed to bring in a Bill as was required by the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I pointed out a few minutes ago that if that were a fact, if the Minister were saying the truth and not the opposite of the truth, he would know perfectly well that this Government is an illegal Government and that this is an illegal <Col N="390" /> Dáil at the moment, because if the Constitution requires certain things to be fulfilled with regard to elections and if those things are not fulfilled, this Dáil, elected by these elections, is an illegal Dáil and the Minister knows that as well as I do.  Just examine that.  His Government, as he says himself, was elected and came to power in March, 1932, with a Bill ready drafted and ready to bring into the Dáil.  In their manifesto, they had said that they were out to reduce taxation because the country had been so overtaxed before and one of the minor methods which they just threw in was a diminution of the Seanad and another was a reduction of the size of the Dáil.  By his own statement, there was a Bill ready by which the numbers of the Dáil were to be reduced.</P>
    <P>What did they do?  Although he says that it is ignoring the Constitution not to bring in this change of Constituencies Bill at the first possible moment the Government allowed more than two years to pass.  He suggested yesterday that the 1932 election was an illegal election, not fulfilling the requirements of the Constitution, due to our inaction, yet his Government allowed a year to go by, and had another election, while they had a Bill ready which really reduced the membership of the Dáil and did not go in for this elaborate gerrymandering. It allowed another year to go by, and ignored the Constitution.  As far as we were concerned at least our consciences were clear, because we were satisfied that we were not acting contrary to the Constitution.  By his own statement he and his Government had a Bill ready which really reduced the Dáil, which they had dishonestly assured the people they were most anxious to do in order to save the people's pockets.</P>
    <P>A year goes by; they hold another illegal election, with the Bill ready. Then more than another year goes by until they had worked out very elaborate mathematics to find an elaborate system of twisting and changing, without reference to any one principle, making one principle apply in one constituency and another in <Col N="391" /> another, just as they thought suited themselves.  Then they bring in this Bill under which, to take the constituency we are dealing with, a constituency which is two integral counties that have been together for Parliamentary purposes for twelve years, and which are, geographically, peculiarly related to each other, one having a slight enveloping movement round the other, is divided so that one portion will require 3,000 more people to elect a Deputy than the other portion, part of it being added to Wexford, whereas Wexford could be left alone as an integral county and the difference allowed to elect a member there, and in Kilkenny as he proposes it would only be a matter of 300.  Personally I would not say it was blameworthy if the Minister got up and said he believes the Fianna Fáil Party in any election is likely to have a majority; that once they had that majority it is right that they should be given responsibility of Government; that when a Party is given responsibility of Government it should not be in a constant condition of jeopardy, dependent upon the smallest possible majority and liable to be knocked out of office by the mere sickness or absence of an individual member.  If the Government got up and said that, personally I could not argue against it.  I am quite prepared to believe that the arrangement, particularly with regard to Kilkenny, which is the one I know something about, is likely to work out unfairly to the Fianna Fáil Party.  That is only a guess, and I should not like to prophesy with regard to it.  It is certainly arranged to give a specially beneficial position to the majority Party.  It is certainly arranged to knock out my poor friend Deputy Pattison.  At the same time as far as Wexford is concerned, a portion is being taken off Kilkenny and arbitrarily added on to give Wexford a Deputy more than it ought to have, in order to save the Minister for Agriculture for his Party and save the job for him.</P>
    <P>As far as Wicklow and Kildare are concerned, what happens?  At the present <Col N="392" /> moment I admit that under the situation as created by us in 1922 or 1923 proportional representation did not operate in Wicklow.  What we did, we did as well as we could, in that we made constituencies of five and over wherever it was possible.  There were individual places where it was awkward to fit that in, and as far as Wicklow was concerned I admit that under our conditions proportional representation did not work.  In the last election it worked out that Fianna Fáil and their henchmen, Labour, got two-thirds of the representation in Wicklow. I think the same happens in Kildare. In those two constituencies, with six seats&mdash;I speak subject to correction&mdash;the Government managed to get four out of six people elected. Nobody is going to get up and say that that number of Deputies was proportionate to the number of votes cast for the different Parties, but here we have this elaborate operation performed on Carlow solely in the interests of a Party which has not the ordinary honesty to get up and admit it.  The Minister said that, as far as this was concerned, one thing occupied his mind, and that was to keep Wicklow as an entity.  That is a thing which no Government could do.  He talked about the people in Hacketstown going into Baltinglass.  I am not prepared to contest that, but from my own personal observation of the people of Hacketstown I should say that the town they tend towards is Tullow. That is only from casual observation. When the people in Baltinglass want to get to another part of Wicklow, what do they do?  They come right up into Dublin and go down again.  If you look at the map you will see a road from Baltinglass to Bray, through Enniskerry, but anybody who knows the district is aware that if you are there with a Ford car, or whatever it may be, and you want to get to Bray, you will not do that road unless you want what might be described as a scenic trip.  You come into Dublin first.  My colleague, The O'Mahony, lives in Baltinglass.  He represents Bray, and the way he goes there is through Dublin.  That is what anybody who knows the country does.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="393" /> Wicklow itself is very much divided. Mountains run right down the centre of it.  The whole centre of Wicklow is a range of mountains.  East Wicklow is completely separated from West Wicklow.  It is inevitable.  The Minister said that the one county he wanted to keep as an integral whole in this Bill was Wicklow.  The one county in the whole country that he would have been justified in dividing under this Bill would have been Wicklow.  Kildare is a flat county.  Carlow is a flat county, with a slightly mountainous portion dividing it from the Wicklow-Wexford end.  Where the mountains were he has made them join; where the plain was he has made a divide.  Instead of using our position when we were a Government to divide up the country in the way that was most calculated to be suitable to us, we really left it to Fianna Fáil.  Personally, I was glad to do that, because I thought certain changes would be made that we would have to agree with, but that if we had effected in our time would have caused the usual de Valerian clamour all over the country and the usual Fianna Fáil propaganda that we were abolishing proportional representation or something like that. Before the first election in 1927 I came out plainly and said that I disapproved of the system of proportional representation which we had.  Of course, I am always perfectly happy to give material to the propagandists of the opposite side, because I usually want propaganda on that point in order to try to lead up to a certain situation. When this Government came in they could have made changes that they know are desirable, that we know are desirable and that in principle we would have had to agree with, but, if we had made them Fianna Fáil would have made the welkin ring throughout the country by denouncing it as another dishonest Cumann na nGaedheal trick.</P>
    <P>As far as this constituency is concerned its treatment is an absolute scandal.  There is no doubt about that.  If the Government wanted to have more Deputies elected than the number of their supporters warranted there were more honest or less harmful ways of doing it.  Carlow <Col N="394" /> could have been left intact if they wanted proportional representation. It would have been no injustice to Wexford if it had to drop to only four seats.  I have no doubt about it that if Deputy Corish had been the Deputy who was likely to be wiped out, the Government would not have such strong feelings about it.  As far as we can judge from the quota&mdash;I do not know what changes may have taken place since&mdash;Deputy Corish, even with a four-seat constituency in County Wexford, would have every chance of being elected, but anybody in Wexford who has given any thought to the matter knows perfectly well that the farmers of Wexford, who presumably ought to be represented by the Minister for Agriculture, have but one desire in life, and that is, to get rid of this appallingly incompetent Minister for Agriculture, through whose administration they have lost many thousands of pounds, and not only they but the farmers of the whole country.  I strongly object that, because the Minister wants to do something for his friend the Minister for Agriculture, he should come along and outrage County Carlow in utter disregard of every possible argument that could be put up.  When he was forced to it, what argument did he bring up?  That at some far distant time there had been an old Gaelic Barony of Idrone associated with Wexford.  He did not go into the association of baronies in other constituencies when he proposed to divide them.  It was only when he was hard driven to find some excuse that he landed on the most patently humbugging excuse that anybody could get hold of.  There is no excuse for this proposal that would be likely to carry conviction with any person of ordinary intelligence.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to pursue the course taken by Deputy Fitzgerald. I prefer rather to make a final appeal to the Minister on behalf of Carlow, simply from the viewpoint of the ordinary people of the country.  I listened last night to the Minister's speech in which he admitted that he is coerced to put Carlow &ldquo;on the spot&rdquo; and bump it off.  It was the place selected so that all the other &ldquo;gives and takes&rdquo; can <Col N="395" /> be so brought together that the pattern will be filled in by the sacrifice of Carlow.  He wheeled Carlow in and, under the anaesthetic of his charm, he proceeded to carve it up, painlessly, as he thinks; but he has done the very opposite.  I am sorry that Deputy Alderman Pattison is not present.  I know what his views are on this matter. He and I have discussed it, and he was very much opposed to the disintegration of Carlow to the extent of throwing a bit to Wexford, a bit to Wicklow and the rest amongst the decent people of Kildare.</P>
      <P>Speaking in a serious vein, I desire honestly to appeal to the Minister on this matter.  I do not see Deputy Gibbons or Deputy Pattison here, but I wonder are they in agreement on this matter with the Minister, or is the Party Whip to be put on?  If so, Deputy Gibbons may have to support this proposal.  I should like to hear Deputy Everett on behalf of his colleague who, according to Deputy Fitzgerald, will be thrown on the scrap-heap. I should like to know if he stands for the mutilation of Carlow.  By the inclusion of that county with County Kilkenny Deputy Alderman Pattison had a guarantee of a seat here.  There is an amendment down in my name and the name of Deputy The O'Mahony, but if I had my choice I would rather depart from that amendment, because Wicklow-Kildare would be an impossible constituency for any one living on the west side of it.  The Kildare-Wicklow amalgamation would be one such as would impose on any Deputy representing it the necessity of employing an aeroplane to look after it.  The Minister referred to Baltinglass as the shopping area for part of Kildare.  I quite agree with that, though I do not know whether Deputy The O'Mahony would agree with it.  I hope when the Minister next visits Athy, and hears all about the O'Kellys of Baltinglass, he will listen to the appeal of one who is aware of the fact that 1,000 years ago the O'Kellys down there always listened to reason, and always could be won over by a really nice sincere appeal.</P>

      <P>I should like to refer <Col N="396" /> to a few remarks which the Minister made last night.  He stated that if he were drawn and quartered he would not care very much what happened to his remains.  That sounded very modest and unselfish, but it strikes me that really the Minister is being very selfish in this matter.  When all is said and done, a practice has grown up in this country of making an annual pilgrimmage to the graves of patriots, I can see great embarrassment for us if the Minister were drawn and quartered, and I can also visualise a very bitter argument as to where the most important part of the Minister had been buried.  To leave the Minister's body: there was one remark made last night which caused me to have a sleepless night, and that was the statement that he might not be taken as innocent.  I should like to take the Minister as being innocent, but he stated frankly that he was not innocent. Therefore, when I went home last night I said he must be guilty; if so, guilty of what?  When I thought over the matter I said that somewhere there must be a nigger in the wood pile.  I tried to find the nigger in the wood pile, and I got a nigger, but whether he was the right nigger or not I am not certain.  For some time past there have been rumours, and I think even statements in the Press, that the Minister for Agriculture was seeking pastures new.  It struck me that the Minister, in carving off the pasture of Carlow and adding it on to Wicklow, was trying to improve the pasture and making it a permanent pasture for the Minister for Agriculture.  That is the only conclusion I could come to.  I should like to say that I do not think that the Minister, even with the addition of this portion of Carlow to Wicklow, will ever succeed in making a permanent or a temporary pasture for the Minister for Agriculture there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should not like to give the impression to the House, with regard to the amendment which stands in my name, that I am in favour of County Wicklow joining County Kildare as a constituency.  The sole reason for that proposal is to try to preserve the principle of proportional representation. There is no question <Col N="397" /> in my mind that if we are supposed to have proportional representation then we must try, no matter how difficult it may be, to be logical.  Personally I should hate County Kildare to be joined with Wicklow for the simple reason that Wicklow is in itself one of the most difficult constituencies for any T.D. to work and the addition of Kildare to Wicklow will not make it any easier.  To come back to the real grievance, that is the carving up of Carlow, I should like to appeal to the Minister to see if something cannot be done to obviate it.  I think it is a very regrettable thing.  In conclusion, I should like to say that if this portion of County Carlow, which it is proposed to add to County Wicklow, is added I am certain that County Wicklow will give that portion of Carlow a very great welcome and that we shall do the best we possibly can for the people there during the time that that portion of Carlow is part of the Wicklow constituency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any parallel in this Bill, or in any other Bill for the proposal in respect of County Carlow.  I think it is quite unprecedented to blast a county clean out of existence.  I understand the purpose of this measure is to conform to the requirements of the Constitution, and at the same time, to reproduce as nearly as possible the wishes of the people in each of the counties to which it applies.  Will any Deputy, or will any Minister suggest, that the people of Carlow want the county unit of Carlow to disappear from the map altogether?  It seems to me it must be perfectly manifest to the Minister that such an arrangement cannot but be extremely obnoxious to Carlow, and to the people of the county as a whole.  One would imagine some invaluable purpose was to be served by this operation.  We find that a piece of Carlow is going to be transferred to Wexford, and the transfer is going to be made in order to provide five seats in Wexford bearing in mind that our unique and treasured Minister for Agriculture got the last seat in <Col N="398" /> Wexford at the last general election. When the transfer is made five representatives are to be allowed to Wexford and we discover that in the whole of Saorstát Eireann the number of electors required to return a Deputy will be smaller in Wexford than in any other constituency.  Only 20,358 electors will serve to return the present Minister for Agriculture to this Dáil at the next election if he can whip up that number.  We have to bear in mind that if there is the slightest oscillation in the population of Wexford revision will become immediately necessary again.  If the population of Wexford falls by 359 per Deputy there will have to be another revision and reduction in its representation although it will then be a county and a quarter.</P>
      <P>Now, from the point of view of the country as a whole, the primary object of the Bill is to reduce the personnel of Dáil Eireann.  The Constitution provides that you shall not have less than 20,000 or more than 30,000 per Deputy.  One would imagine the mean would be about 25,000 and that that would be more or less the ideal, bearing in mind the case of economy.  If Wexford had been left as it was, a four-member constituency, it would have about 25,000 electors per member, which is approximately the ideal number.  And I think that course might have been followed throughout the whole country&mdash;one Deputy to every 25,000 electors.  But, whatever might have been done, it seems to me that it was entirely undesirable to lop a piece off another county to incorporate it with Wexford, and to create a situation that in this newly-constructed constituency there would be a ratio of Deputies to population that is not to be found in any other constituency in the country.  I yield to no man in my admiration for the disinterestedness of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health. But the most innocent and most credulous citizen of this State will find it very difficult indeed to dissociate the precarious position of the Minister for Agriculture, in Wexford, before this rearrangement of the constituency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Several times Deputy <Col N="399" /> Fitzgerald, and now Deputy Dillon, referred to the precarious position of the Minister for Agriculture in Wexford. The Minister has been returned for Wexford in every election since 1918.  At the last general election Fianna Fáil, including the Minister for Agriculture got 1,000 first preference votes more in Wexford than the representatives of the Party to which Deputy Dillon is attached&mdash;they had 1,000 votes to spare.  The seat of the Minister for Agriculture in Wexford is as safe as the seat of any other person in this House.</P>

      <P>I want to prevent the Deputy adopting an entirely wrong line.  If you look at the figures of the votes given to the Minister from 1919 there is no member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party opposite that got within 1,000 votes of him.  Look at the figures, and it will be found that while it is true that the Minister got the last seat at the last general election it must be remembered that, as we believed another candidate would get in on our side, 1,000 votes went to that candidate that would have gone otherwise to the Minister for Agriculture. There is no seat in the Free State anywhere more secure than is the seat of the Minister for Agriculture in Wexford.</P>

He is the expert in these matters on the benches opposite, and if he believed that he would drop down to Mr. Davin and say: &ldquo;I'll just come along and give you a hand.&rdquo;  I have no doubt if Deputy Donnelly went back and considered these matters for a while he would be in a position to say a great many seats in this country could be made safer than that of the Minister for Agriculture in Wexford or else he would not think he was doing his part.</P>

      <P>He will be quite welcome. But let me say this: when the Minister for Local Government and Public Health intervened to say that this has no bearing whatever on the scheme submitted to the House I, for one, accept that without reservation. At the same time I say it is remarkable and undesirable that a constituency should be constructed out of a county and a fragment, the result of which will be to have a smaller percentage of the electors returning a Deputy than any other constituency in the country.  That, obviously, is incongruous; and that, obviously, suggests the job is not well done.  If Carlow-Kilkenny be restored to its original position, as suggested in amendment No. 18, 21,093 electors will be required to return a Deputy there on the basis of a representation of five. It is true that, that being done, the question of the representation of Wexford County will have to be examined with a view to securing a larger membership, though that is not essential according to the Constitution.  We have, however, pursued a policy all through this Bill by which we gave approximately one Deputy to 21,000 constituents, which I think is too much.  But we have done it, and on that basis it would seem that Wexford is entitled to five members, however that can be arranged.  Wexford is a problem in itself and we can deal with it when we come to it.  This amendment deals with the position of Carlow and its purpose is to prevail on the Government to restore the existence of the County Carlow.  It is admitted on all sides that nobody in the County Carlow wants the Government's proposal. I do not believe that anybody in the County Kilkenny wants it, though they will not have the same earnest interest in the matter that the people of Carlow will.  This is a very strange contribution from the Government to what, I think, are the centenary celebrations of a very distinguished Carlow man&mdash;Deputy Minch will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;Dr. Doyle.</P>

      <P>As one who had the honour to represent Wicklow-Kildare in 1921 and 1922, I think I should be permitted to express my opinion.  I am in entire agreement with Deputy Minch when he says that the amalgamation of Kildare and Wicklow would make it practically impossible for a Deputy to give attention to the constituency. Personally, I should prefer to have the amalgamation with Kildare and so would Deputy Norton, notwithstanding the statements made by Deputy O'Higgins last night.  In 1921 and 1922, Labour had no difficulty whatever in returning two members for Wicklow-Kildare.  We were not consulted about this change and it is not the result of any bargain or agreement behind the scenes.  Deputy O'Higgins, although making a case for the combination of Wicklow and Kildare, had no knowledge of the difficulties a Deputy has to contend with in getting around Wicklow as it is. Deputy Fitzgerald is a resident of that constituency but he is fortunate enough not to represent it.  Deputy Fitzgerald said that one has to come in to Dublin to get from Baltinglass to Wicklow.</P>

      <P>It would all depend on what portion of Wicklow he would want to go to.  He could go by Enniskerry. He overlooked the fact that I have to go through Dublin and Kildare to get into West Wicklow.  I have to pass through Hacketstown to get into Baltinglass and, when addressing a meeting in Baltinglass, I have Carlow voters present as residents of Hacketstown. The same applies in the case of Coolkenny.  You have voters at meetings there from Clonmore.  I should prefer the combination of Wicklow and Kildare but, for geographical reasons, when a change is being made, I can see no better way of changing than by putting Hacketstown and a few areas around there into Wicklow.  Although <Col N="403" /> Deputy Minch has his name to an amendment for the amalgamation of Kildare and Wicklow, he is blowing hot and cold.  He is making an appeal to the Minister: &ldquo;Do not interfere with Carlow&rdquo;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is a strange position to be in.  Deputy Minch at the same time appealed to the Minister not to carve up Wicklow.  If Deputy O'Higgins had any knowledge of the geographical position of Wicklow, he would not have made the charge he made last night.  As one who seldom speaks in this House, he should try to understand other men's opinions and not be always making these charges of corruption and self-interest.  He said that this change was the result of a bargain and Deputy Fitzgerald referred to the &ldquo;henchman&rdquo; from Wicklow supporting the Government Party.  I can assure Deputy Fitzgerald that I am more independent of the Fianna Fáil Party than the Deputies on the Opposition Benches are.  The Labour Party are not tied to anything in connection with the Fianna Fáil Party.  We have shown our independence time after time but we have agreed to come to the rescue of the people we represent and to endeavour to carry out some portion of the policy we have been putting before the people since 1922.  We are prepared to help them by every means not to surrender to England at the present time.  I can assure Deputy Fitzgerald and Deputy Dillon that if they come down to my constituency, and a vote of the people is taken, they will find that the people there are prepared to make further sacrifices rather than ask the Government to surrender to any foreign power.  Deputy The O'Mahony made an appeal for an amalgamation of Wicklow and Kildare and said Carlow should be left with Kilkenny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During my whole experience as a member of this House I have never seen such solicitude displayed from the Opposition benches for Labour representatives as we have had in the course of the discussions on this amendment. One would think from their speeches <Col N="404" /> that their only interest was in Deputy Pattison: that they were afraid that, as the result of the carving up of a particular area, Deputy Pattison was going to lose his seat.  We can assure Deputy Fitzgerald, when he states that the opinions of the people of Kilkenny have changed, that they have changed in the right direction, and that Deputy Pattison will be representing Kilkenny when some members of the Opposition will not.  I am one of the few members of this House elected in 1922.  I then had the honour to represent Kildare and Wicklow.  I appeal to the Minister not to be led away by the appeals made from the Opposition benches on behalf of Deputy Pattison.  The Labour Party will be well able to look after the interests of Deputy Pattison when the occasion arises.  I am sorry that Carlow has been divided up, but no alternative suggestions have come from the Opposition benches.  Deputy Dillon's suggestion was that Wexford should look after itself, but he did not say what should be done with Wicklow. Wicklow is a historical county, and Wicklow and Kildare were together in 1922.  Their reunion again will not interfere with the return of the Labour members.  We will be able to return Deputy Norton as well as the other candidate selected to represent Labour.  I can assure the Opposition Deputies that we will be able to return two Labour representatives for that area.  I am familiar with South Wicklow and with West Wicklow, and I can see no better suggestion than the one the Minister has put forward, putting that portion of the present Carlow constituency into the Wicklow area.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Provided that the proportion between the number of members to be elected at any time for each constituency and the population of each constituency, as ascertained at the last preceding census, shall, so far as possible, be identical throughout the country.  The members shall be elected upon the principle of proportional representation.  The Oireachtas shall revise the constituencies at least once in every ten years, with due regard to changes in distribution of the population, but any alterations in the constituencies shall not take effect during the life of Dáil Eireann sitting when such revision is made.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now that is the Constitution.  It lays down &ldquo;once in every ten years.&rdquo;  How long was the late Executive Council in existence?</P>

      <P>They did not.  They had a Bill ready&mdash;at least I should not say that they had a Bill ready because, as I have learned in the last couple of years, there are a lot of stages in the preparation of Bills.  Perhaps they had put something before the draftsman that had been accepted by the Executive Council, but they had never brought it any further, and will Deputy Fitzgerald saying to the Minister&mdash;I suppose it would be Deputy Mulcahy&mdash; who brought it forward, &ldquo;For God's sake no, let that thing alone; forget about it.&rdquo;  The Deputy had his reasons. I will not use the word that Deputy Fitzgerald is so fond of&mdash;gerrymandering. But at any rate the Executive Council of that time forgot about the Constitution they were so fond of, and gave so much of their time to maintain.</P>

      <P>That Executive Council was more than ten years in existence. In the meantime, a census had been taken which demonstrated that there had been changes of population which made it mandatory, according to this Article of the Constitution, to have a revision of constituencies, but the late Executive Council ignored that Article of the Constitution with whatever consequences that might arise from it.  It may be that the whole institution of Dáil Eireann is, as Deputy Fitzgerald says&mdash;his opinion may be right&mdash;vitiated because of that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>May I explain, because the Minister does not seem to understand?  The Article of the Constitution says &ldquo;once in every ten years.&rdquo;  The Constitution was passed in 1922.  If I remember rightly there was an Electoral Bill passed in 1923&mdash; I do not remember the month&mdash;but, let us say that it was in June.  Something had to be done presumably between June 1923 and ten years thereafter which would be June, 1933. Within the ten years an Electoral Bill was introduced, namely, in 1923. There was an election held in February, 1932, that is to say rather less than nine years after the previous Electoral Bill, so that the Constitution was amply fulfilled in every detail in that election.  The first Electoral Bill was passed about 1923, the Government of the time having been in office for a year.  According to the Minister when they came into office they found a Bill ready drafted. They held an election in 1933.  There is no question whatever as to the fulfilment of the Article of the Constitution in relation to the election held in 1932, but there may be a question in relation to the election held in 1933. I have not got the dates here, but it may be that the Constitution has been ignored.  If it was ignored it was ignored by the Government that came into office in 1932.  The Bill was drafted but, in spite of that, they held another election.  If the Minister could only understand the words he read from the Constitution they prove that his statement was false.</P>

As the census was taken in 1926, and the elections held in 1927 and in 1932, while changes were necessary nothing was done although they were aware that something should be done.  They drafted the Bill for reasons which Deputy Fitzgerald knows very well.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Deputy O'Leary moves his amendment, the position is that the decision that has already been arrived at as a result of the vote on the Cork Borough constituency makes the amendment in the name of Deputy O'Leary for North Cork, and the amendment with regard to East Cork in the names of two other Deputies rather inconsistent.  You cannot have this amendment with regard to North Cork carried without repudiating what we have already done with regard to the Ballincollig county electoral area in the Cork Borough constituency and the inclusion of Ballincollig in the county which has already been decided. I have not any desire to stop discussion on the matter, but I think we could have a discussion on the Report Stage.  I am entirely in the hands of the House, but it may be better first, before the discussion, to have the amendments arranged in accordance with the decision that has already been taken to include Ballincollig in the county.</P>

      <P>On that point the Minister has not said whether he would go into Committee on the Report Stage or not.  There is a proposal here that the constituency of North Cork should be the county electoral area of Kanturk and Macroom in the administrative County of Cork. I do not know that the Minister can say that what has been done in regard to the Cork constituency affects directly the proposal that North Cork should consist of a particular area, or that West Cork area should consist of Bandon, Bantry and Dunmanway. <Col N="413" /> I think we might here, at any rate, have some little discussion on the Minister's idea in changing these areas.  The argument that has been put up, up to the present, has been that the Cork Borough constituency was restricted because there was a rural area which it was desired should be cut off from Cork City and because there was a diversity of interests between the rural people and the people in Cork City.  The Minister has not discussed Cork beyond that.  I think we ought to have some discussion as to why the changes are made, particularly when you come to East Cork. We should have some discussion as to why Youghal is cut away from Cork and put into Waterford.</P>

    <P>It aims at preserving the important electoral areas of Kanturk and Macroom.  These two important areas are within easy reach of the present Dáil members of North Cork and the objection which the Minister appears to have in regard to other constituencies does not apply here.  In North Cork, which I represent, we have easy and definite methods of transport.  I do not think that even the members of the Minister's Party will deny this. The people we represent do not want a change; they do not want to be transferred into a new constituency. Under this proposal considerable inconvenience will result to Dáil members and constituents a like.  If it is adopted it will mean that the Donoughmore side of West Cork will be 90 miles from Allihies Mines.  That will mean terrible inconvenience.  To show the House how inconvenient it would be, I may say that never from that side of the county have we any recourse with the West Cork portion of the county.  I think it will be a terrible hardship on candidates if this proposal is adopted.  I certainly think that North Cork is one of the constituencies which should not be slaughtered.  I think the Minister will agree with me when I say that the population there is 61,601 and, if you divide that by three, the number of members at present representing the constituency, you will find there are over 20,000 people for each member.  I protest against North Cork, the one constituency which has held its population, being mutilated.  The Minister has talked about small constituencies giving the best results under proportional representation.  I do not agree with him there.  I contend that the five-seat constituencies give much better results.  I would like to know from the Minister why he has singled out North Cork, which has held its <Col N="415" /> population according to the Constitution, for mutilation.  I protest emphatically against the Government's proposal, and I ask the Minister to reconsider it carefully.</P>

      <P>I would like to say that the primary reason for the proposed division of County Cork is that it is actually the division agreed upon some years ago by the county council for the purpose of dividing the county into three health areas.  I thought it would be convenient to have the electoral areas for Parliamentary purposes in the same divisions as for health areas and I followed the boundaries then agreed upon.  I agree that West Cork is a tremendously big constituency, a wide, scattered constituency.  I heard from several parties in the House that it would be a very difficult constituency to work.  With the official, I have gone over several suggestions, but they are very difficult to manage.  The present proposal makes three constituencies with fairly well-defined boundaries.  I know the people in Macroom, in whom Deputy O'Leary is particularly interested, do not like going West for health purposes.</P>

      <P>There is one point I would like to stress, and I am glad the Minister has alluded to it.  It is in regard to county health areas.  I would like to have the Minister's explanation for taking 9,000 of the population of the South Cork health area and kicking them over into another county.  The most amazing thing I have observed is that there has been an amendment submitted in the case of every constituency that has been considered, with the exception of the constituency that is going to grab a piece of Cork.  There is no amendment here in connection <Col N="416" /> with Waterford.  The Waterford people are always anxious to get a bite out of the Cork man, apparently.  I suggest to the Minister that the population of Cork County is large enough. I do not mind what division is made, so long as County Cork is kept as one entity.  Divide as you like, but keep it as the one county.  There is no case for transferring portion of it to County Waterford.  I have examined the figures closely, and they do not justify the transference of portion of Cork County to Waterford.  Undoubtedly there is a case for some rectification, and in that respect I agree with the Minister that so far as North Cork is concerned, the transference there fits in with the Board of Health area.  I regret that portion of my constituency is being taken away.  It is a portion for which I did a lot.  I worked hard for it, and I have no desire to see portion of it go from me.  After hard work we succeeded in getting a beet factory there, and we reopened the flour mills.  It is not with any light heart I see that side of the constituency scarred and handed over to another member.</P>

      <P>So far as Deputy Little is concerned, I am reminded of what I am accustomed to hear every St. Stephen's morning, &ldquo;Though he is little, his power it is great.&rdquo;  Undoubtedly the power of a Waterford Deputy who succeeds in skelping off 9,000 people from Cork County must be great, but we are going to test that power.</P>

      <P>I do not want to make any more bones about it.  As far as I am concerned, I am here as a representative of Cork, and while I am here as a representative of Cork I am going to stand by it and to see it through. Make no bones about that.  As far as we are concerned, I have no objection whatsoever to the Minister's reorganising constituencies in that county in any way he likes, but what we certainly have a decided objection to is <Col N="417" /> seeing a county with that population being scarred up and any portion of it handed over to Waterford.  There is no justification for doing it.  The population in the new East Cork constituency is larger than that of County Waterford.</P>
      <P>We have heard many arguments from the Minister but we have heard one argument repeatedly from him, and that is that he is anxious to do the least harm.  Well, if he is so anxious to do the least harm, I suggest he should take a piece from Waterford and shove it into Cork rather than to take a piece of Cork and hand it to Waterford.  I do not want to see that happen, but at the same time, as I suggest, it would be less harmful than what is being done.</P>

      <P>At the same time, however, we have to remember that for a long period that particular portion of County Waterford, to which I am alluding, was ruled from County Cork. It formed the Youghal No. 2 rural district and was ruled for all local purposes from the town of Youghal in the County of Cork.  As I say, I can see no justification whatsoever for this proposal.  I would like the Minister to give us an opportunity of threshing out the whole matter on Report Stage, but also I would like him to go into it with the intention that he is not going to interfere with the boundaries of Cork County.  Inside that particular area, I have no objection whatsoever to any plan the Minister may have with regard to constituencies. Let him divide County Cork in any way he likes&mdash;into three, four, five, or six constituencies&mdash;we do not care, as far as we in Cork are concerned, and I am sure that I have all the Cork Deputies on both sides of the House with me, but we are not going to see Cork County scarred up if we can prevent it, and I must say that I think it is straining Party loyalty very much to ask us to agree to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night, Deputy Minch, in looking for a territorial <Col N="418" /> division into three parts, had to go back to the classics, but I suggest that he might have gone nearer home.  It was always a fact that Cork was divided into three constituencies, and these three constituencies fitted in remarkably well.  In his new scheme, the Minister has done a lot of violence to the natural, legal, ecclesiastical and tribal boundaries of the place.  While he has admitted that he is trying to have Cork divided into three health areas, the three health areas which have been outlined will not correspond in any sense, I think, with the three divisions he is now making of the county.  At all events, there is one thing that he has not brought into his health scheme, and that is that he is not putting Youghal into Waterford. I suppose it will remain an integral part of the County of Cork for local purposes, and that is the part represented by the Chairman of the Cork County Council.  I suggest that it is an extraordinary anomaly that the Chairman of the Cork County Council is going to be made, willy-nilly, a constitutent of another county.</P>
      <P>In this matter, I think that these three amendments run one into another.  The Minister has pointed out already that the fact of his having taken a decision with regard to the borough constituency will affect the other three.  The Minister has done an extraordinary thing as regards South East Cork, particularly on the basis of population, but he has done a more extraordinary thing in West Cork.  He has divided not only a county area but a rural district area, and as far as I, personally, am concerned he has put one portion of my area into East Cork and another into West Cork.  I do not worry about that part of it, because we must look at these things from other than the point of view of personal advantage.</P>

What I would like to suggest is that this is a very important matter since this Cork County constituency is the most important part of the Free State from <Col N="419" /> the point of view of intelligence, the number of members, size and influence.</P>

      <P>Their sanity, Deputy Norton.  We are practically one-eighth of the Free State.  We have 18 members in this House and I suggest that such a very important matter might be recommitted for reconsideration by the members representing Cork here in this House.  I think that if that were done it would be possible for us to get agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">

      <P>I do not recollect the Minister having made the suggestion, but I would appeal now to all the Cork members and I think, Sir, that they would come to an agreed solution of this problem if the Minister would accept my suggestion and postpone the consideration of these amendments until the Report Stage.  I think it would be very easy to arrive at an agreement on the point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>For once, at least, there is not going to be unity between Corkmen in this matter.  I think that if the Minister is prepared to give way on this whole matter of Cork, the logical thing for him to do is to withdraw the Bill altogether.  I confess that I cannot sympathise fully with the point that Deputy Corry has made, because the fact is that during the progress of the discussions on this Bill what has happened in Cork has also happened in several other counties. Galway is an example.  Sligo is another example, and so are Roscommon and Westmeath examples.  I consider that the arrangement suggested in this Bill is a very much more preferable arrangement than the arrangement suggested in one of the amendments which proposes to reduce the area and leave the membership the same.  I do not think that coincides at all with much of the sympathy that has been expressed here for representation by minority Parties.  It would <Col N="420" /> look as if it were not conceived in that spirit at least, and to that extent I do not agree with it.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Neill has complained about a rural district being carved up, but the rural district of Dunmanway has been cut in two and the existing part of the constituency comes within four miles of the town of Dunmanway, where I reside.  If there would be some hardships resulting from the new arrangement, at least it would get rid of the hardships in the previous arrangement where people residing within ten minutes' walk of the town of Dunmanway are residing almost ten miles away from their nearest Parliamentary representative.  The Minister has referred to the county electoral areas and to his proposed division of the county in regard to local government. I think, however, that if the Minister were to search the files of his Department he would find, in the scheme outlined by the previous Government, proposals for dealing with West Cork on practically the same lines as those contained in this Bill.  I am pretty certain that the previous Administration considered this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to press the point further.  I know that the present scheme which the Minister has brought in was under consideration by the Department and that it was being favourably considered by the Department. I consider that the arrangement suggested in this Bill is the best one possible.  I would be equally satisfied if the old constituency of West Cork was retained with its full representation. But, in view of the obligations which have led to the introduction of this Bill, a change must be made, and that change must be made either from the point of view of representation or of area.  If the Minister looks round that whole area he will find that there is no other division possible.  If it means a certain cutting up of the rural district of Kinsale, it also means that it restores another rural district that was cut up under the existing arrangement. I know North Cork as well as any Deputy, and I have as much right, by reason of birth and association, to speak for North Cork as any Deputy.  I know a large number of people in North Cork who will not be perturbed in the slightest if this arrangement is given effect to.  I am not at all satisfied that it will not lead to the removal of at least as many hardships, if not more, than it is suggested it will create.</P>

I was treated the same as any other Deputy and was not consulted in the least about what was being done in connection with the constituencies of Waterford and Cork.  I know this thing works out like a kind of jig-saw puzzle, but if you make a <Col N="422" /> change in one place you must make a change in other places.  The last thing I should like to do would be to deprive Deputy Corry of the pleasure of having his little joke.  At the same time, I feel bound to point out that I am entirely in the hands of the Minister in the matter, and that I am satisfied with whatever is thought best.  If Youghal is put into our constituency we are prepared to do the best we can for it.  On the other hand, if it is taken away I shall be perfectly satisfied. I do not, however, want the impression to go out that I have been in any angling or trying to get that part of Cork put into the Waterford constituency.</P>

      <P>I have examined the whole matter closely, and I can see that the Waterford constituency is there marked out.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corry is touching on the kernel of the whole situation.  The kernel of the whole situation is that in bringing about changes in the constituency boundaries in Cork South a little bit of Cork is wanted for Waterford.  If that bit of County Cork were not wanted for Waterford, then there need not be the slightest change in the boundaries in County Cork.  The Minister is providing for a re-arranged County Cork that will give two four-member constituencies, a three-member constituency, and a five-member constituency, the very same as the proposal we are making in our own way &mdash;sixteen members in all.  It is providing representation for the people so that when you compare the number of persons represented by a Deputy in any of the constituencies that are proposed there is practically no difference.</P>
      <P>Deputy Murphy thinks that to oppose the Minister's proposal with regard to a five-member constituency in West Cork is to go back on some of the things said from these Benches as to the desirability of having large constituencies in order that minorities may have representation.  I think, however, that the Labour Deputies took away a five-member constituency from the City of Cork and made it a four-member constituency and, if they insist on this, they are proposing to take away a four-member constituency from East Cork and make it a three-member constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are as many minorities in East Cork as in West Cork and there are as many minorities in the City of Cork as in West Cork.  What Deputy Murphy has said is beside the point, because they have deliberately reduced the Cork City constituency and are proposing to <Col N="424" /> reduce the East Cork constituency.  As between the two proposals, from the point of view of safeguarding minorities you have one five-member constituency, two four-member constituencies and one three-member constituency in each of the proposals. To say that West Cork is the only place in the whole county where minorities have to be safeguarded, is a statement for which the Deputy has produced no evidence.  Deputy Corry talks a lot about the sin that it would be against Cork to take Youghal away, and he points out that there is nothing put in from these benches to deal with the grabbing by Waterford of a bit of Cork.  I want again to tell him that amendment No. 22 on the paper deals with that, and I want to tell him that amendment No. 21 on the paper deals with it, too, because the Deputies on the far side could pass amendments No. 21, No. 22 and No. 23, if they were not co-operating in the Minister's proposal for carving up Cork and handing over a bit of it to Waterford, about which the Deputy complains so bitterly.  I take it that the Minister has blinded the Deputy to what is going on, but there is a bit of writing down on the paper, and the Minister cannot get between the Deputy and it, and if the Deputy would have two good reads of it, he would not talk in the way he is talking about Youghal and Waterford or vote in the way he is apparently going to vote with regard to North Cork, East Cork or West Cork.</P>

The Minister said he had put that suggestion forward and we are quite satisfied to consider it between ourselves, on the one condition that he does not cut the tail off us.

      <P>I do not like this cutting up of Cork either.  With regard to North Cork, which I represent, a portion of it under the Bill is to be thrown in with West Cork.  Personally, I am of the opinion that the West Cork constituency, as at present constituted, is large enough, and, if anything, too large, and by putting the Macroom rural area in with it, you will make it close on 100 miles from Lack to Castletownbere.  As well as being a terribly large constituency, it is very mountainous and scattered and would be very unworkable.  It is hard enough as it is to get around West Cork and with our portion added to it, it would be a good deal harder.  While a change is, I suppose, <Col N="426" /> undoubtedly, necessary in Cork, I think the constituencies could be fixed in such a way as would make it easier for the people and for their representatives.</P>

      <P>The whole discussion seems to me to be concerned with the welfare of the Deputies and with whether they will get votes at the next election or not.  They are not concerned with the people they represent. I would suggest that the Minister could make certain changes in his proposal.  West Cork is, undoubtedly, too large already&mdash;from Donoughmore to Dursey Head is at least 110 miles&mdash; and it is impossible for any Deputy who tries to do his duty by his constituents to look after a constituency of that extent.  I am quite satisfied with my present constituency, and at the coming election, whenever it does come, to take the rap, as well. The Minister has talked of dividing Cork County into three areas for the purpose of Board of Health works. Macroom electoral area is in the area of the South Cork County Board of Health and it would not be any use for a man in Ballyvourney to know that the &ldquo;Skibbereen Eagle's&rdquo; eye was on him.  If the portion of my constituency which is to be relegated to West Cork is taken from us the people in whom I am particularly interested, those in the Gaeltacht area of that district, will be neglected by the various Deputies of this House.</P>

      <P>Deputy Moylan referred to the distance from his place to Castletownbere and, strictly speaking, there is as much difference, on the Western portion of West Cork, from Dunmanway and Skibbereen as there is from Bandon to County Meath and the lands around there.  One area is congested in the strict sense of the word and, in fact, all the relief schemes are going to it, judging by the correspondence I get.  From Dunmanway West, I am getting ten times as much correspondence as I am getting from Dunmanway East, but from the point of view of real efficiency and the welfare of the people, what I think should be done is to make two areas of West Cork and take a bit from Deputy Martin Corry and give it to one portion instead of giving it to Waterford, because, in my view, the people in the congested areas on the seaboard are not properly looked after.  Failing agreement, the only solution I can see is Deputy Murphy's suggestion, because North Cork is undoubtedly becoming another great difficulty, but, mind you, the big difficulty does not really count.  I have very little trouble from my area around Bandon and I am sure that Deputy O'Neill will agree that the same applies to Kinsale, but from there west all the trouble comes.  I think to do justice to those areas west of Dunmanway we should concentrate more on them.  They should not be mixed up with the different theory, different procedure and outlook, such as there naturally are around Mallow, where the land is good.  What they want is one thing, and what the people want in the west&mdash;as Deputies know&mdash; is another.  I am prepared to make the attempt, and do anything.  I should like to see the county kept intact, but my honest opinion is that we would not succeed.  As far as I am concerned, I am prepared both to put up suggestions and to meet them. It would be well worth a trial in any case.</P>

Throughout this debate they have shown a peculiarly cynical and selfish <Col N="428" /> hypocrisy.  They squeal about their tail being cut off, and yet I have not observed any of them either raising their voices or giving their votes when another county is not only having its tail cut off but its legs and head as well.  They now come along and expect us to sympathise with them about having their tail cut off.  In spite of the fact that they had shown themselves cynical and selfishly hypocritical in this matter, they think the House should sympathise with them when they protest against the proposal to mutilate their county, just as we protested against the mutilation of other counties.</P>

      <P>I thoroughly agree with the suggestion which has been thrown out here that the matter be referred to the Report Stage, so as to enable Deputies in County Cork to arrive, if possible, at some workable arrangement.  Probably some reconstruction is necessary, but I think that reconstruction could be carried out without interfering unduly with very ancient boundaries.  Undoubtedly, the West Cork constituency is extremely large at the present time, and any addition to it will make the constituency absolutely inaccessible. Under the new Bill it extends from Kinsale Harbour to the Kerry bounds, and owing to the numerous harbours, inlets of the sea and creeks it has an immense coastline.  As Deputy Moylan has properly pointed out, it would be impossible for any Deputy to keep himself in close touch with his constituents there if it is enlarged.  At present it is an extremely hard and almost impossible task to keep in touch with them.  If by any possibility the constituency is enlarged unduly it will then be impossible for any representative to carry out his duty efficiently, satisfactorily and properly, no matter how well-intentioned, active and zealous he may be.  I would agree that some arrangement might be arrived at if we exercise common sense, and after all I do not think the people of County Cork are wanting in either sense or sanity.  I believe if the matter were referred back, as has been suggested, a practical arrangement <Col N="429" /> which would be pleasing to everybody could be arrived at.  Without going further into the merits of the matter&mdash; I could have gone a great deal further into them&mdash;I am hopeful that the suggestion which has been thrown out will be accepted and adopted by the Minister and endorsed by the House.</P>

      <P>There is one small matter, which is perhaps beside this, that I want to deal with first.  My friend Deputy Corry has spoken very strongly in condemnation of Waterford for not putting down an amendment objecting to the inclusion of Cork.  If they had, I am afraid he would take a different attitude against them.  They could hardly be expected to insult us in Cork so much as that. Waterford has been left alone and, having been left alone, I think they have a right to sit in silent acquiescence in what is being done.  Coming really to the serious portion of it, on the Second Reading of this Bill I made all the case I could, from the historical and administrative point of view, against including Youghal in the Waterford area.  I know that it is not directly relevant to the amendment now before the House, but, from the statement of the Minister, I can see quite clearly that Cork practically hangs together.  Under the arrangement that is to be made, north, west and south Cork are, to a certain extent, interdependent.  That is the reason I speak on this particular amendment, although the next amendment is in my name and that of my friend, Deputy Daly.</P>

      <P>I think the views which I expressed on the Second Reading got greater support from the Minister himself than from anybody else.  He seemed to have a decided objection to interfering with county boundaries or historical or administrative associations where he could possibly avoid it.  Knowing his feelings on that matter, I have every confidence in his decision when he comes to the rearrangement which I now see is possible.  I am informed that owing to the decision on Cork City, a figure of something like 31,000 of a population is for the moment practically unallocated. If that be so, and if the Minister can see his way again to go into this whole question of Cork County in the light of the decision in regard to Cork City, I am quite satisfied that &mdash;without stretching his conscience too far on the question of the numbers entitled to a particular representation &mdash;he can find an arrangement which would at least give the greatest amount of satisfaction to the representatives from Cork County.  I do not think that in the very near future Deputy Donnelly's suggestion will be carried out, although I might tell him that his views are supported in other directions.  This is by the way.  Travelling up in a train a short time ago, I heard a discussion on the amount of trouble we Cork Deputies were giving in this Assembly.  One gentleman, speaking very loudly, though I do not think he recognised who I was, said: &ldquo;If we could only get Cork out, and the Six Counties in, everything would be satisfactory in Ireland.&rdquo;  I do not share that opinion.</P>

      <P>The doubt as to whether that would be perfectly in order leaves me no option but to stand over the amendment in my name and that of Deputy Daly.  I intended at the suggestion&mdash;perhaps I should not say at the suggestion, but as the case was developed by the Minister&mdash;to withdraw the amendment in my name and to allow the question to be left over to be dealt with on the Report Stage, but if it is the definite opinion of the Minister at the moment that no rearrangement is possible, he leaves me with no alternative but to take the decision of the House.  I am afraid, therefore, that I cannot withdraw the amendment.  I might point out to the Minister that, even so, before the Report Stage he should <Col N="432" /> seriously consider the case which I have put up.  I leave aside the historical aspect with which I have already dealt, and I would point out that on the administrative side, he said that his aim was to secure co-ordination between local representation and national representation.  In my view that is a most desirable object.  It gives people down the country, through their local representatives and their national representatives, the best possible means of seeing that anything they want done is done with due regard to both interests.  In the case of Youghal and its surroundings the Minister is going directly against his own principles.  He is insisting on turning his back on what he himself has attempted to carry out already.  I think the Minister on these grounds should make a very sincere effort to meet our views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like my friend, Deputy Corry, I am not a bit concerned about any rearrangement you may come to, provided you give Cork County the representation to which the people are entitled, equally with the rest of the Saorstát.  I am, however, seriously concerned in seeing that we do not violate the principles that have already been laid down and I am seriously concerned to see, as every man who has any sentimental feeling at all must be, that all our historical associations are preserved.  Although sentiment may apply only in a limited way in local areas, I would point out to the Minister that tremendous sacrifices have been made by the people of this country on purely sentimental grounds.  I would ask him therefore not to tear up associations that have existed for centuries or to disunite people who have been united on many questions over a long period. In the administrative sense, this particular area has had a very close and intimate association with Cork and on every one of the county boards it has a distinct representation.  Unfortunately it may occasionally happen that differences of opinion may have to be expressed in the national Parliament, but I think it should be the Minister's aim to preserve historical associations as far as possible, to <Col N="433" /> create a vibrant living unit, and a close association between the local representatives and the national representatives in the best interests of the people generally.  If that be his desire, I am sure that what I am asking him to do is an extremely small thing, to retain the people of this county in an area where they are likely to be more conscious of their mutual interests from an administrative point of view.  I would ask the Minister to consider the matter again and, if it becomes necessary on the Report Stage, we hope to be able to frame an amendment that possibly we may be able to put more logically, more forcibly, and I hope more convincingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is behaving very unreasonably in regard to the matter of Youghal and district in that he is disregarding the principles which he laid down in the tripartite division of Cork on the board of health.  He is here sinning against all the canons of that arrangement by dividing the rural districts of Youghal in the manner proposed in the Bill.  So far as coherent and co-ordinated administrative activities are concerned, the chairman of the county council and the chairman of the boards of health will live outside the administrative bounds.  I think he is behaving perfectly illogically in regard to this matter.  The Minister will doubtless tell us that the decision arrived at in regard to Cork borough affects other portions of the county.  It will not, because those areas in respect of which amendments have been put in, leave us with the old boundaries more or less.  One thing I should like to point out is that the amendment relating to West Cork provides only for four Deputies.  That is a mistake. It was never my intention or the intention of Deputy Burke to reduce the existing representation of West Cork which is five.  We admit that five is more than we would strictly be entitled to on the basis of population, but still having regard to the geographical situation, the length of the constituency, and the physical difficulties of the whole area, we think <Col N="434" /> that we should be entitled to retain five members, even though that is a little in excess of the number provided for in the Constitution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be about 95,000.  Still, an exception could be made in that case.  I need not point out the difficulties in West Cork.  It is an exceedingly difficult constituency to attend to.  To quote the Byronic phrase&mdash;&ldquo;The mountains look upon Marathon and Marathon looks on the sea.&rdquo;  It has a tremendous coast-line and it has various economic problems. The economic outlook of various classes has to be dealt with.  There are town problems, rural problems, urban problems and board of health problems.  I would impress on the Minister that before coming to any decision in regard to the boundaries he should give the members of this House who represent the whole county an opportunity of coming together and of exchanging views.  I am sure that if he does so, we shall come to an arrangement which will meet with general acceptance.  I can see the logic of Deputy Murphy's objection, but I am sure that Deputy Murphy objects to an already large constituency being made still larger and still more difficult from the point of view of administration.  I would again appeal to the Minister to delay a little.  He will not be held up in any way and there will be no fundamental principles sacrificed.  The delay will be worth while because it is likely that any arrangement arrived at now will be an arrangement that will be crystallised for a very long period in the national Parliament.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it hard being in all these cases, what some members of the House would probably describe as <i>advocatus diaboli.</i>  I find it particularly so in regard to the County Cork, but there are rules laid down by the Constitution, to which Deputy O'Neill referred, which any Minister in dealing with this subject is bound to follow.  There is the rule with regard to population.  It would not be possible <Col N="435" /> for any Minister to leave West Cork with a number of Deputies to which the population does not entitle it, even though the population might be only a few hundred under the required number.  The population in that portion of Cork has decreased and certain consequences have to follow. The population of West Cork, according to the census of 1926, was 94,449.  I do not think that if a census were taken now West Cork might have the 100,000 necessary.  But we are dealing here with a Bill introduced many years after that census. A Bill on these lines should have been introduced in 1927 or 1928, soon after the figures of the 1926 census were available.  Another Bill will be necessary after the next census, which will take place in 1936.  It is possible, a year or two after that, there will be an increase in the population in West Cork, and in East Cork, that will possibly bring back the population figures to what they were before the census of 1926 were taken, and that might entitle these constituencies to a greater number of Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not hear Deputy Hales say that.  North Cork is a little over the minimum required to keep its three members according to the 1926 figures.  East Cork is short considerably. It has a population of 91,995 for five members, so that its present figures are below the minimum required, and this alteration in the figures makes it necessary to change the number of Deputies.  The same thing applies to the County of Waterford, which has fallen in population.  We were anxious, for many reasons, to make arrangements so that an important county like Waterford, even though it has lost so much in population, should not be called upon to lose a member, and there was a surplus available.  Taking away the member that Cork County loses as a result of drop in population leaves a surplus then available for Waterford, and we gave them the 2,000 necessary to keep their four members.</P>
      <P>Waterford is a big and important county, not comparable, no doubt, to Cork, but still a big and important county.  We thought if we could find a population nearby that could be added to Waterford it was a good idea to allow Waterford to keep its four members.  There was this to be said in favour of the suggestion.  Youghal, in County Cork, was associated, for administrative purposes, for a long period with County Waterford.  There is a difference between Deputy Corry and myself as to how that is to be described.  He says part of Cork ruled County Waterford. Waterford does not agree with that. They say they were associated with part of Cork for a long time.  I think it was reasonable that sooner than that Waterford should lose a member, and seeing that there was a surplus nearby, we should give them the benefit of that and enable them to keep their four members.  It is not pleasant to have to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard the very eloquent appeal made by the chairman of the Cork <Col N="437" /> County Council, Deputy Broderick. He made his appeal on sentimental and on administrative grounds.  I feel it difficult to resist that.  I know the chairman of the Cork County Council speaks from long experience; I know the interest he takes in local administration, and that no man has worked harder for the interests of his county than the chairman of the Cork County Council has done.  I know he speaks in earnest when he says that the close association for administrative purposes should not be interfered with. From the local government point of view, they will not be interfered with. When the day of election comes the people of Youghal will vote where they vote at present, but the member they vote for will be for Waterford County and, on account of the fall in the population in Waterford, that cannot be helped.</P>
    <P>Now West Cork is a very big area, indeed, and not alone is it big&mdash;there are constituencies as big as West Cork&mdash;but it is a very difficult constituency to travel over, and to represent adequately, but it has suffered a loss in population.  Being the type of district it is, very large and very poor, I was anxious it should have as much representation as possible.  It seems inconsistent, in a way, with my own views in favour of small constituencies, that I should do anything that would extend one which is already large. But what is one to do in a case of that kind?  West Cork being a Gaelic area and scattered and poor would, I think, need more attention than the other portions of the county, North Cork represented by Deputy O'Leary, or East Cork represented by Deputy Corry.</P>

      <P>I have not the figures by me at the moment, but I looked at the map again, and went over the various <Col N="438" /> suggestions made.  If the Deputy looks at the map he will see that the present boundaries of the constituency of North Cork are well marked and are on well defined lines.  From the point of view of transport and all that sort of thing, it is well looked after.  Various changes have been suggested to me but they would make it terribly lop-sided.  If you take a part of West Cork and add it to East Cork, it will make that a very lop-sided constituency.  If you take portion of East Cork and put it on to West Cork, it will make matters very difficult from the boundary point of view and from other points of view.  I realise that there is agreement among certain sections of the representatives of County Cork but there is nothing like unanimity on any of the suggestions made.  If we got all the members for Cork County together&mdash;I should have to condition that by leaving out Youghal; that will have to stand&mdash; I do not think that we would get agreement amongst them on any division.  That is my experience.</P>

      <P>I have one comment to make on the speech the Minister has just made.  When he turns his mind to the County of Waterford, <Col N="440" /> a four-member constituency seems to him so attractive that he is prepared to violate county boundaries and to mutilate the County of Cork to secure it.  When he turns his mind to the County of Roscommon, a four-member constituency seems to him so unattractive, that he is prepared to violate county boundaries and to mutilate the County Roscommon to avoid it.  What is the explanation of that inconsistency? It is very difficult to think of a respectable one and, for my part, I can think of none except it be that the Government Party organisers believe that in a three-member constituency in Waterford the Opposition would probably get two out of the three seats and that they believe that in a three-member constituency in Roscommon the Government will get two out of the three seats.  In respect of the latter, I expect they will be very much mistaken.</P>

      <P>As I stated, we have no desire to take any part of County Waterford.  The figures for the new East Cork constituency and for the County Waterford show clearly that if either is to get four seats, it should be Cork.  The figures of population for the new East Cork constituency are 79,777 and the figures for County Waterford, 78,562.  To cause a lesser upset, the Waterford population should be added to that of County Cork.  As to the base of government, that was in the town of Youghal and the town of Youghal is in the County Cork.</P>

      <P>There is nothing in Deputy MacDermot's argument.  Either East Cork or Waterford should be a four-member constituency.  The question is which.  I feel keenly on this matter.  I feel all the more keenly because, as pointed out by Deputy O'Neill, the Chairman of the Cork County Council happens to be in the sundered portion of the constituency. I may add this: that even if we were <Col N="441" /> in a two-thirds majority of Cork County Council, the chairman must still remain the same.  So far as we, in Cork County, are concerned, we do not differ in that respect.  I should like to appeal to the Minister to make no division in the boundary of County Cork, whatever other divisions he may make.  I feel keenly on this matter and I ask the Minister to leave this question to a free vote.</P>

      <P>I hope that the Minister will be affected to some extent by the remarks of Deputy MacDermot, who has unconsciously confirmed my ideas as to the unreasonable and illogical behaviour of the Minister in regard to some of these constituencies. As regards West Cork, I am sorry that the Minister is going to behave undemocratically and is going to force his view on the House when there is, more or less, unanimity amongst the members for West Cork that this division is not at all a satisfactory one. The Minister says that he knows that West Cork presents a difficult problem. He may know it in a very abstract way.  He has no realisation of how difficult it is.  I am sure that Deputy Murphy, who has agreed, to some extent, with the Minister's addition of Macroom to West Cork as being the best way out of a difficulty, would be prepared to fall in with the other members if a conference were held regarding the Cork constituencies.</P>

      <P>I suppose it is unusual, but I must, in the first place, <Col N="442" /> express my appreciation of the Minister's recognition of my efforts in the county, and of Deputy Corry's statement. Coming back to the question of population, I made my case for the retention of the county boundaries. If they have to be outraged at all, I have no desire to take over portion of County Waterford.  I have no authority or mandate to speak for Waterford, but merely support the view put up before, that that portion of County Waterford has been all the time administered in Youghal.</P>
      <P>In support of that point of view may I say that the public business relating to that portion of the County Waterford has always been administered by the Youghal No. 2 Rural District Council.  If the Minister desires to follow the line of least resistance he has that precedent to go on.  There was very little difficulty experienced in creating the old Youghal No. 2 Rural District area, and there should be little difficulty adding it to the Cork constituency.  I am not suggesting it but I am pointing it out to the Minister as the line of least resistance.  The business of the Youghal No. 2 Rural District Council, since the passing of the Local Government Act of 1898, was administered from Youghal.  The people of that area have all their business interests centred in Youghal.  All their associations are connected with it.  If one may say so, Youghal is their Mecca.  When speaking about Baltinglass yesterday the Minister used precisely the same arguments in relation to it that I am putting forward now in the case of Youghal.  He said that the interests of the people in that area were centred in Baltinglass; that their associations with it had been very intimate for 100 years or so and that he did not wish to disturb them. The Minister's arguments apply with even greater force in the case of Youghal.</P>

      <P>The Minister has stated that in order to comply with an Article of the Constitution it became necessary to introduce this Bill. Deputy Murphy said that there were four or five schemes under consideration by the last Government.  I never heard of any of them.  The fact that Deputy Corkery, Deputy Moylan and myself are agreed about North Cork shows that we should be the best judges as to what is most suitable for the people of that area.  Deputy Moylan said that portions of the new constituency would be 20 miles apart. That, surely, is a good argument for giving further consideration to this whole scheme for the County Cork. Personally, I do not care what you <Col N="444" /> do.  As Deputy Moylan said, either of us may get the boot at the next election.  That is not the point, but rather what is going to be most convenient for the people.  Portion of North Cork constituency is within four miles of where Deputy Murphy resides.  Supposing that I get returned at the next election some of my constituents will be residing about 50 miles from my place.  The people in North Cork have no business dealings and no connection whatever with the West Cork area.  I again appeal to the Minister to give an opportunity for further consideration of this whole scheme so that what is most convenient for the people may be agreed upon. As Deputy Hales and Deputy O'Neill said, parts of West Cork are very poor, and I think that for the sake of 4,000 or 5,000 votes something should be done to accommodate the people residing there.  I do not think it is fair for the sake of these 4,000 or 5,000 votes to tear up the whole constituency and create all this disorder and inconvenience for the people.</P>

      <P>As far as I understand from the remarks of the Minister, he is going to consider some aspects of the Bill, particularly with regard to Cork.  Surely there will be other matters to be considered, particularly when he begins to review the First Schedule, after hearing what the House had to say about it.  The Minister told us that he had not consulted the different Parties in connection with his proposals and, as far as I can imagine, only to a limited extent his colleagues. He stated that he heard some opinions, but that he did not agree with them, and that he then put this Bill before the House.  He appeared to suggest that he was rather open to have the opinions of the House when dealing with different constituencies.  As far as I can see, his Party has been open-minded in connection with some constituencies, and rather narrow with other constituencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to see what he can do between this and the Report Stage to make a more presentable Schedule than the one there is as the Bill leaves this House.  As the Minister is taking a nice pattern home, when he looks at the city he represents he will find, with an eight-member constituency north of the river, and a seven-member constituency south of the river, that it is proposed to divide the constituency north of the river into two, and to divide the constituency south of the river into two, because they were too big. The mind of the Party was rather narrow when looking north of the river and we have the North Dublin constituency divided.  But the mind and the heart of the Fianna Fáil Party expanded when they came to the south of the river.  Not only did they not take the seven-member constituency south of the river and divide it on the grounds the Minister explained, that it was too big, but they added a bit to it.  When considering the Schedule between now and the <Col N="447" /> time the House will consider the matter again on Report, I hope the Minister will have the situation around the City of Dublin reviewed, because there is neither rhyme, reason nor sense in having the matter dealt with by the Fianna Fáil Party in this House in the way in which the north and south sides of the city are being dealt with.</P>
      <P>We turn then to constituencies like Limerick and Kerry.  The County Limerick is to be left in one constituency, with seven members, while Kerry is to be taken and divided into two.  Again I would like to know why the heart and mind of the Fianna Fáil Party, which really in this House controls the decision that was taken on this Bill, should expand against the principles that were enunciated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce about small constituencies and why they should expand beyond and above those principles in the case of Limerick and stick to them as closely as they can in the case of Kerry?  We had again the principle that the county boundaries should be respected and that four-member constituencies were not acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister and Deputy Corry, particularly if he is to go into any discussion on the matter between now and his putting forward of amendments on Report Stage, will explode what I say is a fact that the Cork constituencies are divided up because it is necessary in the Minister's opinion to take away Youghal and give it to Waterford.  The Minister is doing that to create in Waterford a four-seat constituency.  He is dividing Cork simply because he wants to take Youghal away and put it into Waterford.  I think Deputy Corry cannot be as blind to the situation as he professes here to be.  I hope, however, the Minister will convince him on the matter before the goes down to face the Cork people and on the other hand I hope the Cork people will make the Deputy realise that he is wrong when he goes down to them.  From one end to the other the Minister will find when he reviews this, all kinds of anomalies existing in the Schedule. <Col N="448" /> These are anomalies which should not exist when a Bill leaves this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Schedule a very peculiar situation exists with regard to Donegal.  We moved for the rejection of the first proposal with regard to Donegal and that proposal was rejected.  We then put forward an amendment which would naturally have followed from the decision taken, but with the assistance of a paired member of the House that amendment was rejected by a majority of one.  The situation appears to be now that under the Bill as it stands Donegal remains a constituency represented by eight members, in face of the fact that it is desirable, bearing in mind the provisions of the Constitution, that the representation of Donegal should be reduced by one in order to bring it into line with its population.  I want to know if, between now and the Report Stage, the Minister will take into counsel the Deputies representing Donegal in order to ascertain from all Parties what the bulk of opinion is in the County Donegal as to the arrangement that ought to be made.  If the Minister is determined on partitioning the county, and it seems he is, I suggest that he ought to consult the Deputies of all Parties as to the line on which the division should be made. I think that no proposal for a redivision of the county into West and East Donegal can be entertained again because that has been rejected already on the Committee Stage.  Any new amendment for the division of the county must be along the lines of North and South Donegal.  When the Minister is bringing forward a proposal on the Report Stage I trust he will bring forward such a proposal as will commend itself to all sides.</P>

    <P>A variety of questions arise on this matter in reference to the division of Donegal.  The question that is primarily deserving of consideration when making that division would be to ensure so far as possible that the Donegal Gaeltacht is to be comprised in one division of the county, and that the other division of the county will contain none of the Gaeltacht except <Col N="449" /> some small fraction, such as Mourne in the North of Innishowen.  I know the Minister will find it impossible to bring the Innishowen Gaeltacht into any constituency which would comprise West Donegal.  The Minister should do whatever is possible to provide for a division that will comprise all the Gaeltacht areas in the county in one.</P>

      <P>I want just to ask the Minister to look into the anomaly presented by the three neighbouring constituencies of Tipperary, Limerick and Kerry.  As they stand in the Bill at the moment the division is absurd.</P>

      <P>I want just to point out with reference to the statement made by Deputy Dillon that his amendment was rejected by the assistance of a paired Deputy, that that statement is not true.</P>

      <P>On the contrary, it is perfectly true.  The Chief Whip of the Deputy's Party was shown the name of Deputy Doctor Lynch being paired with the name of Deputy Desmond.</P>

      <P>I am quite satisfied that the Chief Whip of the Government Party did not consciously permit Deputy Lynch to come into the Lobby after he had been paired, but the Chief Whip overlooked the fact that he had been paired, and Deputy Lynch went into the Division Lobby after he had been paired with Deputy Desmond.  I do not think Deputy Little knew it.  I am sure if he had known it he would have stopped him.  But it did happen. It is a thing that we ought to take warning from.  It is a matter out of which no political capital could be made by one side or the other.</P>

      <P>If there were general principles governing the Bill, these principles have now been changed, and I was going to suggest that on the Report Stage greater freedom should be allowed with regard to amendments under discussion than is ordinarily allowed in Bills.</P>
