      <P>2.  That the levy mentioned in this Resolution shall be paid by the person who is registered as the proprietor of the premises in which the animal in respect of which the levy is payable is slaughtered.</P>

      <P>Under No. 101 of the Standing Orders of Dáil Eireann a Financial Resolution is necessary to authorise the charge which the Minister for Agriculture proposes to levy under Section 17 of the Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Bill, 1934.  The rate of the levy proposed will be £1 per head for cattle and 5/- per head for sheep.  It will be payable by the registered proprietors of registered slaughtering premises in respect of cattle and sheep slaughtered on such premises.  The annual amount of the levy to be thus obtained will be treated as an Appropriation in Aid of the Vote required for the purposes of the Bill. I presume, in view of the arrangement which has been arrived at as to Parliamentary time, that any discussion on this matter will be reserved for the principal discussion on the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>This means an increase of taxation by a considerable amount.  Perhaps taxation to a greater extent than that amount is going to be used in such a way as to hide the fact that it is actually taxation&mdash;that is, that it will not pass through the ordinary accounting channels. Here we will have another £300,000 imposed on the country without the Minister showing in any kind of budgetary statement that this additional taxation exists.</P>

      <P>The Minister will find there is not much information contained in the Bill.  There is not a single word about what is going to happen with regard to this particular <Col N="2042" /> levy.  The Minister tells us that this is going to come in as an Appropriation-in-Aid to some particular Vote. Why should not income-tax come in as an Appropriation-in-Aid to some of the Votes that are expended in the country?  The Minister, however, then relates to this particular levy the expenditure of money on schemes which, the Minister tells us, the Minister for Agriculture will have authority to set up.  As I understand it, from the Bill, the Minister for Agriculture may become a cattle dealer.  He may become a grazier.  He may become a slaughterer. He may become a victualler. He may set up an establishment for the making of tripe.  He may go into the sale of tripe.</P>

      <P>We are being told that this levy, that is now sought to be imposed under this Financial Resolution, is going to be used for the purpose of financing all those things.  Is this levy going to be used for the purpose of making the loans that may be issued from the Exchequer to persons who are going to extend their victualling business or other manufacturing business that arises out of the slaughtering of cattle and sheep and the use of offals?  The Minister should give us at this particular stage a complete picture of what is going to be done with this money.  There is no other stage in the discussion of the measure before the House where the House can more suitably get full information with regard to the financial implications of the proposal as regards taxation, or what he is going to do with the money when he gets it, than the House can get in discussing the Financial Resolution in Committee here.  I think that the House should be taken more into the confidence of <Col N="2043" /> the Minister and into the confidence of the Minister for Agriculture at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the only point that arises is the amount of the levy and its purpose.  It is to be devoted to the general purposes of the Bill.  If the Deputy is anxious to hear that, I suggest that he should reserve his speech until he has heard the speech of the Minister on the Second Reading of the Bill.  It has been indicated already to Deputy Cosgrave that the actual levy is estimated to produce something like £305,000, that the expenditure on that part of the Bill which will enable the Minister to supply meat to certain persons is estimated to be approximately £400,000, and, in addition to that, this Bill also gives the Minister powers to deal with surplus and diseased and old cattle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Parts VII and VIII of the Bill.  In any event, one thing is clear: that if this levy is to be described as a tax, at any rate it is a tax which is being imposed for the benefit of the cattle producers in this country. I understand that the Party opposite are very gravely concerned with the position of the cattle trade in this country.  They have been calling on the Government to do something to help the cattle producers.  That is the purpose of this Bill.  The levy will produce very much less than will be required to put directly and indirectly into the pockets of the cattle producers an additional £500,000 a year, and so far from being a burden it is a subsidy to production and will go to assist those engaged in the cattle industry in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's argument that this is a subsidy to the cattle producers makes it all the more important that at this particular stage we should hear the Minister for Agriculture on the financial implications of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that this Bill gives power for a levy by which <Col N="2044" /> the Minister will get £305,000.  I should like to ask the Minister, whom will he get it from?  Who is going to pay the levy?  Is it not the farmers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>You charge £1 a head on cattle and 5s. a head on sheep. Will not that be pushed on to the farmer?  Let there be no mistake about it.  To say that a Bill like this, raising in the first instance £305,000, is a benefit to the cattle producers of this country, is beyond all reason.  I am concerned with the levy of £305,000.

I should like to know from the Minister for Agriculture how many cattle are consumed in this country every year. That many cattle represents that many pounds, and does he suggest that all the cattle consumed in this country, paying £1 a head, and all the sheep consumed in this country, paying 5s. a head, will realise only £305,000?  If <Col N="2045" /> there ever was insult added to injury, it is this, and in their supreme ignorance both Ministers and Deputies opposite laugh and smile at this proposition. Not a single man who is making his living from agriculture will smile at this, but those parasites who are drawing salaries as professional politicians and the like, living on the backs of the producers of this country, can afford to smile at this.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;before they went out on strike and when we had printing facilities in this House, we had on the Order Paper a number of resolutions dealing with the cattle trade.  The President was asked, when they were put down first, to give Government time for the discussion as the matter was so pressing, but on every occasion the Minister for Agriculture got up and said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We are considering it; the Government is alive to the situation and we are bringing in a Bill to relieve the pressure.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2046" /> Now we have the Bill.  We have first of all a financial resolution.  What relief is it going to bring to the cattle trade?  The relief that Deputy Curran pointed out.  The relief the cattle trade that is depressed has got is to pay now a tax of £1 per head on cattle.  That is the way the cattle industry is going to be relieved.  What does £1 per head on cattle and 5/- per head on sheep mean to an already depressed industry?  Is this the way it is going to be relieved? The suggestion is made that the butchers are going to bear it.  That is the implication.  Why do not some of you over there on the Government side go into the butchering trade if there is anything to be made by it?  You will not go into it, because there is work in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how the Deputy knows that I had him in mind at all.  But to resume, there is a beast there brought in for slaughter, and any money arising out of that transaction must come out of that beast.  There is no other source but the beast that is brought in to be slaughtered from which the money can be taken.  It does not stand argument to contend otherwise. This levy is a levy on the beast that is brought in to be slaughtered. That levy will be very material to the minimum price that will be fixed. Whether the butchers are getting too much now or whether they are not is beside the question.  There is a levy of £1 a head on cattle and 5/- on sheep, and that levy comes off the cattle or the sheep.  That is the commercial article that you have to deal with, and the £1 and the 5/- come off the cattle and sheep respectively, and that money is taken off them by the Minister for Finance.  The definition of the word &ldquo;cattle&rdquo; in this Financial Resolution includes &ldquo;bulls, cows, bullocks, heifers, calves.&rdquo;  Will the owners of the calves who took them in to be slaughtered at 6d. apiece be called upon to pay £1 a head for them?  Will that levy be made on them?  Will there be a levy of £1 a head on old cows worth about 10/-?  We should have some scale.  I am sure it is not intended to levy £1 upon &ldquo;cattle&rdquo; as defined in this Resolution. What is the purpose of the levy?  What need is there for that levy? The Minister has not explained the necessity for it.  His promise of a Bill following this Resolution has been to help the cattle industry.  This is not helping the cattle industry.  It is going <Col N="2048" /> to be a hindrance.  That promised help was presumed to be an outlet for our surplus cattle; the cattle for which we have not a market.  But the Minister is going to tax these cattle.  I do not want to go into a discussion on what is proper to the Bill itself.  Boiled down, this Resolution is, first of all: nobody can sell cattle and sheep without a permit.  Nobody can buy without a permit.  The holders of permits buying cattle and sheep must pay the Government £1 a head for cattle and 5/- a head for sheep.  That is the help the Minister is offering.  We have not been told how the money is to be used or for what purpose.  It will go back to the Exchequer.  It will, and so does all taxation.  That is the proper place for it.  This is taxation and nothing else, camouflage it as you will.  This is new taxation introduced under the guise of helping the agricultural industry. There will be more heard about it by the Government before the Bill is through.</P>

He complains that this Resolution on the Order Paper is not discussed, that it would be better to discuss that than to bring in a Bill.  That explains his outlook.  As long as the Deputy is talking he thinks he is helping agriculture. He then complains that the daily papers are not there to report him.

      <P>Deputy Belton and Deputy Curran talked about the farmer paying this levy, but these Deputies would do well to read the Bill before they make statements like that.  If we fix the price the butcher cannot take it from the farmer.  If we compel the butcher to pay a fixed price for the cattle, the butcher must pay that £1 or pass it on to the consumer.  There is not much use in dealing with a mentality which refuses to recognise that. That is what the Bill does; it makes the butcher pay the fixed price.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that there was a certain desire to have business expedited and finished by early next week if possible.  I thought we might have all this discussion on Second Reading.  It is impossible to explain everything in connection with the levy without a Second Reading speech.  I must go into what the Bill is doing for home consumption and free meat.  If we are going to have a full discussion it will take time.  There is also the part of the Bill dealing with the projected manufacture and processing of beef, whether in the form of calves or old cows or anything else, and there will be considerable expenditure.  Free meat may cost £400,000 a year, and the disposal of calves and of old cows may cost £150,000; that is, £550,000 a year. <Col N="2051" /> So that, in all probability, this Bill will cost the Exchequer about £600,000 a year.</P>
      <P>We are raising this levy because we think the consumers of meat who are getting it at a lower charge now than what they were getting it three or four years ago, should bear part of that cost, not as taxpayers but as consumers. The other part will be borne by the taxpayers.  Somebody has said that that is mere camouflage, a queer way of getting taxation.  Well, call it taxation if you like.  We are raising the money and paying it into the Exchequer.  There is no doubt about that.  Whether you call it a levy or call it taxation, I do not in the least mind, but there is no camouflage about it. There is the question as to the difference between mature beef and calves and old cows.  However, there will be one levy of £1 all round.  There may be exceptional cases, but the figures of £1 and 5/- were given more for the purpose of calculation.  There is nothing to prevent the Minister for Agriculture either raising or lowering the levy or doing away with it altogether They are there for the purposes of calculation, and the calculation is based on 100,000 cattle a year and 500,000 sheep.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister when he says that some of the matters raised by Deputy Belton might be more usefully raised on the Second Reading Stage of the Bill.  My main purpose in rising now is to ask the Minister to clarify the position more in relation to the consumer.  He says that £600,000 will eventually have to be paid by the taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>They are almost synonymous terms.  Every consumer is a taxpayer, and almost every taxpayer is a consumer.  We have been told by the Minister that meat for some time past has been very cheap.  I accept the Minister's own words when he says that now the consumer will have to pay considerably more for his meat. I do not think that is a very cheery message to send to the people at this particular stage in our economic history, <Col N="2052" /> and in view of all that has taken place since the economic dispute with another country started.  I would like the Minister to make it plain that under this Bill the consumers of different classes of meat&mdash;beef and mutton&mdash;will have to pay more for their beef and mutton than heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister tried to make a point that because he gets power under the Bill that will enable him to fix the price for beef and mutton, he can fix it at a figure which will take this burden of the levy off the producers, and compel the butcher to buy at that fixed price.  From beginning to end of this Bill there is no power sought to make anybody buy any beef at any price.  But there is power to fix the minimum price, and the butcher can go out of business or find it at that price.  There is a level above which he cannot charge. If you go above that level, and you will have to go above it, you put it on the consumer; if you go below it, you put it on the producer.  This £1 comes out of the value of beef, and the 5s. out of the value of sheep; and this is a Bill for the agricultural industry and for the cattle trade.  The Minister is not so pure in his past as to be able to taunt anyone in this House with selling himself to the highest bidder. The price I was to be given by the Party opposite I would not take, but the Minister came along and took it.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister rather expected this Resolution to go through the House without any discussion whatever.  I do not know why he should expect that.  There is a new procedure adopted with regard to this Bill never adopted with regard to any other Bill I know of.  We did have a levy in the Butter Bill, but in the Bill itself we had a definite detailed explanation of how the levy was to be used and for what it was to be used.  The House has a perfect right, in discussing this Financial Resolution, to ask that some Minister <Col N="2053" /> should get up and give the House definite information as to the particular way in which the levy is to be expended. We are entitled to full details of how it is to be expended. Deputy Mulcahy referred to various ways in which it might be expended, and why.  I do not know that the Minister will use it in any of these particular ways but we are entitled, as I say, to full information as to how he intends to expend it.  The Minister did not say that he intended to make buttons but I think he said that he had power already to do so if he wished.  He might wish to make horns, musical horns, to blow his own horn, if you like.</P>

      <P>I do protest against the Resolution being passed before we are given full detailed information of how the levy will be expended.  There are other matters in regard to expenditure to which the Minister alluded a moment ago which can be dealt with on the Bill itself, but the House has a right to know how this £305,000 will be expended.  My own opinion is that when this Bill becomes law, if it ever does become law, there will be no fat cattle left.  By the time the sheriff and the bailiffs have finished belting them hither and thither there will be no fat cattle for anybody to consume.</P>

      <P>This Estimate is required to provide a Grant-in-Aid of £200 towards the expenses of the Committee for Quaternary Research in Ireland.  The Committee which has charge of this work is acting as a National Sub-Commission of the International Commission for the Study of Fossil Man, and its members include prominent archæologists, geologists and botanists in Dublin and Belfast.  The research work, which will extend over the entire country, is expected to occupy a period of three years, and will include study of the geology, palæobotany, zoology and archæology of the recent deposits and an investigation of the growth and stratification of peat bogs in Ireland.  The work will be under the general supervision of Professor Knud Jessen and of Mr. Jonassen, who are Danish experts in the subject, with whom will be associated students selected from University College, Dublin, and Dublin University.  Professor Jessen has kindly offered to give the associated students general training in his own laboratories in Copenhagen.</P>
      <P>The Committee for Quaternary Research has obtained £100 from local Irish sources towards the expenses of the investigation.  One half of this sum has been granted by various scientific bodies, and the other half has been raised by private subscription.  In addition, a contribution of £100 has been obtained from a Danish fund which is available for International Research. Grants are being given by University College, Dublin, and Dublin University to meet the expenses of students to be selected for training in Copenhagen in connection with the scheme.  It may be anticipated in connection with this Vote that applications will also be forthcoming for State assistance towards the expenses of the Research in the second and third years.</P>

      <P>There is just one remark I would like to make on the measure, and it is that the Ministerial Party at times make a virtue of paying people small salaries.  Now that Limerick, in its particular difficulty, has asked to be provided with the machinery that has already been provided for Dublin and Cork, the Minister, through some machinery or another, will be finding a manager for the City of Limerick.  The problem of the City of Limerick, in normal circumstances, may be regarded as minor, perhaps, when classed with the problems to be dealt with in cities like Dublin and Cork, but, nevertheless, the real problems and the type of work that will have to be performed by a manager in the City of Limerick are of a very high order.  The Minister will not be able to get either the character or quality required to stand over the affairs of the city, in co-operating with the council, in looking after the general interests of the ratepayers, in foreseeing the city's problems and helping both the citizens and their council to make arrangements in advance to deal with them in the most satisfactory way if he fixes some small and meagre salary for the city manager.  I consider a case could be made that a man of the calibre that would satisfactorily run Limerick could do a lot more in his more or less spare official time, but nevertheless I do not think that any consideration such as that should operate with the Minister in settling what the salary and emoluments of the manager in the City of Limerick should be.  I think they should be such that will attract a type of person both in character and ability that will be able to do the very difficult and responsible job, which I am sure the Minister realises the city manager in a city of any size will be called upon to do. That is the only matter that I wish to refer to on this stage of the Bill.</P>

I am sure that the Deputies representing the city and the Deputies from the <Col N="2059" /> county will not cavil about the amount of salary that is paid to a competent person to take charge of the municipal affairs of the city.

      <P>The appointment of a permanent manager will be a matter for the Local Appointments Commission.  The matter that Deputy Mulcahy mentioned is an important one.  I agree with him, and I agree with Deputy Reidy, that on the person to be appointed there will fall very heavy duties and responsibilities, and that the very greatest care must be taken to select a person who will be fully equal to the great responsibilities that the managership of a large growing city like Limerick will put upon his shoulders.  I am sure there are men to be had in the country who have the knowledge and experience as well as fitness in other respects &mdash; in character and otherwise &mdash; for this responsible post.  While I have given some thought to the question of the amount of salary to be paid, I have not fully made up my mind on it.  I would say clearly to the House and to Deputy Mulcahy that my desire certainly is not to be mean with regard to salary in this matter, or with regard to salaries in other matters where officials generally, in the Government service or in the service of local authorities are concerned.  I would like to see a salary fixed for the post that would attract the right type of man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2060" /> There is, I suggest, no comparison between the amount of work to be done by the manager of a city like Limerick with its population, and the work to be done by, say, the City Manager in cities like Cork and Dublin.  There is a very considerable difference in the amount of work and responsibility, and naturally some consideration has to be given to the question of the remuneration in the light of the comparison that might be made.  At any rate, I would like to see a salary fixed that would attract what I would regard as the right type of man, because if we do not get the right type of man for Limerick or any other city &mdash; I am told that there are other cities thinking now much on the same lines as the Limerick Corporation have been thinking in the last year or two: they are thinking of changing their system &mdash;then the whole city managership system would collapse.  The success of it depends on getting the right type of person.  Therefore I would like to see a man selected who would rise to his responsibilities.  I certainly will give very serious consideration, indeed, to the question of salary, because I know that on that will depend the future successful working of the managership system in Limerick and elsewhere.</P>

A reference was made here on the Second Stage of the Bill to an official who was appointed as Commissioner to administer the affairs of the Limerick County Borough Board of Health from 1929 to 1931.  That official was charged with employing slave labour.  Some references of that kind were made.  I want to say, in defence of that official, that he did more for the <Col N="2061" /> poor of Limerick City in the way of setting up proper hospital accomodation and dealing with the poor law services of Limerick, than the Committee of Management and the board of health who were occupying the administrative position for nine years before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the discussion which has already taken place here to-day, I think I may commence by saying that this Bill was drafted entirely for the benefit of the producer of the cattle. It is not intended that either the butcher or the seller or the consumer or the taxpayer should get any benefit as a result of the Bill.  As a matter of fact, I think it will be fairly plain that either the consumer or the taxpayer must contribute towards the benefits which the producer will get under the Bill as it now appears.  There is, admittedly, a depression in the cattle trade, and in order to get a clear basis of tackling that problem we want to see to what the depression is due.  In the first place, there has been, during the past three or four years, a very steep fall in world prices of beef and cattle, and with that particular part of the cause of the depression we cannot attempt to deal under this Bill at any rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second thing that occurred as far as cattle are concerned in this country was the penal tariff imposed by Great Britain in 1932.  When that tariff was imposed our cattle fell, roughly, by the difference between the tariff and the bounty which was given, but there was free sale for cattle, and at any rate we can claim that the producer of cattle was getting the best possible price that could be expected from the buyer who exported.  When the quota was imposed on the 1st January of this year quite a different <Col N="2062" /> position arose.  We had, then, those who were buying cattle for export buying them in restricted numbers, where the number for sale was greater than the demand.  It was quite plain before very long that the producer was not getting as much as he should get, allowing the trader the ordinary profits that he was accustomed to take.  We did attempt to deal with that problem, of course, during the stall-feeding period, by giving licences to the feeders themselves, and in that way the difficulty was got over to a certain extent &mdash; in fact, I suppose to the full extent &mdash; but it would be impossible to continue that system for grass-fed beef.  This Bill is introduced principally to correct the unnecessary fall in price which was the result of the quota, and also to deal with the surplus cattle which may or may not be there as the result of the restriction of exports from this country.</P>
    <P>This Bill is urgent in many ways.  I believe in this country the quota position could be dealt with if the producers were willing to take advice. When this quota was brought in early in the year we had a preliminary census taken immediately of the number of fat cattle in the stalls.  We knew from our census that those cattle could be disposed of either by exporting them or by using them for home consumption before the end of the stall-feeding period, that is to say, about the end of May.  We made it known publicly that, according to the census taken by the officers of the Department of Agriculture, we believed that those cattle could be disposed of, but we had, on the other hand, to contend with Press propaganda and statements and motions put on the Order Paper here, such as the motion put down by Deputy Belton referring to a surplus of 58 per cent. Naturally the farmer-producers got the idea that there was really a surplus of stall-fed cattle in the country. As a result of this Press propaganda, and propaganda by Deputy Belton and others, many of those cattle were sold at a much lower price than they might have been sold at.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>And some not sold at all.  What about those?</P>

    <Col N="2063" />
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The cattle were entirely disposed of by the end of May.  As a matter of fact, I think it is quite true to say that there were much fewer stall feeders in the stalls at the end of May this year than there were in the stalls in the previous year.  Of course, there was a very big and unnecessary loss to the farmers, because the farmers with stall feeders down the country sold their cattle at about 15/- a cwt., or even less, while the cattle for export were sold at 25/- or 27/- a cwt. If the farmers had not got the idea that there was a surplus, and had not developed a sort of panic, they would naturally have held out for the higher price.  It would have meant £4 10s. or £5 a head on those cattle which were sold at those lower prices.  There is no doubt that the Department of Agriculture was right in its census, because the cattle were disposed of.  We also find from the ordinary yearly census, the preliminary figures of which have arrived within the last two or three days, that the number of cattle now in the country is not any higher than it was this time last year, so that really this political propaganda about a surplus of 58 per cent. had no foundation whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first and the principal object of this Bill is to compel home butchers to pay a fixed price for cattle.  It has been pointed out by Deputy Belton that there is nothing in this Bill to compel any man to purchase any beast. That is quite true.  We have not gone so far as to take power to say to a butcher: You must kill two or three cattle per week that we will deliver to you, and you must pay the price we say.  We have, however, gone this far, saying to a butcher: You must not kill any cattle unless you pay the price fixed by the Minister for Agriculture. If a home butcher intends to continue in trade, he must pay the fixed price. If he gets out we have no redress under this Bill except to let him go out.  We presume that sufficient traders will remain in the cattle trade to supply the wants of the people of this country with beef.  In order to give an idea of how this fixed price of meat is to work, let us assume that the export price of <Col N="2064" /> finished cattle is 25/- per cwt., and that we fix the price for home-killed cattle at 25/- per cwt.  Assuming that the demand for cattle for export and for slaughter at home is sufficient, then we shall have achieved our object without going any further with this Bill.  If there is a surplus we will have to go on to other parts of the Bill.  If there is no surplus, and if the demand is equal to the supply, both for cattle slaughtered at home and cattle exported, then we have only to fix the price of cattle and, whether exported or killed at home, they will bring that price and we will have solved the difficulty as far as fat cattle are concerned.</P>
    <P>As to the working of fixed prices, buyers of cattle for home slaughter must be registered.  One of the most difficult questions we have to deal with is how are prices to be fixed and how are the cattle to be sold?  The only sure and safe way of having the Bill operated is by having the cattle sold by weight.  We could not possibly have fixed prices on any other basis.  The cattle must be sold by weight and the fixed price will be on a certain figure per live cwt.  Deputies who have read the Bill will see that the price can be fixed, and even the details with regard to the number of hours a beast is fasting before weighing takes place.  No difficulties will arise under this system of selling cattle by weight.  There may be a difficulty in districts remote from any large town where no weighing facilities are available, but in such cases they may by order be declared exempted areas from selling by weight.  The animals can be sold by weight, the weight being that which in the opinion of the inspector they will weigh.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They must have some practical knowledge.  It is an offence both for buyers and sellers to engage in any transactions otherwise than selling by weight as prescribed.  If a farmer sells a beast to a butcher other than in an exempted area, and if he agreed to sell <Col N="2065" /> the beast by hand rather than by weight, he is committing an offence, and so is the buyer, and both can be brought to court and fined.  On the other hand, if a buyer buys cattle at less than the fixed price, it is not an offence for the seller, but it is an offence on the part of the buyer, and as a matter of fact the seller is entitled, any time within 12 months, to sue the buyer for the balance due to him.  That is a necessary provision, owing to the experience of other countries in the working of similar schemes. For instance, there is a fixed price for bacon in a neighbouring country, but in some cases, where there was a surplus of pigs, there was a scramble between producers to see whose pigs would be taken.  The buyers took advantage of the position and got pigs at much less than the fixed price, but the sellers could not report because they were also guilty of an offence.  In this Bill we do not make it an offence for a seller to sell under the fixed price, so that he may be free afterwards to report and have the buyer brought to court and made pay what is due.</P>
      <P>It will be necessary to register retailers of beef and mutton so that in the investigation of offences the meat may be traced to its destination.  A price may be fixed for different classes of cattle.  We may fix a price for heifers, bullocks, and young cows. Deputies will realise that it would be impossible to fix a price for first or second class heifers or bullocks.  If we did so we would have to get immediately the opinion of someone as to whether they were first or second class animals.  We could fix different prices for the best light heifers, the best heavy heifers, the best light bullocks or the best heavy bullocks, but these matters will be decided principally on the measure of administrative possibilities and difficulties.  Under this arrangement of fixed prices the local butchers will be as good buyers as exporters, and it will certainly save the great anxiety amongst cattle owners to get export licences.  It will pay just as well to sell to local butchers as to exporters, and in that way the value of export licences will be reduced to nil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The various parts of the Bill will be <Col N="2066" /> brought into operation by order.  We can operate one, two or three parts, and may find it unnecessary to operate other parts.  If the demand for cattle is equal to the supply, then we need only operate Part V, dealing with fixed prices.  It is more than likely, however, that we may have at certain periods of the year to bring in other parts of the Bill.  It is more than likely that we may have a surplus of cattle at one particular period of the year which, if kept over, could be used at another period.  In that case we would have to bring in Part IV, which deals with the marking of cattle.  We have had some experience of the marking of cattle during the early part of this year.  We had inspectors going round to see the cattle in the stalls.  They did not mark the cattle, but sent back a form to the Department of Agriculture stating that owners had so many cattle, and that so many of them were fit for sale within that month.  We mean to go into the matter in more detail under this Bill, and to have a more methodical way of dealing with it.  The cattle will be actually marked, and no other cattle can be bought for home slaughter within a specified time, except cattle marked by the inspectors. It may be possible that we might have a surplus of cattle in September or October, and we calculate by holding them over they could be used during the following two or three months. In the same way we might have a surplus of cattle in February and March, and we calculate that by keeping them over they could be used during April, May and June.  If the supply for the whole 12 months is not more than the demand, we would not have to go further with this Bill than using Parts IV and V with regard to fixed prices and marking for slaughter.</P>
    <P>We may, however, have a surplus not only at certain periods but for the 12 months.  In that case we shall have to use the power proposed under Parts 7, 8 and 9 of the Bill.  We shall take Part 9 first, because it deals with first-quality beef, which we have been dealing with up to this under Parts 4 and 5.  This part will enable us to dispose of a considerable quantity of first-class beef under the free meat <Col N="2067" /> scheme to those who cannot afford to purchase it.  So far as our present information goes with regard to the census of the total number of cattle in the country and the likelihood of the number of fat cattle which will be available for sale during the autumn months, I think it is extremely likely that we may have to use some of this first-class beef under the free meat scheme.  In fact, I think I may say that it is the intention of the Government to proceed with this part of the Bill immediately it becomes law.</P>
    <P>Under that part of the Bill vouchers for free meat will be issued to those in receipt of home assistance and unemployment assistance.  These are the two classes of people who, it is considered, find it impossible to buy meat sufficient for their families in the ordinary way.  These vouchers will be issued for a certain amount of beef per week, according to the size of the family.  They will take these vouchers to the butcher with whom the Minister for Agriculture has previously made a contract to supply a certain amount of free meat from first-class cattle &mdash; young heifers and bullocks. These contractors will not be compelled to use certain cattle for the purpose.  They will be compelled to take the meat from first-class cattle, but it is quite possible that in many cases they may use what are regarded as the most expensive cuts for their own customers and supply what is termed boiling beef from these good cattle on the free meat vouchers.  In making these contracts we may not meet with any great difficulty.  We may have sufficient competition amongst butchers in any city or town to supply this meat at a reasonable price.  We may, however, have difficulty, as we may have rings formed. In order to meet that situation, Section 40 is inserted in the Bill, under which we can deal with rings of that kind which may be formed.  Section 40, I think, sets out clearly what can be done.</P>
    <P>Part 9 of the Bill, with regard to free meat, I should like to say, is entirely provisional.  It is experimental, and we intend to operate that part for a <Col N="2068" /> period of four, five, or six months.  If it is to be continued after that, it is more than likely that we may change it to a cheap meat scheme rather than a free meat scheme.  We are not prepared to take the risk of running a cheap meat scheme just now, because we may find it difficult and, perhaps, impossible at times in the early stages of the working of the Bill to find this meat for every person with a voucher. We, therefore, think it is much safer to work it entirely <i>ex gratia,</i> so that we are not bound to deliver this meat to a person with a voucher.  All we can do is to do our utmost to supply them.</P>
    <P>If Part IX of the Bill &mdash; that is the part with regard to free meat&mdash;becomes necessary, then Part III will have to be operated, and that is the levy &mdash; the levy which was suggested to-day by the Minister for Finance of £1 per head on cattle and 5/- per head on sheep.  If it is decided under the first order to make the levy, of course it will be possible to vary it from time to time by order.  Circumstances may make it desirable to vary these levies.  If, for instance, the price of sheep goes down, the levy could be increased, and if the price goes up the levy could be lowered.  That is a thing that Deputy Belton, by his reasoning in economics, does not understand, but I will explain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As to sheep, there is a free export at the present time.  Therefore, Deputy Belton will agree, because it is part of his economics, that the export price will regulate the price here.  In other words, if a particular sheep is worth 38/- exported, after paying the tariffs and everything else, to buy a similar sheep at home will cost 38/-.  That is quite plain.  If sheep, therefore, are dear, we are not going to get anything more for the producer here by raising the levy.  It is all the same.  The butcher has to pay the price for the sheep whatever our levy is, because he has to compete with the exporter.  The only way the butcher can deal with the levy is to pass it on to the consumer.  If sheep are dear, we may think it inadvisable to pass on a high levy as well to the consumer, <Col N="2069" /> because mutton would be too dear. Therefore, we lower the levy.  We can put on a high levy if people can afford to pay more for mutton.  Therefore, if sheep are low in price the levy goes up, and if sheep are high in price the levy goes down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to cattle, the influence of the levy must be looked at in a different way.  The price of cattle will be fixed.  Take an example again.  We fix the price of cattle at, say, 25s. per cwt., live-weight. The producer gets that.  He does not care as a producer, though he may, perhaps, as a consumer, what levy we put on.  It is a matter for the butcher to pay that levy and to get his money back whatever way he can.  There again we have to be guided in our levy by the price of beef, not by the price to the consumer and not by the price of cattle to the butcher.  Taking it at 25s. per cwt., live-weight, the butcher is getting cattle very much cheaper than he did for a very long time anyway before, say, a period of twelve months ago. By putting £1 per head on the beast it is only going to make it, roughly, a halfpenny per pound on the beef sold to the consumer.  A halfpenny per pound is a very small increase considering what the present price should be.  It is a very small increase on the consumer, and I think the consumer of beef can very well bear it. I do not mind whether you call that a tax or a levy.  If you like putting a halfpenny on the beef is the same as if the Minister for Finance put a halfpenny on sugar.  It is a tax, if you like.  Let us lose no time arguing over that.  We will admit it is a tax. The consumer can bear the tax, because the price of beef is low compared with what it was three, five, ten or fifteen years ago.  Therefore, the <Col N="2070" /> consumer can afford to pay the extra halfpenny.  In any case, whatever we make the levy, whether £1 or £5 on cattle, or whether 5s. or £1 on sheep, the producer is not suffering one halfpenny. Let us get clear on that.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Belton and Deputy Curran have any concern for the producer of cattle and sheep, let them not argue on that line.  Let them, if they like, have a little concern for the consumer.  We can argue on that basis, because it is the consumer has to pay in this case. The consumer is going to pay the levy. I think the consumer can afford to pay part of the levy.  It is a case of the taxpayer or the consumer paying for the benefits to the producer under this Bill.  If the taxpayer has to pay £500,000 or £600,000 &mdash; and I think it will amount to that &mdash; the Minister for Finance will have to put a tax on some commodity or other, and it is just as well to start now by putting half of that tax on meat, because meat is very cheap.</P>
      <P>Parts VII and VIII of the Bill deal with the manufacture and processing of cattle and sheep products.  I have said already that if we have a surplus of first-class cattle, heifers and bullocks we can deal with them to a great extent in this cheap meat scheme, because with the number of cattle that are being slaughtered at home, the number that are being exported under the quota system and the number that will be slaughtered under this cheap meat scheme &mdash; it is going to amount to 40,000 cattle a year under the free meat scheme &mdash; we will be disposing under those three heads of the same number of fat cattle as we disposed of during the years 1932 and 1933.  Unless there is an increase of fat cattle in the country, we should have no trouble in disposing of them under the heads I have mentioned.</P>

The Minister, in addition to engaging in those various processes, may lend money to another individual or a company, or a co-operative society, to undertake this manufacture and processing of cattle and sheep products, and so on.  Apart from young cattle, heifers and bullocks, there is, we believe, a big surplus of old, useless, diseased cows in the country and one of the factories that is being spoken of and that is likely to mature under this Bill will be a factory to deal with these old cows.  There will be a considerable expense on that factory, because turning old cows into meat meal will involve a considerable subsidy on the price of those cows unless they are sold practically for nothing.  The existing factories which are turning out meat meal, in this as well as in other countries, are getting cattle for that purpose practically for nothing &mdash; merely taking them away.  If we get a factory to deal with the old cows for conversion into meat meal it means that we must pay the owner by way of subsidy.</P>

      <P>I am not sure about the price.  If we give anything over 10/- for them we would be giving more than they are worth, but at the same time we will give considerably more than 10/-.  I had a deputation from Deputy Bennett's constituency, a deputation of dairy farmers, and one of their biggest complaints was that they cannot dispose of the old cows at the present time.  I gathered from them that they would be glad to get £2 or £2 10s. each for the old cows, if we took them from them, and we will give at least that. The working of that factory will probably mean an expenditure of £100,000 to £150,000 a year in addition to the expenses under the other schemes. There is also a small trade in this country for tinned beef and it may be possible to dispose of a certain number of cattle for that purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is now getting interested in the taxpayer.  I thought he was more concerned with the producer. Under Section 35 of the Bill it will be seen that the accounts of this business must be properly audited and laid before each House of the Oireachtas. I mention that in order to assure Deputies that any business I will engage in will have to be accounted for by me here at some time. <Col N="2073" /> I think that gives an outline of what the Bill contains.  The big principles underlying it are to give the best possible price to the producer for his cattle and to deal with the surplus cattle, if there are any.  These are the two big things that I would like should be considered by the Dáil on Second Reading.  If Deputies believe there is a problem under these two headings, if Deputies believe we ought to increase the price of cattle to the producer and that we ought to deal with the surplus cattle, if there are any, then this Bill ought to get a Second Reading.  But if they believe that we are not dealing with the problem in the proper way, then I suggest that the Bill ought still to get a Second Reading, and we might have the ideas of those Deputies submitted by way of amendment on the Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The administrative difficulties of the Bill are not under-estimated by me or by the Department.  It is going to be a very difficult Bill to administer, but if we get co-operation from the producers the Bill can be administered.  It is in the interests of the producer to have the Bill administered as strictly as possible.  Neither am I in any way over optimistic about the results of this Bill.  I have said at the beginning that we hope at least to make right the abuses and the bad effects arising from the quota; in other words, that we may be able to get the producer as much as he is entitled to for his cattle &mdash; the very maximum &mdash; but whether we can go further than that I cannot say at the moment.  At any rate, however, we can get him back so that the ill effects of the quota will be nullified by having this Bill administered and giving him what is due to him for his cattle.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary to discuss in detail the various provisions of the Bill with regard to registration, and so on.  I think that it would be better that these matters should be left over for the Committee Stage, as it would be wrong, in my opinion, to obscure the main principles of the Bill, the two big principles that I mentioned, which are to try to get a better price for the producer for his cattle and to deal with the surplus cattle if there are any.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that the big principle of the Bill is to see that the producer will get a fair price for his cattle, and to deal with any surplus cattle if there are any.  He talked about 25s. a cwt. for cattle. We had a Bill yesterday, which was complementary to this Bill, fixing the price of feeding stuffs.  The Minister's definition of a fixed price for those feeding stuffs yesterday was the cost of production plus a little profit. Now, take up these feeding stuffs from the farm that produces them, or from a mixed farm; value them by that standard; then turn them either into your store or into the market, and value them at the selling price that the Minister says should be got for those feeding stuffs.  Is the Minister prepared to fix a standard price for beef based on the cost of those feeding stuffs&mdash;that cost that is standardised by himself in the Bill that got a Second Reading yesterday?  Those feeding stuffs are passed on to the stall to turn out beef.  Will he fix that beef at a price based on the cost of feeding stuffs, of which he fixes the price, plus the cost of labour and plus a margin of profit for the feeder, and will he standardise the price of beef? That is the problem for the Minister and it is the essence of the whole case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies talked yesterday and wanted to put Deputies on these benches here in the wrong.  They wanted to misrepresent the position we took up, namely, that we were opposed to fixing a standard price and a fair price for oats and barley.  Of course, nothing could be further from the truth. We accept that standard price of oats and barley, but the finished product of oats and barley will be the beef that will be turned out and we will see whether the Minister will fix a price based on those costings.  It is extraordinary how sins always find the sinner out.  The Minister, in his introductory remarks, said that cattle had fallen here since the start of the <Col N="2075" /> British special duties by the difference between those special duties and the bounties that he gave.  I think that is substantially a fair quotation of the Minister's remarks.  It is the first time since I came into this House that the Minister has admitted that the price of beer was lower in this country than in Great Britain.  On several occasions he has got up here and brazenly defended the falsehood, or I should say the fallacious position, that he had been approached by people from the Six Counties for permits to send cattle into the Free State.  The truth has come out now at last.</P>

      <P>The Minister has now disclosed his mentality on the price that was, apparently, occupying his mind, and he mentioned 25/- a cwt.  I presume that he takes it that that is the price after deduction of the British tariff off our cattle.  Does he intend to base that price on the tariff, less the bounty that he is paying now, or does he want to slip away with the bounty and make a present of it to the Exchequer and deprive the producer of fat cattle here of any advantages from the bounty?  I should like him to be clear on that point.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that that was how prices ruled up to the quota system. He taunted me with being responsible for the statement that 58 per cent. of the cattle tied up in stalls last Christmas were surplus cattle and could not be disposed of.  I am not the author of that statement, but, as far as I am concerned, the Minister is the author of it.</P>
      <P>The Minister remembers our conference of the 19th January last when our whole discussion about the allocation of export licences hinged round this figure.  The case put up by the producers was this, that only 42 per cent. of the cattle that they had in their stalls could be shipped to England.  That 42 per cent. remained after deducting the amount required for home consumption.  Exporters who had been getting licences to go into the market to buy 42 per cent. out of the 100 per cent. could give any price they liked for the cattle.  No wonder, as was admitted then and as the Minister will not contradict now, that the effect of giving those licences to the exporters was equivalent to giving them a present of between £5 and £6 a beast on the cattle bought. On an export trade of about 10,000 cattle a month that works out at £50,000 a month.  All that money is taken out of the pockets of the producers and given to the exporters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The relevancy of this is that the Minister now proposes under this Bill to take a census and inspection of the cattle anywhere and everywhere. <Col N="2077" /> This is many times a greater job than the job he told us on the 19th January last&mdash;and that he told us in this House a couple of months ago&mdash; was an impossible job for his Department to do, namely, to continue giving licences to the producers.  When we put up the case to the Minister we were told that no census could be taken.  But on the 10th February the census was taken and 50 per cent. of the licences went to the producers. By the 14th February 100 per cent of the licences went to the producers. Then when we came on to grass-fed beef, the traders and exporters all got around the Minister and they got around the Deputies here.  One met them trooping about the Lobbies out there.</P>

      <P>I do not want to go outside the rules of order and there is no need for me to go outside the rules of order.  We could talk for a month within the rules of order in this case. I was not going to detail what happened in the Lobbies or to say anything about deputations coming in here.  They are quite entitled to come in here if they want to do so.  The point I wish to make is that the Minister gave way to these influences and he handed over the licences to the traders-exporters.  The Minister knows to-day that those licences are worth £3, £4 or £5 apiece.  And he comes up here with as innocent a face as any face of the 120,000 calves he had slaughtered.  He tells us what provision he is making for the surplus cattle, if any.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is it that is putting a premium on those licences issued by the Minister?  It is that there are more cattle seeking export in this country than there are licences procurable or than the British will let in?  In this Bill the Minister has not shown how he is going to deal with those surplus <Col N="2078" /> cattle.  In a discussion on some subject closely akin to this a short time ago, the Minister admitted that taking it on the average we have a surplus of about 20,000 fat cattle a month here for export.  I do not think the Minister will contradict that statement or those figures.  Under the quota system we are allowed to export about 10,000 cattle a month.  That leaves 10,000 cattle for which we have not a market.  Even at the present rates we have not a market for these and surely we are not going to increase that market by increasing the price of meat to the consumer.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes to increase the price of meat to the consumer. Presuming that the consumer will consume as much meat at the higher rate we still have 10,000 fat cattle a month of which we have to dispose. That was the problem that agitated the country this year.  That was the problem created by the British quota. That is the very same problem that the Minister told us time and again he was considering.  But that is the one problem that he has not tackled in this Bill.  The Minister should not try to hit below the belt.  We can all hit above and below the belt when we are put to it.  It shows the weakness of his case when he tries to hit below the belt.  The Minister said in the course of his speech that political propaganda frightened the farmers into selling their cattle at 15/- a cwt., whereas on export they got 25/- a cwt for them.  Some of the farmers got more than 25/- a cwt for their cattle on export.  The Minister may thank the Deputies on these benches that producers got 28/- and 29/- a cwt for cattle since the quota was imposed.  How they may thank the Deputies for it is this: They were getting 18/- and 19/- a cwt for the best beef in the Dublin market while the Minister's friends, the exporters, had the licences.  But when the producers got the licences, the producers were able to get 28/- and 29/- a cwt in the Dublin market.</P>

      <P>I claim it was.  There was a deputation that I headed to the Minister on the 28th January last.  On that occasion the Minister said he could not get the census of fat cattle. On the following Tuesday I supplied the Minister with a census of the fat cattle in the Co. Dublin.  I put that matter up to the Minister, and that made the Minister think, and when he got thinking he said that it was better to give the licences to the producers and they got them.  Of course, I know that some schoolmasters got those licences and some fellows across the Border got them.  I know that the McMahons, the Mulhollands and the Moores got these licences&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Well, if Deputies on the Government Benches want to introduce them they will get them.  We have still the whole problem of 10,000 surplus cattle per month.  We had that last winter.  And it was not the rancher had them; it was the grazier had them. The problem for the Minister to consider is that if we have these 10,000 fat cattle next winter they will have to be fed mainly on oats and barley at a price which the Minister, by legislation, is fixing and that will be remunerative to the growers.  The principal idea is that the growing of oats and barley will be profitable.  The problem is whether the same number of fat cattle will be stall-fed next winter or only half the number.  I am afraid he will only get half the number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why do farmers sell their cattle at 15/- a cwt.?  Because they cannot get any more for them.  When a man goes to the fair with cattle, he is thinking of the price of his cattle, not what will serve Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael.  He is down to brass tacks when selling his cattle.  He will not ask the buyer's politics and he will not be influenced by what any politician says in this House or out of it.  He goes to the market, looks for the best price, and sells at the best price he can get, and the best price he could get here is 15/- per cwt.  The man who can get a licence, and exports his cattle, gets <Col N="2080" /> 25/- a cwt. or thereabouts.  The question of political propaganda does not enter into the matter but the question of Government policy does enter into it.  The man who sells his cattle at 15/- a cwt. loses £5 a beast through the quota, and £6 owing to the British special duty on each animal, making £11 a beast, for which the Government policy is responsible. The Minister said it would be an offence for the buyer to buy cattle under the minimum price.  Will the Minister take the case of a man who has got cattle to sell and cannot get a buyer?  What will he do with them? I wonder where the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands has flown to at present.  How many times, in the last couple of months, have the sheriffs refused to take cattle?  Are they ready to take cattle now?  I was informed yesterday that 566 notices went out in County Dublin for alleged arrears of land annuities, more accurately described as arrears of the new land tax.</P>

      <P>The live stock is valueless to them.  The Minister fixes the price for the butcher.  The butcher buys and sells.  The butcher will not continue to buy unless he can sell. And again we find ourselves back to the problem that the Minister turned a blind-eye on, namely, our surplus stocks.  What is the inevitable result of that?  It means less beef will be produced.  It means pulling the production of beef in this country down to just the balance between the supply and the demand and wiping out of existence any export trade.  It means reducing the area under tillage.  There is no market for tillage produce in this country outside the little wheat and beet and tobacco we produce, and all of which is subsidised.  There is no market for the tillage produced here except stall-feeding.  The Minister boasted yesterday of the increase in our cereal crops, though he regarded it as yet too small.  He said we have 90,000 acres of wheat where <Col N="2081" /> we should have 600,000.  If we grew 600,000 acres of wheat this year we would be growing 600,000 acres of root crops next year.  All these root crops will go to feed cattle.  But the Minister has killed the market for these things by refusing to provide a market for our surplus beef in order to keep up the production of beef.  Of course, it is childish to put forward the argument the Minister put forward that the producer is not paying the levy. Nobody else but the producer is paying it.  This whole Bill could not be improved upon in Russia.  I do not think that any Communist Government in the world could add a comma to this Bill.  By the time it becomes law we will hardly own the air we breathe in this country.  We will be inspected by inspectors, and there will be another troop of inspectors inspecting them and so on until we have nothing but tier after tier of officials on one another's backs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be very poor trade for calves.  Not many of them will be brought across the Border. The butcher will have to license his premises to slaughter the cattle.  These premises will have to be open to an inspector at any time he cares to inspect them.  He must furnish a return of the animals slaughtered, and then of course he has to hand out £1 per head for any cattle he kills, and 5/- for every sheep.  The Minister proposes to send round inspectors with power to go anywhere they know there are cattle, or anywhere they have reasonable suspicions there are cattle, take a census of these, mark them and give a date at which they can be slaughtered, and not before that date must they be slaughtered.  I wonder, if the Department is capable of carrying this out, why they were not capable of taking a census of the grass-fed cattle and giving the producers a licence?  If the Minister would try to be fair and give a reasonable price for cattle, I see no way by which that could be achieved, except by fixing a price here for cattle per cwt., per class, corresponding <Col N="2082" /> to the British price less the cost of transport and guaranteeing that price for all cattle, offered for sale anywhere at any time.  There is no other way I can see of meeting this problem.  What the Minister would do with the beef that he had purchased I do not know, nor can I offer any suggestion but he and his Government are responsible for bringing the trade to that pass and it is for him and his Government to get the trade out of that situation.  Then, the Minister can go into business himself.  It shall be lawful for the Minister to engage in the purchase, keeping, and slaughter of cattle and sheep, the sale of cattle and sheep, either in or outside Saorstát Eireann&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The most serious provision from the national standpoint that I see in the Bill is from Section 37 onwards.  The Bill says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It shall be lawful for the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to lend, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, any sum or sums of money&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  to any person engaged in or carrying on any business to which this section applies, for the purpose of extending or developing such business, whether by the acquisition of additional premises, the installation of new or additional machinery, plant, or equipment, or in any other way whatsoever, or</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw attention to what follows.  Public money is being lent for a certain purpose and these are the conditions surrounding its lending.  We come on to subsection (5):</P>
      <P>(5)  Whenever the Minister has lent any money under this section it shall be lawful for the Minister to do all or any of the following things, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to vary in any manner all or any of the terms and conditions on which such money was so lent.</P>
      <P>He can lend public money to people on certain specified conditions as to time, manner of repayment and rate of interest and after that contract is signed, sealed and delivered, the Minister can vary it.  The section goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(b) with the consent aforesaid, to compound for or wholly release all or any part of such moneys or of any interest or other payment payable on or in relation to such moneys;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c) to take such steps (including legal proceedings) as the Minister may think proper to compel payment of, or to recover, all or any part of such moneys or of any interest or other payment payable <Col N="2084" /> on or in relation to such moneys or to enforce compliance with any term or condition on which such moneys were so lent.</P>
    <P>If that is not undermining the credit of the nation I do not know what is. This money, I presume, will have to be borrowed in the open market and paid for by a charge on the revenue of this country.  The money can be lent to individuals on certain conditions, but a Minister is given power to write off that money, not to collect it at all, or not to charge any interest.  Even though there were conditions attached to its lending, he can write them off.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not make it clear if these beef vouchers for free meat were to be given as an addition to unemployment assistance or in lieu of portion of the allowance to recipients of employment assistance or home assistance, as the case might be.  I agree with the Minister that it will be very difficult to administer this Act.  I go further and say that, in my opinion, it will be impossible to administer it, but it is not the administration with which I am concerned. It is a matter for the administrative Department to do its best, but the one matter that has created the whole situation the Minister has not touched. That is, to find a market for our surplus fat cattle.  He has not touched on that at all from beginning to end of the Bill.  He has not even provided means whereby the producers of those cattle can turn them into money, even at the standard price of 25/- per cwt. about which he talks.  There is no compulsion on anybody to buy cattle. There is no responsibility taken by the Minister, or his Department, to buy the surplus cattle at 25/- per cwt., and to provide that meat in depots to be given out to the recipients of beef vouchers.  That is the aspect of the problem which promoted this Bill and which constituted the acute part of the tillage problem and of the whole agricultural problem which faced the country since the quota, which left a surplus of finished cattle on our hands. Why does not the Minister deal with that aspect of the problem by fixing a standard price, and cutting out all <Col N="2085" /> this nonsensical patching&mdash;making the butcher do this, that and the other thing?  If the Minister says, &ldquo;I will buy all the surplus cattle at 25/- a cwt., 21/- or 31/-,&rdquo; the butcher will have to compete with him and there will be no pimping or spying around any man's premises.  If that were done, the Minister would not want an army of inspectors.  Let the Minister dispose of that surplus meat free, or at a small price, but if he undertakes to take the surplus at 25/-, the whole thing will be fixed automatically.  He will, of course, in order to give the man who sells at home an equal price to that of the man who gets a licence to export, have to vary the standard price according to the variations in the British market and according to the value of the licence he gives to export cattle.  Then the licence will be of no value to the exporter.  The Minister thinks, innocently perhaps&mdash; I doubt if he believes it&mdash;that by making it an offence for a butcher to buy a heifer from a farmer at £1 a cwt. when the price is fixed at 25/-; while it will not be an offence for the farmer to sell, he will put the farmer spying on the butcher.  The butcher is no such fool as to be caught with birdlime of that kind.  What record will there be to substantiate the testimony of the farmer if he turns informer on the butcher?  Will the butcher not insist on the farmer giving a receipt for 25/- per cwt.?  Of course he will, and the farmer will be glad to give a receipt for 25/- a cwt. when there is no market.  The whole trouble is that there is not a market for all the stock and the Minister is not providing one.  If he wants to standardise prices, all he has got to do is to undertake to buy the surplus stock.  If he does that, there will be no loophole for anybody who wishes to break the law in that regard.  As it is, the Bill fixes nothing and unfixes everything.  It disputes the ownership of the butcher in his premises.  It disposes of the last shred of ownership the farmer had in his land because the Minister can walk in, without saying &ldquo;by your leave,&rdquo; take up the land and work it for any of the purposes set out in the Schedule and then sell the land to anybody he <Col N="2086" /> likes.  This is the last word in Bolshevism.  It is just as well it has come out now, because coming it was inevitably under the policy pursued by the Government, who were shouting for tillage but pursuing a policy almost scientifically opposed to tillage.  That policy is destroying the market that tillage produces.  It is destroying the stall-fed market.  When that market is reduced to half, tillage must be reduced to half.  That applies not only to the tillage that goes to feed live stock but to the tillage that goes to feed human beings, because the land that grows wheat this year must grow root crops next year.  If you have not stallfeds for the root crops next year, it will not pay to grow wheat either this year or next year.  The whole system of agricultural economy is being undermined.  That is disclosed in this Bill, which also discloses the utter incompetency and callousness of the Government in dealing with the basic industry of this country.  The time is not far off when the greatest dupe of a farmer who supports the Government will find that out.  Certain farmers who are not dupes are supporting them and will support them. They will do that because they are gone so far on the downward financial path that they are afraid a day of reckoning will come when everybody will get his own.  If everybody got his own, the broken-down farmers following the Party opposite would have nothing left for themselves.</P>

      <P>This Bill brings us a further stage on the road to complete Government control.  We are rapidly advancing to the position of another State, which controls the life and property of practically every individual in it.  I do not think that the Bill will achieve the purposes which the Minister intends it to achieve, but it will considerably hamper certain interests.  It will upset the industry of the butchers and it will make it practically impossible for small butchers operating in the country to carry on business.  These men will, to meet the <Col N="2087" /> requirements of the Bill, have to employ permanently somebody akin to an auditor to keep the accounts which the Minister seems to think they ought to keep.  In the case of the average butcher in a country town, the expense imposed by this Bill will make it impossible for him to carry on except he mulcts the paying consumer to an extreme degree.  One of the results of this Bill will be that the price to the consumer, other than the people who are to get free meat, will be considerably increased.  In this Bill we are taking a further step on the road to complete control by the Minister, by heads of Departments and by a corps of inspectors of every description. When we had the finance motion before us to-day I asked the Minister what portion of the levy would be employed in paying inspectors.  I should like to have that information now.  Can the Minister make any guess at the number of inspectors that will be needed to inspect slaughterhouses, inspect the accounts of victuallers, play hide and seek amongst the small farmers and find out the number of cattle and sheep fit for slaughter?</P>
      <P>I would like to see the Minister on a hot July day&mdash;in weather such as we have had during the last three months&mdash;trying to find out what an inspector was doing on an ordinary farm.  Deputy Corry smiles and it is no wonder.  With the fly active amongst cattle during very warm weather it would be interesting to see the inspector trying to discover what particular animals would be fit for consumption at the end of a particular period.  I am afraid that under such conditions he would not be able to do very much.  I imagine that he would have to come to the farm at the midnight hour with a lantern in his hand to do his particular job, and it seems to me that he would require the assistance of quite an army of the temporarily unemployed in his effort to round up the stock in order to mark them.  That is one of the difficulties that are likely to arise in connection with this particular Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that under one section of the Bill&mdash;this is a point <Col N="2088" /> that was enlarged upon by Deputy Belton&mdash;it was provided that public money might be lent to persons to set up premises to engage in different classes of business and even to the Minister himself to engage in various operations.  But in a Bill which is primarily intended to benefit farmers there is no provision whatever empowering the Minister to lend money so that the producers may be enabled to produce.  No power is taken to lend money to a man to stock his land, and there are many men to-day who have no stock on their lands.  Any they had the sheriff has got them, so that we have this position to-day that there are many farms in the country absolutely denuded of stock.  The Minister is not taking power to enable him to lend money out of the public purse to farmers to enable them to produce either beef or mutton or any other quality of eatable flesh.  The officials of the Minister are to mark the cattle. First of all the cattle are to be graded. Then a time limit is to be put on. The farmer, in fact, will not know what particular cattle he can sell or when he can sell them.  He cannot sell certain cattle before a specified date, but when that time comes he will not be sure if he can sell them. What is the average farmer to do while he is waiting for that time limit to expire?  If he is fortunate enough to have his cattle marked fit for sale at a price that the Minister will fix as reasonable and if the sale period is to be November what is that farmer to do if, for instance, he wants money about the 1st August to meet some demand made on him by the sheriff? Is the Minister going to make an advance to him from the amount to be paid for the cattle that are to be slaughtered in November?  The Bill does not make any provision that a farmer can get any portion of the price of the cattle in anticipation of realising it at a subsequent date.</P>
    <P>The one great point that the Minister made in connection with the Bill was that the farmer would get the export price of his cattle, and by the export price he meant the price that the farmer gets when the British tariff <Col N="2089" /> is taken off and when every other ancillary charge is taken off.  Two years ago, when we had a free market in this country, the prices for cattle were very much higher than they are now.  The Minister will admit that the prices for beef and mutton were very much higher then than now, and yet while that was the position the producer could barely eke out an existence.  He could not put anything by.  He could barely live on the prices that prevailed in those days.  The prices to-day are very much worse, so that the position the farmer finds himself in is that he cannot live at all and no manipulation of prices, whether they are fixed or unfixed, is going to be of any use to him.  That is not going to help production of any kind in this country so far as the farmer is concerned.  There is only one real solution of the difficulty.  It has been stated many times in this House, and it is to give the farmer a free market.  He asks for nothing more.  He asks for no subsidy or for any of the other leads in the dark that have been in operation during the last two years.  These attempts to sustain the farmer have failed.  The plan in operation during the past two years has failed.  We have had two years of guess-work and of various attempts trying to keep the farmer on his feet or, rather, trying to keep him on one leg, but all have failed.  Let any member of the House&mdash;the majority here represent agricultural constituencies&mdash;take any five farmers in an average county, and is it not true that four of them are bankrupt?  The fifth is surviving because he was in the position of being able to have some money laid by.  The Minister thinks that the other four are going to be put on their feet by the operation of this Bill.  I am afraid very few who know what the actual conditions in the country are, share his view.</P>
    <P>There is one saving section in the Bill and that is the provision of free meat for certain unfortunate people. Nobody grudges them that, least of all the Deputies who sit on this side of the House.  It is unfortunate that there should be a number of people in <Col N="2090" /> this country for whom it is necessary to make such provision.  The proposal to use an over supply of beef and mutton in that way is certainly to be commended, but I think some better means could have been found for doing it than the means outlined in this Bill. Deputy Belton dealt with a number of dangerous sections in this Bill.  There was one that he did not refer to. Deputies will remember that we discussed here a couple of years ago a Land Bill.  We made a great fight on this side to protect farmers' interests. Ultimately, it was decided in connection with the acquisition of land that a holding of the market value of less than £2,000 was to be immune.  But I find a rather curious provision in this Bill.  It seems to me to annul completely the protection that was given to a farmer under that Land Act. Under this Bill the Minister is taking power to take over any land.  Section 33 provides:</P>
    <P>For the purposes of doing anything which he is authorised by this Part of this Act to do, the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, acquire, compulsorily or by agreement, any land together with every right of way, water right or other easement used and enjoyed in connection therewith.</P>
    <P>The Minister will, perhaps, reply that he does not intend to operate that section very largely.  He possibly will not, but the power is there to violate a particular section of the Land Act which every Deputy who had the interests of the farmers at heart fought for.  The power is in this Bill to enable the Minister to acquire any farm in the country and to sell it afterwards: to acquire my farm or Deputy Corry's farm or Deputy Curran's farm, and, having acquired them, he may sell them if he does not want them.  There are certain provisions in the Bill restricting the Minister in the case of an Act passed in 1845 and other Acts, but there is no restriction as far as the Land Act of 1933 is concerned.</P>
    <P>I gather from my reading of the Bill that under it he can acquire any land that he wishes and having acquired it, if he has no use for it, he can sell it to <Col N="2091" /> the highest bidder.  Even purchased lands are not exempt from that provision. With the consent of the Land Commission the Minister can acquire purchased lands, lands on which an annuity is payable.  He only needs to get his brother Minister who is in charge of Lands and Fisheries to agree with him that he ought to acquire those lands and <i>hey presto</i> it is done; he can get all the land he wants.  If this Bill does get through this House, I hope that that particular Section 33 will be deleted.  It ought never to have been brought into the Bill.  As I read it, it violates the most useful section of another Act passed in this House, and to me it appears the most dangerous section in this particular Bill.  I may have interpreted it wrongly, but that is my reading of the section, and I think it would be the reading of nine out of ten ordinary farmers.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that cattle were to be sold by weight in certain districts where machinery for weighing them is available.  In remote areas&mdash;and, mind you, the number of those areas will be much larger than the Minister envisages&mdash;where there are no convenient methods of weighing cattle, they are to be sold on the guess principle.  The inspector is to guess the weight.  The number of men in this State who are capable of accurately guessing the weight of live stock is very small.  I myself have seen some of the most eminent cattle buyers very much out in the weight of a live beast.  The same may apply to some of the inspectors whom the Minister employs under this Act. One does not know who they will be, or from what section of the community they will be drawn.  I myself should not like to back with any particular enthusiasm their estimate of what a beast might approximate in weight.  We are to have no guarantee as to what section of the community those inspectors will be drawn from. I do not believe that the Minister will draw them altogether politically; I absolve the Minister from that.  I believe he will endeavour to get the best men he can, but in spite of all <Col N="2092" /> his best endeavours there will be a lot of incompetent men employed; there are bound to be.  We had the Improvement of Live Stock Bill.  The greatest care was taken by the previous Minister for Agriculture and by the present Minister to select what they thought were the most competent men to inspect bulls, but there was most complete dissatisfaction.  Government Deputies will agree with me that the most unfair decisions were made.  I believe that the decisions were made with all good intent, but the inspectors had different views from the average farmer.  Their idea of what a beast should be was, in many cases, almost diametrically opposite to what the farmer would have desired.  It will be just the same in this case, because I believe that the Minister will find it almost impossible to get sufficient competent inspectors to put this Bill properly into operation.  I believe it will be impossible to find men who know their jobs, men who will be in other ways trustworthy, and in every way suitable to carry out the job of inspector. I believe that even after the lapse of five years the Minister will not have a body of inspectors that he or the people of the country will be satisfied with.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister said when he was introducing the Bill &mdash; I hope it is not so &mdash; that the purchasing of the cattle was going to be restricted to the victuallers.  If I am not quoting the Minister correctly he will contradict me.  I think he said that he intended that the victuallers would be the buyers of cattle.  If that is so, it is going to place us in an altogether impossible position, because if we had to wait for the local butcher to buy our cattle we would have to wait till Tibb's Eve.  I did not read that into the Bill myself.  I thought it did not limit the buying of cattle to the local or any other butcher, but I gathered that the Minister, when introducing the Bill, said that the purchase of cattle was to be restricted to the victuallers and butchers.  Is that so?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I just wanted to have that point cleared up, because if the Minister was going to confine the buying of cattle to the butcher the sale of cattle would be practically at an end because a man might never find a buyer.  I am glad that the Minister has now made it clear that there is not going to be that restriction.  A man will have a chance of selling his cattle to anybody he likes, but his chance of selling marked cattle will not be as good as his chance of selling unmarked cattle would be.  It will have some effect on the trade. Nobody&mdash;and the farmer least of all&mdash; likes any restriction put on his operations. The farmer likes to sell when he wants to sell, and to buy when he wants to buy.  If he is successfully to carry on in ordinary times, or any other time, he has to get those rights. The people in the live stock trade are in the position that they have got to use their heads.  It is not like growing a crop, where you just put it in, wait until it comes up, and then sell it.  In this case the farmer has to be a sort of stockbroker.  He has to watch the rise and fall of the market; he has to get in at a certain time, and get out at a certain time.  This Bill is going to upset his ordinary trade. He will not know when to sell or when to get out.  Possibly he may have to get in or get out at a time when he does not want to get in or get out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another difficulty arises.  The cattle are to be marked.  There will be much less consumption of beasts during the summer months than in the subsequent months.  The greater demand for beef will be in the winter months.  Possibly an inspector will walk into the ordinary farmer's place when this Bill is in operation, if it goes through quickly, and mark his cattle for sale next December or January.  How is the ordinary grass farmer going to keep his cattle in condition for that period? It would be impossible for a man who produces grass beef intended for sale from June until September to keep the cattle until December or January.  It <Col N="2094" /> would be an absolute impossibility unless he was to go in for stall feeding. Unless he did that he could not keep his cattle in condition until October.  They would deteriorate very much, and possibly when some unfortunate butcher had to buy them later on in January &mdash; and he would be quite entitled to buy them, according to the Bill, once they were marked &mdash; he would be buying beasts that were altogether unfit for consumption as beef.</P>
    <P>There would be another effect of this Bill.  Even if there were going to be any gain for the farmer under this Bill &mdash;and I doubt very much if he is going to gain anything by it &mdash; there will be a loss in another way.  Even if he did benefit, as the Minister expects, I should like the Minister to consider for a moment what will be the reactions on the bacon trade.  The Minister has done his best for the pig industry.  He is going to create a taste amongst humble people for beef, which they had not previously.  If there is one section of the people who consume and love bacon above all other kinds of food it is the poor people.  They would rather have bacon and cabbage any day than beef or mutton.  Very few Deputies will disagree with that statement.  If there is to be a great distribution of free beef all over the country, and afterwards cheap beef, there is bound to be less demand for bacon.  There is then going to be very serious reactions on the bacon trade, if the Bill is to be the success that the Minister expects it to be.  In that way, what is gained in one way, if there is to be any gain, will be lost to another part of the farmers' production, that is, in pigs.</P>
    <P>A good deal has been said about the levy.  I have no great objection to a levy if it is going to benefit farmers to any extent, provided it does not, as happened under other Acts, make a prohibitive addition to the cost to the consumer.  I am very much afraid that the levy in this case may make beef a good deal dearer to the ordinary consumer than it should be.  If any small butcher is able to survive after conforming with the various regulations, such as keeping accounts and providing premises, he will not only charge the <Col N="2095" /> levy to the ordinary consumer but the expenditure that he has been put to in putting his premises in order and in employing hands to keep accounts and other things.  All will go on to the consumer and the ultimate amount he will have to pay for beef or mutton will be out of all proportion to what the price should be.  These are some of the effects I think this Bill will produce.</P>
    <P>I regret that any attempt to help the farmer should be brought in in such a manner.  I believe that some other method could have been arrived at, possibly the suggestion made by Deputy Belton of having regular fixed prices for different classes of cattle: for first or second-class cattle and stores.  If the Minister made an order fixing the prices to be paid, without having any inspectors, there would not be any need for all these regulations. I admit that there would be difficulties, that possibly various people would claim that their cattle were up to a certain standard when they were not.  But there would not be any of the difficulties that are evident in the Bill and we would not have to have a host of inspectors.  No one can make a shot at what the number of inspectors will eventually be.  The chief objection I have to the Bill is that it is another step on the road that the Government have taken to control every interest, private and public, in this State, and that we will shortly arrive at the position, agriculturally and commercially, when no man will be able to carry on his business as he desires.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I approach this matter with a perfectly open mind but, having listened to the speech of the Minister introducing the Bill, I have come to the conclusion that this is a very important and far-reaching measure, designed to interfere unduly with the legitimate trade, and is one of a number of measures that have frequently been brought before the House during the present session, most of these having been directed towards erecting a big smoke screen round and about the activities of the Fianna Fáil Government owing to the <Col N="2096" /> hopeless mess into which they have led our unfortunate country.  Part II deals with registration of premises, with the keeping of returns, and imposes on the purveyors of meat conditions which may appear to be rather light, but which cause an amount of annoyance and worry to an already worried and annoyed section of the community.  I feel that this is one of the unnecessary interferences with trade to which Deputy Bennett referred.  I do not propose to stress that aspect any further.  Part III proposes a levy in respect of cattle and sheep slaughtered in registered premises, and makes it incumbent on the Minister to levy at the prescribed rate on cattle and sheep slaughtered during certain months in such premises.  I am anxious to know how this figure is to be arrived at.  The Minister was very clear in his definitions and explanations of the various sections but I am anxious to know how he arrived at the figure which will be prescribed by the regulations made by him.  I should like the Minister to clear up that point for the satisfaction of Deputies and for people engaged in this industry outside. In Part IV the Government appear to be taking very drastic and revolutionary steps with an existing trade. I may also mention that it is also proposed to take from farmers the right to sell a beast any time they like and at any price they can get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inspectors are to be appointed by the Minister who may or may not be qualified to act as judges in this respect.  I want to stress that, because my experience when talking to farmers is this, that many of the inspectors who have hitherto gone around&mdash;I do not wish to reflect on any servants of this Department, because as a rule they are highly efficient&mdash;to inspect dairies and cowsheds, who were appointed under the ægis of the Department have been incompetent.  They have been telling farmers what to do, just like telling one's grandmother how to suck eggs. I am quoting the words of many of the Minister's own Party in that connection. These inspectors will have, according to the Bill and according to the Minister's explanation of the <Col N="2097" /> sections of the Bill, the sole right of saying when and how these farmers' stock may be disposed of.  I think the Minister must admit that this is one of the most revolutionary measures that has ever been brought under the notice of this House.  This again I consider to be under interference with trade and I would make the suggestion to the Minister in all sincerity that he should go the whole hog and let the Minister for Industry and Commerce, for instance, take action to bring every other industry in the State under State control.  Then we will know where we are and we will know exactly whether we are to be Russianised, if I can use such a term, this year, next year or the year after.  The sooner this comes along, the better, because it will give many persons who are contemplating putting their small capital&mdash;I am referring to the small people and not to the people with big capital&mdash;an opportunity of knowing exactly where they stand and of realising how any little capital they will put into industry may, at one stroke of the pen, be filched from them and any little business they may have built up entirely taken from them or put under the ægis of some Government Department or another.</P>
    <P>Under Part 7 of the Bill, certain restrictions will be placed on the manufacture of cattle and sheep products for human consumption.  I think Deputy Mulcahy earlier in the afternoon mentioned that amongst these cattle and sheep products were such things as tripe and other such commodities, and last but not least, that well-known Cork dish, the succulent drisheen.  I can quite see a whole lot of objections being raised to this section by a number of industrious people whose families have been in this business for many generations, and I would like the Minister to allay the fears of those people when he is concluding this debate, because already there is some anxiety present in the minds of those people that their business is to be interfered with.  I can quite understand any measures that have been taken which will ensure to the general public a pure and wholesome meat supply and will ensure that all these cattle and sheep products are <Col N="2098" /> made under hygienic, good and wholesome conditions, but I want to submit very respectfully that if we have too much inspection&mdash;I can only term it over-inspection&mdash;in this branch of the industry or the other, it is not going to lead to the things the Minister suggested it would lead to.  The Minister told us that eventually the profit would come to the producer, and he gave the tax on the consuming public as a halfpenny per lb., but he also made the admission, which has been made in this House on more than one occasion recently, and which I, in common with many other people welcome, that eventually it is the consumer pays for all this.  The taxpayer and the consumer are synonymous terms and it is the consumer, whether he be rich or poor, who will have to pay this extra halfpenny.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested that it might be called a tax or a levy and if the Minister for Finance put another halfpenny on tea it would be called a tax or a levy and he was quite agreeable to accept the explanation that it was a tax.  It is well that the general public should know that they are about to be taxed to the extent of a halfpenny per lb. on beef, which, the Minister says, has been sold in this country far too cheaply for some considerable time past.  I do not want to bring the eternal question of the economic dispute into every discussion that takes place in this House, but the Minister must be aware that this Bill, and other Bills of a similar character, are brought in here simply because we have not got the commonsense to sit at a round table and discuss this economic position with our neighbours across the water.  We cannot go behind that.  I must say that I am looking with a good deal of horror and certainly with a good deal of anxiety to the future of this country and particularly to the future of the taxpaying community.  I feel that we will reach a stage one of these days in this country when about 40 per cent. of the people will be maintaining 60 per cent. of the population.</P>
    <P>Another portion of this Bill provides that the Minister himself may carry on <Col N="2099" /> a business or businesses.  Here again, we have the State taking certain powers, which they have already taken to a certain extent under the Shannon electricity undertaking, and I feel that it is unduly interfering with the ordinary and everyday lives of the people, and I would suggest that the Minister might realise that it is about time the shoemaker stuck to his last and not to get into business which neither he nor those associated with him know anything about.  The Minister may know something about agriculture and a good deal about medicine and other matters, but this is a highly technical business.  The slaughtering of animals and the rearing of animals for sale is a technical business.  It is a farmer's job and a butcher's job respectively and I suggest that the Minister, in unduly interfering&mdash;and again, I use the word unduly&mdash;with a trade or calling so long established is making a very big mistake.</P>
    <P>I look upon the distribution of beef to certain classes as a necessary evil. Mark you, it is not free meat of the best quality, as the Minister himself admits, but free meat of a certain character as defined in the Bill.  The Minister himself admits that it is not the best parts of the beef that are going to be given away for nothing and here again, I feel, and I am sure that every self-respecting member of the Government Party feels, that turning the whole of the Free State into a glorified soup kitchen is not a thing the Irish people should be proud of. I would much prefer to see the Minister and his colleagues engaged in a vigorous campaign to reduce administrative expenses, Government expenses, and the money so saved could be applied either to opening new avenues of employment or increasing unemployment assistance or unemployment insurance.  These are the ways in which I should like to see money expended and not in the way of the old soup kitchen, giving free beef&mdash;and that not always the best part of the beef&mdash;to the necessitous poor of the country.  It is <Col N="2100" /> most humiliating, in my view, to find that that portion of the Bill is going to receive any support, especially from the benches opposite, which are supposed to represent the working class people of this country, and it is humiliating to me to find that the working class people of this country are going to be put into the position in which some of our people were during the famine in '47 when they took soup.  We had then religious proselytism whereas now we have political proselytism.</P>
    <P>Another thing I am concerned about, and I feel the public in general are concerned about, is the number of inspectors and extra officials who will be required to administer this Bill when it become law.  I remember, some 12 months ago, asking this House what was the result of some of the new tariffs that had been imposed on various commodities.  I was not answered by the Minister then but some other member sought the information in a question on the Order Paper. As far as my recollection goes, the answer to the question was that the sum paid out by way of salary to the extra officials appointed amounted to something like £63,000 per annum. That represents a permanent charge on the Exchequer of £63,000.  What sum of money will be required for the extra inspectors and officials necessary to administer this Bill when it becomes law?  We heard a lot from Fianna Fáil platforms some years ago during the late Administration as to the hordes of officials employed.  We heard their spokesmen declaring that this country was run by hordes of officials who were costing enormous sums of money.  They pretended to show that when they were entrusted with the administration they would see to it that these hordes of officials were reduced very considerably and that the administrative costs would be reduced considerably.  There were so many millions to be saved here and so many thousands there and so on that the cost of administration could be reduced by at least £1,000,000.  What do we find?  The cost of administration is going up and up.  When this Bill becomes law I venture to prophesy that they must of necessity <Col N="2101" /> employ extra inspectors and further clerical assistance.  That will again be a permanent charge on the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister and those associated with him to cry halt even now to the introduction of measures not calculated to benefit the ordinary man in the street or the ordinary working-class people, because the Minister himself admits that after a time this free beef will cease to be given out and that a small charge may be made for it.  I would prefer to see the Minister even now, at this late moment, saying that there will be no free beef and that a nominal charge will be made for it.  I feel that any person who stands up here in the name of the Labour Party or the working classes and welcomes a measure of this character is for all time branding the necessitous poor as a lot of people who are worse than the perverts in 1847.  As I have just said, there were at that time religious proselytisers; now we have the political proselytisers.  I appeal to the Minister to take those parts relating to free meat and the applying of those vexatious and unnecessary restrictions on trade out of the Bill and then let us see whether we can reach some measure of agreement upon it.</P>

      <P>I waited for some time to hear what criticism of this measure was going to be offered by the Opposition. I cannot say too much for their powers of imagination, but undoubtedly they have been stretching their imagination all the evening to try and find something wrong with this measure.  Yesterday we had Deputy Belton complaining because the farmers are now going to get a price for their oats and barley and the merchants are no longer going to be allowed to rob them.  Deputy Belton's only complaint in reference to that measure yesterday was that there was going to be no fixed price for cattle. To-day when a Bill comes up to fix the price of cattle he has been stretching his imagination for a full hour, until the contortions on his face became painful to look at, to try and find some way out.  Then we had Deputy Bennett, and now we have had Deputy Anthony, all playing on different <Col N="2102" /> strings of the one fiddle.  What is the complaint?  That this Government are endeavouring to find a definite market for the cattle, a definite means of disposing of, you might say, the surplus cattle and seeing that the farmer gets some price for them.  What was the complaint during the last two years? That the farmers' cattle were being bought for nothing and that the butchers were robbing the poor.  For the last two years they were wailing and moaning about beef being bought for 15/- a cwt. and butchers selling it at 60/-.  Now the farmer is going to get a fixed price for his beef.</P>

I have made a fair study of this for the past few weeks and I believe that it will not alone afford a fair market for the cattle, but will practically get rid of all the surplus cattle.  I do not believe there will be any surplus cattle left. We are coming to the time when, like persons dealing in every other class of commodity, the farmer will know definitely what he is going to get for his beef.  The price will be fixed for him.  We have had various complaints with reference to this measure.  Last, if not least, we had Deputy Anthony complaining that the poor are going to get free beef.  He is shocked at the idea.  Deputy Bennett's complaint was that if we gave beef to the poor they would not eat any more pigs' heads.  Which of the two are we going to satisfy?  Deputy Anthony's complaint was that the poor are going to get free meat&mdash;a scandal and a shame! Another point he made was that they were going to get second-class meat&mdash; that it is not going to be the best.  In what part of the Bill did he find that?</P>

      <P>That was one of the fights of imagination into which Deputy Anthony went.  I admit he is up very high in the world and probably he can see what other people cannot see, but I cannot see where the Minister has brought in any second-quality beef or any beef, as Deputy Anthony put it, that was not going to be first-class.  Deputy Anthony's main complaint is that we are going to get any beef at all; he cannot understand it.  Deputy Anthony was a member of the South Cork Board of Assistance, like my colleague, Deputy Broderick, and he saw the amount of money we have to give out in the way of assistance.  Amongst others we have to support a man and his wife and five children.  He should be very grateful to see this assistance being added.  He should be glad to see the unfortunate man who gets 8/- or 10/- a week now getting five or seven pounds of beef in addition.  I am very glad that our surplus beef will go to feed the poor.  I do not think we owe an apology to anybody for seeing that the poor are considered.  The main object of this Bill is to get rid of the surplus stock which happens to be in the country.  In regard to that surplus we have varied expressions from the Opposition.  Deputy Belton told us that only for the attitude of the Government there would be no surplus. Deputy Belton would get a fabulous <Col N="2105" /> price from New Zealand or Australia. As Minister for Agriculture there he would be able to induce the British Government to take all their mutton and their agricultural produce, without any quota.  Mind you, there is a quota in New Zealand and Australia. They cannot sell to England all they want to sell.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;New Zealand in the Ottawa year sent 377,000 cwt. of frozen beef.  The estimates of the Dominion were that there would be an increase thereafter of 10 per cent.  The shipments in 1933 on the basis of the Ottawa year, plus 10 per cent., would have been 414,000 cwt.  The actual shipments in 1933 were 700,000 cwt.

I believe that was the agreement in Ottawa&mdash;that they were limited to 10 per cent. and in consequence of that limitation they were cut down to 414,000 cwt., in the year 1932.  They sent 700,000 cwt., and in the first six months of this year they sent 500,000 cwt. and in the second six months they will send another 500,000 cwt.</P>

While that particular market for frozen beef at that particular price might suit the impoverished pockets of John Bull at the present day, it does not mean that the Irish farmer would be prepared to produce his beef and to sell it at the frozen beef prices in England.</P>

I do not believe it would be possible for him to do it, any more than it was possible for the Irish farmer in former years to grow wheat in this country at the price at which Deputy Cosgrave's Government told him he would have to grow it&mdash;£6 a ton.  There is such a thing as cost of production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Cost of production enters into all those things, and I do not think that the Irish farmer, badly off and all as he is supposed to be, would be prepared to sell his beef at the price of frozen beef in England. I was dealing, however, with statements made by Deputy Belton here on that matter.  In this measure we are providing once and for all and getting a little further along the road to the position where the farmer will have an idea and will know what he is going to get for his produce before he produces it, and that, I think, is the main point.  Guaranteed prices, after all, should be the basis, and if Deputy Cosgrave and his Government had acted along that line in the past ten years this Government would never get the opportunity of inflicting all the ills and <Col N="2108" /> woes they are supposed to have inflicted on the farmers in the past two years.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave and his Government told the farmers:&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, you can sell in the open market; you can grow wheat here and sell it in competition with the ranchers in Canada and Australia, and you can do the same with the rest of your produce; you can produce your pig here but it will have to go in competition with the Chinese pig, and the same applies to all the other items of agricultural produce.&rdquo;  We are coming down to the basis where we consider that the farmer has to get for his produce the cost of production, plus something extra and that, at any rate, in the market we can control, the market here at home, the farmer will get that price.  He is just as much entitled to it as the manufacturer of boots or the manufacturer of clothes, or any one of the other industries that have been started here.  He is just as much entitled to the cost of production plus something over as any of those.  It is a matter of finding out what the cost of production is, and working it out on that basis.</P>
      <P>I admit, and Deputies over there have admitted, that the prices of beef and mutton have fallen considerably even in England during the past two or three years.  I will admit this much, that I have not taken any very great interest in it for the past few years, because, four years ago, I considered that at the price of beef in the English market it would not pay me to produce it, and I got out of it.</P>

      <P>I regret having allowed myself to be drawn by Deputy Holohan and I do not wish to take up the time of the House.  I have dealt with the few arguments put up and they were very few.  This is a Bill to fix the price of cattle. Yesterday we fixed the price of grain. In my opinion we are travelling along what I consider the right road, the road where the farmer will know when he starts to produce what he will get for the article produced, and that he will not be at the mercy of any of these gentlemen.  After all, what has been the argument used here and in every hole and corner during the past two or three years?  Take a beast to the fair.  You sell that beast at 1½d. a lb. and you will pay 9½d. for the steak cut from that carcase.  That has been the general argument commonly used in recent years.  That argument will not be capable of being used in future.</P>
      <P>The butchers of the country owe a debt to the Government because by this Bill they are taking away from them the charge of profiteering.  I am sure the butchers will be duly grateful for that.

He was the one man Deputy Corry did not want; but he comes along this evening and tries to bolster up a case for this Bill under an apparent concern for the rancher.

    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>But what does this Bill seek to do?  Is it not interfering in every possible way with the individual farmer?  Take Part IV of the Bill: Inspectors can go to a man's land, inspect his cattle, mark them, and it will be an offence to have these cattle sold before a particular date. Is it the intention to take a census of the whole cattle population of the country at the present moment?  I would like to have an answer from the Minister to that question.  The Minister admitted that the Bill was a hard Bill to work.  That is the one point on which I do agree with the Minister &mdash;the difficulty of working the Bill. There is one thing in which the Minister and the draftsman have scored&mdash;that they were able to produce such a document to the House.</P>
      <P>The interference with the farmer's rights which is being made possible by this measure is, as Deputy Anthony said, a great objection to the Bill. The Minister pretends to propound by this Bill that he is going to help the cattle industry in this country.  I wonder if he will?  He seems to think that by raising prices the problem will be met.  I understood the Minister to say that more beef was consumed in the country than was consumed some years ago.  So there is.  But if you want to raise the price to what is an economic level, is it not quite likely that the consumption of the commodity will go back again to the same figure as before?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This idea of inspectors trying to operate this Bill must be considered by the House.  The cost of trying to <Col N="2112" /> operate the Bill must be very considerable. I am satisfied that it is not fair to send an inspector into a farmer's place to tell that farmer that he is to sell his cattle at such and such a time, that the cattle will be fit for sale on such a date and so on. I do not think any Government should take to itself the power of dictating to the farmer in that way, or adopting that attitude.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asks why. Because it is an interference with the legitimate right of the farmer to sell his cattle when he wants to sell them. In actual working practice it will be found that the inspector might come to my place and say: &ldquo;these cattle will be fit for sale in a month or two.&rdquo;  If I have got to keep to these dates will there be any competition at all in connection with the cattle industry under the Bill?  It is such clauses in the Bill which I would ask the Deputies to analyse and ask themselves how they will work out so far as concerns the people whom they represent.  In Part V of the Bill there are provisions to fix the basis of weight.  It is upon this the price of the cattle is to be settled. How many Deputies in this House are capable of turning round and saying that a beast would be worth a certain sum calculating it on such a basis? There are not many such people.  Yet the Minister proposes that the Bill will be worked in that way.  There is the implication that inspectors will be appointed.  Nobody knows who these inspectors are or what their qualifications will be or anything else about them.  Deputy Bennett says he hopes there will be men qualified to fill the position.  I do not know.</P>

      <P>He cannot keep order. I am concerned with the working of this Bill entirely.  The Minister says it is time to increase cattle prices and time to absorb the surplus stock in this country.  That is what he proposes to do under the Bill.  How the Bill can be operated to bring about that result is a puzzle to me.  I think it is a puzzle to every Deputy who has studied the Bill.  I will have the greatest possible admiration for the Minister for Agriculture if he makes any sort of a job at all of it.  I know the difficulty inherent in such a job. This Bill, as Deputy Anthony said, is something revolutionary.  Take that section in it fixing the minimum time or the maximum time after being fed when cattle may be weighed for the purpose of calculating their weight and so on.  All this is very difficult to work, and I cannot see how the Bill can at all be operated in the way in which the Minister wants it.  A great deal was said this evening about free beef.  I do not make any objection to free beef.  What I do want is to see that the farmer gets the cost of production. I am at one with Deputy Corry in that.  It is only reasonable to expect that the farmer, as well as any other producer in the State, would be given the cost of production.</P>

      <P>Yes; it is in another Bill.  Somebody mentioned here <Col N="2114" /> about £1 5s. a cwt. live-weight.  I would like to know on what basis that figure was arrived at.  This is the first time that I heard the Minister admit here that the farmers in this country were never getting the production price of beef calculated by the tariff and everything else.  The Minister admits this evening that the farmer has at least lost £4 5s. on his animal. We had this matter here before and we had a discussion and some interruptions on it.  I tell the Minister that it is well known that a fat stock licence is worth £3.  The Minister said here one day that public spirited gentlemen, going around the country buying stock from farmers, were entitled to a licence.  I approached the sheriff's representative some time ago and asked him was he giving a licence with the cattle he sold, and he said he was not.  That is a direct contradiction of what the Minister said. I want to know who will fix the price. Under this Bill a price has to be fixed. Who is to fix it?  There is also provision for the Minister to set up business. I wonder does he intend to set up a butcher in every town.  If so, I suppose he is to be a Fianna Fáil supporter and the cattle would only be bought from Fianna Fáil farmers.</P>

      <P>I do not know it, but I am very glad to hear Deputy Donnelly say it is nonsense.  We have heard much from the Fianna Fáil Party that the Minister wants to go into the trade. If he does buy cattle, the price that he pays will fix the price generally and he can dish that price out to everybody he likes.  Under this Bill we are to have numerous inspectors &mdash; inspectors of cattle, inspectors of beef, inspectors of slaughterhouses and of various other places.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that. The Minister mentioned a deputation that waited on him from my own constituency. They told me he treated them very courteously, and he told <Col N="2115" /> them that the greatest problem was the disposal of cows; that is a matter on which there is a great difference of opinion.  The Minister says cows are useless but that depends on the age of the cow.  If she is four or five years old she may not be suitable for a dairy cow but would she be the class suitable for the factory?  Would he buy her for 10/-?  It is a question of degree in connection with all these cattle.  You might have cattle of the same weight yet some of them would be worth more than others.  If the Minister knows anything about cattle he knows that is so.  How is that to be settled?  Is there to be competition on the part of the exporters or the local traders? The Minister takes power to prohibit the export of cattle.  In fact he takes power to do almost everything; how he is going to do all these things has been puzzling me.  There are some sections of this Bill that I thoroughly object to. If the Bill was intended to increase the price of cattle, and benefit the farming community it would be all right, but instead of that there is to be constant interference with the rights of individual farmers.  For that reason I object to a good many of the sections in this Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corry, in his speech, remarked that some members on this side of the House had not read the Bill.  It was perfectly obvious from the Deputy's own speech that he had not read the Bill.  The whole case he made was based, not upon the Bill before the House, but upon some other Bill that is not before the House.  He talked about this Bill being introduced primarily for the purpose of guaranteeing to the farmer a price for his cattle and sheep which would meet the cost of production with something over for a profit.  Of course there is no such thing in the Bill.  He talked about a provision in the Bill which is to secure that the meat which was to be issued to those who were compelled to seek home assistance, or unemployment assistance, was to be of prime quality, was to be of the best quality.  There is nothing at all about that in the Bill. The Deputy knows that, for he is not <Col N="2116" /> as foolish as one would conclude he was listening to his remarks for the first time.  He gets away with it now and again.  He is now trying to convince the farmers that this Bill will ensure for them a price for their live stock that will not only cover the cost of production but will leave them a profit.  There is nothing whatever about that in the Bill.  The one thing the Bill does lay down is to secure a minimum price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that Deputy Davin does not understand much about the matter either.  Deputy Corry said it was about time that there was a fixed price for the farmer. We could easily get a fixed price for what the farmer produces or what anybody produces, but at what figure? You could get a guaranteed price for butter at 9d. a lb. or 6d. a lb., or you could get a fixed price for beef at a penny a lb.  But that does not mean that the farmers can produce the butter or the beef at that figure. The fact of the matter is this, and Deputy Davin knows it is the case, that the effective minimum price will also become the maximum price. Deputy Davin knows something about the cattle trade and he has stood in a fair now and again.  I do not know that he has been at one lately; in fact, I have doubts about it.  If he attaches to any animal, whether to his head or to his tail, X pounds as the price fixed by the Department of Agriculture, that is the price that will be paid for the animal and no more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no competition. I happened to be at the fair in Nenagh yesterday for three or four hours.  There is another Deputy in this House who was also at that fair and he belongs to a different Party from the one to which I belong and he can tell the House that most of the buyers would not even bid for the cattle they had for sale.  There is another objection and Deputy Davin knows it. <Col N="2117" /> I said, and I am quite satisfied, that the minimum price will become the maximum price.  Deputy Davin knows how this operates in connection with employment.  He has a good deal of experience in these matters and he knows that where men are employed with a minimum wage fixed that minimum also becomes the maximum.  The same will apply here.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry, of course, goes on with his usual nonsense and wants to bring into the debate all about the price of oats, barley, grain and everything else.  He told us last night that the farmers had to get away their oats for anything they could get for it.  I remember him a few months ago boasting about the price he got for his oats.  Deputy Donnelly says that all this talk about inspectors going in on a farm is nonsense.  It is all nonsense as far as Deputy Corry is concerned because if an inspector were to go in on Deputy Corry's farm and to mark a beast for sale at a certain price it would be as much as his job would be worth.  Deputy Corry would plague the life out of the Minister and the officials of his Department until that man was got rid of altogether.  I do not presume to know as much about the practical side of farming as many members of this House, but I have some rough idea of it.  Let me put this case to members of the House. Let us say that an inspector goes in on a farm&mdash;let it be a fairly small farm or the ordinary sized farm, and that there are a number of beasts on that farm and that he stamps these beasts as being fit for sale on a certain date at a certain minimum price. Let us assume that he does that honestly, conscientiously and efficiently, that he is a man who knows his job thoroughly.  It may so happen, and it does so happen in the ordinary farmer's economy, that even if the beasts were fit for sale on that particular date it might not suit the farmer to sell on that date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows what I am at.  There are farmers who <Col N="2118" /> have certain calls to meet at certain times of the year.  I think I am making myself clear on that point. Are we to be faced with the position that a farmer cannot walk into an ordinary fair and sell his beast to the highest bidder, whether that buyer is buying for export or for home consumption? If the farmer walks into any country fair in the ordinary way, he tries to get the highest price in the market and he does not know or does not worry whether the cattle are going to be bought for home consumption or for export.  That is not the way the trade has been worked at all. Does anybody, who has any knowledge of the position, really consider for a moment that this Bill can be effectively and efficiently worked?  I am afraid that it cannot be either effectively or efficiently worked.  I am satisfied of two things, that it is not going to absorb the surplus live stock of this country and that it is certainly not going to secure for the farmer a price which will cover the cost of production and something in addition to maintain him and those who are depending on him as they should be maintained.</P>
      <P>Let us come to the other parts of the Bill.  Of course, it is the usual practice of Deputy Corry to look at the truth from the wrong end of the telescope.  He tried to attribute to Deputy Anthony statements which he did not make.  So far as I am concerned&mdash;and I think Deputy Anthony is of the same mind&mdash;in the circumstances, I have no objection whatever to the Government's providing free beef, free mutton, or any of the other necessaries of life free for the poor and destitute of this country, but I do say that it is a terrible commentary on the policy of the Party opposite, who told those destitute people two and a half years ago that if there were a Christian Government in power in this country, there would be no destitution or no unemployment.  It speaks very badly for the policy of that Party that, after two and a half years of their government, things are so bad and destitution is so much greater than it was two years ago, that they are forced to introduce a measure like this.</P>

Those who were in receipt of old age pensions, or those who were looking for them, were told that if they did not vote Fianna Fáil they would not get them and that if they had them already they would be taken from them.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately for Deputy Corry it did not work in Cork. That is a great tribute to the Cork people.  Not even Deputy Corry was able to fool the Cork people all the time.  To get back to the Bill, I must say in passing that Deputy Donnelly has not lost any of his old tricks.  The Deputy always knows when anybody is getting near his corns.  I was saying when I was interrupted by Deputy Donnelly that this Bill speaks badly for the efforts, or the so-called efforts, of the Government for two and a half years.  We are being driven back into the position&mdash;Deputy Donnelly, Deputy Corry and even the Minister now and again likes to call a spade a spade&mdash;in which, as Deputy Anthony said, we shall have the soup kitchens, the pauperising and the degrading of the decent working people of this country. Deputy Corry talked about first and second-class beef and mutton being given to those people.  There are many members of this House who are also members of local authorities.  I want to put it frankly to any member of any Party in the House, whose duty it has been to consider the contracts for the <Col N="2120" /> supply of beef and mutton to institutions, does he believe, although these institutions advertised for prime beef and mutton, that they ever got it?</P>

That was even when it was costing them 8d. and 9d. per lb. on the hoof.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is trying to be more petty than he usually is. We all know what Deputy Corry is trying to say but he has not the courage to say it.  As far as that is concerned, Deputy Broderick has a higher sense of honour and courage than Deputy Corry ever had.  I am talking about facts.  I go further and ask, if this Bill passes, when it comes into actual operation and when the ordinary working man or his wife or little child gets a voucher and goes into the butcher's shop on a Friday or Saturday afternoon, what is going to happen?  The worker's wife takes her place at the end of the queue and has to wait with her relief ticket while her next-door neighbour, whose husband is working, can walk up and pay for her beef independently and walk out.  In this case I believe in calling a spade a spade.  There are men in this House who know that what I say is true.  There are men serving on local authorities who know all about contracts entered into for the supply of meat to public institutions. These men know that the person tendering a relief ticket to the butcher will not get the same quality of meat as the person who is able to plank down the cash.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have listened to a great deal of detail on the technical side of this measure.  We have been told what it is going to mean to producers of beef and mutton. I want to get it into its political setting in which it has not been put yet.  This thing ought not to be called the &ldquo;Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Bill.&rdquo;  It ought to be called the &ldquo;Slaughter of Trade (Third Shift) Bill.&rdquo;  If those of you who believe that we have won out in the economic war want a better title, why not call it the Economic War (Victory)&mdash;you might put &ldquo;Victory&rdquo; in inverted commas as well as in brackets&mdash;Third Celebration Bill?  What is the situation with which we are faced?  The Minister did become more frank to-day than he has ever been in any phase of this whole economic struggle.  We have suffered twice from the British reaction to the land annuities fraud&mdash; once when the penal tariffs went on and, secondly, when quotas were fixed. We did not think that we were ever going to be driven to this device. On the 14th July, 1932, when the Emergency Imposition of Duties Bill was introduced, the Minister for Finance felt certain that we had alternative markets.  If the British did anything to us, we could, he said, get our produce sent elsewhere.  He did not think that the alternative market was going to be the provision of free meat and cheap boiling beef to the extra number of unemployed brought about by two years of Fianna Fáil Government.  That never ranked in anybody's mind as an alternative market but that is the refuge now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister told us to-day that when the penal tariffs went on it was found that the beef producer in this country was being penalised by the difference between the bounty and the British tariff.  I want him to amend that.  He was penalised in the difference between the amount of the bounty which the producer got&mdash;which was not the whole amount&mdash;and the penal tariff.  Then we got a further set-back when quotas were fixed.  I did not understand the immediate sequence of the Minister's argument on that point.  To me he did appear <Col N="2122" /> to argue at the beginning that the quotas would be of no importance if it were not for Press propaganda and panicky remarks by Deputy Belton. He said that, due to these things, people got the impression that there were more cattle to be exported than the quotas allowed and that there was a rush to kill and a rush to sell cattle. If we have no more cattle to export than the quota allows us to get into Britain, why this measure?  If there is a bigger exportable surplus than the quota allows us to get into Britain, why blame Press propaganda and Deputy Belton for what the ordinary law of economics brought about?</P>
    <P>Now, we are going to get over some part of the trouble with Britain.  I have not yet gathered from the Minister whether the bounties are going to stop.  I take it as an implication from part of his speech that they are not. I take it that this measure is only intended to relieve the producer of cattle from that extra handicap which the quotas have imposed upon him and that he is still going to be at the loss of the difference between the amount of the penal tariffs and the bounty. That is not Deputy Davin's plan. Deputy Davin is the father of this scheme, according to himself.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;Mr. de Valera and the Minister for Agriculture would be well advised <Col N="2124" /> to give up thinking of and talking politics for a week or two and see whether it was possible to put such a scheme into operation immediately.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Deputy had the scheme.  It was presumably passed on to the Minister, who had to consider it.  It has been turned down in part.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It was a scandalous state of affairs that they should be asked to tolerate a continuance of the existing position&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This must have been an awful shock to the Minister, because he denied that this was ever the position.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;which enabled cattle dealers from the Six Counties to come into the Free State and smuggle fat cattle across the Border, thus making for themselves a profit of £7 per head.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Did they ever make these profits?  We used to be told that prices here and in Northern Ireland were much the same. The Deputy thought that men smuggling cattle&mdash;presumably they did not get the bounty on them&mdash;were making £7 profit per head.</P>

I presume that the bounty is going to continue and that this Bill is an attempt to make up for the extra burden caused by the quota. I wonder if Deputy Davin remembers when a scheme such as this was previously proposed.

On the basis of 600,000 head of cattle shipped from this country per annum, a tax averaging 5/- per head would provide a sum of £150,000, equal to 5 per cent. on £3,000,000 of capital.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This addition rather blots part of the text but, so far as I can make out, it is as follows&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to read it afterwards.  It is an interesting addition:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This tax on live cattle exports would not fall upon the farmer of this country; on the contrary, a reduction of the supply of cattle for the English market by 1,000 or 2,000 cattle per week through the killing of that number in Ireland, would raise the market price of live cattle for shipment by much more than the amount of the tax.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It would be interesting to have that tested by facts.  It has not done that.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Such a fund would enable provision to be made for insuring farmers and owners of live stock against loss due to accident or disease.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Before I come to the annex, the plan was to put a levy, a tax per head on the shippers of cattle.  It could be done.  It would provide a sum equal to 5 per cent. on £3,000,000 of capital. It is a sad day for Deputy Davin when he has got to vote, not for putting a tax on the exporters of cattle, but for taxation on the consumers of meat in this country to enable exporters to export.</P>

      <P>Let me go to the pamphlet first.  The foreword to the pamphlet bears two signatures&mdash; Deputy Norton's and Deputy Davin's. That is Deputy Davin's opinion, but the Party were more sensible and they turned it down.  Deputy Davin is here to-day to vote, not for putting 5/- a head on cattle exported out of the country, but for putting a tax of a halfpenny a lb. on the people who eat meat in this country in order to enable the cattle trade to live, and apparently the cattle trade must be kept alive.  There was a time when it was thought to be the most unpatriotic thing possible to almost breathe the same air as a cattle exporter.  Now we find ourselves reduced to the position that the Minister rather graphically described to-day.  I think this is a fair statement of his position. Previous to his interfering with the trade of this country, previous to his winning that great fight over the land annuities, there were so many cattle reared in this country, some remained at home for breeding purposes, some were consumed at home and the rest were exported.  Those retained for breeding purposes are about the same, those retained for home consumption are, according to the Minister, greater than ever and the only difference is as to the numbers exported.  There used to be an export of a certain amount. Now we cannot get it.  Why?  Because <Col N="2127" /> the British will not let us.  It used to be said that the British could not do without our cattle.  Apparently they can.</P>
      <P>It used also to be said that the British had more cattle coming in from all over the world than they could afford to have, but Deputy Cosgrave showed to-night that New Zealand alone was sending in last year twice the amount that was being sent in previously.  It used to be said that we had alternative markets.  But what are we reduced to?  We have a certain number of cattle that used to be exported to Britain.  We have that number to think of.  Some of them are to be sold with a bounty; some of them are to be bought and distributed free; some of them, old and distressed cattle, are to be driven into factories&mdash;the new factory for old cattle, as someone described it&mdash;and converted into meat meal, and some are to be tinned.  That is the position; that we cannot do without this production of cattle.  We cannot send them out as we used to at a particular price.  The Minister says that he is not going to quarrel with anyone who calls this a levy or a tax, but it is going to cost the country £600,000 per annum.</P>
      <P>I remember the old plan, referring to the farmer, when the Minister was looking for the votes of the people. The Fianna Fáil plan for the farmer meant a guaranteed market and guaranteed profitable prices for a large part of his marketable produce, increased competitive power resulting in increased exports.  It meant giving Irish agriculturists chances they had not got since 1922, and it meant security.  In face of that we have got to the position that some of these cattle have to be bought and distributed to the poor at an extra cost to those who can afford to buy.  The calves are to be slaughtered for their skins so that they will not grow up to be an embarrassment in years to come.  The old diseased cows are to be driven into a meat meal factory and some of the rest are to be put into tins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was never forecasted.  There <Col N="2128" /> was never any blot like that in the plan.  We were promised that the land annuities were going to be retained in this country, that complete derating was to be given to the farmer and there was to be £1,000,000 extra for the relief of taxation.  We have kept the land annuities.  Have we got the complete derating?  Have we got the £1,000,000 extra for the reduction of taxation?  Were we ever told about the £600,000 extra that it was going to cost the country to keep the cattle trade going, and to keep it going to England.  We are going to pay that extra sum for meat, for the production of beef and for the forced sale of it to England at a time when, without this money, England is getting back every penny of the land annuities save only that part that she has decided not to collect: the part that she has decided has been converted from a terminable annuity into a permanent one, the sinking fund charges.</P>
    <P>Except for that every one of the cattle that we must send to England bears some part of the land annuities as surely as if there was a coupon attached to the neck of each beast to be cashed into so much land annuities. While we are paying every shilling of that, we have not got from the retained moneys complete derating or the reduced taxation that was promised. We find ourselves driven to two shifts: one that we are going to borrow this year to pay what is called the cost of the bounties.  In other words, we are going to borrow to pay some part of the land annuities although we were told that they were to be retained and were to go to the benefit of the country, and we are going to tax the people £600,000 more per annum to try and keep the business alive.</P>
    <P>In June of this year Senator Connolly, who is a Minister in this Government, went to Naas and said that it had taken 100 years to establish the cattle trade in this country but that with God's help it would not take 100 years to kill it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is dying fast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently it was dying too fast all the while; hence <Col N="2129" /> we rush in with this business of State control.  The Minister for Agriculture to-night said that as far as the moneys for the financing of this measure were concerned he did not care whether they were called taxes or levies.  He used another and more picturesque phrase&mdash;putting the thing more vividly before the House: if the money was not to be got in the levy as it was proposed it would be necessary for the Minister for Finance to come into this House some day and propose a tax which would bring in £600,000.  So in regard to this deplorable trade, which Senator Connolly told us was going to be killed soon, we now find ourselves facing up to the burden of a new £600,000 tax in order to keep it going.  The logic of all this is hard to realise.  When we were discussing on other occasions the establishment of flour mills in the country, one of the great hopes held out was that if you got so much flour manufactured here there was going to be so much more in the way of offals for sale in the country.  There was going to be feeding stuffs.  For what?  For live stock.  For what?  For export, as this Bill shows.  We are going to deal with another Bill to-night, which admits that we are setting up a factory for the production of industrial alcohol which is going to be uneconomic.  The bait of the thing is that, for every gallon of industrial alcohol produced there are going to be nine gallons of industrial alcoholic wash, and it is going to be marvellous foodstuff for cattle.  Again, for what?  So that some of them will drift out into England. Or I suppose industrial alcohol had better be thought of in another direction. If we are going to tin the beef I suppose we may say that by the time they have got the industrial alcohol tinned they will be partially canned.  The industrial alcoholic wash &mdash;the backwash, as somebody described it&mdash;is also going to be cattle food.  In the end, despite the great efforts of the Minister for Finance in July, 1932, and, I am sure, despite his great efforts since, we find no alternative market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is only one stage in the attempt to make up for the losses that we have <Col N="2130" /> achieved through the economic war. There has been a pretty distinct effort made to destroy the cattle trade. There was the emergency panic measure that was started this year with regard to the calves, and there is this other thing which is talked of now and for which I understand we will require another subsidy&mdash;this factory for the conversion of old and diseased cattle into meal.  Despite all that, and despite the absence of the embarrassments that there would be, say, next year, or some years afterwards, by reason of those young animals growing up, and by the clogging of the market with those old diseased cattle, the Minister has no better hopes than this measure&mdash;a halfpenny a pound on meat for those who are able to pay for it; a huge army of officials; big administrative expenses; new subsidies in the offing for this factory and, I suppose, another subsidy in the offing for the canning.  Despite all that, and with all that, there is sticking out the one economic truth that we can have discovered to have pierced any head on the Government Benches, the statement made by the Minister for Defence when he told his audience in Louth that as long as this country had to export any goods to England, so long would England be able to take from us the amount of the moneys we are now withholding from her.  This does not get us far on the way towards the self-sufficiency which will enable us to run away with that money and not suffer, because this not merely allows for but insists on export.  That is the political setting in which all this thing ought to be looked at.  We are told that the bait in it is the free distribution.  I noticed that the Minister went quickly away from the free distribution.  He did speak of it as free for a bit.  He even talked as if the free distribution was going to include what he described as &ldquo;the good cuts.&rdquo;  He told us afterwards that certainly at a later point, and a point soon to be reached, the free distribution would only include what he called the boiling beef ends. A little later he made another step, and we no longer had any hope of free meat, even of the boiling beef <Col N="2131" /> type, but only cheap meat, thus getting further away from Deputy Davin's labour organised&mdash;or disorganised&mdash; view-point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy address himself to that point about free meat on which Deputy Morrissey has offered comment?  I think I heard Deputy Davin echoing and making certain approving comments when, during the last twelve months, the Vice-President stood here in this House and denounced the giving of relief in kind.  He was adverting principally to the position of the Dublin Union, and he said it was a shocking, demeaning and pauperising thing.  He himself made use of the phrase which Deputy Morrissey used here to-night&mdash;that you got back very much to the days when there were abuses in the poor relief system.  He talked as if we had got clean away from all the old taint of pauperism. <Col N="2132" /> He talked as if that had been removed simply because you now gave to people in need money to allow them to buy what they pleased, and had done away with the grievance of giving people foodstuffs and making them take that as part of the relief to which the State had declared them entitled.  We are coming back to it. We are coming back to it for a big number of people.  Everybody who is in receipt of home assistance, and they are a big number, and everybody who has got a certificate entitling him to relief in the way of unemployment assistance, another big number, may have a voucher, with which voucher he can go to the licensed butcher or licensed victualler, hand it in, and get some little portion of meat.  The Minister has hopes, which Deputy Morrissey properly derides, that the man with that voucher is going to get anything like the quality of meat that the man who is paying will get.  That is a small side of it.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The main thing is that with the approval of Deputy Davin we are going to get back to payment in kind.  It will be interesting to see how the Deputy, who, on many occasions was vehement about the stain that that left and the hurt that it did to people who found themselves under the necessity of taking relief in any way, will justify it now in relation to this measure.  The only justification for this measure, or anything in it, is that there is nobody who believes in this doctrine of self-sufficiency; nobody believes in it logically carried out to the end. Nobody believes in seeing this country devoting itself to providing only goods that the people of the country can consume.  Nobody is so far forgetful of the country's interests as to hope that the international trade which used to be between this country and Great Britain will stop for ever.</P>

They have been made our commercial bosses, and made to realise that they are our commercial bosses, when we have to bring in a Bill to tax our own people for the meat they eat, in order that we may continue to export to them.  There was never such an exposure of weakness. If we had a weakness in our situation we could hide it, but this is a complete &ldquo;give-in.&rdquo;  No one really believes in this as a lasting thing.  It is only a subterfuge, something to go on with, something to do in a difficulty, which we all hope will be temporary.  The Minister believes in Deputy Davin's nonsense of April 16th about self-sufficiency, providing just for the needs of the country, and not caring about an export or an international trade&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Is this a measure to carry out self-sufficiency, to have only a certain amount of cattle in the country, and by some system of preferential licences to enable people to rear and to trade in a certain amount of cattle and no more? It is a good sign, at any rate, for the future, that you have a thing like this brought in, because there is inherent in it a negation of the policy of living entirely inside the walls of this country, and neglecting everything that happens outside.  This is an entire negation of self-sufficiency, as it is understood by some people, and that is the only thing that makes the measure even tolerable in present circumstances.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan read out a correct extract from a speech which I delivered at Mountrath in April last.  That speech was made with due regard to the views of the members of this Party at that period. I can say this, and it is to my own disadvantage, that this Bill, in my opinion, is in many respects a considerable improvement on the rough and ready proposals which we presented to the Government in connection with this matter last April.  The Bill is excellently drafted.  Deputies on the opposite benches cannot deny that it goes as far as any measure of the kind could go to protect the interests of producers and consumers. Deputy Belton when speaking on the Financial Motion, apparently not having read it very carefully, said that licensed traders would be placed in such a position that they could deduct the levy of £1 from the producers of cattle and 5/- in the case of sheep. The Minister for Agriculture very ably disposed of that silly argument. I can only come to the conclusion that Deputy Belton would not have twice advanced that argument if he had read the Money Resolution carefully in conjunction with a section of the Bill. Like his colleague, Deputy Curran, Deputy Morrissey objects to inspectors having anything to do with farmers. I wonder if the Deputy would have that objection at a particular period when the administration of the National Health Insurance Act included looking after farmers to see if they had complied with the provisions of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>One could carry such a silly objection to the stage of telling certain people when they should baptise their children or the age at which they should be confirmed.  The inspectors appointed will be calling on farmers for a very useful purpose, that of seeing that the prices which will <Col N="2137" /> be fixed by the Minister when the Act comes into operation are paid to producers.  No section will be more delighted than farmers when the inspectors call upon them for that particular purpose, to see that the terms of the section are strictly enforced and that the profiteering people, who have been buying cattle at ridiculously low prices and selling meat to consumers at particularly high prices, are dealt with.  I am glad to support the terms of any measure which will raise a levy from profiteers in this country, people who have been slaughtering cattle in certain butcher shops, after buying them at sacrifice prices and then selling the fresh meat at highly excessive prices.  The ex-Minister knows perfectly well that behind this Bill and the powers in it is the Food Prices Commission.  I understand that that Commission is at present engaged in an inquiry into the prices being charged for fresh meat by butchers.</P>

      <P>The cause of the low prices at present paid to the farmers of this country for fat cattle is admittedly the surplus stock we have here and which the British, for certain reasons of their own, are not prepared to buy in the same quantities in which they bought heretofore.  This Bill will have the effect of having a considerably increased number of our own fat cattle slaughtered in our own country, and fresh meat supplied to the most needy section of the community.

No specific notice is necessary.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Morrissey made the point that the minimum price&mdash;and he has some peculiar figure in his elastic imagination in that respect&mdash; would in this case be the maximum or ruling price.  So long as there is a large surplus of fat stock in the country, I agree that there would be a good deal in that contention, but a number of people who have access to facts and figures&mdash;in some cases, Government advisers&mdash;estimate that the number of fat cattle to be slaughtered under this Bill, when it is in operation, for the purpose of providing free meat for people at present in need of home assistance and unemployment assistance will increase home consumption by at least 70,000 or 80,000 cattle per year.  If we can reach a stage in our history, while this Act is in operation, where by increased consumption of fresh meat in our own home market, we would cut across the British quota requirements, Deputy Morrissey's argument as to the minimum price being the maximum price will not apply.  If we can reach a stage at which the British will have to come into the market here and buy in competition with the people responsible for the administration of this measure in the Irish market, and with those who buy cattle for human consumption in the normal course of events, the British, being compelled to look for the cattle instead of buying them here under present conditions, in <Col N="2140" /> which there is a surplus, will put that minimum price at a competitive price and certainly the figure will be higher than the minimum laid down by the Minister.  In other words, if we can get to a stage when the British will have to come in and buy as distinct from the present position, the minimum price will not be the maximum price as stated by Deputy Morrissey.  At any rate, it is the duty of any Christian or civilised Government in this country to provide clothing and shelter for its own people before they look after the interests of the people in another country.</P>
      <P>I have nothing to regret in what I have said, because what I said at Mountrath was said with due deliberation. It is the policy, and was the policy, of this Party before Deputies Anthony and Morrissey were expelled from it.  I did not think it was necessary for me to say anything in support of this Bill because it is a Bill which Labour Deputies could support in the Lobby without a speech and without mental reservation of any kind.  It contains principles which we have advocated in this House and outside, long before some of us became Deputies, and when we were associated, as we are to-day, with the trade union movement in this country.  I have no hesitation whatever, and very considerable enthusiasm, in voting for every section of this Bill, believing that it is serving a useful purpose, by providing free meat for the most needy section of our population.  Again, I confess that it is a considerable advance and improvement on the rough and ready proposals which we presented on this matter to the Government as far back as April last.</P>

      <P>I am very sorry that Deputy McGilligan has left the House. I was very much struck by one or two remarks he made in the course of his contribution to the debate.  One was that everybody hoped that there would be no necessity for measures of this kind or that the necessity would not last long.  There is nobody on these benches, either Minister or ordinary back-bencher, who has the slightest disposition for a continuation <Col N="2141" /> of any set of circumstances that would perpetuate the system that makes measures of this kind necessary, but I cannot follow the line of reasoning of Deputy McGilligan, able though he is, nor can I reconcile to a very great extent the logic he used, when he said that this Bill was, if anything, the greatest confession of weakness the Government has yet introduced into the Dáil; when he said that we were showing our hands and exposing our weakness, and proving conclusively that this country could not do without the cattle trade, and that England&mdash; this is practically what he said&mdash;was the only possible purchaser for these cattle.  If there was any weakness at all in the Government's case, or in the contentions they have had to make, which could be pointed out, no time and no opportunity has been lost by all the members of the Opposition without exception in pointing out these weaknesses to the Government across the water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan started off as he usually does with that worn out document he has and which I have seen him quote here at least half a dozen times.  It is stuck to a piece of cardboard or something like that and he calls it &ldquo;The Promises&rdquo;&mdash;the promises we made at the elections and on which we got into power.  We kept the land annuities at home he said, but we are still sending them away in some indirect or invisible manner.  As I said, he always prefaces any remarks he has to make by a reference to the promises we made.  Certainly we promised that we would keep the annuities at home, and they have been kept at home.  What was the attitude taken up by Deputy McGilligan and other members of the Opposition during the course of the general election campaign when we put our cards on the table with regard to keeping them at home?  He talks about weaknesses.  The reply that was invariably made to that&mdash;and I quote one, Senator Blythe, and I would ask Deputy Curran to take special notice of this&mdash;was &ldquo;The day you keep these annuities at home, a poll tax will go on your cattle.&rdquo;  That was one weakness, I suppose.  In case our friends <Col N="2142" /> across the water might not know it, one of the strong men in the Opposition, one man whose words would be paid attention to, went around the country and from platforms and in the Press pointed out to these people, &ldquo;Here is the place where you can strike back&rdquo;&mdash;of course his reputation to some degree as a statesman was at stake&mdash;&ldquo;you can strike back by putting a poll tax on the cattle,&rdquo; and the poll tax was put on.  After it was put on the Government is blamed by members of the Opposition for taking a further step to meet the situation created by the levying of the tax on cattle going across the water and the establishment of the quota.  Members of the Opposition cannot have it both ways.  They cannot have it in one respect in the country by saying that we made a grievous mistake in starting this campaign and have it in the other respect by coming into this House to condemn the counter-action taken to meet the exigencies of the situation created as the result of the economic war.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Davin, I am supporting this Bill and I am going to vote for it.  Apart from any pledge or affiliation I have as one of the rank and file members of the Party, I would vote for this Bill.  I cannot understand a Deputy of the standing of Deputy McGilligan trying to use the sentimental or sob stuff about the degradation that it is for the poor people who are unemployed to go to the butcher's shop and hand in a ticket to get free meat.  I would suggest to members of the Opposition that the further they get away from that sort of argument, the better for themselves.  It would be better that it should not be mentioned.  There is no degradation whatever attached to people who have no money getting food.  There is no degradation attached to any father or mother going to the butchers' shops set up by the Government to get food for a big family. Food is a necessary of life.  If we have to go back, as Deputy Morrissey said, and re-establish in this country something similar to what occurred in the souper days, do not forget the objective kept in view in those days.  We do <Col N="2143" /> not intend to make soupers of our people, to lower them in character, or in the slightest way to bring about degradation by giving them the necessaries of life.  If Deputy McGilligan were here I would ask him, and Deputy Morrissey also, to take into consideration the amount of that kind of work done in this country to bring about a state of circumstances that this Government is engaged in trying to repair at the present time.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan said that Arthur Griffith never dreamed at any time of making this country self-sufficient to the extent that it should not have an outside market.  I think Deputy Cosgrave will bear me out, as he would be a better authority on it than I would be, when I say that Arthur Griffith's whole life was given to one purpose and one objective&mdash;to make this country self-supporting.  His whole lifetime was given to this one particular thing&mdash;pointing out the ruin done to this country by the treatment we were getting from the people across the water.  By measures of this kind we have at last taken a definite stand against the system of penetration adopted by those people across the water to try and bring about the economic ruin of this country.</P>
    <P>I was reading last night&mdash;I am sorry Deputy McGilligan is not here to hear this&mdash;one of a rather interesting series of articles called &ldquo;Ireland's Poverty: Its Cause and Its Cure,&rdquo; written by Deputy Belton who was at that time an ex-T.D.  He is as good at writing as he is at making speeches.  He gave a description of the methods used to bring about the state of circumstances which exist at present in this country and which this Government told the people they were going to try and alter.  I would recommend every member of the Opposition to read his description of the old souper days of '47 and what the people went through while England was preparing a commercial state in this country to make this country dependent on her.  I would recommend every Opposition Deputy to read this series of articles written by Deputy Belton.  I would <Col N="2144" /> ask Deputy Belton to read them again and refresh his own memory.</P>

      <P>Speaking in all sincerity, I am surprised at the attitude adopted by Deputy Belton as regards measures of this kind.  I was hoping during the afternoon that, like the Bill introduced yesterday, there might not be a division on this Bill.  I do not know whether there will or not.  I was hoping that it would go through after all the talk as a measure that would bring some sort of satisfaction to some section of the community and do good to some people&mdash;to people, at any rate, who may be hungry and to farmers who want to get the cost of production.  As I said, I am candidly surprised at the action of Deputy Belton in opposing Bills of this sort. In his election address in 1927, just immediately after he left the Fianna Fáil Party, he said in the last paragraph that he stood for the policy of Fianna Fáil and that the only fault he had with it was that it should come through a process of evolution and not by any revolutionary action.  He told the people whom he asked to vote for him that he stood for the policy of Fianna Fáil.</P>

I ask the Deputy just to refresh his mind on one or two of these things.  I am supporting this Bill not because I happen to be a member of the Party, but because, like Deputy McGilligan was at one period, I was a student of that system of economy that was preached by Arthur Griffith, that it was the right and patriotic <Col N="2145" /> thing to make this country self-sufficient. We are told we are in a weak position.  These people are told on every occasion, both inside and outside this House, where the weakness lies in the case that is being made out and the action taken by the Government. Is it possible for any success to emerge out of this struggle while the Government are being attacked, as they have been attacked day after day, week after week, and month after month, by an Opposition which should throw its whole weight behind the Government in all the actions they are taking to defend this country in the economic war.

      <P>The Minister for Agriculture this evening followed very much along the lines of a speech he made yesterday on the occasion of another Bill and also on the occasion of the introduction of his Estimate. He said there were many things that were wrong in this country.  The agricultural industry was in a serious situation, but the whole fault in relation to any losses sustained by agriculturists, certainly for the last six or 12 months, were entirely due to propaganda by the Press or by the Opposition.  Some time last January a new situation arose in respect to our cattle trade.  Up to January last, whatever might be complained of in respect to the price of cattle, one thing at least was sure and that was, it was possible to cash them.  In January a new situation presented itself and we were suddenly confronted with a prohibition order on the part of the British Government practically restricting us to an export of 50 per cent. of the cattle we had been previously <Col N="2147" /> accustomed to export.  The Minister told us this evening that if it were not for propaganda and for the Opposition that situation would have settled itself. Feeders and others would have been able to get rid of their cattle quite easily without any disturbance and with no loss of price, but that in a panic they tried to cash them.  I have met some feeders during the last six months.  They had not even the opportunity of cashing their cattle. The animals were fit for sale in January, February and March and they had to be taken from the stalls where they were kept and stall-fed and turned into stores by being put out on the land.</P>
      <P>That solved the situation for the Minister.  What was his attitude at that time?  He can correct me if I am wrong.  He said the main trouble in this country was that we had too many cattle and there was only one way to deal with the situation and that was to ensure that for the next year or the next two or three years we would not be in that position.  To make that certain he offered a bounty of 10/- on calf skins.  There was a statement made here that something like 300,000 calves should be slaughtered annually so as to save us the bother of rearing them.  That is the contribution the Ministry makes to a serious economic situation.  Their solution is the slaughter of the calves, with a bounty paid on the skins.  These calves were the best calves that were ever bred in this country.  For something like ten years a real, earnest attempt has been made by the Department of Agriculture to improve the cattle breeds and, in consequence, those were the best.  We will never have the opportunity of selling them as first-class quality.  There is no man who comes from any country, and particularly from Great Britain, who will not admit that during the last ten years there has been an enormous improvement in our breeds of cattle. It would be well if the Ministry opposite and their supporters through the country took off their political spectacles and put on economic spectacles in dealing with the present state of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2148" /> Such statements as to put up the white flag in order to get out of this situation are all nonsense.  Only a child would make that sort of statement. It is very much in accord with some of our earlier experiences in those large institutions in which young people of both sexes are assembled and in which the explanation always is &ldquo;It was me done it, sir.&rdquo;  There is a problem here and it is not confined to this country.  It is a problem which, sooner or later, the collective wisdom of the peoples of those countries will be called upon to solve.  We are not going to solve it by listening to such speeches as we have heard here this evening.  We are not going to get it solved by a miserable contribution of £300,000 towards the price of cattle in this country.  We are not going to get it solved by Ministers or Deputies saying that there will be an economic price given for cattle.  The very terms of this Bill show the lack of confidence of the Ministry.  In Part IV the Minister may fix a price.  Under other portions of the Bill, if an unfortunate farmer or a registered slaughter-house keeper makes any mistake, whether through negligence or innocence&mdash;I think even the term &ldquo;innocence&rdquo; is in one of the clauses&mdash;he may be hauled before the District Justice and fined.  But the Minister may in his discretion fix a price for cattle.</P>
    <P>My principal objection to the Bill is in connection with its financial unsoundness.  It means putting additional cost on the country.  In their first year of office the Government collected £1,200,000 more than they could spend.  Last year, they collected £1,500,000 more than they could spend.  In the first two years, they put more than £500,000 in the Local Loans Fund and they collected £3,200,000, over and above what they required.  Now, to solve the cattle situation they are going to tax consumers to the extent of £300,000. Where is this going to end as far as our own economy is concerned?  It is bound to result in demands for increases in wages.  Everybody who wishes the prosperity of the working classes is anxious for an increase in wages, but in the last analysis, unless <Col N="2149" /> the industry of the country can afford the increase, it is not going to be paid. Not alone in Great Britain but in America and Australia they have learned the evils of that policy and they are sweating under the difficult situations occasioned by indulging in a policy of that kind.  Here are two Governments both of them deeply concerned with regard to this question, each of them endeavouring as far as they possibly can, according to the genius that is in them, to solve the problem.  Almost at the same time as we have this Cattle Bill before us the British Government have a Cattle Bill before them.  How many members or supporters of our Government read the discussions in the House of Commons in connection with the British Bill?  What is their problem? We have been told by Ministers and Government supporters that the British market is gone.  I read out this evening what appeared to me to be quite a different story in that connection.</P>
    <P>Some two years ago, when this Government was only a short time in office, there was a Conference at Ottawa and there was some plain, straight talking over there.  Amongst those who had to concern themselves with the economic situation there was the Chancellor of the Exchequer of Great Britain.  I would recommend those who have time to read the story as presented there by the Chancellor of the Exchequer regarding the importation into Great Britain from New Zealand and Australia of butter and mutton to do so.  I cannot remember, and it does not matter very much now, which of them doubled its exports in the short space of two years&mdash; either butter or mutton.  It can be found in the report.  In one case 568,000 cwts. were exported from New Zealand or Australia in 1929.  In 1931 that export had gone up to 1,500,000 cwts.  In the other case&mdash;either mutton or butter again&mdash;768,000 cwts. were exported in 1929 and in 1931 it had gone up to 1,500,000 cwts.  So that in one case the export doubled and in the other case it had increased once and a half in the short space of two years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2150" /> I read out here this evening what transpired at Ottawa in connection with the export from New Zealand of beef&mdash;377,000 cwts., and 10 per cent. added to that.  Normally that would mean that in the following year they would have a right to export 414,000 cwts., either chilled or frozen meat. They actually exported 700,000, and this year, for six months, they have exported 500,000 cwts., and they are expecting the other 500,000&mdash;so the Minister states&mdash;and there is another 500,000 cwts. still to come.  What is the situation presented to us there? It is simply this: that during the last few years, while there has been an actual reduction in the consumption of beef per head in Great Britain, the imports into Great Britain of chilled and frozen beef have been on the increase.  The percentage of frozen beef, which was 76 in the Ottawa year, is now 84.  Frozen beef has gone up eight points.  The percentage of frozen mutton and lamb in the Ottawa year was 73 and to-day it is 75.  In Great Britain they realise fully and thoroughly the importance of British agriculture to Great Britain and they realise, whether we like it or not, or however much we may object to it, that we are almost essential to the beef production of Great Britain.  The quality of our live stock is something of which they can partake.  Even in their Bill&mdash;the Bill which has been introduced into the British House of Commons, and which, if not already passed, will pass very shortly&mdash;it is prescribed that, three months after an animal is imported into Great Britain, it is entitled to get a subsidy of 9/4 dead weight or live weight&mdash;I do not know which it is.</P>

      <P>The reverse?  The expert comes to the top as usual. Again, there is appreciation in Great Britain of the importance of the situation. During the course of his speech there the Minister informed the House that the wealth expended on agriculture in Great Britain amounted to £1,000,000,000.  He said that the income derived from that was a matter of very <Col N="2151" /> great consequence to them.  The revenue amounted to £180,000,000, and all their overseas investments, in respect of which they had to have some regard in making arrangements for supplies from Canada, New Zealand, Australia and the Argentine, amounted to £3,000,000,000 or £4,000,000,000, although the income in respect of it amounted to only £150,000,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am coming to.  I said that from all the speeches we have listened to over the way the question was 180,000 or 200,000 head of cattle.  Our export trade goes from 600,000 to 800,000 and that is the problem that concerns us, and not the internal problem.  The internal problem is simple, but the external problem&mdash;the fact that we can make them pay, that they are willing to pay and that we should be able to get it out of them&mdash;is what should concern both the Ministry and those who supported them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the last few years, as I have said, there has been a very remarkable improvement in the quality of the beef produced here.  It is that very superior quality which keeps us at the present moment in a market that is far more valuable, three times more valuable, than our own.  We are concerned here with 180,000 head of cattle.  The Minister expects to get a levy of £305,000.  I think that the numbers he gave in respect of sheep were 500,000, but perhaps it is the other way about. Anyway it is 180,000 at £1 a head and 500,000 sheep at 5/-.  Our exports to Great Britain are of consequence in a <Col N="2152" /> matter of this sort.  In 1929 we exported 775,000; in 1930 almost 858,000; in 1931, 766,000; in 1932, 746,000; and last year, 589,000.  That is the market that we are told is gone and that is going; and we are to concern ourselves here with our 180,000 head of cattle.  To put that even in a school where children attend up to 14 years of age, they would laugh at it.  £300,000 is the proposal put before us by the Ministry here to help, not alone beef, but mutton as well.  Cattle alone are not the entire consideration.  There would not be £200,000 in it for the cattle.  Taking those figures and making allowance for the reduction which has taken place in the price, £6,000,000 were got last year from Great Britain and we should get practically £10,000,000 if it were not for the experiment in which we have indulged in order to show that we have lawyers in this country who can dictate political and economic policy.  It is a new innovation in this country, or in any country, that the lawyers are the real politicians and the real economists, and those who make that case would probably not select the particular lawyers they selected to give them advice.</P>
    <P>In the course of this discussion it transpired that in certain parts of England the purchases of beef had gone down by reason of unemployment and other reasons of that sort. It was, strangely enough, in the mining districts where we sold most of our cattle from this country, or rather it was in the mining districts where most of the cattle produced in this country were consumed.  And I find on looking at our financial returns that we have received £205,000 in revenue from the tax on coal.  I am quite sure in the excess of our patriotic zeal and political fanaticism that we are delighted at seeing the coal mines in England in such a position, forgetting that that £205,000 is lost to the farmers of this country, and moreover that when we buy coal on the Continent we deprive the farmers of this country of that money which we pay to the coal mines there and, at the same time, deprive them of a certain market in England.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2153" /> We could do with a little less of that peculiar outlook.  There is moreover an extraordinary feeling on the part of some people in this country who cannot get away from the slave mind and act in a way which would enable us to discuss this question in a business way and decide it on a business footing.  What was the consideration that the British Minister put before the House of Commons in connection with this cattle question in Great Britain a short time ago?  It was that they could not lose sight of the fact that they had foreign investments and that, however much they liked to help the farmers, there was the question of British money being invested in countries like the Argentine.</P>
    <P>What is the case here?  There is no country in the world dealing with Great Britain on a sounder economic basis than this country.  There is no necessity whatever to bow your heads or your shoulders or your knees in dealing with Great Britain on an economic basis.  Our trade is as indispensable to them as their trade is to us.  They are richer, of course, and they must be laughing at us for the nonsensical way in which the Government here are handling this problem. When we went into this question first, nobody believed that a poll tax would be put on our cattle by Great Britain.</P>
    <P>But there was more than that.  We lost at Ottawa an opportunity of making a bargain with Great Britain which would not have us in the position in which we are now.  New Zealand, South Africa, Canada, and Australia could make a trade bargain with Great Britain.  I am sure they are enjoying this conflict between Great Britain and ourselves and sending in their livestock produce.  There is another reason why Great Britain should settle this question with us.  It is this: no matter what any expert can say in England and no matter what any doctor can say there is no question that our fresh beef going over there is vastly superior in quality to anything that can be brought from the ends of the earth and it is to their own advantage physically and otherwise to deal with this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2154" /> It would be very much better for us if we were to consider the terms upon which we might settle than to be considering this Bill.  This Bill, a member of the Labour Party said, showed marked genius.  That was the description given to it by a member of the Labour Party.  The first publication of the Bill was over the radio last Friday night.  But Deputy Corry said he had been looking at this Bill for weeks.  I do not know whether the Deputy is an extern Minister or if the Government is taking his advice in these matters, or how it was he was able to see the Bill three weeks ago, but the fact remains that it was over the radio on Friday last, I first heard the terms of the Bill.  This Bill is sandwiched with a gift to the poor&mdash; to a reserved class of the poor.  Is the Minister aware of the fact that there are in this country people in receipt of an income smaller even than what is given in home assistance and smaller than what is given under the Unemployment Assistance Act?  Is the Minister aware that there are a great many families throughout the country who if the Government desire to help the poor, might have been included in the list?  Why were they excluded?  What is the reason for it? Why were they excluded from this Bill that was so well drawn and so carefully manipulated by the Minister's draftsmen that we were told nothing was forgotten in respect of it?  Is not that the case?  Can anybody deny it?</P>
    <P>We made up our minds within the last few years that relief in kind should not be given.  There is no excuse for restoring relief in kind by this measure, none whatever.  There is no guarantee that it is to continue.  Far better would it be to give 150,000 persons in receipt of home assistance or unemployment assistance 1/- a week extra and let them buy where they like.  It may be that some of them would not care for this.  There is no indication in this measure that these people are going to get anything like good quality meat, none whatever. I have looked through the terms of the vouchers and I find there is no indication as to quality.  Quantity is the whole thing.  If I am not mistaken <Col N="2155" /> the Minister in the course of his speech used the following words: &ldquo;It is extremely likely we will have to use first class quality meat immediately this Bill is passed.&rdquo;  That does not indicate that it is to be first class beef afterwards.</P>
    <P>I would like to know from the Minister whether he consulted the butchers and slaughter-house people when drafting this Bill.  Because it is one thing to know that the law empowers the Minister to enter into contracts with the butchers and another thing to put that in a contract.  I think it was Deputy Belton who mentioned that these Bills coming in such succession with a regiment of inspectors and officials right down along will bring us to the point that some time or another we will have a telephone in every house every morning ringing up Government Buildings to know if there are any new licences that the people have to take out that morning, as practically everything is to be licensed. You will have inspectors to the right of you, inspectors to the left of you and inspectors in front of you.  I thought I was the only person who was persecuted through being surrounded by people reporting my movements to the Government.  But the farmers are now in the same position. They will have their premises visited at any time.  A farmer may be looking after his tobacco, or sowing his corn, or his other crops, or he may be engaged filling up those documents&mdash; the failure to fill, or an error in filling which may render him liable to a fine of £100.  Yet if the inspector comes along and if he does not attend to him on the spot the unfortunate fat cattle that he has for sale may be saved from the death sentence and he may lose his money.  Let it be noted that the Department of Agriculture will insist that the farmer will have written down for him exactly the moment that his animal is to be marketed and when the animal is to die.</P>

      <P>Supposing the animal is fat, the farmer has got to feed it and continue feeding it whether he likes it or not if the inspector says it is not to be slaughtered until a certain day.  That animal has to get its ration from the farmer each day even though the animal is fit to be sold. Under this Bill, he will have to be kept on.  This Bill does not solve the problem and it does not deserve any of the commendation we have heard about it.  The problem remains to be solved.  Just as they are trying to solve it in England, there is only one solution for it here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>If there were surrenders on the style of the New Zealanders, the South Africans, the Canadians and the Australians it would be much better for the people of this country.  If there were surrenders like the surrenders of the people who got an export trade of 414,000 cwts. for the first year and 1,000,000 cwts. the next year that would be the sort of surrender I would enjoy.  We were not told two years ago that we were to have these taxes on our live stock.  At that time our cattle exports were £12,669,000.  These are now down to £6,064,000.  We were not told that there would be a quota here or there. Nobody ever told us there would; if there had been an agreement at Ottawa we would not have a quota now, and it would not be necessary for us to have this Bill.  Whether the Ministry like it or not that is a problem they have to settle.  They will have to settle more than that.  We have got in this, as well as in every other business nowadays, to pay attention to the markets, see what the British requirements are, and produce these requirements.  We can produce something that nobody else can produce. We have again to invite the farmers to produce baby beef; there is a market for it.  The extraordinary thing I see in these figures of imports in connection with the British market is that London with all its wealth consumes something like 60 per cent. <Col N="2157" /> frozen or chilled meat; whereas in Manchester and Birmingham the percentages are 45 and 50.  That trade can only be got by our producing in an attractive and marketable condition. We have to get these markets back in spite of any prejudice that may have arisen.  We can only do that if, in our own interest, we deal with the matter in a businesslike way and with a businesslike outlook in connection with Great Britain.  Our position is in no way subordinate to Great Britain. The Ministry thinks it is, and that is where they make their fatal mistake.  That market represents something like 800,000 head of cattle, always more than our home market. If we had an increased demand in our home market of 800,000 head of cattle &mdash;a most unlikely possibility&mdash;we would still have that market open. That market could be had if there was sound commonsense shown on the part of the Ministry. They are adding, by this Bill, £300,000 to the taxation of the country; and eventually it is going to be £600,000.  Every one of the measures the Government have brought in is going to add to the cost of living and is going to make life more difficult for our people.  Over 300,000 people were in insurable occupations when this Government took office.  They promised to add to that 86,041 persons.  On the contrary, the Government policy is going to shatter the foundation of the State.  It is too costly an experiment. However, we may seek to settle matters legislatively, and by Acts of Parliament with systems of inspectors and licences and so on, in the long run it comes to this, that the test of a country is how its people live; and the more cost caused by this system of inspectors and licences the less there will be for the people to enjoy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The arguments used against this Bill are that it will not achieve what we have set out to achieve.  It is very difficult for any Minister, or anybody else, to deal with questions of that sort.  All I can say is that I expect to achieve what the Bill sets out to do.  If the Opposition say <Col N="2158" /> I will not achieve that, then the only thing that can decide between us is time.  Everyone who spoke on the Opposition side made that criticism, namely, that we will not achieve the objects which this Bill was introduced to achieve.  These objects are to get a better price for our cattle and to deal with the surplus.  If the Bill will not achieve these objects, then I am wrong and the Opposition is right. But I say again time will tell.  At the same time that they use that argument they all practically use another argument as well, namely, that we are going in for very stringent regulations. I said, in my opening speech, that I realised it was a difficult problem.  Being a difficult problem I hope to succeed, in the only way one can succeed in such matters, and that is by provisions to deal with contingencies as they arise.  There is to be registration of the butcher and people who buy cattle.  These things are incidental to our Bill.  If we are not to have a list of those who buy cattle for slaughter how are we to find out whether they pay the fixed price.  If the Opposition is sincere&mdash;and none of them said he did not want to see this Bill passed and they all implied they would like to see a better price for cattle&mdash;why do they not give us the power to do these things.  They profess to have great sympathy for the butcher.  Deputy Cosgrave asked me if I had consulted the butchers about this Bill.  As a matter of fact, I did. But if I did not I do not see why members of the Opposition should have such sympathy with them because, so far as our relations with the butchers go, they are far less stringent than in any of the Produce Acts passed by the late Government.  If persons come along and say they want to buy cattle, I must register them.  I cannot refuse. There is nothing stringent in that. We are told that the butcher will have to get an auditor to make up his accounts.  What is it that we ask the butcher to do in this connection?  We ask him to return in seven days from the end of the month the number of cattle and sheep he killed.  The butcher dealing with seven or eight cattle and fifteen sheep does not require an <Col N="2159" /> auditor to make up these accounts. He is asked to make a return of the number of cattle and sheep he kills, within seven days from the end of the month.  If he is not a good scholar he can take four days to make up the number and three days to prepare his return and send it in.  We do not ask him to make a calculation of what it amounts to.  We do not ask him to multiply the number of cattle by the number of pounds and the number of sheep by five shillings.  We do all that for him.  We send the bill and he gets seven days to pay.  Surely there is no trouble in book-keeping of that kind.  We cannot refuse to register him and we can only remove him for bankruptcy or fraud or things of that kind but for no other reasons.</P>
      <P>Then the question arises as to the stringent regulations with regard to the marking of cattle.  Deputy Cosgrave says the inspector may call on the farmer at the time when he is about to take his cattle to market so that he may lose his opportunity.  In the first place, the farmer applies to us to have his cattle marked.  I am sure that no Deputy has ever found an inspector from the Department of Agriculture unreasonable.  If the inspector is told not to call on a particular day, or for three or four days, I am sure the inspector will facilitate the farmer in every way.  Deputy Bennett said that for the last two months if a man came to market cattle he could only do it at night time and would have to bring a lantern.  Does that mean that no man can buy cattle?</P>

There was some talk about surplus cattle.  There were probably surplus cattle here, but what I stated was that there were no surplus stall-fed cattle during the period from January to May, taking the whole period together. There may have been some ready for market in January or March which had to be carried on until the end of May, but the fact was proved that there were no stall-feds at the end of May. We asked the organisation which was supposed to represent the stall-feeders to apply for licences and we gave them all licences applied for up to the end of May and they only amounted to about 230 altogether.</P>

      <P>Whatever Deputy Cosgrave may say about an expanding market in Great Britain, there is no doubt that any Deputy can go down to the Library and get the Trade and Navigation Reports and he will find from them that the imports of beef into Britain are declining.  I do not care what speech Deputy Cosgrave may quote, any Deputy can find that for himself.  A question has also been raised in reference to a man having his cattle marked and to the fact that he may not be able to sell them for 15 or perhaps 30 days after their being so marked.  He may not sell them to a person for slaughter.  That is, the person who slaughters the cattle cannot slaughter them except after the <Col N="2161" /> date at which they are marked but there is nothing to prevent a man selling his cattle to a dealer.  The dealer may hold them over until the time comes when they may be slaughtered. What does the farmer do at the present time?  If there are too many cattle on offer, and if the exporter takes a certain number and the butcher a certain number, there is a surplus left. We have tried to improve that situation by saying that we will mark cattle that are most fit for slaughter.  We will certify for export the best cattle and keep the best cattle for home consumption, but the farmer has the same facilities as at present to sell to a dealer who may hold them over until they can be exported or slaughtered.</P>

In fact, the butcher can buy them as long as he does not slaughter them before the date marked.  Some Deputies talked about free meat being degrading.  I think that matter has been dealt with sufficiently.  Surely if we have surplus meat, we ought in the first instance to feed our own people well and let them get a sufficiency of the good food we have in this country. The big complaint we have always had against Great Britain has been that in time of famine she allowed our people to starve while she was taking food out of the country.  I think if our people require meat, milk or anything else, we should give it to them first. Whatever means we adopt of giving it to them, at any rate they should get it.  Deputy Cosgrave says that there were only two classes to which this meat would be given.  Most of the other speakers thought that two were too many, but Deputy Cosgrave says we ought to have gone further.  If he can define any other classes to which free meat should be given, that would form the subject of a very appropriate amendment for the Committee Stage, and I suggest he should put down such an amendment.</P>

      <Col N="2162" /> Deputy Belton says that the cost of beef and the cost of feeding stuffs should be fixed.  His reason for that was that we had fixed the price of oats and barley.  Later in his speech, Deputy Belton said that there was a lot of cattle left over last year and he said it was not the rancher who had his cattle but the ordinary farmer. In fact, I have often said myself that it is people who keep cattle who do the most tillage.  That is what we are trying to do in all our cereals legislation&mdash;trying to make every farmer grow his own corn as far as possible. If a farmer with cattle has his own oats and barley, our cereals legislation does not matter in the least, because he is almost compelled, if he is to enter on it properly, to have sufficient oats.  He will certainly have enough corn for his cattle, therefore our cereals legislation will not affect him in the least.</P>

      <P>I do not say that.  I am not sure what the fixed price is going to be at all yet.  That is a matter to be decided.  On the whole there has been no serious criticism of this Bill. Nobody went so far as to say that some action was not necessary.  In fact I think every Deputy on the opposite side admitted that action was necessary in connection with our cattle by way of increasing prices and dealing with the surplus.  Some members of the Opposition did say that this Bill would not achieve its purpose and others, on the other hand, said that we were taking too many powers to deal with it.  Which of them to believe I do not know or on which argument they wish to appear sincere, I do not know.  Anyway, no constructive suggestion was made by which we could alter the Bill or achieve its purpose in any other way.  There was of course the usual suggestion to stop the economic war but Deputies only throw that out when they cannot say anything else.  There was no constructive suggestion of any kind. In fact most of the speeches were on the lines of Deputy McGilligan's <Col N="2163" /> speech.  Deputy McGilligan spoke on the lines that he always pursues&mdash; personalities, abuse, and destructive criticism.  Deputies opposite appear to be adopting the tactics of Deputy McGilligan, especially those of destructive criticism.  We should like very much to have constructive criticism.</P>
      <P>I should like to have some suggestions from the Opposition of a better way of dealing with the problem, or to have some suggestion put forward by which this Bill could be improved. I must say that not a single suggestion was made to me during the debate which would be a headline to me in framing any amendment.  Very often during a Second Reading debate a Minister takes notes of criticisms made.  He takes these notes back to his office and considers them and as a result he brings forward a number of amendments to the Bill.  I have not got a single note from the speech of any speaker on the opposite side which would suggest any amendment of the Bill because, I suppose, members on the opposite side were incapable of putting forward suggestions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a second time.&rdquo;  This is a measure designed to confer the legal powers required to carry out the experimental development of the industrial alcohol industry, of which the Dáil has already approved and for which the necessary funds have been voted.  The actual provision of the necessary money for the erection of distilleries, the purchase of plant and the carrying on of the operations of distilling industrial alcohol is not sufficient, because the Department has not got the legal authority required to enable it to enter into agreements and to undertake commercial trading in the refined spirit and, consequently, it is necessary to have a measure conferring these powers on the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It is also necessary, of course, in accordance with the general scheme, to take power to require, compulsorily, an admixture of industrial alcohol with petrol for sale as motor fuel in whatever proportion may be considered necessary, having regard to the consumption of petrol and the quantity of industrial alcohol available and at whatever price may be fixed, having regard to the cost of production.  One part of this Bill gives the necessary powers in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I outlined the general nature of the scheme on the occasion of the adoption of the Estimate I stated that it was intended to erect a group of five distilleries with one refinery plant and that the group would be located in the north-eastern corner of the Saorstát: in North Louth and in the adjoining counties.  Since then, however, certain investigations have been carried out, and as a result of these investigations a modification of that proposal is under consideration. It may be that, instead of proceeding with the original intention of erecting five distilleries and a refinery in the North Louth area, the refinery will be established in Dublin, which is the centre of railway communication, and the distilleries located partly in Louth and Monaghan and partly in County Donegal.  The Bill, of course, does not affect that position, but I think it is desirable that Deputies should be so informed.  That alteration of the plan would permit of an extension of the industry later, if it were so decided, by individual distilleries, rather than by groups of five, as was originally contemplated.  The refinery which it is proposed to establish in Dublin gives very little employment and its transfer from the area originally intended to the City of Dublin does not affect the interests of that area to any extent. The industry is one which does not, in <Col N="2167" /> any event, give a very large amount of employment, the benefits which it is expected to confer by its establishment being enjoyed mainly by the agricultural community that supply the materials for it.</P>
    <P>The Bill empowers the Minister for Industry and Commerce to undertake the manufacture, distillation and sale of industrial alcohol.  The Bill, as it stands at the moment, is slightly defective in so far as it does not contain any definition of industrial alcohol. That will be remedied by an amendment on the Committee Stage.  It will define industrial alcohol as &ldquo;alcohol which is of a strength not less than 50 degrees over proof whether de-natured or not.&rdquo;  Section 4 of the Bill is the operative section in respect of that part of it.  It enables the Minister to do all things necessary to construct and operate these distilleries: that is, to acquire land, to purchase materials for the buildings, to purchase or hire machinery, to enter into contracts for the supply of raw materials, to employ persons, to sell the spirit, and to do anything else necessary for the purpose of carrying on the distilleries as commercial undertakings. Sub-section (2) of the section authorises the Minister to enter into an agreement with persons who are experts in relation to this industry for the purpose of securing their advice and assistance to the preparation of plans, the preparation of contract forms and in the examination of tenders, the operation of the distilleries, the appointment of a manager and of biological engineers, including guarantees by the contractors in respect of the performance of the distilleries erected and the payment by them of penalties in the event of the distilleries having a performance less efficient than the plans contemplate, and so forth.  The various matters, which may be the subject of such an agreement, are set out in sub-section (2) of Section 4.  There is provision also for the payment to the persons with whom a contract is made of whatever fees may be agreed on in return for their services.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill provides special powers for the compulsory acquisition <Col N="2168" /> of lands and for the construction and operation of transport works.  That part of the Bill is similar to sections in corresponding measures, such as the Act under which the beet sugar industry is now being developed. Part IV of the Bill is the part which provides for the compulsory purchase of industrial alcohol by importers and refiners and is, I think, in accordance with the general description I have already given of it.  The operation of that part of the Bill will, of course, depend on a number of factors.  There is a market, admittedly a limited market, available here for industrial alcohol as such.  It is possible that the market may be expanded with the development of other industries in the country, but it is intended that a large proportion of the industrial alcohol to be distilled in these experimental plants will have to be disposed of as motor fuel, mixed with petrol in the same manner that industrial alcohol is mixed with petrol in a very large number of Continental countries at the present time.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill provides for the prohibition of the manufacture of industrial alcohol by any person except under licence.  There is included under that part also provisions for the establishment of an industrial alcohol advisory board.  Although the Bill as drafted confers the powers of establishing and operating those distilleries upon the Minister for Industry and Commerce, it is intended that those powers will be exercised on his behalf by the advisory board.  The legal authority and the legal responsibility will rest with the Minister, but the actual work will be performed by the board, which will consist of certain officers of the Department of Industry and Commerce, representatives of the Department of Agriculture, and outside technical experts.  There is power taken in that part of the Bill also for the sale of land, and for the sale of the goodwill, stock-in-trade, and other assets of the undertaking, if that should be necessary; for the laying before each House of the Oireachtas of a report on the working of the industry, for the payment of expenses in connection with the operation and <Col N="2169" /> establishment of the industry, and the disposal of the moneys received from the sale of industrial alcohol and any by-products.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it is necessary at this stage to re-state the considerations which prompted the Government to undertake this experiment.  We are aware that in a number of European countries the Governments have adopted various measures requiring the compulsory mixture of home-distilled industrial alcohol with imported petrol for transport fuel purposes, in order to provide an additional market for the agricultural products of those countries.  The position was examined here, and it was at first considered undesirable to proceed with the development of the industry on any large scale, because it did not seem, judging by the experience of Continental countries, that industrial alcohol could be produced here at a price which would permit of its incorporation with petrol for motor fuel purposes except by a considerable increase in the cost of motor fuel, or a considerable loss of revenue to the State.  As examination of the problem proceeded, however, it became clear that there were unknown factors in the situation, and that those might well operate so as to reduce considerably the price at which industrial alcohol could be distilled here, as compared with the price at which it was actually being produced in other countries.  Climatic and other conditions prevailing here seemed to indicate that it might be possible to establish the industry here under conditions which would produce a more favourable result than had been produced elsewhere.  Those matters were, of course, matters of assumption and speculation.  No one could say with certainty what the results would be unless and until some experimental development had taken place.  We decided that in view of the speculative nature of the enterprise it was desirable that it should be undertaken by the State, rather than that we should seek to enter into an arrangement for the subsiding of some commercial firm to carry out the experiment for us.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2170" /> When I say that the development is an experimental development, it is, of course, clear that there are many factors in relation to the experiment which are well known.  Potatoes are the raw material of this industry as we propose to establish it.  It is known that we can grow potatoes here with certain qualities and with a certain yield per acre for different varieties. The actual process of making industrial alcohol from potatoes is, of course, in no way experimental.  It is being done in many parts of the world at the present time.  The matters upon which we hope to gain information as a result of this experiment are firstly, the possibility of developing here a type of potato with a very high starch content, which would permit of a reduction in the costs of the raw material to the distillers, while at the same time giving an adequate return to the growers; secondly, the possibility of reducing manufacturing costs by reason of the fact that a longer campaign period may be worked in this country than is possible in most European countries. There are certain other matters also upon which it is possible to form at least the hope that the difficulties which had been experienced in relation to this industry in other countries will be less formidable for us, and that we may be able to get down to a commercial basis in relation to this industry.  As this experimental development stands there is not likely to be anything like a substantial increase in transport fuel costs in consequence of the compulsory admixture of the comparatively very small quantity of industrial alcohol that will be available in relation to the quantity of petrol used.  Also by reason of the fact that this development is being financed in a particular way the only items of cost that will come into account in determining the selling price will be those that are absolutely essential.  The position in respect of the transport users and the price they will have to pay for their fuel will not be materially changed as a result of this development, but on the experience gained from this development we hope to be able to determine whether or not it would be wise from every <Col N="2171" /> point of view to proceed with a much wider development of the industry than is now contemplated.  I do not know if there is any other factor to which I need make reference at this stage.  The matter has already been before the Dáil both on the occasion of the Supplementary Estimate at the conclusion of the last financial year, and on the main Estimate for the present year.  In consequence of the adoption of that main Estimate by the Dáil a considerable amount of work has been done in the preparation of plans, the examination of sites and the preparation of information in relation to the whole matter, but the actual work of proceeding with the development of the industry cannot be undertaken until the legal powers proposed to be conferred by this Bill are actually available to the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that this has been three times before the House.  It has.  On each occasion we got different statements as to the final cost of the production of a gallon of this industrial alcohol. The Minister first brought this up on 23rd February of this year, as reported in Volume 50, No. 7 of the Official Debates.  I am going to summarise what the Minister then said.  He said that we are going to have a number of small distilleries.  Potatoes were to be the raw material.  There was to be a production of what he at first said was 120,000 industrial gallons, but he later corrected that to mean per factory&mdash;600,000 gallons all told. Those are all to be in the Cooley area. Donegal can congratulate itself on having done so badly in the local election from the Fianna Fáil point of view as to have got some of the factories transferred.  We were told by the Minister that he was counting on using 25,000 tons between all the distilleries, and that the price for potatoes would be 35/- a ton.  &ldquo;Our calculations were made on the basis of an 18 per cent. starch content,&rdquo; although we have not heard whether the people who were then advising on the matter ever fulfilled the Minister's hope.  He was led to believe on 23rd February:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2172" />&ldquo;That it will be possible to introduce and secure the development of potatoes with a starch content of 21 or 22 per cent.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is also proposed that for a period, at any rate, the by-product of the alcohol, which is a cattle feed of considerable value, should be purchased from the distilleries at a commercial price by the Government and distributed to the farmers for use in cattle feeding.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Negotiations were going on and in the end we got a price fixed.  They were provisional figures.  We had brought in, of course, everything about a campaign season which the Minister referred to as one of the great assets, without explaining how he worked out the assets.  We had that in the provisional figures, and came to the amazing calculation that we could sell alcohol at present substantially less than the price at which it is sold in other countries.  Questioned on that the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The price at which we contemplate that industrial alcohol will be available, allowing for potatoes, labour, coal and barley will not, in our opinion, exceed 1/9 and 1/10.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I remarked that that was a little over one-half of what it has cost everywhere else, and I was told by the Minister that taking the yield of alcohol per ton of potatoes and the labour involved, &ldquo;we think it certainly can be produced well below 2/-.&rdquo; Later, on resuming after an interruption, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Taking into account that it is proposed to purchase from the distilleries at ½d. per gallon the cattle food produced as a by-product&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister tied himself there, certainly well below 2/- in one statement, to 1/9 and 1/10.  On 29th May, the Minister told Deputy Mulcahy: &ldquo;I am certain I never committed myself to 1/9.&rdquo;  After another interruption the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I made no prophecy on the subject.  I said that the purpose of the experiment was to find out how much we could do it at.  We hope <Col N="2173" /> to produce it at 1/9.  We may produce it at less.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the best the Minister could say, rather definitely 1/9 and 1/10 on 23rd February, but he had learned so much on 29th May that he wanted rather to avoid being tied to 1/9.  I spoke on the Finance Resolution and gave certain calculations and I will read briefly the answers given by the Minister for Finance, which appear in Vol. 52, No. 3, column 1124 of the Official Debates.  I had quoted from a report written by a certain professor, a chemist, &ldquo;who had been engaged in this particular industry 16 or 18 years ago.&rdquo;  I was reviled &ldquo;because I had no eyes to see that 16 or 18 years have passed since this professor to whom he refers was engaged in this particular industry, and that there have been 18 years of mechanical and chemical progress since then.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I notice in this Bill that there is to be an advisory committee set up, and that these people are to be paid.  I remember when the Minister introduced the Vote he talked of an industrial research council, and I understood that amongst that body was included this professor, who had been in the industry 18 years ago.  I suppose I can take it that he has forgotten more about this industry than the Minister for Finance ever knew.  He was 18 years at the business but was derided by the Minister for Finance.  I wonder if the Minister would say if that man was ever consulted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the subject.</P>

      <P>The article I quoted was written for <i>Studies,</i> a very weighty and learned publication, for March, 1934.  If the Professor had been eighteen years associated with the industry, at any rate he was thought so up to date as to be approached by the Editor of <i>Studies</i> as the only man actively associated with it from the practical as well as the scientific point of view. Let us pass on to this question of producing industrial alcohol at 1/9, and to the sugar content.  The Minister was full of hope that we were going to get a greater yield of potatoes to the acre and a starch content of at least eighteen per cent. hydrocarbide, and up to 21 and 22 per cent., at 35/- per ton.  An enormous yield was to be got for the specialised brand of tuber.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;My first impulse was to judge the whole product as so unfeasible <Col N="2175" /> as not to warrant further consideration. My opinion was based not on any doubt regarding the scientific aspect of the problem, which is perfectly straightforward, but on the cost of the product.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He goes through a lot of material and the various facts that have entered into the consideration of the calculations he made, the raw material to be used, and brings himself down after going through the wood and straw which he puts one side, after talking about molasses from sugar beet and about beet as a material to be used directly for industrial alcohol, to the potatoes.  The average yield here being five tons per statute acre,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With suitable selection of plant, proper manuring and tillage this figure, it is claimed could be raised to eight tons or even more per acre.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does the Minister stop at eight tons in his calculation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter can be easily decided.  The Irish potato contains about 14 per cent. of starch content. In this connection I note that the Professor puts all this as an estimate, as a calculation.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In this connection again experts claim that a different variety of potato could be grown which would give a much higher carbo hydrate content (18-20 per cent.).  Such potatoes might, on account of flavour, etc., be unsuitable as food, but would be eminently utilisable as raw material for fermentation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He goes on:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Under the best conditions therefore we might calculate eight to ten <Col N="2176" /> tons of potatoes to the acre with an average starch content of 18 per cent.  A ton of this material would give 24 gallons of absolute alcohol under practical conditions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister's calculation was 18 to 22 per cent.  There is not much difference between them.  The article was written in March of this year.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is claimed that such potatoes can be found in certain areas of this country at a figure of 45/- per ton. In any scheme of development we are assuming that the supply will continue at this somewhat low figure.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At the somewhat low figure of 45/-, and if the best conditions prevail, and if we get eight tons to the acre, and if we get 18 per cent. average starch content, he works out that the price is going to be something&mdash;and he says the low figure of 45/-.  The Minister thinks the farmers are going to be well satisfied with 35/- and that is what this is based on.  That is the raw material to start with&mdash;the potato producing starch&mdash;and the starch material then being sufficient to give as from the ton up a certain starch content for a gallon of this alcohol.  The Professor continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Some years ago the conversion of starch to concentrated alcohol was generally calculated to cost about 9d. to 1/- a gallon under the best manufacturing conditions.</P>

      <P>The Professor says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Let us assume an average figure of 8d. a gallon for conversion under the best conditions.  There is still another charge, namely, capital charges and depreciation, say, 3d. to 4d. a gallon.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He works out that the cost of the gallon of absolute alcohol at the factory is 3/-, and he continues:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;For the first few years the figure for production will probably be much higher than this: for it will take time to determine the best conditions for growing high starch yield crops in high concentration.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then he goes on to think of a mixture and he took a mixture of a gallon of absolute alcohol to nine gallons of petrol and following out these calculations of his and adding on merely a penny for bringing in the alcohol and petrol to the same place for mixing, he reaches the conclusion that if you have no selling charges in respect of the new mixture, over and above the charges for petrol at the moment, this mixing of one in ten will add on 4d. a gallon to the price of petrol.  That is what I might call his most liberal view of all this, and he sums up by saying:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Under proper conditions and using very modern fermentation methods, it should be possible ultimately to produce industrial alcohol from potatoes in this country at from 3/- to 3/6 per gallon.  This will <Col N="2178" /> require legislation to modify Excise laws.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And, of course, he does not take into his calculation at all&mdash;he alludes to it merely in order to put it aside&mdash;the point that if you produce, say, 500,000 or 600,000 gallons of this alcohol in the country and use it to mix, it means, with the present tax on petrol, that the revenue drops £20,000.  He let that pass.  That can be made up by something extra on beef or cattle or something like that.</P>
    <P>However, there is the account of a man who was, as I say, in charge of what, I think, was the only industrial alcohol plant which the exigencies of the war situation forced England to establish and he recommended, at the end of the war, that the factory should be pulled down.  As the losses were so great, he suggested that if it could not be pulled down quickly, it should be blown up.  Considering the whole thing with his scientific knowledge and with his capacity for bringing things up to date; showing in that article that he has read the most recent literature on the subject, because he refers to papers read before the Institute of Chemists in the early part of this year; having all the best conditions; and assuming that we will get what the experts claim with regard to yield and everything else, he says 3/- or 3/6 a gallon&mdash;at, of course, 45/- a ton.  We make a corresponding reduction if you are going to pay this 35/- a ton.  He considers 45/- and he is native of the soil.  Anybody who knows him will certainly say that.  He knows farming conditions and the conditions of the ordinary rural community here as intimately as any man can and he, in this article, thought fit to say that if this relatively low price of 45/- can be continued, you will get certain things.</P>
    <P>However, we are going to spend £100,000 on factories and we are going to have, in the end, as the biggest bait in the whole thing, the matter which the Minister decided to leave out of his calculations to-night&mdash;the 4,500,000 gallons of wash as a cattle food for the better propagation of the beef of the country for the better feeding of our enemies, the English, Professor O'Reilly <Col N="2179" /> speaks in this article of other countries which have gone into this business and he talks about its being carried on everywhere by subsidy.  He refers to an article written in <i>The Economist</i> of January 13th of this year.  I have quoted it already and I do not want to delay the House, except to say that the writer pulls out of the whole world situation two examples.  He takes the French situation and shows that there the cost of the subsidy, as between direct payment and loss to the State, amounts to 566,000,000 francs.  He takes a view of the American situation and he makes a calculation, showing it in all its details, that, producing from maize, as is the system out there, and producing so as to give them a certain percentage mixture, the cost to the State at the moment is 573,000,000 dollars.  To buy the maize which is used from the farmers and to burn it would cost the American authorities 275,000,000 dollars.  They incur an extra loss of 3,000,000 dollars on this performance.  The only thing that we can regard as satisfactory in our case is that it is on a very small scale and probably will not matter one way or the other, but it will be interesting to see&mdash;and it is the only thing one, can really be interested in following&mdash;what happens to the 4,250,000 or 5,000,000 gallons of this grand cattle feed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister dealt with the material from which he proposes to manufacture this product.  I am not going to go into the manufacturing processes or the cost of manufacture. I do not intend to go beyond the production of the raw material for the industry.  Does the Minister accept that the average percentage of starch in Irish potatoes at the present time is 14 to 15 per cent. and that, by selection of varieties, it might be possible to go to 18 or 20 per cent., and that it would be a high average to have potatoes available in this country with an average of 18 per cent. starch content? The Minister claims, if I heard his remarks properly, that we might be able to get a variety of potatoes to grow fairly prolifically in this country with a starch content of 21 <Col N="2180" /> or 22 per cent.  Obviously, it was not an accident which prompted the Minister to fix his standard price for potatoes of 18 per cent. starch content.</P>
      <P>On the face of it, it looks as if the starch content of 18 per cent. given by Deputy McGilligan as a good average was in the mind of the Minister when he fixed 18 as the percentage on which to base his standard price.  That being a high average, I take it that if the starch content does not reach that, the standard price of 35/- per ton cannot be given, or otherwise his whole costings are out of gear.  The Minister did not indicate&mdash;at least I did not hear him indicate&mdash;what price he would give, say, for 19 per cent. starch content.  The Minister will remember, when the beet factory was established, that for a 15½ per cent. sugar content there was a standard price for sugar beet and that for every one per cent. over that the producer got 2/6 a ton more.  I did not hear the Minister graduate his percentages of starch that the potatoes might yield. Taking the information we have that 18 per cent. starch content is a high average and as much as we can expect from the potatoes we are accustomed to grow, let us come down to price and see how the Minister is starting off; because all his expenditure to set up factories will be useless and his whole scheme will fall to the ground if he cannot get the raw material to run his factory.  He will not get the raw material unless a price is given that will induce people to grow potatoes for this purpose.  I am sure the Minister is not basing his figure on the off-chance of a bumper potato crop and a bad market for potatoes in the ordinary way so that they will be dumped on him.  There will not be a bumper crop every year and, in order to get his raw material, he will have to pay, on the average, a pretty stiff price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How does 35/- per ton compare as a remunerative price for potatoes?  I doubt if people in the ordinary way of growing potatoes average, say, 12 tons an Irish acre.  That would not be eight tons per statute acre.  Even ten tons a statute acre would be a very high average&mdash;an average that <Col N="2181" /> will not be maintained all over the country.  You can, of course, grow 20 tons per statute acre.  In Germany they have more than 36 tons per statute acre.  You cannot, however, grow 20 tons per statute acre at 35/- per ton.  Twenty tons per statute acre would mean £35 gross price.  It would cost more than that to grow them. You cannot broadcast potatoes and expect them to spring up like mushrooms. A potato crop is one of the most expensive crops to grow, if you except strawberries and crops of that kind. From the day potatoes are set until you pick them out you want men and horses in the potato field.  I can speak with a little experience, as for a number of years I believe I was the largest grower of potatoes in the Free State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>We could not go upon my average, because I seldom allowed my potatoes to mature.  I kept an eye on the market and sold them when it paid me.  The yield of the potatoes did not matter to me.  So long as the yield in money paid me I went for the money.  By sending out a half crop at the right time you will get three times the price for it that you will get for the whole crop when it matures and you have only half the cartage upon it.  My yield would not relate to the average yields.  When I allowed my crop to come to maturity I took 30 tons of market potatoes out of an Irish acre.  I only did that one year and that was in 1922, which was an exceptional year when we had a second growth and a double crop.  It would suit the Minister if we could have a second growth and a double crop every year.  Taking the average crop, I do not think that a fixed price of 35/- per ton for the present varieties of potatoes will induce anybody to grow potatoes for this particular purpose.  I am considering the matter entirely from the point of view of yield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking from the standpoint of agriculture and the supply of raw material to these factories, I would suggest that the Minister should <Col N="2182" /> seriously consider the growing of that type of potato that he mentioned that would yield a high percentage of starch, be a prolific yielder and not be suitable for table purposes.  All the points that he mentioned in reference to that potato recommend it for this purpose.  The first recommendation is that it has a high starch content and the second that it is a prolific yielder. The best recommendation, however, would be that it is not a good table potato and that it must be used in this way.  If potatoes suitable for the table are grown the Minister cannot rely upon a supply of raw material for this purpose when there is a small crop, as the crop unfortunately promises to be this year with the price keeping up to twice what it was at this time last year because of the shortage.  The Minister will have to double his price if he is relying on a potato which has an alternative market&mdash;for instance, the potato for table use.</P>
    <P>I doubt if it is a wise experiment for the Minister to embark on now.  When this was debated before, I also spoke from the agricultural standpoint.  I think if the Minister proceeded slowly and cautiously and co-operated with the Minister for Agriculture it would be more advisable.  He should devote one year to experiments in various districts throughout the country.  The committees of agriculture are available to carry out acre experiments in different parts of each county.  It costs nothing; no new organisation is required.  You have a trained staff there at the service of the Minister for Agriculture, and I am quite sure he would consent to allow these committees to carry out the experiments.  I am sure that the committees all over the country would loyally co-operate in carrying out the experiments as they did in 1925 in the case of sugar beet, and in 1926-27 in the case of the Yeoman No. 2 wheat. They could have a special type of potato grown.  An inspector could visit the plot, take a drill or two, and measure it accurately as was done in the case of beet.  In the case of beet they selected a drill or two, topped it and cleaned it and took it to the Department and analysed it for sugar content.  Why does not the Minister <Col N="2183" /> do the same with the potato in order to find out the yield per acre and the starch content?  He would then have some basis upon which to work.  If that potato leaves a margin of profit to the farmer, at 35/- a ton, it will suit the Minister for the purpose of this industrial alcohol factory.  He will then have some justification for spending public money, but now he has none.</P>
    <P>He has not a single material fact to put before the House.  He cannot show definitely that he will get potatoes at 35/- a ton.  He will not get them at that price.  He could not even bank on getting them at 50/- a ton.  If, however, through the medium of experiment, he grows a potato that will be suitable for this business but unsuitable for table use, then he may have some opportunity of purchasing at the price he mentioned, because the potatoes will have to go into the factory as they have no other outlet.  Of course he would always be able to get the rubbishy potatoes, the pig feeding potatoes, to help him out if he comes to a year when the potato crop would be a light one.</P>

It may be up one year and down another year.  There are people, including the very eminent professor whom Deputy McGilligan has quoted and who is, I am glad to say, actively co-operating with us in this experiment, who have expressed the opinion that the figures for the average yield shown by Departmental statistics are really inaccurate and indicate an average yield much less than the actual yield secured.  I would not have time now to detail the various reasons supporting that opinion, which is definitely held by various people.</P>

      <P>Possibly it might come to the point where the potatoes would be sold at more than 35/-, in which case I expect we will have to shift the distilleries elsewhere.  Let us take the case of Donegal, which is not a black scab area.  I will give you the price obtained in Donegal, and this represents the price for selected potatoes other than seed potatoes.  There is a variety called Up-to-Date and in 1932 the price averaged between 17/6 and 33/4.  One was the lowest price and the other the highest price.  For Kerr's Pink the price averaged the same, and in the case of Arran Banner the price was from 15/- to 25/-.  In 1933 the prices were somewhat higher, but the average price was well below 35/- in each case for each variety.  I mention these figures to indicate that there is no reason to anticipate that at the price I have quoted any difficulty will be experienced in obtaining a supply.  It is possible that a higher price will be obtained.  It is not yet possible to visualise all the factors that are going to determine the price. We do not know what it is going to cost to work the distilleries.  We have taken a figure which seems to be fairly accurate, but that figure may be considerably reduced.  On the other hand, if we manage to purchase the equipment reasonably and get the buildings on more favourable terms we may be in a position to reconsider the question of the price for potatoes.  There are many considerations which may, perhaps, permit of a higher price being paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection I might mention that it has not yet been decided whether the price will vary with the starch content of the potatoes.  It probably will not be decided for the first year or two, when those conducting the distilleries will be in a position to enter into contracts for the supply of a particular variety of potato.  It will then be possible to determine whether the price will vary with the starch content.  Deputy McGilligan, when quoting the article to which he has referred, was taking into account a number of factors which might enter into the selling price of industrial alcohol produced in France or America <Col N="2187" /> under the conditions operating there, but which, at least in respect to some of them, certainly will not enter into the price here.  I gave Deputies the information upon which our calculations are based.  We assume that to produce 22 gallons of industrial alcohol it requires 18 cwts. of potatoes with 18 per cent. starch content, 4 cwts. of coal, and 6 cwts. of barley.  Assuming the price is 35/- for potatoes, 20/- for coal, and 10/- for barley, we estimate the cost of the alcohol at 2/0½ per gallon.  There has to be added to that a certain additional cost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the alcohol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>You have not any conversion charges in that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The conversion charges are included.  You add a certain amount for transportation and for amortisation and we have to deduct the price obtained for the wash.  You get ten gallons of wash for every gallon of industrial alcohol and at ½d. a gallon that means a deduction of 5d.  We may get the alcohol at perhaps 1/9 or 1/10, but we do not anticipate exceeding 2/-.  If we get it at that price it will be possible, first, to secure the sale of a much larger quantity of the product as industrial alcohol than the present import figures would lead one to anticipate, and secondly, to make it available for admixture with imported petrol at a price which will not permit of any noticeable increase in the price of petrol, and possibly much lower than the price at which similar spirit is obtained for admixture purposes in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole thing is experimental.  It may work out much better than we hope.  It may work out much less satisfactory than we expect.  We have, however, taken all reasonable precautions and we have endeavoured to secure the information that would enable one to form some sort of a decisive opinion on the various matters <Col N="2188" /> upon which a difference of opinion might exist.  As a result of our calculations we decided it was worth while going ahead with the experiment, even though it may mean subsidising the industry for the time being until we have more definite information about it to enable us to come to a conclusion whether it is worth while developing in the interests of the agricultural community, whether its development would not proceed beyond the step we are now contemplating or even whether the whole project should be abandoned at some later date.  After two or three years we will be able to arrive at some definite conclusion as to which line is best.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister apparently has considered the cost of the alcohol, but he has not considered whether 35/- a ton will pay the farmer. Surely the Minister is not acting on the basis of the 17/- or the 15/- he has quoted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In these districts, for various reasons, the farmers have been growing potatoes in considerable quantities and they have continued growing them even though the prices they obtained were lower than the price we are proposing to pay in relation to this industry.  That is due entirely to conditions which are purely local.  What applies in Louth may not apply in North Monaghan, even though it is an adjoining county, and may not apply in Cavan.  Having regard to the type of potato that is required and to the fact that the potato most suitable for this industry is not of a very high standard, and having regard to the fact that the whole produce of the area can be utilised and not merely selected potatoes, I think it will be found that at the price I have mentioned it will be possible for the farmers in these districts to grow the potatoes at a profit.</P>

      <P>I hold that they are not going to produce an average of over ten tons to the acre.  At the price the Minister is quoting, that would amount <Col N="2189" /> to £17 10s. to the acre.  You cannot produce potatoes at that price&mdash;it is not economic.</P>
