      <P>asked the President if he will state how many newspapers since the establishment of the Government Information Bureau have had Government advertising orders cancelled by Departmental or Government direction; how many have had Government advertising orders withdrawn; how many have been threatened with withdrawal or cancellation of advertisements, the names of the newspapers so affected, the reason for the action taken, and whether any communication has been sent to the newspapers affected stating the reason for the action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the establishment of the Government Information Bureau in February last the Executive Council has had occasion in one case to take action of the nature referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The circumstances are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>On the 19th November the Government Information Bureau issued an official denial of a false statement which had been published in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of the 18th November to the effect that the Seanascal had received an invitation to the wedding of the Duke of Kent and Duchess Marina.</P>
      <P>On the 20th November the <i>Irish Independent</i> published the official denial, but added:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The <i>Irish Independent</i> is, however, in a position to state that an <Col N="1502" /> invitation to attend the Royal Wedding was received by the Governor-General.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In view of this contradiction of an official statement the Executive Council, on the same day, decided that Government advertisements and facilities for obtaining information from Government Departments should be withheld from all papers published or controlled by <i>Independent</i> Newspapers, Limited, until such time as a specific withdrawal should be published in the <i>Irish Independent</i> and in the <i>Sunday Independent.</i></P>
    <P>A letter to this effect was sent that evening to the Manager of <i>Independent</i> Newspapers, Limited.</P>
    <P>On the 27th November, in reply to a letter, the Manager of the firm was informed by letter that the following statement, if published without addition or qualification in a prominent position in the <i>Irish Independent</i> and <i>Sunday Independent</i>, would be regarded by the Government as a satisfactory withdrawal of the false reports which had appeared in those papers:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The <i>Irish/Sunday Independent</i> had what it believed to be reliable information that an invitation to the Royal Wedding had been sent to the Governor-General.  We accept without reserve the statement of the Department of the President that no such invitation has been received by his Excellency.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the 30th November an undertaking that this statement would be published as desired was received from the Manager of <i>Independent</i> Newspapers, Limited, and on the same day the prohibition order which had been made in respect of these papers was withdrawn by the Executive Council.</P>
    <P>I understand that there was another instance of the type referred to in the Deputy's question, but as action in that case was taken by the Minister for Agriculture, information regarding it should be sought from that Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the President if he would state how many newspapers have had these advertisements withheld from them.  Will the President deny that advertisements in connection with the wheat scheme have been withheld from papers in this country because they had independent views on wheat and wheat growing and expressed those views in the columns of their papers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already indicated to the Deputy that the Executive Council has had occasion to take action in one case.  Other action such as is suggested by the Deputy was taken by the Minister for Agriculture, and, as I mentioned in my reply, information regarding it should be sought from that Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I take an interest in what is done by all Departments, but there are certain duties performed by certain Ministers who are responsible to the House in connection with those duties, and I have indicated to the <Col N="1504" /> Deputy that information with regard to the schemes he has mentioned ought to be sought from one particular Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, as this is the season of Christmas, would an Irish Government not at least set as good an example as the British Government did 18 years ago by granting an amnesty to these prisoners and further, is he not aware that, in 1932, his predecessor, Deputy Geoghegan, then Minister for <Col N="1505" /> Justice, and the Minister for Finance, released prisoners from Arbour Hill informally and, perhaps, illegally?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Conduct of Cases at Military Tribunal.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that prior to the trial of Messrs.  Ryan, Harty and Johnston by the Military Tribunal, the members of the Tribunal were supplied by the Attorney-General with copies of the State counsel's brief; if he is further aware that objection was taken to this brief on the ground that it contained surmises by officers of the <Col N="1506" /> Gárda; Síochána and a great number of unsworn statements which were not and could not be put in evidence, and further, to ask the Minister what he proposes to do in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been brought to the notice of the Attorney-General and I am informed by him that the answer to the first part of the question is in the negative. The practice settled by the Constitution (Special Powers) Tribunal requires the Attorney-General to serve upon each accused a copy of the statement of charges and a summary of the evidence to be given against him and to lodge with the Registrar of the Tribunal copies of these documents. This practice was followed in the case mentioned by the Deputy.  An objection was taken during the hearing of this case to the fact that statements included in the summary of evidence were before the members of the Tribunal.  The President of the court overruled this objection and informed counsel that the documents in question were supplied to them by direction of the Tribunal.  As the Deputy is doubtless aware, the Tribunal has full and unqualified power, under the statute by which it is constituted, to settle its own procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider that it is very unfair to prisoners who are brought before the Tribunal that matters of conjecture, detrimental to the interests of the prisoners, should be supplied by the Attorney-General, or by anyone else, to the Tribunal, and is the Minister not further aware that if depositions taken before District Justices, who know the law of evidence, were allowed before a jury and if the jury were allowed to see them, a conviction by that jury would not stand for five minutes in the Court of Criminal Appeal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>That has been settled; it has been the practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider that, if that is the practice, the sooner the Attorney-General <Col N="1507" /> refuses to supply documents to the Tribunal for the purpose of prejudicing the Tribunal against the prisoners who are being brought before it, the better?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Deputy lay down that practice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>You did lay it down. You gave power to the Tribunal to accept evidence in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Evidence before the Tribunal must be on oath, and you are now supplying and, in this particular case, did in fact supply, as I know of my own knowledge, statements to the Tribunal which could not be verified in court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>We supplied to the Tribunal what we supplied to the prisoners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I might say that the practice followed is the same as the practice followed since the Tribunal first started its operations, and I do not see how the Deputy can expect me to decline to obey the ruling of the Tribunal itself.  As stated in the answer to the question, the practice is to supply to each accused person a statement of the charges and a summary of evidence.  Every effort possible is made to exclude from the summary of evidence anything which will not be admissible as evidence.  It may have happened in some cases that something did creep into these summaries which perhaps it might have been wiser not to have allowed in, but I can assure the Deputy that every effort will be made to exclude such things.  I cannot, however, refuse to file with the Registrar a copy of the charges and a summary of evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>But surely here is a particular case in which I have put a question and in respect of which the Attorney-General and the Minister for Justice can verify my statement, if they like, by seeing the documents, as I have seen them.  The same documents were supplied to the defence and they were absolutely teeming with <Col N="1508" /> statements which no attempt was made to prove and with guess-work and surmise by police officers detrimental to the prisoners.  I would ask the Minister, having regard to that fact and having regard also to the fact that the Military Tribunal in the finding they came to, which was not justified by the evidence, must have been prejudiced by these statements, will he not consider the question of releasing the men who were tried in this fashion, which I say was against justice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not have alleged that the Military Tribunal came to a decision which was not justified, as neither the Tribunal nor any other duly constituted court can have its decisions subjected to revision or discussion in this House, this House not being a judicial body, and having in fact no judicial functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is not open to me, according to the rules of the House, to comment on the finding of the Tribunal, I naturally obey your ruling, Sir, but I now ask the Minister that, considering that these men did not get a fair trial, owing to the fact that matter was supplied to them which could not be put in evidence, will he not consider the question of releasing the men in the interests of the administration of justice who were found guilty by the Tribunal?  Will the Minister not answer that question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I adhere to that&mdash; that the men did not get a fair trial because the Attorney-General supplied to the Tribunal statements of fact which could not be verified in evidence and a whole lot of guess-work by police officers and not a summary of evidence.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I resent this suggestion that the brief in the hands of Counsel appearing for me was handed to the Tribunal.  I have just stated what is the fact, that the document which was served on the accused &mdash;the statement of charges and summary of evidence&mdash;was all that was before the Tribunal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>There was much more than a summary of evidence.  Again and again, the Tribunal referred, when reading from it, to particular evidence and the paging was exactly the same as that in the brief supplied to the State Counsel and therefore, it must have been the same document.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that the farming community, without distinction of politics, feel that there is not an equitable distribution of the burden of the economic war as they believe that they are being forced to pay twice; if he will take steps to set up a tribunal under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, to investigate and report on the farmers' claim for equitable treatment and to <Col N="1517" /> suggest means of placing the burden equally on all classes, and if he will take steps to have the execution of decrees by the sheriff suspended pending the report of such tribunal.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, will he deny that the farming community supporting his own Party has put requests to him on substantially those lines?  In this question, I did not ask the Minister to accept my view, expressed in the question, as to what portion of the burden the farming community was bearing, but I put it to him that it was the belief of the farming community, and that it is worth hearing their case.  I do not want him to accept anything, but to provide machinery to give the farming community&mdash;the largest section of the entire nation&mdash;the chance and the right of being heard on a matter on which they consider that they have a distinct grievance.  I do not want him to accept that they have a grievance, but when there is such unanimity, regardless of political differences, that they are bearing an unjust burden, I would again ask the Minister if he would reconsider his answer and say that he is even now prepared to grant this tribunal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The administration of the Acts relating to school meals does not fall within my functions as Minister for Education.  The Education (Provision of Meals) (Ireland) Acts, 1914 to 1930, and the School Meals (Gaeltacht) Act, 1930, authorise local authorities to provide school meals for children attending schools, and, in the case of necessitous children, the cost may be met from the rates, with the consent of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  Such school meals are provided at present by the authorities of 42 urban districts, including the four county boroughs, and by the Boards of Health of the Cork, Donegal, Galway, Kerry and Mayo County Health Districts for the portions of these districts scheduled under the School Meals (Gaeltacht) Act, 1930.</P>
      <P>I am advised that milk is supplied in school meals in about 85 per cent. of the urban schemes, and is also used largely in the meals provided in the Gaeltacht districts.  Half of the cost of the food provided in these school meals is met by a State Grant (the School Meals Grant).  In addition, the Government have provided a grant of £100,000 for the provision of free milk for necessitous children under five years of age, and approved schemes for its distribution are in operation in 62 urban districts and in 27 county health districts.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will realise that the State has already incurred considerable liabilities in connection with schemes which tend to encourage the consump tion of milk, and in the circumstances I see no reason for taking any further measures in the matter.</P>

      <P>I think the amendment meets to a certain extent the difficulties which I pointed out during the previous stages of this Bill with regard to citizens of Northern Ireland.  I should like, however, to ask the President if he has got any definite policy with regard to this Bill as to what can be done to avoid the prospect of Irish citizens of Northern Ireland having to go to England to register in order to retain their Irish citizenship.  Perhaps, in the Seanad some amendment will be introduced which will avoid that.  I still insist that something should be done to avoid the necessity of Irish citizens, born in Northern Ireland, having to go to the High Commissioner's office in Piccadilly Circus to register.</P>

      <P>I am not sure that the Deputy realises the provisions that are made in this Bill to meet the situation which he has in mind.  First of all, people residing in the Six Counties on 6th December, 1922, were in the territory of Saorstát Eireann, as ascertained and defined by a judical decision. The next thing is that children of the first generation automatically become natural-born citizens of Saorstát Eireann.  It is only in the third generation that there is any need for registration and that registration can be done either in the manner the Deputy was indicating or directly here through the Foreign Births Register which is kept at the Department of External Affairs.  These are the provisions in the Bill at the moment and I think these are as ample as we are in a position to make.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment has been introduced in deference to the views expressed by the Opposition during the Committee Stage.  As it stood originally, it was suggested that the section was too wide, and when I pointed out that we had in mind, for the most part, minors of Irish association, it was suggested that we might make an amendment to <Col N="1530" /> that effect.  That is the purpose of this amendment that we are now proposing.</P>

      <P>(3)  A person to whom a certificate of naturalisation has been issued under this section may, within one year after attaining the age of twenty-one years, make and lodge with the Minister in the prescribed form and manner a declaration of alienage, and thereupon such person shall cease to be a citizen of Saorstát Eireann.</P>
      <P>The object of this is to enable a minor who might be naturalised on the request of one of the parents, to be in a position to exercise his own right when he comes of age.  We have in other cases some such provision, and we thought it wise to put in the provision here also.</P>

      <P>During the debate in the Committee Stage, it was suggested that there should not really be a time limit set. Of course, in five years, in any case, the person would be applying for a certificate, and would have full residence qualifications for naturalisation.  Consequently we decided that the time limit was not necessary.  I was rather anxious to have the time limit in order to give special privileges if applications were made immediately.  But in view of the opinions expressed here and on reconsideration, we thought it as well to omit that time limit.</P>

      <Col N="1532" /> In page 14, section 32, line 28, before the word &ldquo;Citizenship&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;Irish Nationality and&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the Short Title of the Bill it is proposed to insert the words &ldquo;Irish Nationality&rdquo; before &ldquo;Citizenship,&rdquo; not that we feel that there is a need for doing it, but it was suggested by the previous Attorney-General, Deputy Costello, on the Second Reading that we meant to make some point with regard to Nationality and Citizenship. Although my view with regard to it still remains the same, the word has no legal connotation.  At the same time to prevent any suggestion of that sort getting circulation or getting accepted, I think it might be wise to put the words &ldquo;Irish Nationality&rdquo; into the Short Title of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>This was said by Deputy Costello:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The words `Citizen and Citizenship' in relation to international law, are, I think, words that have only come into common use in connection with the subject matter of Nationality in fairly recent times.  It is rather inexact phraseology, from the point of view of public international law, to treat the subject of nationality as being the same as citizenship.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In practice, I think the modern tendency is to assimilate the nomenclature of citizenship with that of nationality, but, in public international law, the real thing is nationality, and this Bill deals, in my view, with something which is not really nationality, and this Bill is really not a nationality Bill at all.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the views expressed by Deputy Costello. I disagree with this amendment and I must oppose it.  I associate this amendment closely with what is now Section 30 of the Bill which purports to abolish, so far as Irish citizens are concerned, the common status possessed by <Col N="1533" /> every one of the King's subjects throughout the British Commonwealth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to say a few words about the principle and philosophy behind this proposal.  The President and his Party accepted here, less than two years ago, a motion declaring that voluntary reunion of the Irish Free State with Northern Ireland should be the principal object of Irish statesmanship, and that every other constitutional issue should be subordinated to that. Although they accepted that motion they have frequently acted in a manner entirely opposed to it.  In this Bill they act in a manner entirely opposed to it. They do so without the excuse of their achieving anything at all.  What they are putting into the Bill here is just words.  The President speaks as if he were saving this country from some form of degradation by declaring that it would be henceforth an impertinence for anybody to allude to us as British subjects.  If there is any degradation it does not consist in what people call you.  It consists in how you behave yourself.  The President is not proposing that measures should be taken to stop Irish citizens from taking advantage of whatever privileges are available as a result of our belonging to the British Commonwealth.  He is not even proposing, so far as I am aware, to make a patriotic appeal to them to refrain from making use of such privileges.  If he was sincere in this talk of &ldquo;impertinence&rdquo; and this implication of degradation, he, surely, would introduce some such legislation or make some such appeal.  He tells us that he proposes to change the basis of these privileges, that we are to have in future some sort of reciprocal arrangement&mdash;a reciprocal arrangement that can be made with any other country just as well as with Great Britain.  I venture to say that that statement was sheer humbug.  He <Col N="1534" /> knows perfectly well that there is no prospect of obtaining in any other country the privileges that we at present enjoy in Great Britain.  He knows, moreover, that he himself is not prepared to offer such privileges to other countries, nor is he, I take it, prepared to offer to Great Britain the full privileges for British citizens that are available for Irish citizens in Great Britain.  Even if he were prepared to keep the door on this side as wide open as they keep it on their side, he knows very well that a small and poor country like ours has got nothing equal in value to offer. I ask him to consider what the logical conclusion would be if he were to be taken seriously by the British.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 10 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  No person shall keep a dairy or produce or sell milk until he shall be licensed by the sanitary authority each year.</P>
      <P>(2)  The annual fee for such licence shall be fixed by the Minister in regulations made by him.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister had the unanimous support of the House when he put forward the intention of this Bill, which was, as he said, to render the milk supply of the country safe.  It seems no part of the public policy of the <Col N="1538" /> country to increase the consumption of milk.  The Minister and his colleagues must have some hesitation in pressing for an increased consumption of milk until the consumers have the assurance-that the milk is reasonably safe.  I believe the whole intention of this Bill is that milk should be made safe for consumption, and I believe it will go a considerable way in satisfying the public upon this point.  It is in the hope of making this measure more effective that I am moving this amendment. The principle of the amendment which I am asking the House to adopt is that all producers and sellers of milk should act only with the authority of an annual licence, issued by the sanitary authorities on such fee as the Minister may prescribe.  I notice that this recommendation, in a more definite form, was among the recommedations of the Departmental Committee that reported in 1928.  This is one of the recommendations of that committee, which is absent from the present Bill, and which is one of the two or three most important things that could find place in this Bill.  On page 31 of the report, paragraph 132, reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;All milk vendors in county boroughs and urban districts should be licensed annually by the sanitary authority personally and in respect of the premises used by them for trade purposes.  In the event of refusal of a licence a right of appeal to the District Court might be given.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is more limited in its scope than the amendment to which I am speaking. It refers only to county boroughs and urban districts.  At the time that the Departmental Committee made that recommendation it is probable that a much larger proportion of milk was produced in county boroughs and urban districts than is produced to-day and that there was a much larger consumption of milk.  If the licensing were confined to the shops and dealers situated only in urban districts it would be ineffective.  It is necessary, if our milk is to be safe, that the milk at its source should be under just as close supervision as at the point of sale; and the reason that this amendment <Col N="1539" /> is put forward is to render that supervision more effective.  There is, I know, registration of milk dealers at present, but one can hardly claim that the supervision under the present system is effective enough, even in those areas in which it has been relatively most effective.  The Departmental Committee, commenting on the Dairies and Milk Shops Order, made the remark that in rural areas the Order had failed in its object.  One must take that statement as meaning what it says.  The effect of my amendment would be the more efficient supervision of the production of milk in rural areas; and it is of the utmost importance, as was made plain on the Second Reading of the Bill, that the supervision of the production of milk is as necessary at its source as at its sale.</P>
    <P>It is clear that if a dealer or producer is to have his licence renewed each year he will be on his mettle throughout the whole year to avoid committing an offence, and will do his best to produce his milk in such a clean and healthy way that it will not be a danger to the community.  It is unfortunate that this has not been the result of the Order so far.  I think that the least that should happen to a man who is habitually careless, not to say criminal, with regard to the production of his milk is that he should lose his licence for a period.  This amendment is one of the recommendations of the Departmental Committee. Its provisions have appeared in print in recent months, and have attracted a good deal of public attention.  It is interesting to see that in the City of Cork, recently, the Deputies of that constituency were unanimously requested by an important body in that city to support this amendment as well as other amendments having the same purpose.  That shows that the people who are concerned with the health of a very important centre in the country recognise that such an amendment is necessary.  It shows that such an amendment is necessary if the Bill is to give our citizens the security to which they have a right.  I suggest <Col N="1540" /> that its addition to the Bill will not inflict any considerable hardship on the milk producers or milk dealers.  I have no doubt that if other health authorities, besides the health authorities in the City of Cork, had considered the matter in the same way, they would have come to a similar conclusion.</P>
    <P>I believe that in this amendment I have the approval of all those who have really concerned themselves with the question of the milk supply in relation to the public health of the country.  The medical officers of health with whom I have discussed it hold that it is not alone highly desirable but the best that could reasonably be expected, and I trust that all Deputies in the House, no matter to what Party they belong, will take the same view as those health authorities, both lay and medical, who have given the matter full consideration. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister will receive this as an amendment intended to help towards the solution of the supply of clean milk, and I can assure both the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary that it is in that hope that I am proposing this amendment. For that reason, I ask the support of all Deputies for it.</P>

      <P>I do not think that it is necessary to say much in support of this amendment.  It is an amendment that has been inserted with a view to ensuring, so far as is reasonably possible, the proper control of the production and sale of milk.  It is considered by the authorities, who have had experience in the administration of public health in important centres, that such a provision ought to be included in the Bill.  I do not desire to waste the time of the House any further, except to say that I think this is an amendment that ought to be accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Second Reading Stage of this Bill very strong representations have been made to me and to the Department in relation to the principle that is raised in Dr. Rowlette's amendment.  When the Bill was under consideration, and while it was in rough draft, so to speak, it was intended that the principle of registration should be incorporated in the measure; but at that time, or before the Bill came before the House, strong representations were made by the Department of Agriculture to the effect that the inclusion of the principle of registration and licensing of milk producers would involve undue hardship on a section of the agricultural community. There seemed to be some weight in the argument put forward at that time, but, in the light of all the facts that have been disclosed in the meantime, and the volume of opinion that is, undoubtedly, in favour of registration, I am inclined to the view that the incorporation of this principle of registration would be, certainly, an improvement, and I believe that the agricultural community can be safeguarded against any undue hardship under a system of registration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I do not think, from the amount of consideration that we have given this question since Deputy Rowlette's amendment has come under consideration, that the amendment before the House would be sufficient to deal with all the implications and complications of the principle of registration. The point raised by Deputy Burke as to the right, in the event of the refusal of a licence or cancellation of registration, of an appeal to the court is one that certainly ought to be incorporated in this system of registration. I am advised that to implement the principle involved in this amendment, we would require some 23 or 24 new sections in the Bill.  If this principle is accepted it would appear to be desirable that our Bill should be completely comprehensive and embrace all our legislation dealing with our milk.  I think that if the principle is accepted, the House would be well advised to discharge <Col N="1542" /> the Committee Stage, have the Bill withdrawn, and the measure redrafted. In the redrafted Bill it will be necessary to repeal Section 34 of the Contagious Diseases of Animals Act, and take all our powers relating to milk supply, production, supervision, and sale in one comprehensive measure. If the House wishes to adopt that course I am quite agreeable to it, and I believe that as a result of it we will have a better Bill.</P>

      <P>In view of what the Parliamentary Secretary has said, I do not propose to press the amendment.  I understand that he has intimated his willingness to accept the principle of it and to embody it in a new Bill.  I quite realise that my amendment, if accepted, would make it necessary that a number of consequential amendments should be inserted in this Bill.  It would be more satisfactory, I think, if these consequential amendments were drafted by the officials of the Department than that members of the House should prepare them in a hurried kind of a way.  In view of what the Parliamentary Secretary has said, I ask the leave of the House to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I should like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary if this amendment is accepted in principle will it mean that individual producers of milk, no matter where situated, will be put under the necessity of registering?  Would it apply, for instance, to milk suppliers to creameries in the various counties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will see from Section 2 that &ldquo;this Act shall come into operation on such day or days as may be fixed . . either generally or with reference to any particular purpose or provision.&rdquo;  Now, creamery suppliers are under fairly strict supervision at the present time.  The Minister for Agriculture and his Department have efficient machinery for dealing with the cleanliness of the milk supply to creameries.  I would be prepared to meet the Deputy to this extent: that while power to apply this to creamery suppliers ought to be taken in the measure, it ought not to be actually <Col N="1543" /> applied.  That portion of the Act ought not to operate unless in agreement with the Minister for Agriculture.  I think it will be a number of years before the general milk supplying section of the community is brought up to the standard of efficiency that we have already reached in the case of creamery suppliers.  In the case of those who produce and sell milk for human consumption, I would like to see their methods very considerably improved before we interfered with the creamery suppliers.</P>

      <P>In view of what the Parliamentary Secretary has said, I think we ought to leave the matter at that.  On the Second Reading of the Bill I did point out that there might be difficulties in the way of producers who supplied the creameries, in as much as there was already supervision in their cases through the Department of Agriculture. So far as they are concerned there is already supervision, and the point that I made was that if these people were to be made subject to the provisions of new legislation it might bear very hardly on them.  For the present, I am prepared to accept what the Parliamentary Secretary has said, that there will be a saving clause in any new Bill introduced to protect them from the necessity of registering.</P>

      <P>I suggest that the Minister ought to make a full confession of the sins of the Government in this matter.  It is no wonder that Deputy Belton is puzzled by the way in which the Government are trying to hide their sins.  What has happened is that the Government came into office in the beginning of 1932, and they said: &ldquo;Oh, the farmers were not getting a fair `do' at all.&rdquo; The farmers, who were in that year getting relief of rates on agricultural land to the amount of £1,948,022, were given another £250,000.  Then, in the following year, the Government said: &ldquo;Oh, we are going to take a lot of the money which we are spending on home assistance off your shoulders.&rdquo; They then took £448,000 back from the farmers without giving a halfpenny to relieve the burden of home assistance on the farmers.  Then they came along in the beginning of this year and they said: &ldquo;We are going to give you an additional £220,000 in relief of rates on agricultural land.&rdquo;  They did and they are giving it now, but it is a reduction of £228,000 on what the farmers were getting in the year 1932-33.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1547" /> They also dipped into the farmer's left pocket and they took out of the farmer's left pocket the moneys they were then giving them by way of bounty.  They took 5/- per head off the cattle bounty and 6d. per head off the sheep bounty.  So they pinched money out of the pocket into which they hoped, at any rate, the farmer was putting some of the bounty, and they put it into his other pocket by way of relief of rates on agricultural land.  In the meantime, as a result of the whole transaction, the farmers are losing £228,000 in the sum for the relief of rates on agricultural land which they had three years ago.  They are suffering as well a reduction of £220,000 in the amounts paid by way of bounties.  I think the Minister ought to tell us what he thinks of the adequacy, or otherwise, of the £470,000 which is provided here.  It points out that the Government has pursued a very vacillating policy in the whole matter of these grants.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the position of county councils has been going from bad to worse in the burden of their normal warrants for the year, and in the burden of arrears carried over from the previous year.  They are facing year after year a decline in their income.  It was pointed out here before that whereas in the year 1932-33, when the agricultural community had the full benefit of a grant of £1,950,000 for the relief of rates on agricultural land, the assessment for the year was £2,323,546.  Two years afterwards, this year, when they are getting £228,000 less by way of relief of rates on agricultural land, and £220,000 less in bounties on cattle and sheep, the total assessment is £2,963,982.  In other words, the assessment for the year has gone up by £640,000.  As the Minister is aware, at the beginning of this year they were facing a bill for £1,142,000 by way of arrears from last year, whereas two years ago they were only facing a bill for £435,000 in respect of arrears.  In the meantime, as between these two years, the year before the present Government took over and the current year, the receipts of the farming community <Col N="1548" /> for their export of live stock and live stock products fell from £27,186,000 to £11,400,000.</P>

      <P>As regards this grant of £470,000, we are told that &ldquo;such grant shall be so made by the said Minister by way of an increase over and above the supplementary grant under the Act of 1925&rdquo;&mdash;I take it that was £600,000&mdash;&ldquo;... and the additional supplementary grant in the Act of 1931.&rdquo;  I take it that was £750,000.  I would be glad to be corrected if I am wrong. There is reference also to the agricultural grant under Section 48 of the Act of 1898.  That was another £600,000, making a total of £1,950,000.  This section is empowering the Minister for Finance to pay another £470,000.  If that is the position that means £470,000 added to £1,950,000.</P>

The second one, if my recollection is correct, was voted here in the ordinary course.  Last year there was a deduction of £448,000 made on that.  It is on that deduction you are basing the plus £470,000.  I am quite sure Deputy Belton does not want to take undue advantage of the child in charge of the Bill, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. It is not his baby.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Not to make one at all? The origin of the agricultural grant was to enable the Government to meet a liability, not a farmer's liability, but a liability that prior to that time was met by the landlords.  It was never a grant to help the farmers.  It was a grant made prior to the 1898 Act. Broadly speaking, in connection with land tenure in this country the landlords met half the local rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>They were indemnified against that by the 1898 Act when the Grand Juries Act was abolished and their power was removed.  It was called an agricultural grant, but it was in no sense a present to the farmers.  It was a present to the landlords, if you like. The British Government took it on, and succeeding Governments inherited it. Had that condition of affairs continued, instead of the Government taking on the half of the rates, the farmers would have got each succeeding year not half the rate standardised in 1898, but half the rate of each year just as the British farmers obtained. In this country we did not get it.  In <Col N="1550" /> 1923 the British farmers got three-quarters of the actual rate on agricultural land and the Northern Ireland farmers got three-quarters of the actual rate on agricultural land remitted.  I think what prompted our late Government to double the agricultural grant in 1925 was they found themselves with some loose change in the till.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately I was not here then.  I hope the Deputy does not suggest that if we were there, there would be no loose change.  They decided because of the increased tariffs that it was only equitable to double the agricultural grant as a set off against the burden imposed through the increased tariffs on the agricultural community.  I think that prompted the double grant in 1925.  In 1931 a grant of £750,000 was made.</P>

      <P>I was there, but I will not go back again.  We are at 1931 now, very near home.  The Minister is aware that to raise £750,000 in 1931 there was a tax of 4d. a gallon put on petrol and a halfpenny a lb. on sugar. I would say that they raised for the Exchequer £1,100,000 or £1,200,000 to meet an expenditure of £750,000.  In addition, the Customs revenue in 1930-31 was £7,778,388 6s. 6d., and in 1933-34, £10,407,447 12s. 2d.  In face of those figures I submit that this sum of £470,000 should be at least trebled, if not quadrupled, and leaving the economic war out of it altogether, if <Col N="1551" /> things were normal, with that Customs revenue, entire derating of agricultural land would not place the agricultural population in as good a position as that in which they were in 1931.  All that the Minister is offering, over the 1931 figure, is some £20,000 or £30,000, and not £470,000, and I would suggest to him that it is not at all adequate to meet the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether it is on Section 6 or Section 8 the question arises as to the date of the introduction of this measure.  This measure ought, in all reason, to have been introduced last January and passed into law before March.  A series of steps has to be taken and, as I say, I do not know whether the question arises on Section 6 or Section 8. Section 6 says:</P>
      <P>Every council of a county shall, in the current financial year, make in accordance with this Act to every person rated certain allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a statute specifying the framing and the segregation of these allowances, and we have it in the month of December.  Most people know that the estimates in respect of the rates are made up about February, and the rate ought to be made at as early a date as possible after the 1st April. The Minister knows that, in the case of certain counties, no rates at all were collected during the first six months.  There are cases in which one can allege that the people have not shown any particular appetite for paying, but in respect of certain counties I have seen one of the rate <Col N="1552" /> dockets myself, circulated to the ratepayers on the third day of October informing the ratepayer that the first moiety is due, and payable, on, I think, the 1st June, and the second moiety was due, and payable, on the 1st October.  In times such as these, to demand, as will be demanded, payment within six months, or within seven or eight months, of the whole of the rate, is unreasonable.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, county councils were held up in the striking of the rate and in the making of these calculations, and, in addition to that, we have the anomaly of the circulation of credit notes in certain counties and not in other counties.  However, what I have to say on this is that if and when such legislation as this is under consideration, it ought to be introduced into the House in time to give no excuse to county councils to make a complaint against the legislature of the country in producing legislation for them in time.</P>

It is hoped that it will not occur in future, but it was unavoidable in view of the fact that these new statistics had to be compiled.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister say whether he has had any information as to how that employment compares with a year or two before? <Col N="1553" /> People were employing in certain places more men than they have employed recently.  If, when a man has reduced the number of his employees, through stress of economic circumstances, you come along now and give him a smaller reduction in his rates, there is no great inducement to him to employ them.  I am not quite sure, in the majority of cases of which I have heard, that, where people were disemployed, it was due to the actual necessities of the case, but I would put it that if we are anxious for employment, it is at a time when the maximum number are employed that people ought to be given the advantage.</P>

      <P>7.&mdash;(1) In this section&mdash;</P>
      <P>the expression &ldquo;the qualifying period&rdquo; means the period which began on the 1st day of April, 1933, and ended on the 31st day of December, 1933, and the expression &ldquo;adult workman&rdquo; means a male person who, on the 1st day of April, 1933, was not less than seventeen years of age nor more than seventy years of age and who was not and whose wife was not, at any time during the qualifying period, the rated occupier of agricultural land the valuation or the aggregate of the valuations of which during the qualifying period was equal to or greater than five pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  Where two or more adult workmen were successively at work on any agricultural land during the qualifying period and the respective <Col N="1554" /> periods during which such adult workmen were severally so at work are such that at all times during the qualifying period at least one of such adult workmen was so at work during the whole of the qualifying period, then and in such case (whether any two or more of the said respective periods do or do not overlap) such two or more adult workmen shall be deemed for the purposes of this section to be one adult workman who was at work on such agricultural land during the whole of the qualifying period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 49, after the words &ldquo;five pounds&rdquo; to add the following words:&mdash;&ldquo;and which agricultural land was not worked during the qualifying period by the father, brother, or son of such male person or by another male person not less than 17 years of age nor more than 70 years of age employed by such first-mentioned male person.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to see, where <i>bona fide</i> workmen are employed, the person who employs them shall receive the full benefit to which he is entitled under the Act.  It is quite possible that my amendment deals with a state of affairs which exists only in certain parts of the country, that is to say, the parts where the persons who work outside their own land for wages are very much the same class, and, in fact, are the same class, as the persons who work their own land.  In other words, there are no agricultural labourers so-called at all.  The sole persons who work as agricultural labourers are either small farmers or the sons of small farmers.  It does happen, in a good number of instances, that a man who has got a special adaptability&mdash;he may be a very good man with cattle, or something of that kind&mdash;may be able to earn twice as much in wages as the ordinary rate for agricultural labour in the district would provide. Suppose a man, because he is specially skilled in looking after cattle, or horses, or sheep, can get £2 a week, <Col N="1555" /> and has a holding of land himself over £5 in valuation, it is very much better for him to receive the £2 a week himself and to employ a labourer at, let me say, £1 a week.  If you change it about, and if the labourer, whom he is employing at £1 a week, were to work upon the other farm, he would not have the specialised knowledge and would be no use at all.</P>
    <P>Then, again, it happens in other cases that a man is, let me say, a specially good ploughman.  He is a rated occupier of land and he has a couple of brothers, or his father or someone like that, living with him at home and, in fact, working the land at home.  It suits the family economy very much better that this particular man should work off the land and that the other members of the family, who are not actually rated, should work on the land.  This is not entirely a theoretical question, because I may say that, to my own very certain knowledge, an employer in South Mayo has three workmen who have holdings of over £5 a year valuation.  If this Bill goes through in its present form this particular employer will, although they are <i>bona fide</i> workmen, lose the advantage that he would get from the employment of those labourers.  That seems to me to be very unfair.  I am perfectly aware that the insertion of this amendment in the Bill at the present stage might lead to very practical difficulties for this current year, because certainly I know that in my own county the demand notes were sent out very early, and the returns were made before 1st October.  In consequence, it would be very difficult to rectify the matter for this year.  I take it that this Bill is really only applicable to this current year, but I should like from the Minister an assurance that for future years the state of affairs I mentioned will be taken into account, so that where there is a <i>bona fide</i> labourer, whether or not he has a holding of £5 or a higher valuation, the employer will receive the benefit.  There can be no fraud in that connection, in view of the provisions further on in this sub-section <Col N="1556" /> (6).  I assure the Minister that there is a very real grievance in connection with this matter.</P>

      <P>On the section, the Minister tells us that the amount of money which will be used up in this employment allowance is £385,000. The Minister cannot have failed to observe the fall which has taken place in agricultural wages throughout the country.  They have fallen in Munster in the last two years by, I think, 3/-; by 2/6 in Connaught; by 3/3 in Ulster; and, I think, by 4/- in Leinster.  At any rate the average fall has been 3/3 over the whole country, so it is evident that the persons who are giving employment on the land are finding it very difficult to pay their employees. The average amount provided for under this Bill is about 25/- per year relief in the case of one workman.  I would ask the Minister if there is not a case for increasing the grant, based upon the necessity, at the present time at any <Col N="1557" /> rate, of assisting people who are giving employment so that they may pay better wages than they are paying at the moment.</P>
      <P>Sub-section 7 provides that it shall be the poor rate collector who will say whether or not any particular ratepayer is giving the employment he claims, and it is upon the poor rate collector's report that the council makes a decision.  I should like to ask the Minister whether he considers that a suitable machinery for deciding those matters.  I admit it is not easy to provide a machinery for doing it, but I should like to ask him if he has had any representations or if he has seen any difficulties arising out of the fact that this additional duty is put upon the rate collectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had no representations, and it is assumed that if the system were unsatisfactory we would have had representations.  In any case, the council can rectify any mistake which may be made.  If a wrong report is given by the rate collector, the ratepayer is not going to lie under it; he will make representations and get the matter rectified. We have not had any complaints so far.</P>

      <P>This is one of the sections which I referred to on the Second Reading.  As Deputy Cosgrave has said, this comes somewhat late in the year for criticism.  It is at least clear that there is no allowance for women employees, and, as I already stated in the House, in many counties &mdash;notably in the dairy counties&mdash;there are as many women employees as men, many of them doing work which it would be difficult for men to do.  The Minister in his reply on the Second Reading said that the policy of the Government was to encourage male labour as against female labour. Another Department of the Government&mdash;if one can call the Revenue Commissioners a Department of the Government&mdash;gave the very opposite advice to farmers.  They told them that they ought to employ women; I will not say at what wages.  At any rate, the current rate of wages paid to women for work on dairy farms in the South is practically the same as that paid to men.  Almost every individual dairy farmer who has a farm of any size or employs any labour at all has one or more female workers, for whose wages he gets no allowances in his rates.  That is not an equitable way of treating the dairy farmers as compared with other farmers.  I would ask the Minister, when proposing regulations for the coming year, to make some provision for dairy farmers, and to see that they get at least a fair crack of the whip with regard to the reduction of rates or to any allowances that are given to other farmers.</P>

Every suggestion that has been made will receive consideration.  I do not think it is likely that there will be agreement to put women on the same basis as men.  A woman may be working about the house for six months, and at harvest time or for milking purposes, she may be engaged on the land.  There are difficulties about the question.  I do not think it will be easy to say when a woman is actually engaged whole time at farm work.  It is hoped that more employment will be given, as a result of these provisions, at whole time adult work.</P>

      <P>I dare say there were other reasons.  There is no difficulty in ascertaining the numbers.  The fact is that hundreds of women are engaged on farm work in County Dublin.  As these women never work at anything else, with the exception of fruit growing, the tendency in County Dublin will be to employ women. Heretofore, the tendency was to employ fewer women, but now the tendency is to increase the number of female workers on the land, especially on fruit farms and on land that is going under glass.  While I think there should be no distinction made, the allowance given for intensive farming of that kind will be absorbed by male workers.  The question of women coming in does not amount to everything. I employ about 30 women and if I could get an allowance for them it would not amount to much, as I have sufficient men employed to cover all the allowance I get.  This proposal will not affect the position very much in County Dublin, if at all.</P>

      <P>I think this section deals with the figures that the Minister was asked for some time ago.  There was a sum of about £600,000, and in 1925 another sum of £600,000 which was looked upon very much in the nature of a grant, as far as the agricultural community is concerned, no matter what way farms were managed. There was then a grant of £750,000, practically on the same basis.  An examination of the two grants of £600,000 shows that they practically absorbed what is called the primary amount. The sum at the disposal of the Minister now, as relief for ratepayers who give employment, amounts to approximately £3 per person employed.  There are about 130,000 persons affected, and there will be £10,000 short of the £380,000 required.  It is a small sum, if the intention is to increase the number of persons engaged in agriculture. I understand the policy of the Bill is to segregate what is granted rather than to give an additional sum which would stimulate the giving of employment. I do not wish to make a Second Reading speech, but it is advisable to refer to the statements of many Ministers, and some of their supporters outside, about the condition of agriculture. If ever there was a time when some assistance should be given to those who give employment, now is the time.  If there is any money available for the relief of ratepayers, it ought to <Col N="1561" /> be given now so as to offer them every possible inducement.  The sum involved amounts to about £3 per person. That was the amount formerly given as a bonus by employers, and was known as &ldquo;harvest money&rdquo; in County Dublin.</P>

      <P>Dublin is one.  I am not speaking <i>ex cathedra</i> now, but I am under the impression that you may break the demand notes under Sections 13 and 14, even if they were passed into law.  The principle in respect of municipal finance is that a ratepayer has a life of 12 months; he is taxed for the 12 months.  He is only supposed to bear liabilities for that 12 months.  Let us assume that a ratepayer is unable to discharge his liability before 1st April next year, and there is a credit note outstanding. He will not get the credit of that and the discharge of his liabilities in connection with the rates will mean that he will pay more than that for which he was originally served with notice. That is bad.  I think that this whole credit note arrangement is a wrong one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take another side of the question.  A man, through misfortune or any reason you like&mdash;perhaps he cannot sell his cattle or he has other liabilities to meet, or something of that sort&mdash;is unable to meet the rates by the 31st March.  He incurs a liability of £1 or £2, as the case may be, over and above that for which he was legally liable before.  That is wrong.  The Minister will admit that it is the hard-pressed individual who will be hardest hit in this case.  Assuredly, it was never the intention to make it severe on those persons.  It is quite true that, in certain cases, in order to get the advantage of the credit note, people will pay in time, but one must have the means in order to do that.  Everybody will admit that for the last couple of years a rather unusual effort had to be made by agriculturists to meet their liabilities in this way.  The point I want to make arises rather on Section 14 than on Section 13.  I think all this credit note business should be wiped <Col N="1563" /> out and that these unfortunate people should have an opportunity to cash their credit notes sometime at any rate after the period.</P>
    <P>There is another point in connection with this.  Every single one of these restrictions and regulations puts extra work on the staff of the local authorities. If there is one person more than another who had to earn his money during the last couple of years it was the rate collector.  A docket is issued.  If it is not credited in connection with the payment, if there is an extension of time, the unfortunate ratepayer must make a pilgrimage to the rates office, if the Minister out of his bounty will extend the time, and hand in his docket and get the cash. All that means waste of time.  In these strenuous days there ought not to be any waste of time or energy, and I put it to the Minister that he should reconsider the whole question of credit notes.  Personally I am against them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <P>I should like to associate myself with Deputy Cosgrave in asking for the withdrawal of these credit notes altogether.  This is not our first experience of credit notes, as in some counties there were credit notes for a limited amount last year. It was a notorious fact that very many farmers were at a loss through the credit notes expiring on 31st March. In fact, I know a couple of cases in which there were genuine mistakes and <Col N="1564" /> farmers who had paid previous to 31st March never got the money back which they ought to have got.  The same thing may occur again.  I have spoken of the difficulties of the dairy farmers and the injustice to them of not getting relief for women employees.  There is an added injustice in this case.  Dairy farmers get their income principally from the sale of milk.  The particular period when the credit notes will be expiring is the time when dairy farmers will have no resources whatever. They will get their first cheque for milk about the end of May.  In fact, the first cheque that will be of any account will not arrive until July and, therefore, they will have nothing to meet the rates.  If this system of credit notes is adhered to stringently, it will mean that the bulk of the ratepayers in the dairying counties will find themselves unable to pay the rates in time and will, therefore, lose any benefit which they would get from the credit note.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have to say on this would be more applicable to Section 14, but as the subject has been raised now perhaps I might speak on it.  The circumstances under which the Dáil met on Friday and to-day prevented me from putting down an amendment for the Committee Stage to delete certain words in Section 14 restricting the use of the credit note, and I should like to bring in on Report an amendment to delete these words.  I think if the credit notes are used they ought not to be used in such a way as will discriminate against people in a certain county and put them under a disability that people in another county are not under; nor, in view of the Minister's experience in regard to the working of these credit notes and the collection of rates last year, is it reasonable that on some, and those, to a large extent the hard-pressed portion of the community, the disability of these credit notes should fail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands in the House. I do not know whether he was a member of the Clare County Council last year.  At any rate, he is close <Col N="1565" /> enough to the Clare County Council to realise the position in which they found themselves as a result of the year drawing to a close without all the rates being collected.  If we take the County Clare we find that the unfortunate people who were not able to pay their rates by the 31st March were deprived of the benefit of these credit notes and that unfortunate rate collectors who, in an endeavour to save their own position, paid up the full amount of the rate for certain ratepayers, hoping to get the rates from these ratepayers, did not get the advantage of the credit notes.  Again &mdash;I do not know whether it happened in Clare&mdash;we have the position that a man who goes security for a rate collector and is called upon to make up the rate for any particular year will only be called upon to do so after the close of the financial year, and, if it happened in Clare in respect of the year 1933-'34, that unfortunate person would have lost the amount of money that the credit note represented.</P>
    <P>Last year the total amount that might have been covered by the issue of credit notes was £250,000.  This year it runs to £1,558,000.  If the issue of credit notes is general this year, then there is going to be a very serious situation for many people.  The total amount of the credit notes which it was possible to issue last year was about 1/12th of the total warrant; but, in view of the fact that some counties did not issue credit notes, that is probably too big a percentage. Credit notes were issued in Clare, however, and the total amount of rates outstanding at the end of the year was £51,000.  I submit that 1/10th of that was covered by credit notes and that, therefore, £5,000 went waste on some unfortunate ratepayers and rate collectors and was used for the advantage of the whole county during the current year.  For that reason I think, with the present position of the rate collection and the difficulties arising in connection with credit notes, that we should carefully consider this question. Credit notes have been issued this year, and I submit that these credit notes should be realisable whenever the rates are paid.  We ought not to have collectors, <Col N="1566" /> their sureties or the ratepayers in the position in which some of them found themselves last year.</P>

      <P>We attempted a couple of times during the passage of the Bill through the House to get some explanation of the vacillating policy with regard to this grant.  I should like to ask if the Minister for Finance has any statement to make on the matter.  We have pointed out that up to the time the present Government came into office the line taken by their Party was that the farmers were not getting sufficient assistance.  They voted £200,000 additional in relief of rates.  They did that at a time when the total assessment was £2,323,000, when the arrears of rates in the previous year were £432,000, most of that having been collected before the warrant was issued, so that arrears amounting to only £129,000 were included in the warrant.  Next year, the farmers suffered a reduction of £448,000 in the amount voted by the Government for the relief of rates.  That year, the assessment rose by £650,000.  The county councils had to budget for £2,972,000.  At the end of that year arrears of rates had gone up by £100,000 to £542,000.  This year, the Ministry reversed their tendency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1571" /> Whereas, in the second year, they cut the grant by £448,000, now they are restoring £220,000.  While restoring that £220,000 they are putting their hands into the farmers' pockets and taking an equivalent amount, by reduction of bounties, to the extent of 5/- in the case of cattle and 6d. in the case of sheep.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In the year in which they are doing that, we find that the total assessments of county councils amount to £2,963,000, practically the same as last year.  They do that in a year in which the county councils, with that very heavy assessment, have unpaid rates to the extent of £1,442,000.  As I said before, the income of the people from live stock and live-stock products has fallen from £27,000,000 in 1931 to £11,000,000 in the current year.  Already, the very small wages of agricultural labourers have suffered a reduction throughout the country of 3/3.  None of the Ministers &mdash;the Minister for Local Government or his deputy to-day or the Minister for Finance, who introduced this Estimate&mdash;has said anything on the subject of the unfortunate people whom he is supposed to be assisting by this vacillating policy.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Estimate is to provide funds to give effect to the proposals contained in the Bill which the Dáil has just passed. Having passed a Bill of that sort, the Dáil would stultify itself if it did not give the Government the wherewithal to make the Bill effective.  I presumed that the debate on this Estimate would be confined to the question as to whether or not the proposal to grant £470,000 was within the terms of the legislation.  Accordingly, I did not feel it necessary, when introducing the Estimate, having in mind the Bill which the Dáil had just passed, to deal with the question of de-rating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy who has just sat down made a number of statements which <Col N="1572" /> are inaccurate.  He said that this year we had decreased the amounts for bounties and subsidies.  I am afraid the Deputy suffers from an affliction which, I think, is called amnesia&mdash;blanks in the chain of thought.  It is only a fortnight ago since the Deputy took part in a prolonged debate on a Supplementary Estimate the purpose of which was to provide an additional sum of almost £750,000 for bounties and subsidies. The original vote for agricultural subsidies and bounties was either £2,148,000 or £2,150,000 and that represented an increase of almost £300,000 on the amount actually paid in respect of agricultural export bounties and subsidies for the year ended 31st March, 1934.  In addition to that sum of about £2,150,000, the Dáil, as I have said, no later than a fortnight ago, passed a Supplementary Estimate for £750,000.  That will make £2,900,000 which, on the assumption that the whole of the money will be spent, represents an increase of £1,100,000 in export bounties and subsidies to be paid this year over and above what was paid last year.  In face of that, Deputy Mulcahy has told the Dáil that, having increased the grant in relief of rates on agricultural land this year, we have concomitantly reduced the provision for export bounties and subsidies.  If the Deputy had the facts before him, I do not see how he could have made a statement of that sort.  As I have already pointed out, the House fully discussed the principles underlying this question of the agricultural grant on the Bill which we have just passed.  The conclusions of the House are expressed in that Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister has only reminded us of further vacillation on the part of the Ministry.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health started the local authorities on their work last year with an announcement upon this subject. In the Press of the 17th February certain information concerning agricultural grants was announced in an official communication from Government Buildings as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1573" />&ldquo;The Government has announced its decision to increase the agricultural grant from 1934-35 to the amount necessary:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  to give relief on the first £20 of the valuation of agricultural holdings at the same rate as was given on the first £10 in 1933-34, and, secondly, in the case of holdings of over £20 valuation to give relief on an additional £12 10s. 0d. of the valuation in respect of each male worker, including relatives of the occupier, between the ages of 17 and 70 permanently employed on the holding.  The original proposal for 1934-35 provided for relief on the first £10 of the valuation and on an additional £10 in respect of each male worker over 18 years of age.  The alteration in the scheme is estimated to cost £220,000, bringing the total amount of the agricultural grant to £1,970,000, the increase to be made good by a reduction of bounties on agricultural exports.  The increase, bringing the total amount of the grant to £1,970,000, is made good by a reduction of bounties on agricultural exports.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The official announcement goes on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government has also announced that after the 31st March the bounty on the export of cattle shall be reduced by 5/- per head, and the bounty on the export of sheep and lambs by 6d. per head.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has addressed himself to the additional moneys provided for subsidies to the farmers, driven to the dire circumstances in which he finds the agricultural population. Here we are concerned with the county councils, the financing of their work and the carrying on of important local services.  We ask the Minister, who has run away from the position he took up in April or May last, has he no care for the position of local government in the country, knowing, as he does from the returns of the rate collectors, the condition of those services? Has he gone any way to meet the local bodies, many of whom are unable to pay their accounts, their home assistance and their various contractors?  I ask the Minister, pressed by circumstances <Col N="1574" /> of his own creation, since he is coming to the assistance of the farmers with this miserable type of aid and the provision of additional bounties, is the local government going to trudge along without any further financial assistance?  He knows that, at the end of last year, there was more than £1,000,000 outstanding in rates.  He knows that the councils this year were merely collecting old debts, that they are now only beginning to collect on their present warrants and that they are likely, at the end of this year, to be in a worse plight than they were at the end of last year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The necessity for this Supplementary Estimate arises from a considerable increase in the volume of work that the official arbitrators have had to do in connection with the assessment of compensation in cases arising under the Acquisition of Lands (Compensation) Act of 1919, as a result mainly of the number of compulsory purchase orders made by local authorities under the Housing of the Working Classes and Labourers Acts.  The Act of 1919 provides that all questions relating to disputed compensation for land acquired compulsorily by any Government department shall be referred to one of the panel of official arbitrators appointed under the Act.  This panel of arbitrators is appointed by a Committee of Reference, consisting of the Chief Justice, the <Col N="1575" /> President of the High Court, and the Chairman of the Surveyors' Institute. The terms of remuneration and conditions of service are settled by agreement with the Minister for Finance and the Committee of Reference.  Under the pressure of business to which I have referred, it has been necessary, in addition to the arbitrator who acted for a number of years past, to appoint two additional arbitrators upon a part-time basis.</P>

      <P>The items under sub-heads a (2) and a (3) deal with travel and incidental expenses, which have arisen largely because of extra expenditure in connection with the National Museum. Last year a certain number of excavation schemes were conducted throughout the country.  Although the Board of Works is primarily responsible, the practical cost of the schemes being borne on their Vote, certain additional expense fell upon the Museum by reason of the fact of increased travel and subsistence allowance and certain other provision had to be made for some of the officers.  The item a (3) also includes certain incidental expenses in connection with the National Library. With regard to item b (3), we are asking for £280 extra in connection with the production of the English-Irish <Col N="1576" /> Dictionary which has been in the hands for some years past of Father MacKenna as editor.  The editor had anticipated that when the book reached the stage when it would be ready for printing he would be able to dispense with the aid of his assistants; but now he finds it desirable to retain the services of his staff, at least until the first stage of the printing has been completed.  The dictionary is at present being printed and we hope to have it ready for publication in May next.</P>
      <P>With regard to b (6)&mdash;Production of a Sound Film in Irish&mdash;the small additional sum for the production of a sound film (or &ldquo;talkie&rdquo;) in Irish is required to defray certain expenses incurred in the present financial year. The production of the film would have been very much more expensive had we undertaken the work ourselves, but through the collaboration of Mr. Robert Flaherty and the Gainsborough Film Company we were able to get it produced at a comparatively small payment of, I think, £100.  The expenses incurred in the present financial year included the cost of a visit made by a representative of the Department to London to advise in the cutting of the film, the payment of a royalty of £20 to British Acoustics, the purchase of a second copy of the print and some other expenses.  It is anticipated that the £60 we are now looking for will cover all the expenses in connection with the film.  It is hoped to have arrangements completed soon, that the film will be on exhibition early in the new year and that schools and teachers will take the opportunity to see it.  I should add that we hope to have some receipts out of the production of the film throughout the country.  Out of any receipts that are obtained from the hire of the film, two-thirds will go to the Department and one-third to the distributors who arrange, on behalf of the Department, for its exhibition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-head b (7) represents the refund of college fees and payment of arrears in respect of a young man who was a former student of the College of Science. The provision is intended to enable the Department to refund fees to this young man and to pay the balance of his scholarship.  This student's course <Col N="1577" /> was interrupted owing to his arrest and imprisonment in 1922.  He held a scholarship which entitled him to free instruction and to a maintenance grant of £66 per annum.  When he came out of prison and desired to return to the College, he was refused the unpaid balance of the scholarship (£36 13s. 4d.) and was, in addition, required to pay the usual college fee of £20.  The unpaid amount, plus the additional charge, is now being refunded to him. No charge was made against him at the time, and, in view of the general policy of the Government, I consider&mdash; and the Minister for Finance agrees with me&mdash;that we should refund this amount.</P>
    <P>The most important sub-head is sub-head b (8)&mdash;the Irish Folklore Commission. The Government has been of opinion for some time that an organised effort should be made without delay to collect as much as possible of the remnants of our folklore, especially the oral literature in the Irish language which is being gradually lost on the death of the older Irish speakers in the Gaeltacht.  After careful consideration it has been decided to establish a commission and to give this body as wide a discretion as possible in the work assigned to it.  We hope to have the assistance of the Folklore Institute as members of the new commission, and to strengthen that body by the addition of some others, including representatives from the Departments of Education and Finance. It is not proposed to interfere in any way with the useful work at present being done by the Folklore Society of Ireland.  On the contrary, the new commission will be authorised to make a grant of £250 to the society to assist in the advancement of this work.  The intention is that it should be aided as far as possible in the work of publication. A great amount of matter has been collected already but not published, and this £250 will be utilised, it is hoped, in order to increase publication. It is proposed that a sum of £3,000 per annum be placed at the disposal of the commission for a period of five years&mdash;in addition to the sum of £250 already mentioned.  From this sum the commission will be required <Col N="1578" /> to defray all expenses in connection with its work.  The intention is to establish a Grant-in-Aid, so that the expenditure will not be subject to the audit of the Comptroller and Auditor-General nor will any unexpended balance be surrendered at the close of the financial year.  We hope, therefore, to give the fullest possible discretion to the new commission in pursuance of this work, and the present Estimate of £813, which I am asking the Dáil to pass, is based on the belief that the commission will be able to start work by the 1st January next.</P>

      <P>There is another question I should like to ask the Minister.  There was a suggestion some time ago that a small vocabulary should be published, based on the experience of the Dáil Translation Staff; in other words, that it should be based entirely on the language used for the purposes of translation of our Acts and regulations.  I think that the reason that was not gone on with was that it was suggested that a considerable amount of the words used in connection with these Acts and regulations would be matter used in this English-Irish dictionary.  I should like the Minister to tell us whether the nature of the new English-Irish dictionary is such as to interfere with or prevent the publication of a small volume dealing with the technical language as it is used in the preparation of the various Acts and regulations.  Personally, I can imagine an ordinary English-Irish dictionary being very much encumbered with a lot of the matter that has found itself in our legislation; while, on the other hand, I can see that it would be most valuable to have a small separate publication that would deal with the technical matter of these Acts.</P>

If so, I should like to know in whose hands will the control of the work be.  I understand that the Minister has not yet appointed the full commission; but if there is a temporary commission acting at the present time, I should like to know from the Minister who constitute that body and also who is the chairman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the latter point, the control and planning of the work of the commission will be the responsibility of the director.  He has not actually been appointed, although I think the Deputy is probably aware of who he is.  He will lay out the general plan and the commission will have a certain general supervision. The intention is, however, that the director should be responsible for the work and that he should be given the fullest latitude in selecting his field workers and laying out his programme. It is proposed that the £813 should be spent on new work and not on work that is being done at present.  In connection with the new work of the Folklore Commission, I think that a number of workers will be taken on to collect material through the country, and that they will practically have to be appointed whole time.  That will account for the largest part of the expenditure of this £3,000.  There will be other incidental expenses, but I think the main expenditure will be in connection with the appointment of workers through the country who will practically have to be full time</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the dictionary, I do not know what the position is with regard to the technical side.  I think the opinion was held, and that the Deputy is correct in stating, that the feeling was that we should hold over the question of a dictionary appropriate to the needs of the Oireachtas and folklore until such time as the <Col N="1580" /> large dictionary was completed.  I can promise the Deputy that I will go into the matter again.  I think it was arranged provisionally, but it may not have been done so far, to make the existing folklore and the Parliamentary terms available at least to members of the Oireachtas in the Dáil library.  We doubt whether it would be worth while publishing the existing terminology which has been classified and is in typescript. A certain number of copies can be made available.  It is extremely bulky as the thing is in typescript.  We did not consider that it would be useful to print the classified dictionary of Parliamentary terms until an opportunity had been given to re-edit this, but we can make it available I think to members of the Oireachtas.</P>

    <P>This Supplementary Estimate is required on account of the extra expenditure falling on the Civil Service Commission in connection with the abnormal recruitment of Civil Service staff not foreseen at the time the original Estimate was prepared.  The legislative measures of the Government have necessitated expansions of staff in most Departments, especially in Local Government and Public Health, Industry and Commerce, Lands, Agriculture and in the office of the Revenue Commissioners.  Evidently the expectation that a larger number of posts than were required to be filled from the competitive examinations held this year occasioned a considerable increase in the number of candidates putting themselves forward as compared with 1932.  In addition to the ordinary examinations for the general service classes, it has been necessary to arrange examinations this year which had no counterpart in previous years.  For instance, an examination for the posts of cattle and meat supervisors was held in October, and an examination for posts as investigation officers for means tests in connection with unemployment assistance and old age pensions will be held in January.  The total net entries for the Civil Service examinations rose from something like 3,500 in 1932 to 9,011 in 1933, and have been almost 10,000 in the first ten months of this year.</P>

      <P>Then I shall deal with the examination for temporary assistant meat inspectors to which the Minister made reference in his opening speech.  That examination was held during this financial year.  The candidates were expected to pay a fee of £1 each before being allowed to sit for it. Many of those competing were unemployed persons.  To demand a fee of £1 from an unemployed person seeking a temporary post seems to me to be unreasonable.  I gather from what I have seen in the newspapers that something like 2,000 people competed in that examination.  Therefore, to extract a sum of £2,000 in fees for posts numbering 120 in the aggregate seems to me to be an unreasonable procedure altogether.  I think that the Minister for Finance might well look into the matter with a view to reducing the fee from £1 to something nominal.  It is not desirable that candidates should be debarred from competing at examinations because of the difficulty they may find in being <Col N="1583" /> able to put up the required fee.  The Minister, I am sure, is aware of the fact that it is not often easy for people who are unemployed, people who are receiving no unemployment insurance benefit and only an inadequate sum in unemployment assistance, to put up a fee of £1 if they desire to sit for these examinations.  I suggest that the maximum fee in these cases ought not to be more than 5/-.  The additional cost to the State would be relatively small, and a fee, such as I have suggested, would be more in accord with the capacity of applicants to pay.</P>
      <P>There is another matter that I desire to bring to the attention of the Minister in the hope that he may be able to do something to remedy the procedure adopted by the Civil Service Commission.  It deals with the matter of examinations in oral Irish.  In the case of some grades recruited to the Civil Service there is a written examination in Irish on entry as well as an oral examination.  When a person is subsequently appointed to an established position, it is on the condition that within a certain period after receiving the established appointment or before that established appointment is definitely confirmed, he or she will undergo a further examination in oral Irish.  I put it to the Minister that that is not a satisfactory method of dealing with the qualifications of candidates or of civil servants in the matter of Irish. I suggest to the Minister that the procedure requiring a candidate to undergo a second examination in oral Irish is one that ought to be abolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, whatever standard the Civil Service Commissioners require a candidate to have, they should ascertain whether he reaches that standard at the first examination, or they should, if necessary, make the standard higher, or require a more detailed examination in the first instance. Once, however, a candidate has got through the first examination and has been appointed to a post, he should not be obliged to undergo a further test.  I suggest that one test only should be applied and that is the first test.  If the second test is applied <Col N="1584" /> rigidly, as it has been in some cases then the candidate after he has been some time acting on probation in an established post, finds himself threatened with cancellation of that appointment. I should be glad if the Minister would look into that matter and see if it is possible to arrange that whatever test is imposed should be imposed in the first instance, and that no candidate who has been acting on probation for two years should be threatened with cancellation of an appointment if he does not reach the standard required by the Civil Service Commissioners as a result of a second oral Irish test.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the point in regard to the oral Irish test arises really on the Vote for the Civil Service Commissioners.  It arises on the Vote for the Minister for Finance because he is responsible for conveying to the Civil Service Commission what the policy of the Government is in regard to a matter of this kind.  I think the contention is that whatever standard we require should be laid down and exacted from the candidate at the first entrance examination alone, and that no subsequent examination should be required.  The invariable rule in regard to all Civil Service appointments is that a person is appointed on probation and his continuance in the Civil Service is conditional on his being efficient and satisfactory during the whole period of his probation.  At the end of his probation, the Civil Service authorities should be satisfied that he is equipped to continue in their service, and that he will in all probability give efficient service.  It is the policy of the Government that, so far as possible, all public business will be conducted through Irish.  That is not going to be an ideal that will be easily realised, but, in any event, the use of Irish in all Departments is growing.  A person entering the general service classes may find himself, owing to the requirements of the service, in a Department where comparatively little use is made of Irish, but he must hold himself in such a condition in regard to Irish, that if at any time he is called upon to serve in another Department where Irish is in more general use, he will <Col N="1585" /> be able to bring to the public service in that Department just as good a knowledge of Irish as he would have been able to show at the beginning of his service.</P>
      <P>The unfortunate thing about Irish is that quite a considerable number of people who had a good knowledge of Irish when they entered the Service have failed to maintain that knowledge. Quite a number of people who passed the original test, failed to pass the test to which they were submitted at the end of their probationary period. The only way to cure that condition is not, it seems to me, to dispense with the probationary period altogether, as Deputy Norton suggests, but to make the probationary test just as severe and, if necessary, even more severe than the original entrance test.  I think it is very important that those in the Service should know that so far from its being the policy of the present Government to lessen the requirements in regard to Irish, the whole tendency will be to increase them, and so far from people having any expectation that the Irish test will be dispensed with at the end of the probationary period, the expectation should be that it will be made more and more rigorous as time goes on.</P>
      <P>With regard to the other question about the examinations for temporary meat inspectors, I should like to say that it is not true to suggest that the majority of applicants for these positions were people who were out of work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The fairness of an examination fee can be gauged by the number of people who are willing to pay that fee to sit for the examination. If we were to reduce this fee below the figure that has proved sufficient to enable us to get a sufficient number of candidates for any examination, the effect would be to clog up the whole process of selection or the whole process of examination for entrance to the Civil Service.  When the fee is of a significant <Col N="1586" /> amount, a person will think twice before he pays it and will examine himself to see whether, in fact, he has any reasonable chance of getting one of the posts.  It is only people who think they have a chance of getting posts that we want to sit for these examinations, because if you get a number of people entering who have obviously no chance of passing the examination, not merely does it mean that it will take a longer time to secure suitable candidates to fill the vacancies, but it involves considerably greater expense for the Government in making arrangements for the examinations.  4,000 persons were willing to sit for the examination for temporary meat inspectors&mdash;I am merely giving that as an instance because I happen to know the number &mdash;if instead of the fee being £1, it had been 5/-, it would have been a case not of examining 4,000 people, but a case of examining probably 25,000 people, because everybody who thought, even on the flimiest grounds, that he had the faintest chance of securing one of these positions would have been willing to gamble that 5/- in order to get a chance of sitting for the examination.  Then we would have the difficulty of providing examiners, printing examination papers, and securing examination halls in order to get 120 inspectors from these 25,000 individuals. It is not merely a question of simply reducing the fee; it is a case of fixing the fee at such an amount as will get you such a number of qualified competitors for any one post as will enable you to fill this post with the greatest efficiency and expedition.  It is on that basis that these fees are being fixed, and I do not see how you are going to carry on the work of the Civil Service Commissioners and to provide the staff necessary to operate the machinery set up by the Dáil, if these fees are reduced to insignificant amounts.</P>

I could understand the test that you are going to examine people on the basis that they are of good character and are good citizens, but the test which the Minister applies is that any fool who has got £1 and sufficient to pay his railway fare can compete at these examinations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting this point to the Minister.  Any fool with a pound and a railway ticket can compete in these examinations.  A poor man with intelligence might find it difficult to borrow the pound.  The Minister confers a definite advantage on the fool <Col N="1588" /> with the pound as distinct from the poor man who cannot borrow the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>But the fool and his pound are soon parted&mdash;that is no advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says he wants the type of candidate who thinks he has a chance in the examination. Let us assume that 2,000 university professors sit for an examination for appointments as meat inspectors.  That would probably come up to the Minister's expectations of good competition. Assuming 2,000 professors sat for examination, 1,880 would have to be failures, because there would only be 120 appointments offered.  The very fact that there is a limited number of posts is bound to result in some people being disappointed.  The fact that people fail in examinations is no reason for saying that that in itself is a case for screening the number of applicants.  The whole principle of giving the advantage to the person with the most money to enable him to compete in an examination is an unfair one.  I did not think the Minister would rely upon it as his line of defence.  Surely there could be some other test applied besides the test of the possession of money.  I am aware that some applicants found considerable difficulty in borrowing the money and their railway fare in order to compete in the examination.  I still think there is a good case for a substantial reduction in the examination fees, so that people who may not find it so easy as the Minister thinks to pick up £1 notes will be given an opportunity of qualifying for examination. With regard to the other point, I am not suggesting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Chair rules that way, I am quite satisfied.  I would like, however, to put this point.  Under the <Col N="1589" /> present method of holding two oral Irish examinations the Minister is recruiting young people at 14 years of age.  They are kept in the Service until they are 18 or 19 years and they are then pushed out if they fail to pass the second oral Irish examination. They are pushed out at an age when it is not possible to find employment as apprentices in industry.</P>

      <P>This Estimate adds considerably to the Estimates brought under the Civil Service Commission.  I would like to ask the Minister whether fresh taxation will be imposed to make up this amount.  The Minister indicates that there will not.  I would like to ask him if there was any other reason for increasing this Estimate than that the Civil Service machine is growing and growing rapidly, and that the number of civil servants is increasing and the general Civil Service is an increasing burden on the people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The real reason for introducing this Estimate is that the number of applicants for admission into the Civil Service has increased considerably.  I think I gave in reply to Deputy McGilligan a month or six weeks ago some figures which showed that the total cost of the Civil Service at this moment is somewhat less than it was on the 31st March, 1932.  There are a considerable number of posts of a new kind being created. Some of these have been filled by redundant officers.  To compensate for the increase in the personnel of the service there has been a considerable number of retirements and newer people, younger people, whose places on the incrementary scale are not as high as those who retire, have come to replace the older men going out at the top.  I <Col N="1590" /> do not think there has been any actual increase in the personnel.  There has been an increase in the number trying to get into the Civil Service, and it is mainly because of that that this Estimate is required.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a considerable amount of discussion on the Committee Stage of this Bill.  The general burden of the discussion on the one side was that here we had a considerable increase of Customs duties, the alleged idea being to develop Irish industries.  The effect, so far as some of us argued here, was to raise appreciably the cost of these articles to the people and to set up industries, where that did occur, under unsatisfactory circumstances.  From the Government Benches there was no general statement on the industries that they were to set up, no general statement as to what they were doing to secure that a rise in prices would not take place.  Their attitude generally was the attitude of people who introduce an order imposing a duty, who had not examined the situation beforehand and thought it too soon to lift the lid and see what was happening as a result of the imposition of the duty.  The experience of the House during the discussion of this particular Bill will, I hope, have been such that in various directions and in various ways the Minister will be impressed and that both himself and the Minister for Industry and Commerce will deal with measures of this kind in a somewhat different way in the future. There is no Party in the House anxious to create difficulties either for the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Finance in dealing with industrial affairs; there is no party in the House who wishes to snipe them in any way, who wants to examine too closely into any of their proposals or who wants to stand too closely over them in doing their work, but we do expect that they will make some kind of a reasonable presentation to us of what their hopes are, and that they will give us some indication that they have given a fair examination to the general circumstances before they imposed these duties and ask this House, even in a certain amount of darkness, to pass them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the duties pointed to here was the Excise duty on sugar.  I have charged the Minister for Finance and his Government with doing this, in <Col N="1592" /> the sugar business, since February last taking in a concealed way from the pockets of the Irish people, by means of their Customs duty and their Excise duty, approximately £730,000 additional per year for sugar.  The Minister shakes his head, as he did before, and says that they are not doing it.  He even says to us that they are going to get less money into the Revenue from Customs duties, but what I am telling the Minister is that he is going to make the people pay out of their pockets, for sugar, £735,000 additional, whether it gets into the Revenue or not.  When we were dealing with the butter business in 1932 I put it up to the Minister for Agriculture that he was taking steps in that respect that were going to cost the people, in additional demands, £1,400,000 a year.  My figures were wrong according to the Minister.  They had worked it out carefully at £400,000 odd and the Minister gave, as his outside figure, £600,000.  The Minister was telling us the other day what implied that the people are paying £1,200,000 out of their pockets in the increased price for butter as a result of the Minister's legislation.</P>
    <P>What is happening in a concealed way with regard to butter is now going to happen in a concealed way annually as regards sugar, just as, in a different way, it would be happening as a result of some of the other industries, in cases in which they do succeed in starting industries, which are not capable of battling for themselves or standing in a fair way against competition from other people working under similar circumstances. Again, I challenge the Minister that he is, in taking this Bill away from the House, taking away the final act which draws from the pockets of the people to the extent of an additional £750,000 a year for sugar.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not allow this debate to conclude, I would not feel that I was doing my duty, if I were to acquiesce in the statements which have been made by Deputy Mulcahy.  Every proposal to which an Emergency Order relates is carefully considered by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the first case; by the Minister for <Col N="1593" /> Finance in the second case, and by the Executive Council, as a whole, in the third case.  The effect of that Emergency Order is considered both on the cost of commodities and on the budgetary position, and I may say that, from the budgetary point of view, I have derived little satisfaction from any one of these Orders, because they have prevented the flow of revenue into the Exchequer, but if they have done that, they have what I think is a considerable compensation in that every one of them, or most of them&mdash; those of them that relate to industrial commodities&mdash;is going to result in the establishment of a new industry in this country.</P>
      <P>In the debate on the Emergency Orders, as much information as could be reasonably expected was given by the Ministers who were responsible for the Orders, but there are certain things which it is not fit should be discussed in this House.  I have heard it when Deputy McGilligan was Minister for Industry and Commerce and I have heard Deputy Mulcahy himself deprecate the discussion of the personal affairs of private individuals in this House, and short of publishing the names&mdash;and the names were forthcoming elsewhere, all those who were interested in this development&mdash;short of giving confidential information in relation to their business costs, all the information that could be given, all the information that could properly be asked for and be given, was given during the course of the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, on the question of the present position of the dairying industry and the sugar industry, to which Deputy Mulcahy referred, I thought it was rather significant that, when he was speaking, Deputy Bennett, who is generally very vocal where the interests of the dairy farmers of Limerick are concerned, was absent and there was nobody on the benches opposite, with the exception possibly of Deputy Finlay, who was interested at all in the mixed farming and tillage counties of the Saorstat.  We are challenged because butter cost us too much, because it cost the ordinary urban consumer more.  Why does it cost us more?  It costs us more because we are <Col N="1594" /> providing, or we are going, as far as we can at any rate, to provide a satisfactory price for the dairy farmer for his milk.  That is why it costs us more, and if Deputy Mulcahy objects to that, I suggest that he should raise it at the next meeting of his Party and fight the matter out with Deputy Bennett and those who sit for constituencies like Limerick and Tipperary in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Again, in regard to sugar, we did not for a moment conceal from the people, when we were introducing the Sugar Manufacture Bill last year, the fact that if we were to make our own sugar here it was going to cost us more to do it than it would cost us to buy foreign sugar.  We told them that it would mean an increase of a halfpenny to three farthings in the lb. in the cost of sugar, but, if it is, who is getting the benefit and advantage of that?&mdash;the people who sowed thousands of acres of beet in the district around Tuam, in the district around Mallow, in the district around Thurles, and in the district around Carlow.  It is for their benefit and their advantage that the rest of the community are paying a higher price for their sugar, and it is not for the benefit or advantage of the Exchequer.  As was stated on the last occasion, the actual fact is that this year, from tea and sugar, we expect to get, and, I am afraid, we will get, something like £200,000 or £250,000 less than our predecessors got from the tax upon sugar alone in the year which closed on 31st March, 1932.  That is the position. Not merely are the consumers of this country making some sacrifice in order to develop the sugar-making industry in this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but the Exchequer is losing considerably as well.  The proposal which we are now debating is the Emergency Order which imposed an Excise duty of a farthing a lb. on home-manufactured sugar and a corresponding Customs duty of a farthing a lb. on imported sugar.  The only duty which Irish manufactured sugar bears at the present moment is a duty <Col N="1595" /> of a farthing a lb.  In the year 1931-'32, the Excise duty on home-manufactured sugar was just twice that.  It was 4/8 a cwt., and to-day it is 2/4 a cwt.  That shows how far we have gone to help the sugar-making industry and how far we have gone to keep down the price of sugar to the consumer, all the time bearing in mind that an increase in price, on the basis on which these factories were constructed and on the basis of costs, as we know them, was unavoidable, once we began to make it ourselves.</P>
