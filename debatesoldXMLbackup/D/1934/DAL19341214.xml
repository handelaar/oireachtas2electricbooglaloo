      <P>The business will be taken as on the Order Paper, from items 5 to 12, inclusive.  Items 5 and 6 will be taken in the appropriate places, and item 7 before item 8.  Estimate No. 25 (Supplementary Agricultural Grants) alone will be taken to-day.  It is proposed not to interrupt public business at 12 o'clock noon to take Private Deputies' business, and the Dáil will sit later than 2.30 p.m.  The Order for the Adjournment will be taken not later than 12 p.m.</P>

      <P>The proposal before the Dáil is to sit until 12 o'clock to-night to take, amongst other items, the Citizenship Bill.  What, might I ask, is the need for haste in connection with that particular measure?  Is anyone going to suffer if that Bill does not pass this Session?  Is there any need for having it included amongst the measures to be passed before the Session ends?  Looking back on the last few weeks, we find that we met one day one week, and then adjourned for a fortnight, and then met one or two days in another week, and now, at the end of the Session, the Government is suffering from a serious attack of constipation of one sort or another in connection with Bills, some of which are unnecessary, and we are to be kept here until 12 o'clock to-night, without notice.  This week has been marked in the Dáil by three Ministers&mdash;the President of the Executive Council, <Col N="1260" /> the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the Minister for Finance &mdash;not knowing the measures before the House, and not being able to put it in possession of facts that should be given to Deputies.  It was a hopeless exhibition on the part of the President of the Executive Council yesterday, and by lack of information or study on the part of Ministers, the House had to be asked to help them out of difficulties.  I should like to know what reason there is why the Citizenship Bill has to be taken this Session?</P>

      <P>I do not see that the Deputy has urged any reason why the business on the Order Paper should not be taken to-day.  The Deputy talks a lot of nonsense in this House, but I never heard him talk more nonsense than he did now, when he said that Ministers exhibited a want of knowledge of their Bills.  The less the ex-President of the Executive Council says on that subject the better.  The Citizenship Bill is necessary.</P>

      <P>Indeed I do not know.  The business on the Order Paper need not occupy us until midnight, but it is the Government's opinion that the items on the Order Paper to be dealt with to-day should be dealt with.  They are measures which are necessary.  I know that the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill should have been before the House months ago, but on account of the changes, we had to give the local authorities about three months to get up the necessary information.  Nobody wants to deny the fact&mdash;I do not, at any rate&mdash;with regard to that Bill; but it is urgent now.  We are anxious that the Bill should go through as quickly as possible, and also the Supplementary Estimate, so that the local <Col N="1261" /> authorities may get the money authorised under the Bill.  The business on the Order Paper is regarded as urgent and necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>After that lucid explanation, upon which I should like to congratulate the Vice-President, we have discovered that one Bill is necessary&mdash;the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill.  We understand that that is necessary and that the Estimate in respect of it is also necessary.  The other portions of the Minister's statement are even more interesting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the other peculiarities in connection with the Citizenship Bill.  We have found that two items on the Order Paper are necessary.  Although the Citizenship Bill is supposed to be necessary, we have not been told why.  We have not been told why it is urgent.  With that lucidity and irrelevance which are characteristic of the Vice-President, we are told that because of something which he thinks happened three or four years ago, this business must go on.  I congratulate the Ministry on the Vice-President's explanation.  It is magnificent; it is even more than lucid&mdash;it is entrancing.</P>

      <P>I submit that it is the invariable experience of the House that the work done in a prolonged session of that kind is apt to be badly <Col N="1262" /> done.  It is admitted that the Citizenship Bill is an important measure, and I suggest that it ought to be considered under circumstances which would ensure that it gets the most careful and reasonable consideration.  The Vice-President has given no explanation as to its urgency and, if it is so urgent, why the Government have been three years in office before they saw fit to bring it in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Government that claim this is urgent and, consequently, it is up to the Government to show why they consider it urgent and to show from past conduct that they are genuine in saying it is urgent.  The business of this session, as Deputy Cosgrave has pointed out, has been conducted in a positively farcical manner.  There is not alone the point that he made about inadequate information being available from Ministers as to measures they were recommending to the House, but we have been meeting here for a day a week or, at the most, two days a week.</P>

      <P>It has been through the mismanagement by the Government of their own business that we have got into a jam, if we have got into a jam, at the end of this session.  I suggest that they should meet us in this matter.  It is not a question of desiring to be unreasonably obstructive. We want this Citizenship Bill to get adequate consideration.  Let us have sessions of the normal length and let us get as far with the business as we can this week and the two days next week on which it has been decided to sit before the motion for the Christmas adjournment.  But do not ask the House to scramble through the business of the Dáil in the midnight hours.</P>

      <P>I protest that this is simply trampling on the Dáil as an institution.  The Standing Orders laid down certain normal hours as the hours on which the House will meet.  These hours were arrived at after considering the personal commitments of the people who constitute the membership of the Dáil.  These hours were selected as the hours most suitable to the classes of people who were Deputies so that they might be given an opportunity of attending in some way to their own private business as well as giving their time to public business here.  We understood from the Government, taking into account the amount of work they wished to complete before Christmas, that the Dáil was expected to rise yesterday.  The Vice-President now tells us that we must take all stages of the Citizenship Bill before Christmas; that we must take all stages of the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill before Christmas and that we must take all stages of the Imposition of Duties Bill together with certain Supplementary Estimates, and that no consideration at all is to be given to the motions that are down on the Order Paper in the names of Private Deputies&mdash;motions that have been down for months and in respect of which we heard from the President within the last few weeks some expressions of appreciation as to the generous spirit in which the Government wished <Col N="1265" /> to approach these Motions and to give facilities to private Deputies for their discussion.</P>
      <P>The Vice-President tells us now that the Rates on Agricultural Land Bill is urgent.  But will he tell us why the First Reading of that Bill could not be taken on the 14th November?  Is there anything in that Bill which would prevent its being introduced on the 14th November or earlier if the Dáil were sitting?  Is there anything in the Imposition of Duties Bill which would prevent that Bill being introduced before the 14th November if the Government had taken the trouble of doing it?  Then, we should have these Bills adequately discussed and we could have private Deputies given the time that is normally due to them.  In view of the fact that the Government business which normally should have been ready on the 14th November, was not ready some of the generosity of which the President has spoken could have been extended to private Deputies in the second week of November in which the Dáil sat.  When we met on the 14th and 15th November, these two Bills could have been introduced as well as the Supplementary Estimates&mdash;Science and Art and the Circuit Court.  These Bills could then have been disposed of in the Parliamentary week beginning the 21st November.  What happened was that private Deputies were deliberately squeezed out of their rights by the refusal of the Government to give them time for the discussion of important Motions.  I charge that Government business has been held up in the hope that the Opposition Deputies will break off to their homes and that the Government will then be able to scamper through the business&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Donnelly knows the close attention business people have to give to their business to day if they are to keep out of the bankruptcy courts.  The Government is taking advantage of that strain on the business professional and the farming community to-day to get them out of a difficulty.  The Government are trying to get the business of the Dáil <Col N="1266" /> through with very inadequate discussion. They want to get business that requires serious consideration by this House rushed through.  This attitude of the Ministers in shutting down the Dáil&mdash;the Dáil was shut down for three months up to the 14th November&mdash;has only one object.  Since the 14th November the Dáil has only met eight days, and during those eight days the Government business was conducted in such a way as to squeeze Private Deputies out of their rights by preventing discussions on the motions down on the Order Paper.  Now, an endeavour is being made to manaeuvre the situation so that Deputies will be prevented from discussing Government business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion is the usual Fianna Fáil version of the closure.  It is an extremely amazing fact about Fianna Fáil that they have an infinite capacity for doing dirty things and not doing so openly.  When doing these things they wrap the mantle of sanctimonious rectitude about themselves and then stab someone from behind the pall.  On the Second Stage of the Citizenship Bill we had a statement from the President that he expected everyone in the House would lend a hand and that he expected them to take an interest in that Bill so that we would have an agreed measure and there would be open discussion.  Then the President came in with his Bill and he floundered about like a sea-lion that had got into a bog.  Though he had been hauled out by the Opposition and straightened out repeatedly, still the stress on his spine was too great, and accordingly the Fianna Fáil closure is produced in order to let him flounder through the whole Bill without correction. That is the whole story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Citizenship Bill was brought in by the President for the purpose of wrapping the green flag around him and embracing Caithlin Ni Houlihan. There is the pretence of putting an end to the British connection.  The whole business has been motived in that way. Now, in the remaining stages of the Bill the closure must be put on so as to prevent Deputies having an adequate discussion on the Bill.  And then we will have the Government, through the <Col N="1267" /><i>Irish Press</i>, to-morrow or next day, explaining what a marvellous achievement the Citizenship Bill is.  The whole thing is perfectly understandable.  Anyone who knows the mentality of the Party opposite knows the purpose of this motion.  It is simply to squeeze out discussion so as to prevent the House from exposing the absurdity of many of the Government's actions and from exposing the amendments which they propose to the Bill.  Deputies opposite have nothing else to do but to come down to the House.  But vast majority of the Deputies on this side of the House have occasion to earn their living.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The mere idea of earning one's living throws the other side into convulsions of laughter.  It is so long since they did it that it seems absurd to them that any sensible man should occupy himself in such an operation. If this House is to sit until midnight and right up to Christmas, then the majority of members of this Party cannot attend to the deliberations of the House.  If that brings any satisfaction to the Ministers, they are welcome to the information.  If we are to sit here at a time when the ordinary citizen has to give attention to his private affairs in order to earn his living, then the members of this Party cannot assist in the transaction of public business.  Whenever the Fianna Fáil Party want to effect the closure in that way, they are welcome to do so. They will get their own brigades to trot in and out of the lobbies, but they will not get the co-operation and the assistance to which they would be entitled in normal circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to be led into divagations, but when I heard the effect that this Citizenship Bill was going to have on Deputy MacDermot's nationality, I was tempted to ask what effect it would have on President de Valera's nationality.  I shall not pursue that question and I suggest to the Opposition that they should not pursue it either.  This is the closure and you might as well say so.  It would be much more honest and much more <Col N="1268" /> decent on the part of the Vice-President if he would introduce a guillotine motion in respect of the Citizenship Bill and a closure motion in respect of all the other business on the Order Paper, That would be the honest thing to do.  I am certainly not going to sit here until midnight&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When the imbecilities of the Opposition shall have subsided, I shall continue to speak.  No other Deputy who really wants to do useful work in this House will attempt to spend 12 or 13 hours discussing a measure such as the Citizenship Bill. Every Deputy on the opposite side of the House knows that.  That is the reason that this motion is introduced&mdash; to prevent full and adequate discussion of the Citizenship Bill.  There is no reason whatever why the Committee Stage of that Bill should not be put back until the 13th February, if we want to do any really useful work upon it.  Possibly the Ministry have come to the conclusion that the Bill is not worth any useful work, that it is so futile and so ineffective that it is just as well to let it run through in whatever shape President de Valera wants it.  If they do want it to be examined, after their experience of last night, it is obviously a Bill which ought to be put back until the 13th February.  The House should be given ample time to consider it in all its aspects.  If it is not put back, there is going to be no examination of the measure.  There is going to be an incompetent and inefficient Bill passed into law, with the usual inconvenience that ensues upon such legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill. This Bill provides for giving legal effect to the decisions taken in the earlier part of the year in regard to the Agricultural Grant.  The Grant for the current financial year will be increased to a total of £1,970,000 or £222,000 more than last year and will be applied to the relief of rates in a new way.</P>
      <P>When the Grant first became a feature of local finance, on the establishment of county councils by the Act of 1898, the Saorstát share amounted to £599,011 and it remained at this figure until 1925 when, an equal sum being voted, the Grant was doubled. In 1931 the Grant was increased by three quarters of a million pounds which brought it to a total of £1,948,011.  Each county's share was applied at an equal rate over all land valuations.  The occupier who ekes out a living on a small holding got the same rate of relief as an occupier who had a holding with a poor law valuation of £300, £400, or £500 pounds a year.</P>
      <P>In 1932, the present Government increased the relief by £250,000, which brought the total up to two and one-fifth million pounds approximately, but the relief out of the new money was confined to holdings of £10 and under and the first £10 only of larger holdings.  This was the first break with the old method of a county flat rate for all holdings and was continued for a second year, that is, 1933-34, when the total amount provided was £1,750,000, the reduction of the Grant that year by £448,022 not affecting the special relief to the limit of £10 valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year, as I have stated, the Grant will be £1,970,000, which is the highest figure it has ever reached <Col N="1272" /> except that of the year 1932-33 when the land purchase annuities were still at the old figure.  But whilst increasing the Grant a new method of giving the relief has been adopted. Last year's rate of relief on the first £10 valuation is taken as the standard rate, and the Bill provides that every occupier of land not exceeding £20 in valuation shall, in the current year, get this rate of relief, and occupiers of larger holdings shall get an equal rate on the first £20 of their holdings. To extend the maximum rate of relief up to the £20 limit will cost, we estimate, an additional sum of £116,000, and part of the new money to be provided this year goes to meet this extra cost.  In the Bill the relief on the first £20 valuation is designated the primary allowance.  The primary allowances, including urban district shares, will take, we estimate, £1,182,000 of the Grant and cover valuations amounting to £3,700,000.</P>
    <P>After the primary allowances are given there will remain the part of the valuations above the first £20 and this part can get relief by way of employment allowance or supplementary allowance or both.</P>
    <P>The employment allowance is given where one or more men were at work on the holding in the nine months preceding the 31st December, 1933. Every occupier of land over £20 valuation was asked to make a claim to the allowance in respect of men at work on his holding, and the county councils received, and admitted, claims in respect of 130,000 men&mdash;somewhat more than half being employees and the remainder relatives of the occupiers.  For each man employed an abatement of the rate was made at the primary allowance rate on £12 10s. valuation, if the occupier had so much additional valuation.  The employment allowances will cost, we estimate, £386,000, of which £104,000 will come out of the additional £220,000 which is being provided this year.  The cost of the employment allowances, when added to the cost of the primary allowances, will absorb £1,570,000 of the Grant.  There will then be a balance of £400,000.</P>
    <P>After the primary and the employment <Col N="1273" /> allowances have been paid the balance of the Grant in every county will go to the relief of the part of the valuation that did not get any relief by way of primary or employment allowance, and this balance will be applied in every county by way of supplementary allowance at an equal rate over the remaining valuation, which amounts to £2,000,000.  The supplementary rate of relief is everywhere below the primary allowance rate.  In most counties the difference is slightly over 2/-.</P>
    <P>This is the main outline of the scheme in the Bill.  Perhaps an illustration of how it works in a typical county will make it clearer to those Deputies who are not themselves farmers, and had not, as a matter of business, to become acquainted with its working.  Take a holding of £50 valuation in, say, County Kilkenny, the occupier of which has a brother and a paid labourer working on the holding.  On the first £20 he gets relief at the rate of 6/- in the pound, which was the previous year's relief on the first £10.  He gets relief at the same rate on £12 10s. for his brother and on £12 10s. for his labourer.  That means that his rates would be abated by 6/- in the £ on £45.  There is a remaining valuation of £5.  On that remainder he will get relief at a lower rate of 3/10½ in the £, which is what the balance of the Grant runs to in that county.</P>
    <P>We are now at the stage when it can be said that the new method has been successfully put into operation. It has, we recognise, involved a good deal of labour on the part of the secretaries and clerical staffs of the county councils and the rate collectors who examined claims, but this was inevitable in the initial year of the change over and the scheme, if continued, will probably work more smoothly each succeeding year.</P>
    <P>It may be asked why do we put forward this scheme changing the basis on which the Grant has hitherto been distributed.  The answer is shortly that we did not regard the old basis as any longer satisfactory.  It applied the Grant in a blind, mechanical way and, except for the slight variations <Col N="1274" /> made in 1932 every holder, large and small, whether he used his land in a way that gave the maximum employment or gave no employment at all, whether rancher or congest, got the same rate of relief without any conditions whatever.  Some of the witnesses before the Derating Commission in 1931 took the view that relief from rates should be conditional on proper use being made of the land and, furthermore, two of the Commissioners recorded their view that as soon as the State could do so the first £15 or the first £20 valuation should be exempt from rates.  In the scheme in the Bill we have combined two ideas, one to provide for occupiers of £20 holdings and under and the first £20 of larger holdings the rate of relief which was allowed last year on the first £10, and the other to differentiate in the case of larger holdings between occupiers according to the extent to which the holdings afford employment. It is a common criticism of the scheme that there is not sufficient inducement to give employment.  That is so.  In the first year unless we were prepared to revolutionise the whole system of relief of rates on agricultural land we had to content ourselves with a gesture that would indicate the path that we intended to pursue.  This Bill is the beginning of a new system but only the beginning, and landholders of the higher valuations who are not making proper use of their land would be well advised to take note of the fact that the day of unconditional relief of rates on land is at an end.</P>
    <P>With regard to the employment allowance, I notice some of the county councils are pressing the Government to allow claims to be made for persons employed temporarily.  We cannot overlook the necessity for constant employment for the agricultural labourer and give countenance to a practice, which I am told is growing, of taking on causal labour during the busy season and dispensing with it during the slack season.</P>
    <P>The Second Schedule of the Bill shows the share of each county council in that grant.  These shares have been arrived at in the following way:&mdash; Each county was allotted a sum equal <Col N="1275" /> to last year's share and credited with the payments that they are bound to make to certain urban districts, the whole of the additional sum required to extend the primary allowance from the first £10 to the first £20 was then allotted and the balance of the grant was divided in proportion to the claims to employment allowances.  The urban districts that receive agricultural grant are those that have been created or extended since 1898.  The county councils will pay these districts first a sum equal to what they paid them last year and in addition whatever may be necessary to bring the rate of relief on the first £20 in the urban district up to the county rate of relief.  I may, perhaps, appropriately here add a word about these urban district grants generally because on every occasion that the agricultural grant has been increased there has been a considerable amount of pressure to extend it to all urban districts.  The problem presented by these urban farmers is not quite so simple as it may appear at first glance.  The point for consideration is whether there is a case for placing land in the 39 urban districts that do not at present receive any part of the grant on a par with similar land in rural areas.  The exclusion of urban land in 1898 from the benefits of the agricultural grant was due to deliberate policy.  Prior to 1898 oudoor relief was a charge on the electoral division and as outdoor relief was heavier in the towns than in the rural areas it bore heavily on the electoral divisions in which the towns were situated. After 1898 the charge was extended to the union and the agricultural grant was calculated as if there had been a flat union charge for all poor relief expenditure.  The towns benefited by the wider area of charge and agricultural land get something extra by reason of the slightly higher rate resulting from the extension of the charge.  The towns also experienced benefit when, on the county schemes coming into operation, the county at large superseded the union as the area of charge.  As a rule, land occupiers in towns are not assessed on the full valuation for all rates.  In most areas <Col N="1276" /> a differential scale prevails by which land is relieved of three-quarters of the town rate.</P>
    <P>Land in towns has a higher valuation due partly to proximity to markets.  It is probably true that improved transport has neutralised some of the benefit of proximity but as against this it must be remembered that with an increasing population the value of land in urban areas tends to increase.  We see urban councils called on to pay more than £100 an acre for land required for housing and of course if you give further relief to land in towns you enhance the value of the land.  In some of the boroughs and urban districts&mdash;Dun Laoghaire for instance&mdash;it would be hard to justify further relief to agricultural land.  By giving special relief you are in fact encouraging land owners to withhold land from building. It is proposed to continue the system by which an abatement of rates may be given partly by means of credit notes. It has been found in some counties that a credit note is an incentive to ratepayers to pay their rates within the financial year.  In most counties the supplementary allowances will, this year, be given by means of credit notes that expire on 31st March, 1935.</P>
    <P>I would say in conclusion that at one time I had hoped to present this Bill earlier in the year.  But it was not possible to make a satisfactory allocation of the money to be voted until we knew what would be the cost of the primary allowances and employment allowances in every county, and before this information could be ascertained all employment allowance claims had to be examined.  About 130,000 persons, relatives and employees, were returned as at work and it was some time before claims could be certified and the allocation of the Grant completed.  The Bill, however, is temporary and applies to the present financial year, and, although it is not now possible to alter it radically, the Dáil will have an opportunity of considering a permanent measure which I hope we shall be able to present early next year.</P>

      <P>It is an astonishing reflection on the attitude of the Minister to the public bodies and the <Col N="1277" /> people over whom he is supposed to exercise a fatherly and helpful supervision that he introduces this measure and does not say a single word with regard to the financial condition of these public bodies or of the people upon whom the main support of them depends.  The Minister has explained that a certain arrangement of finances has been made.  He is introducing the giving of a grant in respect of employment in agricultural occupations, but does not refer in any way to the condition of the agricultural industry or to the fact that the wages paid to agricultural labourers within the last couple of years have fallen calamitously. An endeavour is being made to get the agricultural community to employ labour in circumstances in which they are less able to pay agricultural labourers than they were and, as I have said, the fall in agricultural wages has been calamitous within the last couple of years.  The Minister's policy with regard to this grant has been a most wayward policy.  When the Government came into office they were so concerned with the position of the agricultural community and of the burden that rates placed on it that the £750,000 additional relief in rates granted by the previous Government the year before was not enough, in their opinion, and they added £250,000 during their first year of office.  But they took away £448,000 the next year, and they tell us to-day that they are adding £220,000.  The Government indicated somewhat earlier in the year that the money that is being given in this way to the further relief of rates on agricultural land was being taken from bounties: that there was to be a reduction, I think, of 5/- per head on cattle, and 6d. per head on sheep.  The Minister is now making great bones in restoring this £220,000 as additional relief on rates on agricultural land&mdash;in other words, putting into the farmers' pocket with one hand what he is taking out of it with the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has been the condition of the people paying rates during the time when the Minister is carrying on this rapidly changing policy?  In the year before the Minister gave his £250,000 as an additional relief in rates on agricultural <Col N="1278" /> land, the total warrant of the county councils was £2,405,000.  Then the Minister gave his additional relief of £250,000, but the total warrant for that year remained at £2,323,000, a fall of about £80,000.  In the year in which he took away the £448,000 the total warrant of the county councils rose by £650,000, so that the warrant rose from £2,323,000 to £2,973,000.  In the year in which they are getting this £220,000 back, in relief of rates, money which has been taken out of the farmers' pockets in bounties, there is no fall in the warrant, or in the burden that will fall on the general body of the ratepayers. The total warrant of the county councils remains at £2,963,000, a fall of about £10,000.  While the burden of the warrant relateable to the year has risen, local bodies find themselves in this position every year, that they have bigger increases of outstanding payments.  For instance, in the year 1932-33, when the total warrant was £2,323,000, the county councils had to look for arrears of £435,000, £129,000 of which they put into the warrant for that year.  In the year 1933-34 when the warrant rose to £2,973,000, the county councils had to look for £542,000 of arrears, £176,000 of which they had to add to the warrant, while in the year 1934-35, when the warrant was £2,963,000, the county councils were faced at the beginning of it with arrears to the extent of £1,142,000.  The condition of affairs was such that they had to squeeze £339,000 of that into the warrant for that year.</P>
    <P>The Minister is now introducing this measure and talks about relief in rates on agricultural land.  But during the first six months of the year in which this relief in rates on agricultural land is to be given the county councils, instead of collecting the warrant for the year, were engaged squeezing about £700,000 of arrears out of the people. A sum of £339,000 has yet to be squeezed out of them as arrears under the warrant as well as another £100,000 or £102,000 not appearing in the warrant, but still there as arrears, to be squeezed out of them.  We have heard nothing from the Minister as to that particular situation or as to the position <Col N="1279" /> in which the councils find themselves as well as the people who have to provide the rates for the support of the councils.  The Minister is supposed, as I have said, to exercise a fatherly supervision over the important work of local bodies, to do everything possible to assist them to discharge their important responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The Minister, I suggest, should not shut his eyes to the situation.  The amount of the rate collection at the 30th September last should open his eyes to the very dangerous position that exists. The various councils throughout the country have made serious complaints about what their position is.  The Minister knows very well the condition of the agricultural community.  He knows the importance of the work of local bodies.  Last year, he was vigorous in his sizing up of the situation.  He was vigorous not only in his appeal to local bodies to stand up to their responsibilities and to get in the rates quickly, but he was also vigorous in his threatening of them.  To-day when the situation is infinitely worse the Minister has nothing to say with regard to it.</P>
    <P>Let us first see the class of people with whom you are dealing in the main. You are dealing with the agricultural community.  In 1932-33 when the Minister thought the rates bore so heavily on the agricultural community, and when he had to come to their assistance with an additional £250,000, they had received from exports of live stock and live stock products a sum of £27,155,000. In the meantime, he has taken roughly £448,000 from these people.  He has taken £228,000 off the gross amount he is giving them in respect of rates, and his colleagues have taken £220,000 out of their pockets.  Yet, he is doing that in respect of a time when their income from the exports of live stock and live stock products has fallen from £27,000,000 in 1931 to £12,000,000 in 1933.  This year, they are only going to receive about £11,000,000 from these exports, and included in that £11,000,000 is £3,000,000 bounties which the farmers are going to pay themselves practically.  That is one item that shows the Minister the condition of the people upon whom he is depending to <Col N="1280" /> support local bodies, and the fact that the Minister dealt with this matter without paying any attention to that is an extraordinary circumstance to me.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that local bodies have discussed their position from time to time.  There is a County Council in Clare, and, as long ago as June last, a member of the County Council said he had not paid his rates in respect of the previous year until May 22nd.  In order to do so, he had to sell nine head of cattle at £2 per head and to borrow £1.  He said that he belonged to no political Party but he had voted for Mr. de Valera last year, and by the way things were going he was not going to do it again.  That was in June last.  Clare County Council have been discussing the situation again recently, and at a meeting held, and reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> on 28th November last, the Minister informed them that owing to the heavy draw on the Guarantee Fund in respect of arrears of annuities of the May and June gale, no further issue of the agricultural grant could be made at present and the collection of the rates should be pressed forward as quickly as possible. The County Council were driven to discuss a proposal asking the Minister for Local Government to confer with the Minister for Agriculture as to the best means of enabling the taxpayers to meet their demands for the maintenance of local administration. The situation of the farming community in Clare was discussed so much that a Fianna Fáil representative said that he could not object to it, if a resolution was brought forward, as the people needed whatever help they could get. Another Fianna Fáil representative said &ldquo;they could not close their eyes to the fact that there were hardships on the people but that the Banner County should not be the first to put up the white flag.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Even the Minister's supporters in the country realise to-day the condition to which the people are reduced. They have developed a hardened political skin, no doubt fostered by local personal antagonisms, but the Minister must view the position from a somewhat more detached point of view. If he takes any interest in the work of <Col N="1281" /> local bodies, or any interest in the necessity for the work of local bodies being carried out in the interests of the people, he should take cognisance of the situation that exists in Clare when the local people, even of his own Party, comment on the stress in which the people find themselves.  In Cork in June last, when pressure was being made for the collection of rates, two letters were read from rate collectors, one of them from the Castletownbere district, which stated that in many cases there were no prospects whatever of the ratepayers being able to meet the amounts demanded.  In other cases, it was stated the ratepayers were actually on the home assistance list.</P>
    <P>In June last, in West Cork, the people were unable to pay last year's rates, and the rate collectors stated, according to the <i>Irish Times</i> report of 22nd June, when the Minister was actually pressing at that time for the collection of rates, there were people being pressed for rates in West Cork who could not pay their rates, even if they sold the whole of their stock at present prices, and there were others who were on home assistance.  The Kerry Committee of Agriculture in May last called on the Minister for Agriculture to call a conference on non-Party lines with a view to devising some means of avoiding a smash in local administration through the inability of the people to meet their local rates demand, owing to the existing position.  About that time, at a meeting of the Westmeath County Council, in circumstances in which the bank would not allow any further increase in the Council's overdraft of £55,000, it was stated that the feeling of the meeting was that a serious financial situation had then been created.</P>
    <P>The Minister has plenty of evidence that so long ago as June last local bodies were finding themselves in a very serious situation.  I have called attention here before to the fact that a number of rates cases came before the District Courts, and in the more or less impartial atmosphere of the District Courts certain statements were made with regard to the position <Col N="1282" /> of persons sued for rates.  It is reported in the daily Press of 21st June that in the Castlemartyr Court the day before arrears to the extent of £2,000 were claimed against 175 farmers in the district.</P>

      <P>This District Justice adjourned several cases for one month.  One farmer on a large scale remarked that his cattle were being made lame and rendered unsaleable as a result of bringing them home continuously from fairs.  I have already pointed out that as long ago as April last the District Justice, adjudicating on unpaid rates cases at the Edenderry District Court, said the evidence before him disclosed a pitiable condition of things.  It was crying out for some alleviation from one source or another.  The local authority, he said, ought to be in a position not to bring these cases at all.  The rate collector could do nothing, added the Justice, because if he did not take action there was some peculiar machinery by which he was held responsible for the debt.</P>
      <P>The cases coming before some of the courts were such as to put the District Justices into very considerable difficulty. They did not want to appear to be making political or <i>ex-parte</i> statements from their courts and they washed their hands of a situation that they were legally entitled to wash their hands of.  The District Justice of Clonmel, on the 25th April, 1934, as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i>, said: &ldquo;I gave all the time I could to people who were unable to pay&mdash;now I have made up my mind to leave it in the collector's hands to deal with people who are willing but unable to pay.&rdquo;  He salved his conscience to some extent by saying &ldquo;I cannot see the majority of farmers without the necessities of life considering that they have land that can produce.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He salves his conscience in that way. If he was taking advantage of the law to prevent rate collectors bringing these cases to his court, where people could plead in the detached atmosphere of the court trying conditions and the injustice <Col N="1283" /> of the demand made on them for rates, he at least satisfies himself that they were people of a class not likely to starve.  They were without money to pay their rates, but they were not likely to starve.  An auditor in Cork is reported in January last as having examined the state of the rate collection and he reported: &ldquo;In the examination of the causes of the backward collection, it was observed there were among those who had not paid their rates by October 31st a number of councillors, clergymen and teachers, several officers and employees of the council and its associated bodies, including dispensary doctors, rate and rent collectors, assistance officers, contractors, quarry owners, pensioners, road workers and a member of the Survey staff.&rdquo;  But the Minister is surely in a position to know that there are dispensary doctors, road workers, contractors to whom local bodies owe considerable sums of money who are not paid by the local bodies.</P>
    <P>We see the circle going in a vicious direction now when the Minister is directing local bodies to withhold from persons who do not pay their rates some of the benefits that the law normally allows people in order to better their condition.  The question arose with the Limerick County Committee of Agriculture in June last and it was considered by some of the members of the Committee that rate defaulters should not get the advantage of some of the agricultural and live stock schemes in the county.  The Minister for Agriculture, looking at the matter no doubt from the point of view of the agricultural well-being of the people, wrote the Committee a letter stating that no provision was contained in any of the agricultural and live stock schemes to make the payment of rates a definite condition of receiving benefit.</P>
    <P>Four, five or six months have passed and, while local bodies may want to regard the Minister for Local Government as the unfortunate victim carrying out the policy of his colleagues, we now have the Minister pursuing a policy that the Minister for Agriculture, <Col N="1284" /> in the interests of the agricultural community, did not wish to pursue and the Minister for Local Government is now directing local bodies, in connection with schemes administered through the committees of agriculture in 1935 and subsequent years, that they shall not select an applicant for participation in any scheme with a view to obtaining a premium, prize, grant, subsidy or mare nomination unless they have first satisfied themselves that the applicant has no undischarged liability to the county council on foot of rates or cottage rent for the financial year immediately preceding the one current at the time the application is under consideration by the Committee.</P>
    <P>The South Tipperary Committee of Agriculture stated that 90 per cent. of the people who would come under the lash of that measure were people who could pay their rates.  So that some of the Minister's supporters are urging him to pursue that particular policy.  The Westmeath Board of Health, on the motion of Deputy Kennedy, seconded by Mr. Brett, adopted a resolution to the effect that in future contracts for supplies of any kind or work of any nature be given only to those who can show clear receipts for their rates and annuities to date.  I want to hear Deputy Kennedy discuss, for the benefit of the Minister for Local Government, the position in which his own Council is in the matter of discharging its obligations to the people to whom it is due to pay money.  I suggest the Deputy will find his Council in the position that many councils throughout the country are in, and that is they are not able to discharge the obligations that lie on them and, instead of proceeding to twist the situation in the vicious circle in which the Ministry are apparently going to do it, which will make it further impossible for them to recover rates from the agricultural community, the Deputy and some of his colleagues concerned with the position of local government in the country should be putting the clear facts of the situation before the Minister.</P>
    <P>The position of the Board of Health in Westmeath is an interesting one.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1285" /> I would like to hear the Deputy discuss that, because, if we can believe the discussions in the <i>Irish Press,</i> he is reported as saying: &ldquo;We are up against it now.  Whatever may be said about the farmers being unable to pay their way, many people in the towns are well able and willing to pay,&rdquo; and the Deputy was urging that the circulation of the warrant should be speeded up in the county so that the few pounds that might be collected in the towns would be collected, the farmers, apparently, in his opinion, being in such a position that he did not expect very much from them and no one indeed would expect very much from the farming community.  It is interesting to see the Deputy, who has been so hard in his attitude to the farming community in these circumstances, waking up to a small extent now to the plight in which they are and before he turns the screw a little more on some of the people he has in mind, and before the Minister turns the screw more in the way in which he is turning it, the Deputy ought to tell the Minister what exactly the conditions of local government are in Westmeath and how exactly the local authorities stand financially.</P>
    <P>The position in which the local bodies are is that, on the 30th September, they had 3.7 per cent.  of their total warrant collected.  The position on 30th September, 1931, was that £1,800,000 was outstanding; in 1932, £1,900,000; in 1933, £2,700,000; and in 1934, £3,100,000.  There was this difference that when the local bodies were waiting on 30th September, 1933, to collect £2,700,000 from the people, they were only clearing up an arrears situation of £500,000, but the local bodies waiting on 30th September last to face the collection of £3,179,000 in rates were endeavouring to deal with a situation in which they had £1,142,000 outstanding at the beginning of the year.  By methods of terrorism and threats in some parts of the country they had squeezed £700,000 out of the people in various parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister last year addressed himself on 9th October to the various councils.  He was writing about 9th <Col N="1286" /> October in respect of the position on 30th September, 1933.  He pointed out:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At this period, granted efficient collection, the proportion of the entire year's collection lodged should have amounted to one-half, but in no county has one-third been reached, and the general position is that less than one-eighth of the rates has been collected.  This position is discreditable alike to county councils, their collectors and ratepayers themselves.  Economic conditions were difficult last year, when the proportion collected at this stage amounted to one-fifth.  In the preceding year the proportion was one-fourth, while the year before showed a collection of over one-third. The retrogression disclosed cannot but reflect on all parties concerned.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, in a year in which the total amount of money collected is one-twenty-seventh, the Minister has not a word to say.  He does not dare write to the local authorities now to remind them of their duties and to threaten as to what is going to happen them and their officials if they do not collect the money that is outstanding.  The silence of the Minister to-day must be an indication that he understands the situation to some extent.  That being so, I would ask what the Minister proposes to do during the year further to assist local bodies.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that he has a sum of money withheld from local bodies to the extent of probably £900,000 in respect of old estate duty grant and old agricultural grant.  The Minister withheld, at the beginning of this year, £256,000 of agricultural grant.  In addition, he had an old outstanding liability to refund to the county councils, at the earliest possible moment, £643,000 estate duty grant.  The Minister knows sufficient of the history of the land annuity campaign to know that he has a very considerable amount of responsibility for the position in which local bodies find themselves now, as a result of the withdrawal of moneys to meet the nonpayment of land annuities.  I should like to ask the Minister what he proposes <Col N="1287" /> to do to assist the local bodies now by restoring to them some of the money which is at present withheld, and I should like him to tell the House what he has been able to ascertain with regard to the situation as a result of his experience in those counties in which he has three commissioners at the moment.  The Minister set up an inquiry in Kilkenny, an inquiry in Waterford and an inquiry in Leix, at the beginning of this year, and after very short inquiries, the whole burden of which was that the local bodies in Waterford and Kilkenny were not making any attempt to collect the rates, and that the people were well able to pay if they would only go and collect them, these bodies were superseded.  Commissioners were sent down and the commissioners set out to leave nothing undone to see that the rates were collected.  They issued public statements of the clearest and most vigorous kind to the effect that they were going to take all the steps necessary to collect the rates and to carry on the local government administration.  The <i>Irish Press</i> of 2nd July last reports that a number of Waterford farmers were summoned before the District Court in Youghal for arrears of rates.  The collector told the court that the Commissioner for Co. Waterford had given instructions that the most active steps should be taken against defaulters who had distrainable effects.  Again, on 9th July, three days afterwards, the <i>Irish Press</i> reports that, at the same court, a rate collector, in giving evidence, stated that the Commissioner intended recommending the Land Commission to take over those farms on which rates and annuities were due.  Previously, on 19th June, in the same court, the rate collector said&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;He had been notified that morning he would be dismissed, in common with other collectors in Co. Waterford, if his collection was not finished at the end of the month.  He had also received from the newly-appointed Commissioner for Co. Waterford a circular for distribution to all ratepayers in arrears warning them that <Col N="1288" /> `the full force and resources of the law will be vigorously enforced immediately, and as the heavy costs of such action will be borne by the defaulters themselves, I advise them, in their own interest, to pay their rates at once.' In one case, where there were several years' arrears, the collector said that he visited the place to make a distraint some time ago, and found that the tenant, a woman with a family of nine, had neither means nor stock.  `She should be on outdoor relief instead of being rated.' he added.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Justice asked what was the good of bringing forward arrears in such cases and the collector said it should not be done, but it was done.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All this was preceded by a statement by the Commissioner in which he said at a meeting of the Waterford Mental Hospital Committee: &ldquo;The dissolution of the Waterford County Council and my appointment as Commissioner were due principally to the disgraceful state of the rate collection in the county. I intend to concentrate for the moment on the collection of rates, and in this connection I would warn defaulters that the most active steps are about to be taken to collect the rates.&rdquo;  Then he goes on to describe what a rich county Waterford is.  Well, the Commissioner has been performing in Waterford, and we find the position in Waterford to be that on the 30th September, 1931, 47.9 per cent. of the rates was collected, while in the year 1932, when the policy of the Minister's colleagues had begun to affect the country, only 31 per cent. of the rates was collected. In 1933 the percentage had fallen to 12, and, after all the skin and hair that were going to fly in Waterford in the interests of the efficient collection of the rates and the carrying on of local government, the percentage of the rates collected on the 30th September, 1934, was 1.2.  We have it then that the percentage was 47.9 in the last year of the previous administration; 31 per cent. in 1932: 12 per cent. in 1933, and 1.2 per cent. in 1934 under the rule of the Commissioner, who was going to take the most active steps to collect the rates.  Now the Minister <Col N="1289" /> has, I forgot to mention, an equally vigorous Commissioner in South Tipperary. The position is that, in the last year of the previous administration, on the 30th September, 1931, the percentage of the rates collected in South Tipperary was 46.1.  In 1932 when, as I say, the present Government's policy had begun to affect the people responsible for paying those rates, the percentage was 26.  Last year it was 7 per cent., and under the Minister's Commissioner the percentage on the 30th September of this year is nil.  Not one halfpenny was collected out of a warrant amounting to £171,000 in County Tipperary this year.</P>

A total of £46 had been collected out of the total warrant of £89,588.</P>

As far as Leix&mdash; where there is another Commissioner&mdash; is concerned, the percentage collected in the last year of the previous administration was 23.4 of the total warrant, on the 30th September.  Then the policy of the Fianna Fáil cum Labour Party hit the farmers of Leix, and on 30th September, 1932, only 15 per cent. had been collected; in 1933 11 per cent., and in 1934, 3.7 per cent. Out of a total warrant of £121,000 which was to be collected from the unfortunate agricultural community in Leix&mdash;unfortunate because of their present condition&mdash;£4,000 was collected.</P>

      <P>If he is in touch with the Leix situation we should be glad to hear some expression of opinion from him as regards Leix, even if he cannot go further and tell us the position in regard to any other county. The Minister has settled a certain amount of money to be allocated in a particular way.  He has indicated that the way in which he has allocated part of that money is going to encourage the employment of labour.  I should like to hear Deputies discuss whether or not that is so&mdash;Deputies who, like some of the Deputies in the Labour Party or the Fianna Fáil Party go down among the people.  I should like to hear them discuss to what extent this is going to increase the employment of labour.  If we are having, as we unfortunately have, a very big depression in the wages paid to agricultural labourers in every county in this country, are we going to have <Col N="1292" /> the satisfaction of knowing there will be a bigger number employed?  Or, is the Minister talking about this, entirely divorced from any knowledge as to what the results of this Grant for employment will be?  There are counties in which it is the opinion of men who were engaged in agriculture that it is not going to do any good.  The House is particularly entitled to discuss the general situation, and to have some kind of prognostication, such as the Minister can give, as to what the financial position of the County Councils is going to to be at the end of this financial year.  There is every evidence before the Minister, as it is before us, that the people are not able to pay these amounts, and that local bodies at the beginning of December are already in serious financial difficulties.</P>

      <P>I was waiting for Deputy Davin to rise, but evidently he is waiting for a further opportunity to address the House.  In presenting this Estimate the Minister explained that he is actuated solely in the amount of rates he collects, and the manner in which it is collected, rather than in the difficulties in which the people who should pay the rates are.  I have every sympathy with the Minister in his position.  He is suffering, as his Ministerial colleagues are suffering, from the general policy of the Government. The Minister says he is actuated solely by the collection of the rates, and the amount he can get from the unfortunate and suffering ratepayers. When recently addressing the Committee of Limerick Mental Hospital, on the occasion of the inauguration of an extension of their premises&mdash; and very probably other mental hospitals will need an extension of premises in the near future, if signs and portents are any indication&mdash;the Minister, appropriately enough, made the remarkable declaration that he did not think the rates were high enough.  It was just as well it was to the representatives of the mental hospital the Minister made that remarkable declaration, because one would not like to be in the Minister's position in making it amongst a <Col N="1293" /> representative body of ratepayers. Really, if that is the view of the Minister, any argument of ours for the alleviation of the sufferings of the ratepayers will have very little effect.</P>

      <P>I do not want to enter into statistical explanations on this debate but, when introducing the Estimate, the Minister said that there was a common complaint that sufficient inducement was not given to give employment.  Is there any particular inducement being given by the Minister to-day to employers generally in the agricultural community to increase employment?  The method of allocation of the Agricultural Grant that the Minister pursues will not have any effect in increasing the amount of employment given by farmers.  The Minister made great play with a particular statement, that more was given this year than ever in relief of rates. He quoted what was given in previous years.  In 1925, when, by the way, Cumann na nGaedheal was in office the Agricultural Grant was doubled, and in 1931 it practically reached £2,000,000&mdash; £1,948,011.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1932 the present Government increased the grant, but in 1933-34 the farmers of this State were muleted in £448,000.  The grant is now a small amount greater than it was in 1931.  Can any honest comparison be made between the conditions of the farmers <Col N="1294" /> generally and their ability to pay rates between 1931 and 1934?  If £1,948,011 did not suffice to give farmers adequate relief&mdash;and Deputies on the opposite benches joined with Deputies on this side in proclaiming at that period that the sum actually given in relief of rates was not sufficient&mdash;can the Minister make any case whatever why £100,000 more at this period is at all sufficient, or that the condition of farmers has been in any way improved by his exertions? Even if the amount is insufficient, is the method of distribution equitable?  The Minister stated that a change was made because the Government did not consider the old system satisfactory, as relief was given whether a man used his land to advantage or not.  That may have been so. But what are the advantages of the new system of distributing this relief? There has to be an allowance first for people whose valuation is £20.  They are to get the principal relief under this method.  It is a notable fact that in the counties where the collection of rates is most difficult valuations are highest.  That applies particularly to dairying counties like Limerick, Tipperary and contiguous counties, where the average rateable valuation is much higher than the West of Ireland, and in other parts, where dairying is not carried on to any considerable extent. The present method of relief will affect a much fewer number in these counties than in other places.  In alluding to that, I should like to say to the Minister that the method of giving relief on the basis of employment is not an equitable one in the dairying counties.  Relief is given according to the number of male employees employed by any particular farmer. Every Deputy knows that in the counties where dairying is carried on the number of women employed&mdash;who have to be employed in the dairying industry&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as to the number of women employed in the dairying industry.  It might affect the argument as to whether the intervention of the Revenue Commissioners succeeded in adding to the number of women employed in the dairying industry. Under the Minister's system no relief is given for women employees.  In the County Limerick, which I represent, and in the neighbouring counties of Tipperary and Cork, and other dairying counties, thousands of women are employed in that particular industry for whom the farmers will get no relief whatever.  If that is an equitable distribution of a grant in relief of rates, then it is difficult to argue the matter.  The average farmer in a county like Limerick, say, of 40 acres, with 20 cows, has as many female employees, and possibly more, as he has male employees, and his relief under the head of employment would be very small, while in another county, where farmers do not engage in a similar occupation, a farmer similarly <Col N="1296" /> situated would get treble the relief or, perhaps, more, than a farmer in that county would get.</P>
      <P>In the counties where the greatest difficulty is experienced by the Minister and the collectors in getting the rates paid, the difficulties of the farmers are greater than those of farmers situated elsewhere, notwithstanding that there has been an effort on the part of various Ministers to prove that the farmers carrying on dairying are more prosperous than any others farmers.  Up to this no Minister has been able to sustain that argument; no Minister has definitely been able to stand up to the statements made in that respect.  It has been definitely proved in this House and outside that the position of the dairying farmers, if not worse, is at least as bad as that of the farmers carrying on any other branch of agriculture.  The Minister for Agriculture challenged me a couple of days ago in this House, aided and abetted by Deputy Davin, to repeat certain statements down amongst the farmers in the country that I made in this House.  If the Minister, accompanied by Deputy Davin, chooses to come with me to any agricultural audience in the counties of Limerick or Tipperary, I shall be very happy to accompany them and make the same statement there that I made in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I put that definite challenge to Deputy Davin and the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;that I shall accompany them before an audience of farmers and repeat the statements, word for word, that I made in this House and let the Minister or Deputy Davin disprove them.  Deputy Mulcahy referred to the difficulty that the farmers meet with in disposing of their <Col N="1297" /> produce and stock, and quoted from a statement made by some farmer that his cattle had gone lame from travelling. That is a general grievance amongst farmers.  Personally, I have had cattle in three recent fairs&mdash;Kilmallock, Bruff and Limerick&mdash;and in none of these did I receive a single bid for any of the cattle.  There are thousands of unfortunate farmers in a similar position, and if they cannot dispose of their produce how are they going to pay rates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty found in paying rates is not confined to the farmers.  I hope Deputy Davin will bear this in mind; that the rate arrears in the southern counties are just as common, and possibly more so, amongst the holders of labourers' cottages, as amongst farmers.  Unfortunately, the poor possessor of a labourer's cottage has his rates included in his rent; at least that is the position in the county I represent.  His rate is collected with his rent and he cannot well pay one without paying the other; so that he is pressed and harassed in a manner that, possibly, the farmer is not; and the difficulty is much greater in the case of a man in his position than in the case of the farmer.  In my county, for seven weeks, up to last week or the week before, at any rate, none of the workers under the county council had received any wages.  I suppose some of these people were expected to contribute punctually to the payment of the 1934-35 rate.  These unfortunate people, who were honestly working for the local council, expecting to be paid, had been waiting for seven weeks and received no payment whatever.  Their lot, bad as it is, is not perhaps as bad as that of thousands of their brethren who have no work; who have not even the satisfaction of knowing that, if they wait long enough, they will get some wages.  Many of these are in arrears with their rates, and some of them are threatened with eviction.  I myself within the last month contributed to a collection made on behalf of the occupant of a labourer's cottage who was unable to pay his rent and rates and was about to be evicted. Perhaps in his case the amount due was extravagant; but the man's <Col N="1298" /> actual circumstances and his condition were unfortunate.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that landowners who did not make sufficient use of their lands would be well advised to take note.  Take note of what?  Is this meant in the light of a threat&mdash; that if they do not pay their rates some particular infliction is going to be imposed upon them.  I suppose it means that the land will be taken from them.  But even if it is, even should the land be taken from the farmers who will not pay the rates, the position will not be improved because the man who gets it will be in exactly a similar position to the men who have it now; they will be in exactly a similar position to the man who has a half an acre plot or the man with a thousand acres&mdash;they will be unable to pay.  They will all find it equally difficult to pay the demands made on them in the matter of rates. The Minister in his explanatory statement left the question of the credit note to the last.  The final relief is to be made by a method of credit notes. These credit notes are only available if the rates are paid by the 31st March next.  In other words unless the unfortunate ratepayer pays his rates by the 31st March next he loses the amount of his credit note.</P>
    <P>I venture to predict that there will be thousands of farmers and thousands of labourers who will be unable to pay their rates by the 31st March. Those particular credit notes will be of little use to them unless the time is extended.  Perhaps it would be as well now if the Minister would make a statement now that the credit notes will be available after the 31st March next.  Otherwise a certain portion of the amount that the House is now discussing will never reach a big proportion of the ratepayers in general. As far as one can see anything ahead there is very little probability that the state of the rate collection next March will be anything better than it is now.  In fact it is likely to be worse.  A number of people holding credit notes will find, unless the time is extended, that these notes will be of no further use to them.  The number of such people is likely to be very <Col N="1299" /> great.  These are the main points that I would ask the Minister to take particular note of&mdash;first, that the relief, as far as it pertains to employment, should be extended to employers of women labour as well as to employers of men labour.  If it is not then the relief given under this vote will not be equitable.  In many counties employers employ more men than women.  In many farms there are more women employed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is protesting his ignorance.  The Deputy sometimes interrupts intelligently.  On this particular occasion he has not interrupted intelligently.  The rate of wages paid in Limerick and Tipperary to women milkers is about on a par with the rate paid to men.  They receive practically the same amount although the farmers got a definite hint from the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that 6/- or 7/- a week would provide suitable recompense to women workers in dairy farming and that women should be employed in preference to men. Notwithstanding that, however, the unfortunate farmers kept on a few men.  They kept on a great number of women at men's wages.  Does the Minister suggest that dairy farmers should get rid altogether of their women workers?  If there is any portion of the agricultural industry that provides work in general for the family it is the dairying industry.  That industry provides work for the men, the women and the children of the family. Because, as Deputy Corry knows full well, many of the children are employed on dairy farms at work which men or women would not be expected to do&mdash; for instance taking milk to the creamery.  Many young people are engaged at that work.  Deputy Donnelly will not suggest that driving a donkey to the creamery is very <Col N="1300" /> onerous work.  Many young workers are thus employed.  Notwithstanding that, nevertheless, the relief given to dairy farmers under this grant-in-aid is not an equitable one.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister now to make some change in the arrangements for the distribution of this grant before next March.  Otherwise the position with regard to some dairy farmers will be that they will not be getting the relief that the other farmers are getting.  My second point is that the credit note should be extended beyond the 31st March.  No reasonable Deputy supposes that the great bulk of the farmers will be in a position to pay the balance of their rates before then.  It is unfair to hold out a threat to them that if they do not pay they will lose a certain part of the grant that this House is now voting to them.  That is an unfair proposition to make to the farmers. Surely at this time when no farmer is in a position to pay his rates, and when everybody knows the difficulty there is about the disposing of agricultural produce such a condition should not be allowed to prevail.  It is monstrous that this House should stand for such a method of allocating this grant.</P>
      <P>Anything further that I might say will not, I suppose, have any effect on the Minister.  Perhaps he may be induced by a little argument to alter the method of allocation and to extend the date in the credit notes.  I hope I will be supported by some Deputies on the Fianna Fáil Benches in impressing on the Minister these two points&mdash;the relief in the case of the female workers and the extension of the credit notes after the 31st March.  Where the female workers are paid a reasonable wage the employer should get relief in their case as well as in the case of the male worker.  I do not see any reason why Deputies on the Government Benches should not back me in these two points.  The people of the country will expect that much from Deputies who represent farming communities. I do hope this co-operation from the Fianna Fáil Deputies will be readily given.</P>

      <P>They appear to be satisfied that the situation that confronts the country at the present time is one towards which they cannot make any contribution.  Having embarked upon a policy which has landed the country in the condition in which it is, the Local Government and Public Health Department say there is no responsibility on them to get the people out of this position.  To my mind, the Ministry of Local Government and Public Health is the most responsible Ministry in the country.  There is a dual responsibility there&mdash;a responsibility that is not really carried by any other Minister.  The Ministry must interest itself in the prosperity of the main industry of the country, because it is both on the prosperity and the continuance of prosperity that local government can flourish or indeed continue to carry on at all.  There is no other Department in the State which is such a tell-tale of progress or decay as is the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  The state of affairs which exists at the present time and as disclosed by the rate collections all over the country is most alarming. Even the silence of the members of the Fianna Fáil Party cannot allay the alarm which, I am sure, the Front Bench of the Fianna Fáil Party must feel at the situation.  We have in practically every county an outcry for increased bank overdrafts.  That is not customary at this time of the year.  It is not the normal condition of things. The responsibility rests upon the Minister for Local Government to come to the assistance of the councils and local authorities in some way.  I maintain that there is an obligation on the Minister to do that over and above the ordinary obligations which the Minister is supposed to bear.  Let me take the case of the Council of the County of Roscommon. According to a question put to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health some time ago, there was withheld from that Council over a period of years, dating back as far as <Col N="1302" /> 1922, £32,141, out of the Excise grants, for the purpose of meeting the amounts due by defaulting tenant purchasers. There was refunded to the Council £10,000 odd, leaving a balance of £21,000.  In 1934, deductions were made from the grants amounting to £9,000. At the present time, there is withheld for one cause or another from the County Council of Roscommon over £18,000, taking into account the fact that £12,136 was recently received by the County Council on foot of the £300,000 which was supposed to be made available to the county councils and which was made available to some extent.  I do not know whether or not it was made available fully.  That was in connection with the 1933 Land Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to that, the position in which the county councils find themselves is due entirely to the agricultural situation.  People are at a loss to know&mdash;particularly those in charge of the administration of county councils and boards of health&mdash;why the agricultural grant is not being paid in the usual way.  I presume that the Minister will tell us that and make county councils aware that, although the annuities have been halved, the country has reached such an impasse&mdash;such a state of decay has set in&mdash;that the money which would ordinarily be accruing to county councils is being withheld to meet deficiencies of annuities. In our county, out of practically £68,000 of agricultural grant notified to us, we have, up to date, received only £19,000.  We are supposed to put the screw on the ratepayers to see that public services are maintained while the Government itself owes us practically £49,000.  That is the position in which we are in Roscommon at present. In addition, an extraordinary thing has recently happened&mdash;a thing which we never had experience of before. The county surveyor's requisitions for moneys due to him for road grants have not been paid in full.  The Local Government Department, for some reason known to itself, has been shortening those demands and paying the county surveyor less than he has asked.  That has caused the funds of Roscommon County Council to be called upon to meet demands which <Col N="1303" /> would otherwise be met out of the road grants.  It is interfering with the ordinary funds of the council.</P>
    <P>It is an extraordinary commentary on the Government's policy, considering that they have endeavoured, through the allocation of the grants, to assist employment, that in County Roscommon recently, when ten labourers' cottages in rural districts were advertised for letting, the board of health had only two applicants. These cottages were all in districts where people would be supposed to be looking forward to holding a piece of land and to employment.  That is an extraordinary commentary on the Government's housing policy and on their attempted assistance of employment. But that is the case.  When the Government told the country that they were going to endeavour to assist employment by making special allowances in the rates to those people who employed labour, there was a great flourish of trumpets and, from various platforms, the new system of allocation of grants was hailed with delight as a great advance in the interests of labour.  What did it really represent? In our county there is a distinction of 2/2 in the £ between the rates of the man who employed labour and the man who did not.  In other words, the man who did employ labour got a present of 25/- or 26/-.  He was supposed to employ a labouring man all the year round at a wage of £26, which is the wage usually paid in our county to a man living in.  The farmer was supposed to employ a man and pay him £26 a year, living in, in order to get a reduction in his rates of 22/-, 23/- or 25/-.  That is the position.  The real situation with regard to wages is disclosed in the Returns of Agricultural Wages, wherein it is shown that, since the year 1931, there has been an average drop in Saorstát Eireann of 3/3 per week.  These are not my figures.  These are the figures of the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>

I maintain that there are some anomalies in this Bill, particularly in respect of subsection (3) of Section 13.  I should like the Minister to say whether a county council is obliged to use credit notes or has any option in the matter.  According to this section &ldquo;the county council of a county may, with the sanction of the Minister, decide ...&rdquo; so-and-so. Might I, at this stage, ask the Minister if some councils have not adopted the credit system, while others have?  That question makes a great difference to the ratepayers who are unable to pay their rates.  I should like to have the position clarified if the Minister is agreeable to do so now.</P>

If the rates are to be carried forward against individuals, surely they ought to get credit to the amount of the notes.</P>

      <P>If it was really known, I do not think that the credit note system would have been taken up at all.  I think there ought to be some solution found in this matter.  I think a very grave injustice is inflicted upon men who cannot pay their rates. Under Section 14 of the Bill, the Minister is reserving to himself the right to extend the period for payment in which these credit notes would be available.  That seems an absolute necessity.  What about people who paid their rates in 1932, 1933 and in April, 1934.  These people lost their credit notes, and some provision should be made for them.</P>

      <P>I understand that but the principle in this Bill was not operated last year.  The Minister stuck to a fixed date.  At that time the people did not know what a credit note was but he stuck rigidly to the 31st March.  At the present time the position disclosed by the rate collection is so unsatisfactory that I think it does not need any advocate from these benches, or anywhere else, to show to the Minister that something ought to be done to make up to the county councils for the amount of money withheld for years; that is, if the present situation is temporary.  If it is not temporary, but is going to be a continuing situation, in regard to the main industry of this country, then I am afraid that temporary suggestions will be of no use. I impress upon the Minister further that there is a responsibility on him and, also, that there is a responsibility particularly upon the Minister for Agriculture, with regard to the main industry of this country, and that if the rates are not paid the Minister for Local Government ought to endeavour to find out why they are not paid.  He ought to endeavour to get at the cause of it and remove the cause.  There is no use in attempting to bolster up a position such as we have at the present time.  You must find a solution for it somewhere, and unless you can find a solution for it, well, then, I have very little hope for the future of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Few as they are, Deputies on the Fianna Fáil Benches may not relish them.  First of all, I should like to know from the Minister what is the comparative position of the farmer, say, in Kilkenny, to whom the Minister referred&mdash;the farmer with a holding of £50 valuation who employs his brother and one paid labourer on his holding&mdash; compared with his position on the old basis of distribution of the agricultural grant.  I think that before we can arrive at any reasoned judgment on the merits of this proposal, comparative figures of that kind must be made available, not only in the case of a man employing one labourer but in the case of a man employing a number of labourers.  It seems to me that the Government attitude on the question of part-time employment of men in agriculture, and their determination to make no allowance in their respect, shows, on their part, an ignorance of normal agricultural procedure which is deplorable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister really desires to promote employment and to promote methods of agriculture which involve the employment of agricultural labour, he must do so in a practical way and must realise that if men are going to save a crop of hay, or of roots, or of corn, or if they are going to go in for that type of agriculture at all, they will employ ordinarily at the harvest a very large number of men in order to save the harvest within the period of good weather.  He will also realise that it is perfectly futile to suggest that any farmer, taking on labourers in harvest time, should keep them all the year round.  It is equally futile to suggest that any farmer could harvest his crops with the same number of employees with whom he should, and actually does, carry on the normal month-to-month activities on his holding.  If you really want to stimulate those types of <Col N="1309" /> agriculture that involve employment of comparatively large numbers of men, you ought to make an allowance for part-time employees, because they are an essential part of crop-raising economics.</P>
    <P>Those are two of the points I wanted to deal with.  Now, I want to deal with a third point.  The Minister, when the rates collection began to present a problem, proceeded to dissolve certain county councils and to send out commissioners, and the commissioners were clearly instructed to go out to the country and raise the scare of a conspiracy not to pay rates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is perfectly true. What about Deputy Minch's speech in Monasterevan?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Has Deputy Donnelly finished &ldquo;clocking&rdquo;?  Because, if he has, he can get up after me and flap his wings and crow.  In the meantime, let him continue to hatch his eggs in silence.  As I was saying, the commissioners were sent out with the idea of raising the scare of a conspiracy not to pay rates, and they desired to create the general impression that there was no reason whatever why the rates should not be paid.  All the Fianna Fáil Deputies then shook their heads and said: &ldquo;Quite right.  Now we are going to see something done.&rdquo;  And everybody waited, full of expectations.  Then the position of the rate collections was published, and all the Fianna Fáil Deputies, with virtue oozing from their persons, hastened to demonstrate to the world that wherever the Fianna Fáil army was firmly entrenched the rates would be paid up to date and that the faithful followers of the Great White Chief would make whatever sacrifice might be necessary to pay the rates on the nail in order to show their love for de Valera.  What transpired?  The first county in the return to show itself either unable or unwilling to pay one single penny of rates is the County Clare.  Dev's stronghold!  The cradle of Fianna Fáil! The heart of Cathleen Ni Houlihan! The county that was described by one enthusiastic Fianna Fáil member of the County Council as <Col N="1310" /> the Banner County of Irish Republicanism !</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of Fianna Fáil, to the effect that there is a &ldquo;No Rates&rdquo; campaign, is pure moonshine.  The fact is that you are all closing your eyes to what is wrong.  You are all behaving like a whole collection of ostriches with your heads stuck in the sand.  The fact is that the rates are not being paid in Clare, because the people of Clare cannot afford to pay them.  That must be true, or else President de Valera's supporters in Clare are all hypocrites and frauds.  They will go out and bawl &ldquo;Up de Valera!&rdquo; at the cross-roads, and they will vote for him.  They will even vote for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Department of Lands and Fisheries, and that demands some sacrifice of commonsense.  They will even vote for him, but when it comes to doing something concrete, such as putting down the cash when President de Valera says that it is essential for the welfare of the State that they should pay up, what do they contribute? Not one farthing! Is it that <Col N="1311" /> they are unable to pay?  I believe they are unable.  Or is it that they are typical of the support of Fianna Fáil throughout the country&mdash;loud-mouthed hypocrisy?</P>

      <P>They will not contribute that moral support of paying their rates, because it costs 3/- or 4/- per man to do it.  That is a dilemma out of which the Minister for Local Government and Public Health must get himself.  One or other of those theories must be correct.  Now, there might be some peculiar circumstances in Clare which would explain the inability of the Banner County to meet the just demands of their beloved representative, President de Valera. But Councillor MacMahon&mdash;F.F. in brackets&mdash;took the field at the Clare County Council.  He was there asked to support a resolution drawing the Government's attention to the inability of the people of Clare to meet the rate collector's demand, because they were suffering acutely in the economic struggle.  Now Mr. MacMahon is full of purposeful patriotism when it comes to voting for a resolution, and he rose and said that &ldquo;the adoption of the resolution would create chaos, because the people would expect some fairy wand would be waved and the institution maintained hereafter without their being asked to contribute.  They could not blind their eyes to the fact that there were hardships on the people, but let not the Banner County be the first to put up the white flag.&rdquo;  He would not put up the white flag, but he would not pay his rates.  Mr. MacMahon was full of patriotic fervour, but he would not pay even 6/8.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, he may have none to pay, but he might get his supporters and friends to pay.  The position is that no one in Clare has paid his rates.  I think it is peculiarly typical of Clare that while they were not prepared to raise the white flag, but were prepared to stand behind Cathleen Ni Houlihan, the one thing that costs a few shillings to the country is the thing that they are not prepared to do. Some peculiar circumstances may have arisen in Clare which would explain the state of affairs there.  I now pass on to the other fortress of patriotic fervour, the County of Kerry&mdash;the Kingdom&mdash;where the I.R.A. formed fours.  The warrant there amounts to £133,700, and after great scraping in the whole of the Kingdom of Kerry £29 was collected.  Is there a conspiracy in Kerry not to pay rates?  Are the supporters of Deputy Crowley, Deputy Flynn and Deputy Kissane in a conspiracy not to pay rates, and, if so, have these loyal Deputies been called to a reckoning with the President in his office?  If they have not been so called, are they going to be prosecuted for organising a conspiracy in the County Kerry not to pay rates? Perhaps Deputy Flynn's wee gun that he was asked by somebody to lend to somebody else has been at work in order to prevent the payment of rates in the County Kerry.  We all remember in this House Deputy's Flynn's embarrassment when a letter was read requesting a friend of his to lend to another friend a wee gun.  I wonder has that wee gun been in operation in the County Kerry?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to find some reason why the rates in the County Kerry have not been paid.  The Minister's commissioners have gone to Waterford, Tipperary and Kilkenny, and they say that there is a dark conspiracy to prevent the payment of rates but what are the facts?  None of the counties which I have mentioned are a bit worse than the Banner County <Col N="1313" /> of Clare or the ultra patriotic Kingdom of Kerry.  Is the Minister going to explain to the satisfaction of this House why it is that there is conspiracy in one county not to pay rates and just inability in another?  Why is it that where President de Valera's supporters reside it is inability to pay, and where the supporters of Fine Gael reside it is a dark conspiracy not to pay, and where the non-payment of them is made the subject of prosecutions before the Military Tribunal?  Why are not the military, the tanks and the recent additions to the police force sent down to Clare or to Kerry to deal with the situation?  The conditions that obtain in Kerry and in Clare obtain in every other county in the State, and it is that the decent, respectable farmers who have always paid their rates have been made unable to pay them as a result of the activities of the Fianna Fáil Government.  There is no use in sending lorries and military and secret police or spies down to any of these counties.  There will be no necessity for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands to send down the battering ram, the bailiff or the evicting gang to any of these counties if he and his colleagues will give the people the chance to earn a livelihood. If they get that chance they will pay their way as they have always done. If the Minister and his colleagues are going to create a situation wherein these people cannot earn a livelihood then neither his bailiffs nor his battering rams will get out of them what they have not got to give.</P>

      <P>It is better that I should speak hard words, so that the Government may be warned of the direction in which they are wandering perhaps inadvertently.  I have too high a respect even for Deputy Donnelly to believe that he will be a party to the employment of the battering ram in this country, or of the evicting gang. I believe there are some Deputies on the benches opposite with sufficient independence left to them still to resist that.  The Deputy will remember that his colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands, <Col N="1314" /> sat silent yesterday when I asked him if it was proposed to evict a widow woman and her family because she was unable to pay the demands that the State was making on her.  He did not deny that he was going to do it, or would try to do it, but I have every confidence that if such an attempt were made in that case or in any group of cases, that Deputy Donnelly and a few of the Deputies who sit with him&mdash; Deputies reared in the country, and who know the conditions in the country &mdash;would not help the Government to do it.  It is much better that we should ventilate that now, before so mad an enterprise is embarked upon.  Deputy Donnelly and his colleagues should warn the Government that they are not going to be made parties to the use of the battering ram or of the evicting gang.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am angling to nail the Deputy's ear to the post and I have reason to hope that he is not going to lend his support to that.  I have often said that there are a great many who have not the wherewithal to pay their rates.  Let me call evidence in support of that thesis.  It is unnecessary to deal here with the income of the agricultural community, because that has been referred to on many occasions in this House.  Deputies know as well as I do that the income of the farming community has been halved in the last two years, and is steadily dwindling. Take the figures for outdoor relief, which is only given to destitute persons.  There is a statutory obligation on local authorities to give outdoor relief, but that only arises when the danger of hunger accrues, so that we are not dealing with a variable class of persons.  We are dealing only with that class of persons who are immediately threatened with hunger and destitution, and who turn to the local authorities for protection from that threat.  In 1931 the average weekly outdoor relief paid in Saorstát Eireann was £11,000. That was a sufficient sum to protect every individual in this State <Col N="1315" /> threatened with destitution, from destitution and hunger.  Then we had a year of the Fianna Fáil Government, and the amount of outdoor relief paid rose to £12,956.</P>

      <P>In 1933, the weekly outdoor relief rose to £16,200.  Then in 1934, we have the impact of the Unemployment Assistance Act, which takes a very considerable burden off the rates.  I think Deputy Briscoe will agree with that.  A very large burden was taken off the local rates by the Unemployment Assistance Act.  In fact, one would imagine that every able-bodied person in receipt of outdoor relief would be taken off the outdoor relief list by the Unemployment Assistance Act, but after that Act has been put into operation what do we discover? That the only effect it has succeeded in bringing about is to leave the home assistance relief bill much larger than it was in 1931 before the Unemployment Assistance Act was introduced at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately a very large body of the occupiers of agricultural land are getting home assistance because they are in a state of destitution. I refer to the case which was reported in the newspapers very recently in which a rate collector went to the house of a woman with five children. He sued her and brought her before the courts.  She came before the court and explained her position, and the comment of the District Justice was: &ldquo;This woman should never have been sued.  She is entitled to outdoor relief, but she is sued in this court as a ratepayer.&rdquo;  I am making the complaint that the burden here is in direct relation <Col N="1316" /> to the relief being provided under this Bill.  I am making the case that the Government has converted hundreds and thousands of farmers in this country from self-supporting, self-respecting members of the community into dole getters and individuals who are living on outdoor relief, and that, at the same time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Surely I am making the case that the farmers of the country have been reduced to destitution by the Minister and the present proposal for their relief is ineffective and inadequate because, in fact, they have been reduced to destitution by the Minister. I further make the case that his suggestion, that their failure to pay rates to-day is due to a conspiracy not to do so, is all pure nonsense, and I make that directly relevant to his proposal that the credit note should become valueless if it is not used before March, 1935.  It is necessary that we should face facts, because Fianna Fáil propaganda at the present time suggests that a great boon is going to be conferred on the agricultural community by the Minister under this Bill. In fact, not only is any appreciable advantage not being conferred upon the agricultural community by this Bill, but the agricultural community is being reduced to absolute destitution and ruin by the Minister, taking his whole policy into purview.  I put it to the Minister that the sooner he and his colleagues wake up to what is happening under their very noses the better it will be for the country, because the longer this process of attrition goes on the more catastrophic will be its results.  There is no reason why the whole business should not be settled and why all the difficulties in connection with rate collection should not be overcome. There is only one way of doing it, and that is to restore to the people the capacity to meet their obligations. You will be able to get rates in Clare and in Kerry just as well as in Waterford and Tipperary.  In the meantime, in the name of justice, do not go around the country alleging that the farmer who lives in Waterford and in Tipperary, and who is a supporter of Fine Gael, is a conspirator and a dastard because he is unable to pay, <Col N="1318" /> while the farmer who lives in Kerry and Clare is a patriot and a self-sacrificing individual because he shouts &ldquo;Up de Valera&rdquo; and keeps his rates in his pocket.</P>

      <P>There could be nothing more reasonable than that.  I hope <Col N="1319" /> the Minister's explanation will be more convincing than that of the Minister for Agriculture when I put him a query some days ago.  He said he did not believe what I alleged to be true, because it was too silly.  He declared that President de Valera could not have said what I alleged he said, because it was too silly.  The Minister for Agriculture has consulted the references I gave him and he has discovered to his horror that silly and all as it was, the President said it. I hope that the Minister for Local Government will not try to explain the figures in Clare and Kerry on the grounds that they are not true because they look too silly.  Unfortunately, they are just as true as the allegation I made about the President of the Executive Council.  You cannot get out of that dilemma.  It is unanswerable and yet it has to be met.  If you take the view that those people cannot pay, you must turn your minds to the reasons why they cannot pay.  If you have any moral courage, when you find those reasons you will at once set out to correct them.  I very much doubt if any of you have any moral courage.  Your reaction to it will be to shout &ldquo;Up the Republic,&rdquo;&ldquo;We are fighting John Bull and we will not put up the white flag.&rdquo;  You will collect on your various contracts, your tobacco contracts, your wheat bounty contracts and your beet contracts, and, having collected that money, you will all shout: &ldquo;Up de Valera,&rdquo; as well many of you might.

The last time we had a statesmanlike contribution from Deputy Breen the whole front bench opposite fainted; he almost gave the President apoplexy.  I invite the Deputies who are so anxious to interrupt me to <Col N="1320" /> intervene in the discussion and present the House and the country with their theories of why the people in Clare and Kerry have not paid a penny rates.  My theory is that they cannot pay because you have made them destitute.  I suggest to Deputy Corry, and particularly Deputy Breen, that they might usefully intervene. I would like to hear Deputy Breen on this, to learn his opinion why the people of Clare and Kerry have paid virtually nothing in respect of rates which the Minister for Local Government declares are essential to the good government and continued welfare of the country.</P>

He was going to tell him &ldquo;without yielding my position I would not ask them to yield theirs.&rdquo;  Finally he said that the whole matter could be argued before the International Court of Justice.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>They included teachers, clergymen, dispensary doctors, and even the staff of the county council could not pay their rates because they had received orders from the Blueshirt organisation not to pay.  They could not go around to the unfortunate farmers and tell them to pay their rates while the dispensary doctors were not paying theirs.  That is why the rates were not paid.  They were not paid until the back was broken of this kind of society that has been carrying on that game.  Those people who have all the sympathy for the unfortunate ratepayers send out their gangs at night to cut trees, telegraph wires, knock down bridges, block trains and put on more cost on the unfortunate ratepayers whom they say are unable to pay their rates.  That is the game. One gentleman, according to the daily Press, said he was acting under the orders of the League of Youth.  He was putting a further burden on the unfortunate ratepayers by cutting trees and telegraph poles.  When they have done all that they say: &ldquo;I am very sorry, Sir; I acted on bad advice.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That has been the position brought about by Deputies who went down the country last year warning the people publicly not to pay their rates.  That campaign, however, failed and, as proof of that, I can tell the House that, in the three days before 31st March of this year, there was lodged in the offices of the Cork County Council £98,000 in rates.  They sold their blue shirts for 19/10 of a credit note.  These are the patriots&mdash;the men who advised the people not to pay their rates were also sold for 19/10 of a credit note which expired on 31st March and they paid in £98,000 in rates in the three days preceding that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have Deputies here to-day boasting of the result of that policy one after the other and getting up with their tongues in their cheeks and saying: &ldquo;The poor people cannot pay.&rdquo; Then we had a veiled attack on the new system by which the farmer who cultivates his land and employs labour gets more relief in respect of rates than the individual who leaves his <Col N="1323" /> land derelict.  I have only one regret in this matter.  I think it unfair that the enormous sum of £400,000 should be still available for relief of rates on land on which no employment is being given.  I think that is a matter that should be looked into and I am glad to say that the Cork County Council unanimously sent a request to the Minister that they be allowed use their share of that sum of £400,000 in the same manner as the Minister had used the other portion, namely, in relief of land according to the amount of employment provided.  I would suggest to the Minister that that change should be made.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot of noise as to the reason why the rates were not being paid.  We all know the reason why the rates are slow this year.  The rates are slow on account of the working in of this new system which delayed the issue of warrants for at least four or five months.  In 99 cases out of 100, warrants were issued only in the month of November and the figures read out here to-day were in respect of the period three or four days after the issue of the warrants, and before they were issued at all, in the case of County Clare, County Kerry and other counties.  I heard an argument between Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Davin to-day on that matter but the fact is that £47,000 out of £112,000 have been paid as against the £3,000 quoted by Deputy Mulcahy.  The rates are coming in. Another matter which falls very heavily on the community, and to prevent which, I think, the Minister for Local Government should take steps, is the cost of the wholesale outrages that are being committed on the advice of the Party opposite through the country.  The burden of the cost of these outrages falls on the ratepayers.  Where the individuals committing the outrages are a mark for the money and when a man is caught cutting a tree, he, and not the unfortunate ratepayers, should be compelled to pay for the tree he cuts.</P>

      <P>That is the actual position with regard to the reason why the rate has not been collected.  One suggestion I would make to the Minister is that, on account of the late issue of the warrants this year, which is largely not the fault of the county councils concerned, he should be a little more liberal in the payment of the Agricultural Grant in the earlier portion of the year.  County councils are very hard hit in the matter of overdrafts on account of that particular issue, and I think the Minister ought to do his utmost in that regard.  I do not intend to delay the House further. I merely rose to give the facts as they are when I heard the arguments from the other side.</P>

      <P>As so much has been said about the Banner County, I feel, having the honour of being one of the representatives of the constituency which elected the President, that I should say a few words.  I should like, first of all, to say that there is no conspiracy in Clare against the payment of either rates or annuities, and I must corroborate Deputy Dillon when he says that little, or none at all, of the rates has been paid so far this year.  Our rate for this year is £102,636, and very little, if any, has been paid so far.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>They were issued a month or two ago, but whenever they were issued, we are asked to pay the first moiety on the last day of this month, and we are asked to pay the complete year's rate within the next three months or so, in order to qualify for this credit note.  I suppose that credit note can be described as either an inducement to, or a compulsion on, the ratepayers to pay, but the position in Clare, as I know it, is that we are selling good two-year-old cattle at from 50/- to £3 and £3 10s., and two <Col N="1325" /> years ago they were worth at least £10 or £12.  The women in that county were selling turkeys a few days ago at 5d. a lb., and two years ago they received 1/3 a lb. for them.  The only little industry we can claim to have in County Clare is the rearing of store cattle, turkeys and pigs, together with the little advantage we derive from creameries established by Deputy Paddy Hogan, the former Minister for Agriculture.  In my area we built a creamery five years ago, and the first payment we got in that creamery was 1/7½ per lb. for butter fat, and to-day we are receiving the noble sum of 9d. That is more or less due to the recent levy imposed by the Government and to the reduction of 2/- per cwt. in the price of butter.</P>
      <P>We are asked to employ extra labourers on the farms.  I should like to know for what purpose.  Can any Deputy say what the farmer can produce at the moment that will pay him for his labour?  I believe that, bad and all as the position of the labourers is, they are better off than their masters at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that in County Clare, we had only one factory and that is the creamery.  We have no beet in County Clare and we have very little wheat.  Two-thirds of the county cannot grow either beet or wheat, so that this litter of baby white elephants will not be any use to the people of County Clare.  We will not grow beet&mdash;we are unable to do so&mdash;and we are more or less unable to grow wheat.  As regards the rates, the people of County Clare who elected the President were under the impression at the time that there would be complete de-rating of agricultural land and now the only consolation we have&mdash;and we heard it very recently&mdash; is that rates should be increased.  The people of the county which I have the honour to represent are prepared to pay their rates but we want to be put in a position to pay.  Our fairs and markets are a thing of the past.  We have nothing else to depend on there. We have no factory of any kind.  I would suggest to the Ministry that the <Col N="1326" /> only remedy, in order to enable the people to pay, is to settle this so-called economic war.  I believe, as an Irishman&mdash;and I claim to be as Irish as the other good Irishmen who sit on the other benches&mdash;that we all should co-operate at least in setting this thing called an economic war.  I believe it can be settled in an honourable fashion, without making any sacrifices of our Irish nationality or of our Irish principles. I would say that the sooner it is settled the better and the more creditable to all concerned, because it will settle itself whether we like it or not.</P>

I think the sooner it is settled the more creditable it would be to the President, because, as I have just said, it will have to settle itself if it is not settled by somebody very soon.

      <P>I do not think, in concluding the debate, that I need say a great lot with reference to the speeches that have been delivered, mostly from the Opposition Benches.  We have rambled very far afield in this debate.  The economic war was, as one would naturally expect, dragged in.  One would have thought that on the subject of rates alone&mdash;it is an important subject&mdash;and local government in general, one would have had enough to deal with on a Bill of this kind, without rambling even as far as Deputy Bennett did.  He is not such a rambler, as far as my recollection of him goes, but he certainly took a fairly wide scope in dealing with this measure.  It struck me, in listening to some of the speeches, that the Deputies had not gone to the trouble of reading the Bill, because while Deputy Mulcahy, who started off referred once or twice to the Bill, he did so only in a vague kind of way. He never made any reference whatever to the amount of the Agricultural Grant of this year.  He did tell us all we were not doing for agriculture.  He told us all about the speeches made at a dozen different county council meetings, and about speeches made by District Justices, but he paid very little attention to the Bill itself.  Deputy Bennett, I must say, paid more attention to it than almost anybody, because he did make one or two suggestions as to where, according to him, the Bill might be amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a lot of talk about the amount of rates that has been collected this year.  I said in my opening speech on the Second Reading of the Bill that there had been delay this year&mdash;and <Col N="1328" /> delay was necessary this year&mdash;in introducing this Bill for the legalisation of the additional Agricultural Grant, and I explained why.  The reason was that the new system which is being introduced this year for the distribution of a certain part of the Agricultural Grant on the basis of the amount of employment given by agriculturists necessitated a very big amount of additional work being done by the secretaries, the staffs in general, and the collectors of rates in every county. At least three months were required in every county to collect the information which was necessary so that the proper allocation of the moneys could be made.  Three months and, in some cases, even a bit longer, were taken by the staffs of the county councils in collecting that information.  We wanted to have the information as realiable as possible.  We wanted to give the farmers full time and full notice as to what was in store for them, and we wanted to give them time to send in the returns.  As we know, without any reflection on the agriculturists more than any other members of the community, they are not too quick in sending in the various statistical forms that are required by the county council to be filled up in connection with this and other matters. Although they were notified several times and called on in person several times, in addition to which a registered letter was finally forwarded to everyone who had not sent in the form, nevertheless there are agriculturists in different parts of the country who will complain very bitterly because they will not get relief this year by reason of the fact that they did not send in the forms.  That caused delay, and that delay is responsible for the fact that in many cases the rates were not struck until the month of September. Some were struck early in September and some late in September.  The striking of the rate was, therefore, several months later than usual.</P>
    <P>Much play has been made by Deputy Dillon and others on the question as to why County Clare&mdash;we all know the reason why they chose County Clare&mdash; was recorded as having no rates paid on the 30th September.  The fact of <Col N="1329" /> the matter, I am sure, was that the rate warrant was not issued in a great many cases.  The demand notes certainly were not issued by the 30th September in the vast majority of cases in the Co. Clare.  Therefore, it is quite true that the return of rates paid in the Co. Clare up to the 30th September was given as nil, the reason being that they were not asked to pay their rates.  The same applies in several other counties.  It applies in South Tipperary and Westmeath, and to the extent that only a small percentage was paid it is also true in a great number of other cases.  In Galway, 6 per cent. was paid by the 30th September; in Kerry, .1 per cent. was paid, and in Kilkenny, .1 per cent. had also been paid by the 30th September. Some other counties had a great deal more paid on that date. Wicklow had .4 per cent.; Wexford had .5 per cent., and so on.  In those counties demand notes were not issued at the usual time.</P>
    <P>In some cases they were issued four or five months later than usual. That is the reason why the rate collection was as bad as it appeared to be on September 30th.  In reply to Deputy Mulcahy, Deputy Davin stated that in Leix £40,000 had been paid at the end of November.  I asked the Department what amount had actually been paid in Leix and I was told to-day that out of a warrant of £121,000 £53,000 had actually been paid to date. I do not doubt that in other counties the amounts paid to date, while they may not be as good as is evident in the case of Leix, where the warrant was only issued in September, there has been a very good collection. I have the figures to the 30the November and they show that amounts ranging from 45 per cent. down have been paid in a great many counties. I have no reason at all to say that I am dissatisfied with the vast majority of the counties, in the way they are doing their work, in so far as the collection of rates is concerned, up to the 30th of last month.</P>
    <P>I say that there has been, in some areas of some counties&mdash;not in any whole county&mdash;a deliberate attempt to prevent the collection of rates and to encourage people not to pay.  I will <Col N="1330" /> quote Deputy Bennett, not his actual words, but I remember reading a speech in which he stated that he could pay but did not pay, and his cattle were seized.  He was not saying that he could not pay, that he had not the money to pay, but had the money and did not pay.</P>

That is different from saying I could not pay. In making the statement I wanted definitely to be honest with the people that I made it to.  It would be possible for me to find the money, not from my farming earnings, or from any other earnings, but by endeavouring to borrow.  It would have been possible in that way.  I was definitely honest in making that statement to farming people.  I was not making the claim that I could not find the money, and I am not claiming that I could not find it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I did not intend to do so.  The Deputy knows that rates have to be paid and that local authorities have to collect them.  I know that resolutions which were passed by certain political organisations, with which Deputies opposite are associated, calling for the non-payment of rates have ceased in the last few months.  Responsible heads on the Opposition Benches realised that that was not a profitable game to play, and they have quietly encouraged their people to drop the campaign against rates, and they are dropping the campaign against the payment of the annuities.  I do not know whether or not they are doing that on the advice of their leaders, or <Col N="1332" /> some of their leaders, perhaps, but it has been dropped, because it does not pay.</P>
      <P>We have made a considerable addition each year, over several years, to the Agricultural Grant, with one exception, when there was a decrease because, at the same time, we had made other provision for the agricultural community.  That gives them a great advantage over previous years. The annuities have been halved, and it was thought that the very exceptional sum given in the Agricultural Grant the previous year would not be so necessary now.  We find that the position of agriculturists has not improved, that world prices of agricultural produce have continued to decline, and ours, of course, have declined.  Conditions are such that we realise that agriculturists want what help the Exchequer can provide for them.  But we have to measure our help to the agricultural community in accordance with our cloth, in accordance with the money in the Exchequer, as we have to think of other classes in the community.  This year we brought into operation an Unemployment Assistance Act which relieved the rates to a very considerable extent.  In the boroughs and in certain urban areas, certain additional rates had to be put on to bear some of the cost of the bill for unemployment assistance.  The county councils were not asked to do so, and therefore, they have benefited to the extent that they have been relieved considerably by the Unemployment Assistance Act.  That should be borne in mind, particularly when we are comparing one year with another, in order to see how the agricultural community is being helped by the Government through this Bill for the relief of rates on agricultural land, as well as from other sources.</P>

      <P>So that I am satisfied that we have done as much as could reasonably be expected, considering our resources, to meet the difficulties of the agricultural community. There were two points raised by Deputy Bennett, one with regard to women and the other with regard to the time limit for the credit notes.  I must say that my own view is that it is advisable that the Government should do all they can to encourage the employment of men rather than women everywhere, in every industry.  I think from every point of view, for moral reasons as well as economic reasons, that that is good policy, and that, especially at the present time, when so many men find it so difficult to get employment, anything the Government can do by way of encouragement to people of all classes and in every industry to employ males rather than females is all to the good.</P>

      <P>Even of that I am not satisfied.  I would not pretend to enter into a discussion on the details of agriculture with the Deputy or any other agriculturist.  I have not the knowledge or experience to do that, but, speaking generally, from my limited knowledge of agriculture, I would say that there are very few things that could not be as well done by men as by women.  Take the milking of cows.  I am sure that in many cases that is done in Limerick by the large farmers, at any rate, by machinery.</P>

I shall not follow him through the wandering speech he made; but I will say that if there is destitution and starvation in the country we have not heard of anybody dying of destitution and starvation since this Government came into office.  We have on record, in the public Press and elsewhere, authoritative evidence of the fact that people did die of starvation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not think there is anything else I need answer. We are making all the efforts we can to meet a situation that we realise, so far as the agricultural community is concerned, is a difficult one.  We realise that things are not now even what they were last year and certainly not what they were four or five years ago.  Prices have fallen rapidly and that is a situation that necessitates the very close attention of this or any Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a situation that I am sure is getting close attention in all countries affected as ours is by the heavy fall in agricultural prices.  But we are no exception.  That collapse in agricultural prices is world-wide.  I think we are doing more considering our resources to help the agricultural community than is being done by most of the Governments affected as we are by falling prices.  In proportion to our resources a great deal more has been done here than elsewhere.  I am not saying that everything has been done but I would say that everything that can be done has been done and will be done.  I am not going to say that everybody is going to be satisfied or that even a quarter of the agricultural community would stand up and <Col N="1338" /> say they were satisfied.  Naturally, the desire of all is to get more help. When times are hard people will make big demands.</P>
    <P>I think the country, as a whole, is satisfied that we have done well.  That has been proved by the recent elections. Deputies opposite clamoured for the holding of these elections this year. They complained that we were holding them back.  We faced the electors and Deputies know the result.  Without the help of the agriculturists in all the counties where the people make their living by farming, we could not have got a majority; if the farming people were dissatisfied with us we would have been defeated.  However, we improved our position.  There was evident a feeling on the part of the farmers, a feeling and disposition that this Government was doing its best for them.  That is clear from the votes that were recorded.  We have done our best and we continue to do it, and if more money will be available to help agriculturists over their difficulties, the Government will put it at their disposal.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party is very largely composed of agriculturists. They know the feeling of agriculturists and of the farming community generally. The members of the Fianna Fáil Party are not in any way silent in pressing the claims of the farmers. But the Government has to look to all classes of the community.  They have to deal fairly with every class.  We believe we are doing that and we are out to help agriculturists in every way over their difficulties.</P>

I am just putting that question to the Minister, and I want to put a supplementary to it.  Will the Minister give the agricultural community a commission to inquire into this&mdash;even let them be selected from his own followers &mdash;drawn entirely from the ranks of his <Col N="1339" /> own Party?

      <P>There was some discussion on this amendment the other day, and particularly arising out of that discussion the Minister had his notice drawn to the miserable wages paid in the Enniscorthy factory, in the first instance.  The second point referred to before the House adjourned was that the conduct of the factory is on alien lines and quite alien to the whole local tradition in County Wexford in respect to the observance of Catholic holidays, which has been the custom in the County Wexford.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <P>This duty is being imposed for the purpose of preventing the import of razor blades in this country and the development of the <Col N="1341" /> manufacture of razor blades here.  The Minister has taken all kinds of power to put conditions on all kinds of firms who engage in the manufacture of the articles covered by these duties.  The Minister is developing in this country the razor blade industry.  He has not given us any satisfactory particulars about the factory in Enniscorthy which is for the manufacture of cheaper razor blades.  He suggests that there are to be 100 persons employed but he does not in any way make a case for that. In that particular factory objectionable conditions as regards wages and objectionable conditions as regards working are enforced by the management, who are breaking what is an established social custom and an established religious custom in that county.  I think these are reasonable matters for discussion on this section.</P>

      <P>It was a barber shaved me last time.  Has the Minister seen a sample of the razor blade made here and sold at a popular price?  Does he know what the quality of the article is? You can get the hoop of a barrel and say you will make a razor blade out of it.  Then you can seek a tariff and dump them on the market, but the poor man cannot pay for that razor blade.  I agree with the tariffs going on and with the making of the blades here, but we should see that the quality of the article we get approximates to the quality of the article which we have been accustomed to use.  Did the Minister take any steps in that direction before he imposed this Order?  He knows that I am not speaking against the Order or against his power to make the Order.  Since I have come in here, I have felt that the imposition of tariffs by Order has become the rule rather than the exception.  I should like to know what steps the Minister took to secure that a reasonably good razor blade would be made here at a reasonable price.</P>

      <P>I am not responsible for running this industry or, generally speaking, any industry.  If the opportunities are afforded, we expect private enterprise to avail of them.  An opportunity is being afforded to people to engage in the manufacture of razor blades and, presumably, if one firm does not take full advantage of that opportunity and put on the market a commodity that will satisfy the public, another firm will.  The only question which concerns the Dáil is whether we should impose a duty on razor blades in order to encourage their manufacture here.  I am prepared to defend that, but I am not responsible for the manner in which any firm is managed or conducted.</P>

      <P>So far as I know, there is no ground for complaint with the product now on sale either in respect of the suitability of these products or their price.  In any event, the duty imposed here, working out, as it does, at less than ½d. per blade, will not necessitate anybody growing a beard in order to avoid shaving.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of us grow moustaches, or try to do so.  The Minister has not dealt with the point I raised. I agree that it is not the Minister's concern to inquire into the affairs of any individual firm unless that firm is in receipt of a trade loan or moneys from some Government Department. The private individual must be allowed to squander his money if he wants to do so, instead of using it for profitable purposes.  However, it is not the individual we are concerned with now.  A duty is being imposed upon an article which is made here, or about to be made here.  In the case of an article which was not made here and on which a duty is to be imposed, I suggest that it would be only ordinary business procedure on the part of the Minister to satisfy himself that a case had been made for the imposition of the duty. In making that case, it should be demonstrated to the Minister that a reasonably good blade would be put on the market.  The Minister argues that the duty means only ½d. per blade and that we will not go without a shave because we have to pay 2d. or 2½d. for a blade.  I am sure that the Minister does not believe in that argument, that he has a different idea of his duty as a Minister.  When he imposes a duty, he imposes it to help industry.  If a reasonably good article is not put on the market, we shall have to pay an extra ½d., and this duty, instead of helping an Irish industry, will only provide the Minister for Finance with more revenue.  Surely, that is not the object of protection, as conceived by the Government.  If it is, I do not think it is a good one.  Speaking commercially, I have been looking for good Irish blades, and I have not yet found them.  I should like the Minister to give me privately the addresses of people who could provide these blades, <Col N="1345" /> because I could put a good deal of business in their way.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete in page 2, the reference to &ldquo;The Emergency Imposition of Duties (No. 39) Order, 1934.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment refers to the imposition of duties in the Imposition of Duties Order, No. 39.  The Order purports to impose a duty equal to 50 per cent. ad valorem up to the 30th June, 1934, on manufactured hay-forks, manure-forks, potato-forks, digging-forks, and, secondly, on component parts, whether completely or partially manufactured, of any of those types of forks.  I asked the Minister, on the 5th December, to give us information as to the total value of the articles imported into the Saorstát in the twelve months ending 30th December, 1933, and in the six months ending June, 1934.  The Minister gave no information in reply to that question.  He gave no idea as to the extent of the market for these articles in this country. I asked him to say what the revenue anticipated would be as a result of this duty in the first twelve months following the dates on which protection came into operation.  The Minister gave no information in regard to that.  I asked him the total number of firms engaged in the production of these articles in the Saorstát, and the average number of persons employed.  The only information he gave in reply to that was that the matter would be <Col N="1347" /> dealt with in the Bill.  As to the production of agricultural forks and component parts, he said there is more than one firm established, but the principal one is located in Galway, and is in production.  No information, however, as to the number of these factories or their location, or the extent of the employment they give, is given in any of them.</P>
    <P>The Order gives power to the Minister to issue licences to persons for the import, without payment of duty, of these articles; and the Minister was asked, on 5th December, for information as to the extent to which licences were issued, and also as to the extent to which licences were refused. Again, the Minister gave no information with regard to that.  Now, the imposition of a 50 per cent. duty on articles of this particular kind, used in agricultural work, may be important from the point of view of the process of these articles.  We want to know from the Minister to what extent there is an increase in prices; to what extent the duty in that way is fully operative as far as a rise in prices is concerned.  We ought to get from the Minister some information as to the extent of the market for these articles, the extent to which there is already an industry in the country; and, further, we ought to get information as to the development the Minister expects in that industry, both in the value of the additional output and of the additional employment that he anticipates will be given in that industry when the effect that he expects from this Order will have fully taken place; and, in the meantime, what is the effect of the Order at the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, of course, entirely incorrect to say that I refused to give information concerning the previous imports of these goods or the extent of the market for them here.  I told the Deputy what is the fact, that that information is not available.  There is no means of ascertaining what the extent of the market is, or what the previous imports were, and full information on that point cannot be ascertained <Col N="1348" /> until the existing firms have been in operation for some time supplying the demand, whatever it is, and are able then to speak with authority upon the normal requirements of these goods.  Until that has happened, however, there is no means of getting the information.  It was not refused to the Deputy.  He was told precisely what the position was.  The manufacture of these goods has been undertaken in Galway.  I have had no complaint whatever concerning either the price or the quality of the goods produced. The prices are competitive, and before the duty was imposed the Department of Agriculture was consulted on the matter, and expressed themselves quite satisfied that the duty should be imposed.  I, personally, am quite satisfied that in this industry we have an industry of value, and one that should be fostered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should it come in if the Galway article was competitive and better and cheaper?  Is it not obvious that the Galway article was not cheaper than the foreign article? That seems to me to be manifest.  The <Col N="1349" /> putting on of a tariff may be justified in certain circumstances, I admit, in order to protect a firm, say, in Galway, that was engaged in the manufacture of some agricultural process; but what is the object of a 50 per cent. tariff?  Surely the object is to open the way for that company, or for any other company to extract the largest price that it can possibly get out of the agricultural community for these commodities.  I should be glad if the Minister, when he is dealing with these duties, would tell us whether this Order applies to the factory that supplied him with fork or shovel handles, or whatever it was that we heard so much about in County Cavan recently; and if so, whether that factory has gone out of production as a result of this tariff or prior to the imposition of this tariff.  I think that the House should be informed on these questions and, furthermore, I think that the House should be reluctant to consent to a 50 per cent. tariff on any commodity of daily use in this country unless they are satisfied that it is not going to be used for the purpose of profiteering and in order to pile up more expenses on the backs of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>All that they say largely consists of rámaish.  One expects it from them.  I think, however, that the Minister ought to try to use commonsense and discharge his common duty to this House.  His duty is to tell us why it is necessary to put a 50 per cent. tariff on an article produced in the country already, and whether its object is to give that company an opportunity of extracting approximately the entire amount of that tariff from the agricultural community.  No doubt, the Minister will reply that he is doing it in order to secure that a <Col N="1350" /> profitable industry will be set up so as to secure a living wage for everybody engaged in it.  But if it is going to provide a wage of £2 a week at the expense of the agricultural labourers, who, his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, says ought to be able to get along on 6d. an hour, or 27s. a week, for a 54 hour week, it is time that Deputies there should realise that and should realise that while it may be desirable and necessary to put on tariffs in certain circumstances, it is neither necessary, desirable nor just to secure 40s. or 45s. a week for labourers in the City of Galway at the expense of labourers in rural areas, who, their agricultural spokesman, the Minister for Agriculture, says, ought to be able to get along well enough at 27s. a week for a 54 hour week.  Let justice be done on both sides.  It is a monstrous thing to be driving the agricultural community and the agricultural labourers in this country down into destitution, and at the same time to be piling up on their backs further expenses in order to provide fair rates of wages for the workers in the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Deputy think that there was an obligation on him to make some inquiry as to the real facts of the case before coming in here and making this charge against a private firm&mdash;that they were engaging in profiteering and exploiting the agricultural labourers?  The Deputy should make some inquiries before making such a charge.  I notice that the members of his Party have had the grace to stay out of the House while he is making these speeches.  The Deputy, as usual, is completely wrong in what he says, and there is no foundation whatever for the speech he has delivered.  I suggest that if he is a member of a responsible Party, he should do what commonsense and justice would dictate: get some information from some reliable source before making these charges.  He did not attempt to do that.  He never does.  I am quite certain that he need not have put himself to any trouble to find out the facts, because any Galway member of his Party could have given him the necessary information to prevent him making a fool of himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We had better get this straight.  The Minister, whenever he is driven into a corner, always tries to kick up a row.  That is his great refuge. He prays that the public will forget the net point that he was called upon to answer, and that he is unable to answer.  This is the procedure that is at present being followed: there is to be a scene in Dáil Eireann in which the Minister for Industry and Commerce attacks Mr. Dillon.  &ldquo;Truth in the News&rdquo; is to come out in the morning with grand headlines and the essential point is to be forgotten.  The essential point is this: the Minister is putting a tariff on to start an industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Minister is putting on a tariff to preserve an industry.  The Minister will not undertake to preserve the industry at the expense of the public unless he is satisfied that fair wages are being paid in that industry.  The Minister will agree with that.  The Minister will agree with me, too, that £2 a week is not, to say the least of it, an excessive wage for factory operatives working a full week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, fortunately, is not under cross-examination. I hope to expose his latest attempt to draw a red herring across the floor of the House.  The Minister holds himself out as an apostle of fair wages, and I fix a fair wage for factory operatives, working a full week, at not less than £2 a week.  I do not know whether the Minister wants to have a lower rate of wages, but we shall assume that he assents to my proposal.  I object to laying a burden on the backs of the agricultural community&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What burden?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in order to secure those wages for the operatives in that factory, so long and only so long as the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, says that for a similar 48-hour week the agricultural labourer, who is going to use the fork, is only entitled to 24/- a week.  That seems to be a perfectly plain, simple case.  When I make that case to the Minister he gets up and says that Deputy Dillon attacks an industrialist in Galway and charges him with being a profiteer.  I might use a nasty word to describe that misrepresentation.  All I will say is that the Minister is either so stupid or so deaf that he did not hear what I said. I made no reference at all to the profits of the enterprise in Galway.  I made reference only to the fair wages condition which the Minister presumably exacted before he undertook to protect the industry.  I repeat that it is not <Col N="1353" /> justice that fair wages of £2 a week should be exacted for the operatives of Galway from a community of people whom the Minister for Agriculture says are entitled to no more than 24/- a week for a working week of the same duration.  Now that is a dilemma to which I invite the attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and that is the question he has got to answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has asked no question at all.  He knows nothing whatever about the conditions prevailing in this industry in Galway.  He does not know if there has been an increase in price and, I am sure, will be surprised to learn that there has been a decrease.  The Deputy's method is to assume a number of facts, about which he knows nothing and which I may say are all incorrect, and then proceed to base an elaborate argument on that.  That is typical of him.  My advice to him again is that before committing himself to public utterances here on any question of public importance, he should try to find out something about it.  There are other members of his Party who could have given him information on it.  As I have said, if he had got the information he would have the wit, I think, to say nothing here this evening.</P>

      <P>If the Minister desires to attempt to put it over on the House that he would be justified in putting on a tariff of 50 per cent. in order to off-set the prejudice against Irish industry in this country, he is simply fooling the House, and the House knows it.  That is the kind of stuff that might be good enough for a secondary school debating society, but it ought not be good enough for the Minister for Industry and Commerce in Dáil <Col N="1354" /> Eireann, because it is manifestly untrue, to begin with.</P>

      <P>That the Minister has to pretend, in justification for putting on a tariff of 50 per cent., that it is to counter the prejudice that exists in this country against Irish manufacture. No such prejudice exists in any part of the country to my knowledge, and these are commodities, hay forks, etc., in which I have been trading for many years.  Where supplies are available from Irish sources it is both more convenient and desirable from every point of view to get them here than to import them.  In certain circumstances, as I have already said, it might be legitimate to put on a modest tariff in order to compete against American and British products, which are produced on mass production lines. The Minister has made no case at all for the imposition of this 50 per cent. tariff.</P>

      <P>Now we have the Ministerial benches coming to the rescue of the Minister.  They want to impose on the Opposition Party, whose help they say they want so very much, the same type of silence as is imposed on themselves.  We here are interested in industrial development and we are questioning the Minister on these points.  We know that the only decent industrial development that has taken place here since the new Government came into power has been on foundations solidly laid by the last Government.  We think it unreasonable that the agricultural community should be asked to face this tariff of 50 per cent. without being told something about it.  All we are told is that the Minister does not know the extent of the market here and that he does not know the extent to which forks of this kind came into the country in the past.  He says that there are more firms than one in Ireland making forks, but would he tell us in what county they are? Would he tell us what employment is given in them and what is the total production?  The Minister has apparently some information in regard to it.  We should have as much information as the Minister can give us.</P>

      <P>The Minister has mentioned Galway.  He has put one spot on the map.  Outside that we do not know how many firms are making these forks.  We do not know what the production has been or what the number of employees is.  The Minister has not given us the slightest suggestion as to what increased employment will be created.  The Minister simply draws a veil over the whole question. He does not tell us whether the Order is operative at the present time.  We infer that it is fully operative.  We infer that no licences have been issued to import these articles without duty. We are left to infer all that, but when the Minister is asked specifically about it, he does not tell us.  All we know now is that the duty is being imposed.</P>

      <P>The Minister may be vacating the position of being a prophet.  Like the Minister for Education he may be repudiating his former prophecies.  It is not asking the Minister to act as a prophet when we ask that in introducing this Order, he should give us some general statement on the position, give us whatever facts he has and indicate that in some way he has examined the position.  The Minister has said nothing that would indicate that he has examined the position. All that we are left to infer is that he is approached by a certain number of people who say: &ldquo;We are running a particular line and we want a tariff on these goods&rdquo; and the Minister says &ldquo;Here is your tariff, I will cover up your tracks, I will give them no more information than I gave them in respect of other things.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Minister this simple question and I want an answer to it.  When this question of hay forks first engaged his attention and he first excogitated the <Col N="1358" /> question of whether he would impose a duty under an Emergency Imposition of Duties Order, somebody must have come to him and said &ldquo;We can produce these hay forks at such a price. They cost so much to produce abroad.&rdquo; Somebody must have said to him &ldquo;Hay forks cost so much to produce in Ireland and so much to produce abroad.  To secure that Irish firms will get a monopoly of the market such and such a tariff is necessary.&rdquo;  Can he give us, from that information, what approximately the cost of production of hay forks in Ireland is and what the cost of production was heretofore, free to quay, Galway or North Wall?  Has the Minister got that information?</P>

      <P>If the Minister has not got that information, or if he will not say whether he has or has not it, he could perhaps tell us in what other county besides Galway are these forks being manufactured.

The Galway factory has branched out into this particular line of industry because it was a factory that existed before for making other agricultural implements.

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete in page 2, the reference to &ldquo;The Emergency Imposition of Duties (No. 40) Order, 1934.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is the Order which imposes a duty of 30 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> on machines which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, are completely or substantially assembled and are designed, constructed and suitable for the automatic sale, by means of the operation of a mechanism set in motion by the insertion of a coin in the machine, of all or any of the following articles, whether exclusively or in addition to other articles, namely, tobacco in any form, matches, sweetmeats, including chocolates in any form, and articles which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, are substantial assemblies or parts of any such machines as described in the foregoing.  In connection with this, too, the Minister was asked if, in regard to the imposition of this duty, he would tell us the value of these articles imported during the 12 months ended 31st December, 1933, and the six months ended 30th June, 1934, and the Minister gave no information. He gives no information as to the value of these articles that are taken annually into the country.</P>
      <P>He was asked if he would state the total number of firms engaged in the manufacture of these articles; the employment they gave; and the extent to which licences had been issued for the purpose of admitting these articles free of the duty he imposed.  Again, I ask the Minister if he considers it reasonable to impose a duty like this and to give no information, good, bad or indifferent, as to the circumstances existing in the country which induce him to impose this duty or the circumstances which he hopes to bring about in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The duty in this case was imposed on general principles.  A number of these automatic machines were coming in and it was felt that the firms concerned should be encouraged to do the assembling of them here.  There is no information as to the value of the importation in previous years and nobody has yet started assembling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  When I say no, I should like to qualify it by saying that interested parties, to wit, traders in various towns of the Saorstát, have for years been agitating for the prohibition of automatic machines altogether, but the Order made here would permit, of course, the utilisation of automatic machines, either machines imported subject to duty or machines assembled here on which no duty was paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Observe that it is very important to cross-examine the Minister <Col N="1363" /> on an Imposition of Duty Order, because we were told first that this Order was made in pursuance of general policy, to promote the manufacture or assembly of anything in this country that can be sold.  We then pressed for further particulars, and we now discover that the purpose for which this Order was made was to prevent the use of automatic machines in rural towns.</P>

Of course, it is manifest that it did weigh with him when he imposed the duty, and it now transpires that the duty was imposed for a purpose entirely other than that which he first suggested to the House.  I invite the Minister to make up his mind as to why he did impose it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently, from what we have now ascertained from the Minister, the proposal in this Order is neither fish nor flesh, but just a good red herring.  He is drawing a red herring across the track of his inability to make up his mind as to what he wants to do.  This is supposed to be Irish industrial development and he does not know whether it is simply revenue he is making; whether he is putting a stop to the use of automatic machines; or whether he is developing an Irish manufacturing or assembling industry here.  It is no wonder that when the subject of Irish industrial development is approached by the Minister in that nebulous state of mind, he is not able to come before the House and, with each Emergency Imposition of Duty Order, give us a clear statement of his intention or his hopes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I just say that this is the type of thing we like to do, because it is something in respect of which we cannot lose.  Either the machines will not be imported, which I think is all to the good; or we get revenue, which is equally good; or we get some employment in assembling them, which is also good.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete, in page 2, &ldquo;The Emergency Imposition of Duties (No. 44) Order, 1934.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In the first place, this Order imposes a duty on all tanks, cisterns, drums, barrels and kegs which are made wholly or mainly of iron or steel or a combination of iron and steel; are of a cylindrical or elliptical shape; have a capacity of not less than three gallons, nor more than 50 gallons, and are imported empty.  The rate of duty is equal to 33? per cent. of the value of the article.  Secondly, it imposes a duty on all other tanks, cisterns, drums, barrels and kegs made wholly or mainly of iron or steel, or a combination of iron and steel, and imported empty.  The rate of duty here amounts to 15 per cent. of the value of the article.  In the third place, it imposes a duty on component parts (made wholly or mainly of iron or steel, or a combination of iron and steel) of any such tanks, cisterns, drums, barrels or kegs as are mentioned in either of the foregoing paragraphs, at a rate equal to 15 per cent. of the value of the article.</P>
      <P>We endeavoured to get from the Minister some information as to the market for these things, the extent to which they were imported during the last 1½ years, the extent to which they are being manufactured here, and what exactly is the licensing position. The Minister has given no information in reply to the questions asked him. I want to know what the purpose of the Order is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Order is to increase the existing rate on cylindrical metal drums, the best <Col N="1367" /> known of which, I think, are the ordinary tar drums.  The duty has been increased because the manufacture of these goods on a mass production scale has been undertaken in Dublin by a very well-known firm which is capable of supplying all the requirements of the country.  There is no information as to previous importations of these goods because they were not listed separately in our import list.  On that account it is not possible to state with accuracy what the market is.  In any event the market varies considerably from year to year.  The position is that a well-known factory is turning out these goods in whatever quantities they may be required, and considerable additional employment is given on that account.  The purpose of the duty is to discourage the import of these things.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say how many persons are employed in the production of these goods at present? He says that the consumption varies considerably from year to year. Will he say what is likely to be the effect of that, or the employment that will be given here?  What is the position with regard to the issuing of licences to import these goods at present without duty?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say if there have been any imports of tar in the past, and if the increased price of containers would put tar produced in this country at a disadvantage as compared with tar from foreign sources, in cheaper containers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there was any tar imported, worth talking of. Most of the tar is got at home, and is, as Deputies are aware, a by-product of gas works.  We have certain production which is probably all that we require. It is not possible to state with any accuracy the number of people engaged in the concern manufacturing these <Col N="1368" /> drums, as they make a very large number of other goods.  In case of fluctuation in demand that would not mean less employment for those in the concern, as individuals would be put from one process to another, as demand fluctuated.  The equipment installed in the factory for the production of these goods is as up to date as that in any part of the world, and is on a mass production basis.  I do not think it is correct to assume that there will be any higher cost of production here, other than the cost of raw materials which may be somewhat higher.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no reason to believe that the firm concerned is not capable of meeting all requirements at present.  Licences are not being issued under this Order, except occasionally for some odd article of special design, or intended for a special purpose, or of such a description that it could not be manufactured here.</P>

      <P>In fact, the duty applies now as far as the ordinary type of cylinder is concerned, and yet the Minister is not in a position to tell us about the increased amount of employment that will be given, or that there is not a rise in prices, as a result of the imposition of the duty.</P>

      <P>In relation to the cistern the Deputy has referred to, the Order does not impose any increase of duty.  Theoretically there is a decrease from 22½ per cent. to 15 per cent.  The duty on these goods has been 22½ per cent., with a preferential rate of 15 per cent.  In future there will be a flat rate of 15 per cent. on these articles.  It has not been varied in the Order.</P>

      <P>I say that subject to this qualification, which must always be made in relation to industries of this kind, where imported raw materials must be used, that there may be higher raw material costs for concerns here than for concerns abroad.  But the process of manufacture need not be any higher.  in fact, it is possible that the cost of production here is somewhat lower than in other concerns.

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete in page 2, the reference to &ldquo;The Emergency Imposition of Duties (No. 45) Order, 1934.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Order imposes a Customs duty at the rate of 75 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> on all electric filament lamps consuming not more than 500 watts, but excluding electric filament lamps which are, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, designed, constructed, and intended for use in hand lamps energised from a dry battery, or for use exclusively for scientific or for medical or surgical purposes.  The Minister was asked to state in this case the value of the electric lamps imported into the country during the 12 months ending December 31st, 1933, and for the six months ending 30th June, 1934.  He said he cannot give the House this information.  He cannot tell the country from which these lamps were imported.  We are told the Order is a completely new Order.  The Minister was asked if he would state the total number of firms engaged in the manufacture of these articles, the average number of persons employed, and he has not given us the information under this head either.  The Minister has been asked what is the position with regard to the licensing arrangement.  He was asked if there is a free importation of electric lamps at the present time, and whether there is anything in his Order which would warrant the rise in the price of electric lamps.  The duty is a very considerable duty.  The suggestion is that it is a prohibitive duty in order to allow of the development of the manufacture of electric lamps here for the fuller requirements of the country.  We have not been told anything about that either.  Again, I say it is absurd to put a proposal before the House without such information.  We expect some facts from the Minister as to what the actual situation is and what he expects will be the result of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to state precisely what were the imports in previous years in the matter of <Col N="1372" /> electric films and electric lamps which are made subject to this duty.  Nor is it possible to state precisely what the annual requirement in lamps is to be. Nobody has as yet manufactured these lamps.  At present the normal requirements are imported free of duty, under licence.  There is consequently no occasion for a rise in the price nor will there be after the duty has become operative.  The concern which is erecting the factory for their production has agreed that their products will be sold at the standard price now prevailing. It is anticipated that the firm will come into production early in the New Year and the duties will become operative simultaneously.  It is not possible to say exactly the number of persons who will be employed, but the number will not be inconsiderable and may possibly increase as the manufacture is extended to other classes of lamps than those which are now being made the subject of duty.</P>

The Minister tells us that there is going to be considerable employment here and that that is why he is clapping on the 75 per cent.  Surely the Minister is trifling with this House and trifling with the people of the country who require the lamps.  He is also trifling with the men who are putting Irish capital into an industry who, if I understand the Minister properly, are putting Irish capital alone into this industry.

      <P>These are not matters for the Dáil.  If I were to give the Dáil information on a matter of that kind I would be abusing my position. It is open to anybody to manufacture lamps in this country at the moment provided they are qualified and provided they put up the money for the <Col N="1375" /> purpose themselves.  If a particular concern proceeds to do it, it is a matter for themselves what arrangements they make to get the technical assistance or to get into communication with firms engaged in this industry. The one point on which we have to be satisfied is that they will supply us, in accordance with their undertakings, with lamps as good as we are getting at present and at no higher price.  Let me say&mdash;this is a matter the Deputy might consider&mdash; that I had considerable questioning in my mind before I was satisfied with a mere undertaking not to increase the prices because, in the circumstances of this industry one might have expected a decrease in price when the manufacture was undertaken here.  The Deputy, apparently, had no objection over a number of years to paying whatever price was charged for these lamps without any inquiry as to whether that price was justified or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Minister propose to satisfy himself as to quality? I observe that the Minister, on the first occasion on which he spoke on this amendment, said there would be no increase in price.  At a later stage, he said there would be no increase in price and no decrease in quality.  That is a very important consideration, because, in a commodity like an electric lamp, the price consists of two elements&mdash;one, the quality, and the other the money asked for the lamp.  It is quite easy for anybody to set up in this country and manufacture lamps of a kind at a reasonable price and then manufacture other lamps at a much higher price, these latter being efficient lamps.  I should like the Minister to make quite clear that the object he has in view in granting this tariff is to secure that lamps of an efficiency equal to those at present imported will be manufactured here at a price reasonably near that at which we are importing at the present time.  If the Minister is prepared to give us that guarantee, I do not see what justification he has for imposing a tariff of 75 per cent.  Let us assume that, owing to the special circumstances obtaining in the Free State, it would <Col N="1377" /> be impossible to manufacture efficient electric lamps as cheaply as they are manufactured in Great Britain or the U.S.A. or Holland.  Let us assume that it would cost 15 per cent. more to manufacture these lamps in Saorstát Eireann than it would to manufacture them abroad, and that we want to give the home manufacturer an ample margin in order to reassure him and induce him to invest the requisite capital in the factory and machinery.  Let us add, therefore, to that 15 per cent., actual difference in cost, 10 per cent. in order to give him a wide margin of security. If that course be pursued, there is comparatively little danger of the price rising unduly, because, if an attempt were made by an Irish manufacturer to exploit the home market, the corrective tendency of the duty-paid imports would manifest itself immediately. Under this system, we are creating a system whereby the manufacturer in years to come may push the price up or leave the price stationary long after he ought to have reduced it.  The 75 per cent. tariff will continue to protect him to an extent far in excess of what the Minister for Industry and Commerce hoped for from the very beginning. To that objection, the Minister for Industry and Commerce will reply: &ldquo;You can go to the Prices Commission.&rdquo; I think that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is beginning to realise now that reference to the Prices Commission is a very unsatisfactory procedure and that the consumer very rarely gets satisfaction from it.  More and more, as time goes on, that will prove to be the case.  More and more, as time goes on, this tariff will be made the excuse for a variety of interests in the trade to exploit the consumer in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that the imposition of tariffs of these dimensions, far from serving the best interests of Irish industry, are doing it a serious injury for two reasons.  One reason is that it sets a premium on incompetence.  There is no urge on the man operating behind a 75 per cent. tariff to make himself as efficient as possible, because there is no threat of competition, proximate or remote.  The second reason is that the public mind <Col N="1378" /> of this country, when the first fervour of economic nationalism has passed away, will begin to ask itself why Irish manufacturers want to operate behind a 75 per cent. tariff.  The man in the street will answer that question to his own satisfaction by saying that either the Irish manufacturers are incompetent or they want to exploit the consumer. The men with whom I am acquainted in Irish industry desire to do neither the one thing nor the other. They want to compete freely against the mass production methods of Japan, Czecho-Slovakia and countries of that kind, and to sell their commodities in competition with commodities manufactured under similar conditions elsewhere. If the conditions are different, we should correct that difference by a modest tariff, and the Irish manufacturer and the foreign manufacturer should have an even start.  In every case where that policy has been pursued in the industrial development of this country, the Irish manufacturer has more than held his own.  When the boot industry was first protected here, the tariff was, I think, 15 per cent. Under that tariff, there grew up a prosperous, thriving, solidly-founded boot industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It developed over a period of years and produced an article that compared with anything that could be imported from anywhere else in the world.  They were pushed to that measure of efficiency and success by the constant threat of competition. On that foundation, the Minister, by increasing tariffs, has sought to create a larger development.  I seriously apprehend that, far from serving the boot industry, the extravagant system of tariffs at present in operation in that industry will do it an injury in the long run.  I admit freely that, at the moment, these mushroom industries are making money, but, in the long run, I believe this system will react against the efficiency of the industries and the excellence of their products, because they will be virtually delivered from competition of any kind.  That is a bad system.  Every <Col N="1379" /> one of the industries that grew up in this country under a low tariff system, only sufficient to protect them from unfair competition, was solidly founded and secured.  It is upon these foundations that the present Minister for Industry and Commerce is at present endeavouring to build. If Deputies will consider the matter they will find that in every industry where there is a genuine increase in employment&mdash;and they are comparatively few&mdash;since the present Minister took charge, it is in those which were founded on a modest tariff basis, and if these industries are now reacting to the tariffs it is due to the manner in which their foundations were laid.  If that policy of building only when solid foundations were laid, had been continued, there would be every hope for raising solid structures on such foundations.  75 per cent. of an impost on lamps the Minister can justify, if, as he says, there is no increase in price of the article produced. I think it would be better to have a modest impost on lamp filaments which would give competent Irish manufacturers ample security to compete with foreigners, and not build, from the economic point of view, an inefficient industry which would be no credit either to the occupists or the capitalists.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if Deputy Dillon has considered every factor in making a case for what he called modest tariffs.  I wonder how many people would be induced to embark on the manufacture of filament lamps if they were simply offered a modest tariff.  Has the Deputy taken into account that there are combines and rings in connection with the manufacture of filament lamps, and that any of those rings need only order a small reduction in price to wipe out the modest tariff awarded to such a new industry?  When Deputy Dillon made that general statement with regard to the establishing of industries in this State, did he realise that there is no such thing as reasonable competition in lamp filament matters?  The Deputy mentioned Japan.  Can the Deputy say <Col N="1380" /> whether Japan is prepared to compete on these modest terms?  Can he say if Japan is satisfied to maintain a reasonable price and has no desire to wipe out competing industry in other countries by lower prices?  Further, when he speaks of maintaining the quality of the lamps with those imported, what quality had he in mind? I do not know if there is such a thing as standard quality for filament lamps. There is scarcely a householder in the country who has not used dud film lamps, not merely once, but many times.</P>

I know one town where there is a great welcome for it.  The people of Bray would have very little patience with the Opposition in this present instance.  If you take a town like Bray, with no industry and a population of some 12,000 people, you will find they are very glad to see the Government making this effort to give their idle men employment.</P>

Deputies opposite talk a lot about people profiteering and about the extortion that may be practised by Irish manufacturers.  Surely Deputy Dillon does not forget the other phase.

It is stated the bulk of the labour to be employed will be female labour.  I would like if the Minister could make representation to the proprietors that as far as possible they should employ male labour.  It is of course very good that even female labour should be employed, but it would be wonderfully good if male labour could be employed. There is a big surplus of unemployed men in the neighbourhood, and it would be a very much more important matter to ensure that this work was done mainly by male labour.</P>

I have used several kinds of lamps, and when not satisfied with one make, I go on to another.  I have used Phillips, Osram, Mazda, and so on.  If I buy Mazda and get a couple of duds, I may still buy Mazda, but I will get a few Osrams as well.  If Osram fail me I will get Phillips.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that these various types of lamps vie with one <Col N="1382" /> another, with a view to producing one of such excellence that there will be a demand for that in preference to some other type.  The Minister says that these are all covered in a ring, and that they are the one manufacture.  If that is so, it is a great evil.  But that is the very thing the Minister is going to do here in the Saorstát; he is going to create a virtual monopoly in Bray.  I do not want the Minister to hesitate about setting up a factory in Bray, and making it possible for that factory to pay a fair rate of wages, and to make a fair profit.  But having provided for that, I warn him to provide a margin against inefficiency; I want him to provide a fair market to pay a fair wage; and, these being secured, I want him to leave in the offering the threat of competition, if the quality of the commodity falls below the standard, or if the price tends to rise too high.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to be unkind, but my experience of the Minister's undertaking is of such a character that I would be reluctant to reciprocate. Perhaps, however, Deputy Moore sees what I am getting at now.  By all means, as I say, set up an industry and impose a tariff that will be adequate for its protection; but when setting it up and fixing a tariff, do not leave a wide margin, beyond what protection is necessary, wherein to promote either incompetence or profiteering.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Deputy how he would propose to deal with the question of a ring or a combine that was prepared to operate and make a sacrifice for a time in order to wipe out a little industry such as that in Bray.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite prepared to explain that to the Deputy.  It is possible that the Deputy may not have sufficient experience in business to realise that it is undesirable and imprudent to bid the devil good morning until you meet him.  It is quite competent for the Minister to come into the House and even to demand the sympathy of the House by saying: &ldquo;We have determined to set up a factory for the manufacture of these lamps.  We consider that under the existing circumstances 75 per cent. is a fair amount of protection and will provide sufficient margin to prevent a factory in Holland, America, the United Kingdom or anywhere else from engaging in dumping activities here.&rdquo; The Minister often has elaborated on the fact that he has the right to stop <Col N="1384" /> a ship coming up the Liffey under this Act.  So that, if any attempt were made to dump goods here with a view to putting the factory in Bray out of business, he could impose a duty of 150 per cent., if he liked, when the boat was at the bar of the River Liffey, and could serve any ring or combination with full notice that if any attempt was made to do this thing he would have no hesitation in imposing a duty of this kind so as to make it impossible for them to carry on.</P>
      <P>Now, the heads of these rings are big business men.  They are not fools and they realise that there is no use in battering their heads against a stone wall.  Provided that this Oireachtas puts on record that it is prepared to give a certain measure of protection to a factory and to maintain that measure of protection, no matter what any external merchant or manufacturer proposes to do, these men are not going to run their heads against a stone wall.  What I maintain will be done under this and what is, in fact, being done, is that somebody rambles into the Minister, or the Minister sends for somebody, and the Minister says: &ldquo;Will you manufacture lamps?&rdquo; The person says: &ldquo;Yes, if you will make it worth my while,&rdquo; and he asks for 50 per cent. or 75 per cent., or whatever it is, and it is whacked on by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And an undertaking is given that the price will not be increased. That answers the Deputy's whole argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that an undertaking is given that prices will not be increased, but he was not at all so sure, on a former occasion, that in addition there was a guarantee that quality would be maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not think that when he was steering his Cement Bill through the House.  He learned it in the course of the passing of that Bill through the House, and if he looks it up he will see that there was an amendment by the Opposition providing not only as to the price but <Col N="1385" /> as to the quality as well.  He will find that the Minister for Education said that such a proposal was absurd as to stipulate for quality.  When the Bill went to the Seanad the quality proviso was put in and it was from the Seanad that that recommendation came down here, and it was put in as a recommendation from the Seanad after being rejected by this House.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moore has some business experience and should realise that if people engage in the manufacture of filament lamps with an undertaking that the quality will be maintained, somebody will have to be the judge of the quality.  Who will judge the quality?  Is the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Finance going to examine into it once a month?</P>

      <P>There would be no necessity to waste the time of the House, or to even appear to waste its time, if the Minister would put his proposals <Col N="1387" /> before us in a decent and orderly way and tell us something about what the Government are proposing to the House.  Deputy Moore drags across the discussion here what a terrible thing it is to deprive the people in Bray of an industry.  He says that the people in Bray are looking forward anxiously to the development of this industry.  Why would they not?  Their condition, as a result of the policy of the Government for the last two years, made them anxiously accept doles of free meat and free milk and unemployment assistance.  They are looking anxiously forward to the day in which some way or another they may get a day's work. What we are anxious about is that they will be sure of that day's work, because whether the duty is 75 per cent., 80 per cent. or 100 per cent. what is important is that we shall have sound industries that serve the people satisfactorily.  The Minister is asking us to impose this duty on people already burdened with many other duties.  They are burdened with very heavy taxation which has reduced them to their present economic condition. The Minister does not give us any indication that this industry is being established on anything like secure foundations.  He knows that it is a highly technical industry, and that it has been developed to a high extent in a number of countries, so much so that he is afraid of dumping from highly organised countries.  He, apparently, has neglected to inquire about the technical guidance that the people who are setting up this industry are going to have.  He has given them the protection of a 75 per cent. tariff without enquiring how they are going to root their industry without satisfactory technical guidance.  I think that it is a crime against the people who will have to bear the duty and against the people who are expecting continuous employment in this country.</P>

The speeches from the other side are being made simply for the purpose of wasting time, arising out of a policy of obstruction.  If the Deputy wants to waste time he ought at least to be frank about this.  He ought to develop that point and say what he means.

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Order No. 37, but he assured us that it was a firm that had very extensive experience in the matter.  The Minister knows very well that we are anxious that Irish industry would be established here on Irish capital, and that one of the difficulties that we feel with regard to the establishment of Irish industry on Irish capital is the policy pursued by the Government which is destroying the main source of the production of capital in this country, namely, the agricultural industry.  The objection taken to the imposition of this duty is not either to the size of the duty or to the fact that the industry is being established by a group of Irishmen, but rather to the fact that the Minister plans to encourage the setting up of a very technical industry here, one which will impose a heavy duty upon the people, without taking any steps to inform the House or himself as to the technical experience that is going to be at the disposal of the people setting up the industry, or where that experience comes from.</P>
      <P>The Minister speaks of the discussion on these Orders being obstructive.  The Minister was told when the Orders were under discussion the other day, and he can be told again now, that discussion is taking place on them for the purpose of extracting information from him as to what he is doing under the Orders.  Until these amendments were put down no information of any kind was to be obtained by means of question from the Minister.  He pretends that he gave information to the Press but he gave no such information.  We have to admit failure to a very large extent to extract information from the Minister in the discussion on these amendments, and the only thing that the Opposition can do is to drive the Minister by question to expose his attitude in this particular matter; to get him to change his attitude, to give the House more information, and to examine proposals intended to develop Irish industry more carefully in the future than apparently he has done so far as the Orders that are before the House at the moment are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not terribly attractive, and perhaps I was not paying attention.  The Minister has been very economical in the use of his words here this evening, but I observed that he had to make some explanations three or four times.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I think the Minister would have been very well advised if he had dealt with this matter at the beginning.  It is a highly technical matter, but the Minister did not deal with it in a technical way.  The first shock which the consumers of electric current got in this country was about 24 or 25 years ago.  I do not know whether the Minister was born then or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not under this Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of the Osram lamp marked a very important improvement not only as regards durability but the light that it gave. In consequence of its introduction the consumption of electricity dropped to a marked extent.  The Dublin Corporation had to increase its prices at that time to make up for the drop in consumption.  Things have improved even since then.  It is not a question of the price of the lamp.  It is the quality and durability of the lamp which is of account.  I had one lamp in use for about ten years, which is a very unusual <Col N="1391" /> thing.  All consumers are concerned with is how long a lamp is going to last.  The Minister will admit at once that it is rather difficult to have an examination of this kind and for a firm to stand the test.  The question of price is an immaterial consideration if you get quality and durability.</P>
      <P>A tariff of 75 per cent. is rather a frightening imposition.  The Minister should have taken the House into his confidence from the very beginning with regard to that.  He could have said that there would be an imposition of 15 or 25 per cent., or some lower percentage than what is being proposed, and that would be on the present catalogued price of lamps.  I presume there is such a thing.  An imposition of 75 per cent. gives one the suspicion at the moment that this industry will require more than the usual amount of protection.  Assuming for a moment that the factory does not come up to the Minister's conception of what it should be, and that it is found necessary to add 15 or 20 per cent. to the current price of lamps, will the Minister be bound by the statement he made here this evening that he is going to compel them to sell at the present price?  Does not everybody know that after the factory is established, when it is giving employment to 200 or 300 hands, if it is otherwise successful but, that by reason of the small area of supply, prices have to be increased by 50 per cent., the Minister is not going to close that factory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is that sort of bargaining that has made the world what it is at the moment.  It is utterly unfair to ask such a factory to go into competition with the ring and to expect it to turn out goods at the same price. Anybody who believes that it will be able to do that is no businessman or has no experience.  Just contemplate for a moment the resources of this ring and the population which it has to <Col N="1392" /> supply in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  Here we have one-fifteenth of that population.  Perhaps the relative figure would be more like one-thirtieth. The firm here in Bray, started under the circumstances under which it has been started, is expected to be equal in efficiency with firms such as I have described.  The Minister shakes his head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I do not and I think that that particular frame of mind when approaching a transaction of this sort is unbalanced, absolutely unbalanced.  It is that sort of thing that keeps us here considering these matters for over an hour when they might have been disposed of much more quickly if the Minister had taken the House into his confidence and had given us the information which we require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. Cleary Mr. Cleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not have risen to speak in this debate at all were it not for the lecture that has been given us by Deputy Cosgrave.  Many of us have experience of purchasing lamps, good and bad lamps.  Some of us have a good deal of experience, and technical knowledge also, of this particular matter.  We have, I am sure, much more experience than Deputy Dillon except that he sells them at a good price.  In spite of the lecture which we had from Deputy Dillon, I would not have attempted to speak only for the attitude taken up by Deputy Cosgrave on this question.  It is the same attitude which he has taken up on all matters connected with industries started in this country.  It is by no means a special thing.  Deputy Cosgrave would lead us to believe that the delay caused is due to the fact that Deputy Dillon asked the Minister for certain information and did not get it.  Have we not had this ordeal of listening to the inferiority of the Irish worker on every occasion here on which it was proposed to impose a <Col N="1393" /> tariff to build up Irish industry?  Have we not had the same exhibition on every occasion?  We were not able to assemble motor cars.  We were not able to do anything at all which would come up to the standard of the product of the foreigner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even though we have only one-thirtieth of the purchasing power of the people across the water, I do believe that Irish brains will be capable of turning out as good lamps as any combine.  Let nobody be misled by statements such as we had from Deputy Dillon about goodwill between Irish firms and foreign firms.  The Deputy suggests that if you tell the combine that you will only put on 10 per cent. or 20 per cent. they are going to be good fellows and will not undersell you.  They will say: &ldquo;You were jolly decent to us.  You would not put on a high tariff and therefore we shall not undersell you.&rdquo;  If business were usually conducted on these lines, we <Col N="1394" /> might be able to accept that, and I, perhaps, would be thoroughly in agreement with Deputy Dillon, but Deputy Dillon knows, like everybody else, that no combine in any country would accept that jolly-good-fellow, hail-fellow-well-met idea, and that they are going to smash any business they can.  Every Deputy on the opposite side knows that the 15 per cent. tariff on boots was not a success from the Irish point of view.  Outside firms were able to undersell our producers the whole time.  This is not a matter, as Deputy Cosgrave would have us believe, of simply trying to get information. It is simply an attempt to waste the time of the House, but since it is only in comparatively recent times that Deputy Dillon could attempt to delay the work of the House or the country, we can afford to sit here until 12 o'clock.</P>

The imports of these goods last year were valued at £150,000, and the duty is imposed as a preliminary to the manufacture of edible extracts in the country.  The manufacture has not yet begun and licences for normal quantities are being issued.</P>

      <P>To delete in page 2, the reference to &ldquo;The Emergency Imposition of Duties (No. 48) Order, 1934.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Imposition of Duty Order (No. 48) imposes a duty of nearly 40 per cent. on the value of the article on rope, cord, twine, thread made of cotton, flax, hemp, ramie, jute or coir, or any like material or a combination of any two or more of those materials, but excluding binder twine and plaited or cable-laid sash-cord, and also excluding any article which at importation forms part of another article.  The Minister suggested that he had given information with regard to the import of edible fats, but I think if the Minister looks again he will find that the figures he quoted were in respect of rope.</P>

      <P>Well, whatever the Minister makes them.  The Minister told us on the Second Reading that there was a factory at Kildare for the production of cable, ropes and twines. He said it had been in production for some time and was increasing its production as it made progress.  Would the Minister tell us the amount of employment given at Kildare and the amount of employment which he expects will be given in the country if it is his intention that this Order is going to be a prohibitive one&mdash;40 per cent?  Will he say what is the position with regard to the issue of licences at the present time, and whether there is anything in the present situation which would mean a rise in the price of ropes or twines either now or later on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should point out to the Deputy that he got the information concerning edible extracts from the Minister for Agriculture on the 5th December.  He got the information, or some of the information, which he desires concerning cordage, cables, ropes, twines and threads made <Col N="1399" /> subject to duty by this Order.  Next, I should inform the Deputy that the duty imposed by this Order on cordage, cables, ropes and twines is not a new duty.  It has been in operation for some time past.  These goods are included in this Order merely for administrative convenience.  The effect of the Order is to extend the duty which has been in operation upon those goods to cotton and linen thread. There is nobody yet manufacturing either of those threads in the country. A factory for the manufacture of cotton thread is being constructed at Westport, and a factory for the manufacture of linen thread is being constructed at Dublin.  It is intended that each of those factories will produce the whole of the requirements of the country, but it is not yet possible to say what will be the total employment given in either of them, or what the total output will be.  The employment, however, is quite considerable, and the firm in each case has the benefit of the association with them of competent external firms, of which no doubt the Deputy will be glad; it is a British firm in the case of the cotton thread and a Belfast firm in the case of the linen thread.</P>

      <P>To delete in page 2, the reference to &ldquo;The Emergency Imposition of Duties (No. 51) Order, 1934.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Attention has already been called to the fact that the machinery of the Emergency Imposition of Duty Order <Col N="1401" /> has been invoked in this particular instance to impose a Customs duty. By enshrining it in this Bill now, the Minister asks us to permanently create a situation that will, as it were, draw a line after the Government's action in respect of sugar during the last 12 months.  They put on an additional Customs duty in February last and now we have this Excise duty under this Emergency Order.  The present Government are taking an extra £735,000 out of the people's pockets for what both the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce have recently characterised as a very necessary article of food for the people.  £735,000 a year is to be taken out of the people's pockets for their sugar as a result of the actions of the present Government during the last calender month.  Without any review of that position, we are asked to make that permanent decision under the guise of an Emergency Imposition of Duties Order.  I should like to hear what members of the Fianna Fáil Party have to say on the subject of taking an additional £735,000 yearly from the people's pockets.  They have been very silent all day as regards the condition of local authorities, the condition of the people generally, and the prospects of industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to protest against the imposition of this extra Excise duty on sugar.  If there was any tariff originated by the late Government that was furiously opposed by the present supporters of the Government, it was the tariff on sugar.  That tariff has now been increased beyond what anybody ever expected. This proposal is certainly putting an imposition on ordinary consumers, which they are ill able to afford at present.  I should like to ask the Minister to consider how this imposition will affect certain industries which are struggling to compete with industries in other countries.  For instance, what would be the effect on <Col N="1402" /> a large concern, that may be called a semi-Government concern, the condensed milk factory?  I have no brief for the factory, and I do not know the position there, but as an ordinary member of the community, it strikes me that any extra duty on sugar must bear heavily on a factory which is endeavouring to create an export trade against tremendous world-wide competition. There must be other concerns, with which I am not acquainted, but with which other Deputies may be, which will be affected by this increase, especially at a time when the Government is endeavouring to create new industries.  An imposition such as this must affect their policy.  Deputy Mulcahy made the case for the ordinary consumer, which every one of us could and should make, that this increased tariff falls more heavily, perhaps, on the poorer sections of the community than any other imposition that could be conceived.  The case for the poor people has been made a hundred times in this House by Deputies on these Benches and, in particular, by the Deputies who are now on the Government Benches.  The effect on industry generally has not been dealt with.  While I am opposed to the increase on these grounds, I have the opinion that this tariff is going to have a very ill effect on a great many industries that we are trying to develop, such as the condensed milk industry, which has to meet considerable competition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>When a tariff of a halfpenny a lb. was put on sugar three years ago, which indirectly helped revenue here, and had the effect of reducing the subsidy given to the Carlow sugar factory, the Minister was one of the loudest critics against the imposition of that extra halfpenny, even though the total proceeds from the halfpenny were going to help agriculture, which the Minister and his colleagues shed so many crocodile tears over now.  Three years ago the imposition was put on to do a good service.  The Minister and his Party, when they came into office, showed consistency in their opposition, by taking the Customs duty off sugar and putting it on tea, saying that they were doing that because sugar was an article that was much more required by poorer people than tea.  The duty on tea still remains, while the duty on sugar goes up, for no earthly reason that I can see, except to provide revenue.  I wonder if the Minister has thought how this will affect various industries that are dependent on sugar.  What about protected industries, such as jam making, condensed milk, to which Deputy Bennett referred, the curing of bacon and hams, as well as numerous other industries that I cannot enumerate?  Apart from being an essential food, sugar finds its way to a great extent into every industry.  It is an article that we produce ourselves.  If there is one article that should not be unnecessarily taxed in this country, it is sugar, because we are coming to a production of 100 per cent. of our requirements. No country in the world has been able to produce beet sugar at a price that will compare economically with cane sugar.  It has to be subsidised in every country.  Now, when we are beginning to produce it on a large scale, we are going to have it taxed to provide revenue.  Is there nothing else to tax but sugar?  Hemmed in on all sides by prohibitive tariffs, when no more can be extracted from these tariffs, we start internal taxation, and there is <Col N="1404" /> not a word of explanation.  The Minister's Department is now in receipt of about £3,000,000 more from Customs duties than his predecessor was in receipt of three years ago, when sugar was little more than half the price it is to-day.  The Minister shed crocodile tears over the poor of this country when he was against the imposition of an additional halfpenny per pound.</P>
      <P>Now the price of that sugar, in order to protect sugar production in this country, had to be raised, but on top of that the Minister is now putting on another ½d. or ¾d., and there is no explanation. He said that he gave his reasons for it on the Second Reading of the Bill.  I am afraid the reasons the Minister gave are so flimsy that he is afraid to repeat them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister states that he made clear on the Second Reading of the Sugar Bill that a tax would be necessary.  That is not so. In introducing the Sugar Bill the Minister will recollect that he stated that the price he was assuming to pay for beet was 35/- per ton and that, with the return of certain of the bye-products valued at 3/9, it was 38/9.  Now, he is not paying 35/- per ton.</P>

      <P>The Minister said in the course of the Second Reading speech that it would not be necessary to put on more than ¾d. of a protective duty and, further, that ½d. only might be necessary and that ¾d. would not be required.  He said &ldquo;The extension of this factory will not cost the consumers that additional ½d. or ¾d. per lb.&rdquo;  Now ¾d. has been added before the sugar is for sale.  The sugar is not yet for sale.</P>

      <P>I have only one thing to say and that is, that the attitude which the Opposition Party has taken up in this matter is consistent.  They have fought tooth and nail against the extension and development of any industry in this country from the moment they went into opposition.  I quite clearly indicated, when the Sugar Bill was before the Dáil, that, in certain circumstances, it might be necessary to put an additional duty of ¾d. per lb. on sugar, and these circumstances have arisen.  The fact of the matter is that, even with the additional increase on sugar now, the total revenue to be derived from tea and sugar in this year will be almost £200,000 less than our predecessors derived from sugar alone in the financial year which ended on the 31st March, 1932.  In addition to that, we have the four factories working turning out 80,000 tons of our sugar requirements.</P>

      <P>The position is that in every Budget the Minister introduced since he came into office he largely increased taxation upon the people, as well as collaring moneys that were properly due to be paid in another way, and in the year ending 31st December, 1934, he will have put his hand deeply into the pockets of the ordinary people and taken out as an increased price for sugar an additional £735,000.  It is no wonder that he tried to remain silent.</P>

      <P>The Minister has made a little explanatory statement at the end of the debate.  He made play with the fact that the revenue derived from tea and sugar is some £200,000 less than the duty on sugar alone two years ago.  Everybody knows that the policy of the Minister has practically been to wipe out the import of sugar into this country.  That policy might be quite correct, but it does away with his revenue.  He is not going to get away by drawing that red herring across the track and trying to persuade the people <Col N="1407" /> that they are saving £200,000 when everybody knows that sugar alone is costing them ½d. or ¾d. per lb. more than at that particular time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, the first Article of Section 5 proposes that a person whose Irish citizenship is dubious may go to the Minister and the Minister may, if he thinks proper so to do, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, issue to such person a certificate of naturalisation containing an express statement that it is issued solely to remove doubts or to settle a question or dispute.  It seems to me that that is eminently a judicial function.  The man in question is in a peculiar position.  He is not quite sure whether he is a citizen or not.  The question may have some relation to a case in the courts.  In such circumstances a person can, according to this article, go quietly to the Minister, talk the matter over with him, and receive from him a certificate that is to put beyond further question the issue whether or not he was at a previous date a citizen of this State.  Now it seems to be quite an unwarrantable proposal, if there is a case in the courts and a decision has been made, whether a man was a citizen of the State or not, that that man can come along and say: &ldquo;The Minister will give me a certificate which will be binding and will remove any doubts.&rdquo;  That seems to me eminently to be a case, even if the Minister himself had all the data, that should be referred to a judicial authority,</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The section says: &ldquo;When a person applies under this Act to the Minister for a certificate of naturalisation and states in such application that he claims to be a citizen of Saorstát Eireann and that some doubt ... has arisen as to whether he is or is not entitled to such citizenship ... the Minister may, if he thinks proper so to <Col N="1412" /> do, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, issue to such person a certificate of naturalisation containing an express statement that it is issued solely to remove doubts or to settle a question of dispute.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy now read sub-section (2)?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-section (2) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The issue to any person of a certificate of naturalisation under this section shall not be evidence or an admission that such person was not a citizen of Saorstát Eireann prior to the issue of such a certificate and shall not prejudice or affect any claim by such person to have been a citizen of Saorstát Eireann at any time prior to such issue.</P>
      <P>Reading that sub-section quickly, it seems to apply only in a negative case. The Minister gives him a certificate, but this says that that is not to imply that he was not a citizen before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not mean that the Minister has decided whether he is or is not a citizen.  This confers upon the Minister jurisdiction to grant a certificate of naturalisation where there is some doubt that might give rise to trouble.  The Minister meets the situation by giving a certificate. He is not adjudicating on whether he is or is not a citizen.  It is simply meeting a difficulty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that there is a doubt that should be settled by a judge, not necessarily a judge in court but, perhaps, by a judge in chambers.  The case of an ordinary man coming along for a certificate of naturalisation is one thing.  Here, in fact, the Minister is resolving a thing in which it seems to me, if there is a doubt whether the person is or is not a citizen, the proper person to resolve that is a judge and not a Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any use arguing this.  The Deputy does not understand the nature of the section.  The Minister has power to grant a certificate of naturalisation. A person can come and ask for a certificate of naturalisation.  Certain conditions of time and so on would be imposed.  The section says there is doubt about his citizenship and the person comes along and says: &ldquo;I want that doubt resolved so far as the future is concerned.  I do not want my status to be in any doubtful position.  I want it beyond yea or nay that I am a citizen.&rdquo;  The Minister examines the question and comes to the conclusion that it is a proper case in which he can issue a certificate.  But he does not purport to decide the question as to whether he was or was not a citizen previous to that.  If there was any question involving court action that court action would go on until he was convinced there was a decision in his favour.  In this you give the Minister discretionary power to grant a certificate of naturalisation, in order that the status of a person in doubt may be put on a clearly defined position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that it is to remove doubts.  There is something that is in doubt if a person in that position applies in the ordinary way to be naturalised and become a citizen.  I take the words &ldquo;the Minister may, if he thinks proper so to do, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, issue to such a person a certificate of naturalisation containing an express statement that it is issued solely to remove doubts or to settle a question of dispute.&rdquo;  What are the doubts?  Whether a man is or <Col N="1414" /> is not a citizen.  If the Minister by fulfilling an administrative act makes him a citizen there is no question but that from that moment he becomes a citizen.  Why this question about removing doubts?  It is a case where the person himself or other persons may be dubious about a question turning on fact of law, and the Minister takes steps to remove those doubts.  If it was a question of baptism, a person may not know whether or not he was baptised.  A person comes to the Minister and says he is in doubt and the Minister says to him if you are in doubt whether you are a citizen, I now make you a citizen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>May I raise this point, which is somewhat similar, but not identical, with the point raised by Deputy Fitzgerald.  In the ordinary course, when the Minister is certifying naturalisation under Section 4, there are certain limitations.  If you read the section you will see that the Minister shall not issue a certificate unless he is satisfied, sub-section (3), paragraph (a), that such person is of good character, (b) that there are certain qualifications as to residence, and (c) and (d) certain declarations.  Now, I wonder why a certificate of naturalisation as provided for in Section 5 should not be at least subject to the same limitations as under Section 4.  It seems to me to be left altogether too much to the discretion <Col N="1415" /> of the Minister to do what he likes in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>If he were to proceed in the way indicated by the Deputy, it is quite clear that he would be more or less deciding the question.  If he says that this person has to have a period of residence, or if he insists on anything else, he is, in fact, deciding the case, because if, in fact, the person was a citizen, he has no jurisdiction, but where there is what he considers a genuine doubt, he may give a certificate. Consequently, this is quite consistent with the position with regard to a non-citizen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Where the Minister says that there is evidence in the case which makes it right and proper for him to give the person concerned this certificate, it means that henceforth&mdash; although this is not deciding about the past conditions&mdash;that person is entitled to the rights and privileges that belong to citizenship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the President's point, but for the very reason that it has reference only to the future and not to the past.  The Minister, while he might not insist on a residence qualification, surely ought to be compelled to insist on the other requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>He is not called upon to consider whether or not the person was, in fact, a citizen, because the thing has only future effect, and as it has only future effect, and as he is issuing the certificate in the same spirit as he would issue an ordinary certificate of naturalisation, I hold that he should make the same requirements that are made in that case as to good character, and the intention of the person to reside in Saorstát Eireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the two cases should be put on the same footing, because the idea is to extend the class to which the Minister may grant a certificate of naturalisation.  His jurisdiction arises <Col N="1416" /> from the fact that, to his mind, there is a genuine doubt as to whether or not the person is entitled to citizenship. If the person were a citizen, as the President has pointed out, he would be entitled to get a certificate without going under these tests, and if there is a genuine doubt as to whether or not he is entitled to citizenship, is it not reasonable that he should be allowed to receive his naturalisation certificate in order to remove that doubt without going through the tests which an ordinary applicant for naturalisation has to go through?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing here to stop him, I agree with the Deputy; but we assume that the Minister will exercise his functions properly in that regard.  If the Minister is satisfied, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, that there is a genuine doubt, he is entitled to issue a certificate of naturalisation with a view to removing the doubt. That is the principle underlying the handling of these applications generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What both the President and the Attorney-General have said confirms my view that the Minister in this case is exercising a judicial function.  A man comes before the Minister with an application for a certificate of naturalisation.  That man either is a citizen or he is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is acting judicially, but he is not exercising judicial power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, he is acting judicially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Then, clearly, the ordinary course ought to be followed, but the Minister, while actually acting under that section, is himself judging. He says, in effect: &ldquo;I define that <Col N="1417" /> there is a difference between the position of this man and a man who is not a citizen.&rdquo;  In doing that, he is assessing evidence to the point of saying that this man is different from a non-citizen and that, therefore, he has not got to fulfil the conditions that a non-citizen has to fulfil in order to become a citizen.  My argument is that, inasmuch as the Minister is defining the difference between that man and the man who is not a citizen, he is making the decision himself, and I hold that he is not the proper person to make that decision.  It seems to me that the proper course would be to send that matter to a judge in chambers for decision.  If the man says: &ldquo;I am in doubt as to whether I am a citizen or not and I want this matter cleared up; will you make me a citizen?&rdquo; there is the ordinary rule to be followed.  On the other hand, if he says: &ldquo;I am convinced that I am a citizen, but other people say that I am not a citizen,&rdquo; then that matter can be judged according to law.  But here &mdash;not that I wish to disagree with the President or to look for a means of misunderstanding either him or the Attorney-General&mdash;both the President and the Attorney-General say that the Minister does make the decision that that man's case is different from the case of a person who is not a citizen.  That seems to me to be a case which is a matter for judgment in the courts on the evidence.  It seems to me that that is a matter which should be sent before a person who is qualified to judge it and who is employed or appointed for deciding such questions as this. In my opinion, if the Minister gets the evidence, he should send it on to a judge in chambers for a decision.  I do not think that the Minister should be the person to make the decision or that he should be the person to say that people&mdash;who probably are not citizens at all&mdash;need not fulfil the ordinary requirements because, in his judgment, they are citizens.  I feel that the right thing would be for some person in a judicial capacity to decide the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, we understand each other, at any rate.  It is quite <Col N="1418" /> clear that the Deputy wants this Bill to be operated by the machinery of the courts, and that is the way it is done in other countries.  We, however, want it to be a matter for decision by the Minister concerned, and the Minister will be acting in a judicial manner.  Acting in that capacity, he will be considering whether the people concerned are fit and proper persons to be citizens.  That is the process proposed in the Bill and it is the foundation of the whole Bill.  The Deputy may differ with that mode of procedure and he may think that the method of procedure through the courts is a better process.  All that is necessary for us, I think, is that we should understand each other and understand what is implied in these proposals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>All I am asking is whether the Minister should be the person to undertake to remove the doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is putting it with regard to the future. A citizen comes along, for instance, and says: &ldquo;Look here.  There is a point of view expressed which seems to indicate that I am a citizen and there is another point of view which would seem to indicate that I am not a citizen.  I, however, claim that I am a citizen.&rdquo;  He makes his case for being regarded as a citizen, and the Minister, in circumstances like that, says &ldquo;I will give you a certificate of naturalisation in order to remove the doubt, it being clearly understood that that does not resolve the question of whether, previous to this, you were or were not a citizen.&rdquo;  It is, so to speak, without prejudice.  And there is nothing here to prevent him from coming along and saying, in connection with any particular action: &ldquo;Not merely have I this particular certificate of naturalisation to remove doubts, but in this application I claim that I am a natural-born citizen anyway.&rdquo; Is not that so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>My objection is that if a man comes along in that way, the Minister could say: &ldquo;If you are a citizen, well then you are a citizen and you can just go ahead and merely act on that, and if anything arises in <Col N="1419" /> the meantime it can be decided; otherwise, if you want to make certain for the future you can be naturalised in the ordinary way.&rdquo;  But he goes before the Minister and says: &ldquo;I think I am a citizen for such-and-such reasons but I may not be a citizen for such-and-such other reasons, and I ask you now to put it beyond doubt.&rdquo;  By putting the matter beyond doubt in that way, the Minister certainly has decided that that person's condition is certainly different from that of a non-citizen, and the mere fact that the Minister exercises that machinery rather than the other method means that he himself is deciding the issue, and it seems to me that it is not the Minister who should decide that matter.</P>

      <P>On the application of the parent or guardian.  It seems to me that the President wants to have it clearly laid down and understood that this would be done in a case in which a parent or guardian proposed to settle here.  The sort of case that would seem to me to justify it would be if you had <Col N="1422" /> people living in, say, Lithuania, the mother, a widow, being Irish, and that she proposed to come and live here with her family.  It might be desirable in that kind of case where the mother desired to come back here with her children.  The real guiding course in this should be the fact that the guardian or parent proposed to settle with the children here, but as far as I can see there is nothing of that nature in the section at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If the section said that this certificate would only be given on the application of a parent or guardian when the Minister was satisfied that the parent or guardian proposed to live in this country there might be a case for this, but as I read the section, a mother living in Lithuania can apply to the Minister to have her children registered as Irish.  They may come here for a year or so to attend school or something like that. But that gives no real indication as to where the children are likely to reside when they come of age, because then they will be able to decide for themselves.  I object on principle to this section if it indicates a separation of nationality as between children and parents.  There is no provision that the parent or guardian shall live here. I can see no reason for this section except in cases where the parent or guardian proposes to live here with the children.  In that event I think the President would have a good case for this, but unless he makes such a provision it would be wrong in principle to do what is proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see anything that is wrong in principle in it.  There has to be a certain amount of elasticity given to the Minister.  We cannot envisage all possible cases. This Bill is already a fairly lengthy measure without trying to deal with all possible cases that might arise.  If we were to follow the suggestions thrown out by Deputy Fitzgerald we would be obliged to have a Bill of huge volume to try to deal with all the possible conditions and circumstances under which certain <Col N="1423" /> things could be done.  We have to depend largely on the discretion of the Minister who will issue the certificates. There are cases where it is advisable that he should have power to do this and we have to depend on him to exercise that power wisely without adverting to all the governing and attendant circumstances.  For instance, there are people in India whose children are here.  It is the intention of these people probably to come back from India and settle here afterwards, and there may be no intention on their part that their children should join them.  It is better from the start to assume that their children should belong to the nationality with which they are associated.  We cannot take all exceptional cases.  We have given directions in various ways, but we cannot by any possible code cover all possible circumstances which would arise.  The only way to deal with these matters is to give a certain amount of discretion and a certain amount of elasticity to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The President could have brought in a much shorter Bill saying that all persons shall be citizens or not citizens, as shall be decided by the Minister in his discretion.  That, I admit, would be pushing the thing to caricature.  The President says that you cannot have laws dealing with every possible case.  The position of the law ordinarily should be that no minor&mdash;a person not in control of his own actions&mdash;shall be naturalised. That seems to be the first thing.  There is certainly a case, one obvious case, which would justify a deviation from that principle.  That would be the case of the parent or guardian coming to live in this country clearly with the intention of living in the country, and whose children would also live in the country.  Then you might say: &ldquo;There is a case for naturalising the minors.&rdquo;  But the President looks round and is rather hard put to it to find some sort of case that would justify this definite provision in law. It is a well-known principle that exceptional cases make bad laws.  The basic law should be that no minor is going to be naturalised and, secondly, <Col N="1424" /> that nobody is going to be naturalised unless he comes to this country with the clear intention of living in this country.  Here we have minors who are going to be naturalised when there is no clear intention that they are going to live in this country.  Minors should be naturalised only through their parents or guardians living abroad and with the clear intention that they are going to reside here. The minors may not intend to live here but the Minister would seem in this case specifically to naturalise them.  In principle it seems to be wrong although I admit that there might easily be cases which would make it eminently desirable to depart from the basic principle.  The principle here is completely wrong on the face of it.  The ordinary thing in this Bill should be that minors, who are not able to make up their minds for themselves, should not be naturalised except on the application of a parent or guardian and on the clear intention that they are going to live here.</P>

      <P>Why should it be a principle that minors should not be naturalised?  There are certain conditions attached to certificates of naturalisation in the case of minors. There are conditions by which they make declarations of alienage if they go out of the country, so as to deprive them of the certificate, but why should it be a principle that minors should not be naturalised?

      <P>Certainly; quite a lot.  But when a young person lives, as I might say, subject to the tutelage of a parent or guardian, then it seems to me that the judgment should be passed really on the parent or guardian.  When I say that a minor should not be naturalised, I mean that <Col N="1425" /> he should not be naturalised in relation to himself, but in relation to the person responsible for him.  Take the case, say, of an Irishwoman who was married abroad and who, on becoming a widow, came back here with her children.  She intends to live here, and she asks to have her children naturalised.  She does not want a divergence of nationality as between herself and her children, and with that I quite agree.  But in most cases of minors, the real thing to guide judicial authority or the Minister is the parent or guardian.  Here we provide that a parent or a guardian living in Russia can apply that their children shall be Irish citizens and the application can be granted.  To my mind that is completely wrong in principle.  When the minor ceases to be a minor, he is his own master, and can decide on his own actions.  Up to that time it is the parent or the guardian who must be responsible for him, and the child should be judged in relation to the parent or guardian. Consequently, if the Minister is satisfied that the parent or guardian does not intend to reside here, he should not grant a certificate of naturalisation. The general purport of it would be to give the children a different nationality to that of the parent or guardian, which would be wrong in principle.</P>

She wishes that these children should in every way become Irish citizens, should be eligible to sit for Civil Service examinations here and have all the rights and privileges of citizens.

      <P>It appears to me that this section gives much wider powers to the Minister than are necessary. I do not know whether there is a parallel elsewhere but it seems a very remarkable provision to give the Minister power to naturalise any minor whatsoever.  Does the President not think that that is going very far?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>

      <P>Surely it might be limited to children of Irish born parents or Irish born grandparents or to the children of people who had complied with the ordinary conditions of naturalisation, or with some of these conditions?

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>It is wide; I am not denying that for a moment; but it is based on the belief that in these cases the Minister will take all the circumstances into account.  Our marriage provisions make it extremely desirable. We have nationality descending through the father.  There are cases where great hardship would result through that, and we are, in this way, enabling the children to overcome that. I gave one of the best examples possible. In regard to our people, we are in a very peculiar position.  The fact that this wide power might not be paralleled in the laws of other countries is due to this reason, that we are in an <Col N="1427" /> exceptional position.  A greater proportion of people born here reside outside than is the case in any other country in the world.  Some 46 or 47 per cent. of the people born in this country are resident outside it.</P>

      <P>We are bringing in a special clause to deal with these cases. We do not ask that the parent be an Irish national or if the parent or guardian intends to live here.  We are providing that a person living abroad can apply to have the children naturalised as Irish, whether they are going to live here or not.  It seems to me to be a wrong principle, and the President has made no case for it.  The child can guarantee nothing.</P>

      <P>I take the case of an Irish mother in America who took out American citizenship.  Her husband dies, and she is going to continue living in America.  She may have to earn her livelihood there.  She breaks up her home and she decides she wants these children brought up here at home.  She sends them here.  Is the Minister to be prevented, by our tying his hands, from giving a certificate immediately in such cases?  We are here trying to untie his hands and give him a certain amount of freedom.  I can quite understand Deputy MacDermot's point.  I do not agree with Deputy Fitzgerald about the basis of the thing.  There is, perhaps, a point in saying that this is an exceptionally wide power and we ought not to give such power of discretion to the Minister.  I promise I will look into it.  We may not be able to cover the number of cases that we think ought to be covered.  If we can, without tying the hands of the Minister in cases where his hands should be loose, we will try to limit it.  If we can do it without unduly putting in a large number of provisos and conditions, we will limit it, but it may be extremely difficult.</P>

      <P>That implication seemed to be there.  The President says you cannot visualise everything that may turn up.  It is generally recognised that hard cases make bad law.  The President says we must recognise that all sorts of unforeseen things, and peculiar and extraordinary cases, may turn up, and we must be able to say whether in any one of these extraordinary cases a person should be naturalised.  That seems to be a perfectly ridiculous way of approaching legislation.  The President says there may be a woman in America who wants her children to be of a different citizenship from her own, and she wants them to live here, with the Atlantic ocean between them and her. We are asked to give the Minister unlimited powers to be in a position to deal with such a case if it turns up. In my opinion, every effort should be made to prevent the mother having the children of a different citizenship from herself and to prevent her having the Atlantic ocean between herself and her children.  This is the natural order, although possibly the President thinks it is ridiculous.  It is altogether wrong to give the Minister such unlimited power just because some unforeseen case may arise.</P>

      <P>The President says you cannot foresee the types of cases that may arise, and if you were to map out exactly each case that might arise you would have an enormous Bill.  I quite agree.  But the same would apply to every other Bill.  What you do is to regard a certain thing as normal and provide for that.  There might be obvious things that might require a slight extension.  The President says that as we cannot foresee the peculiar circumstances that may arise, which may make it desirable that naturalisation should be given in a given case, then we must see to it that there is no possibility in any case where it would be desirable that it should be given, that it will be excluded.  It is an entirely wrong way of approaching the whole idea of law making, and we are bringing in clauses here to provide for cases that are absolutely exceptional, on the face of them.  The law here should be directed in the opposite direction, to see to it that an American mother has her children American, at least, during the time they are minors, and that she should have them on the same side of the Atlantic with her.</P>

I presume that the information would have relation to the man's conduct, and one thing or another.  All the matters laid down in this clause would be matters that would affect a decision for the revoking of a certificate, and those are eminently matters that should be decided upon by a judge rather than by a Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first case if the Minister had known, for instance, that the man was not of good character he would have refused the certificate. When the Minister gives the certificate he is not affirming that the man is of good character but saying that it must be presumed he is of good character unless there is information to the contrary. That principle always applies. You are not liable to be taken before a judge and condemned because you cannot prove that you are a perfectly law-abiding citizen; there has to be evidence to prove that you are not.  In this case the Minister undertakes to decide, without any reference to a judge, that a person is not of good character.  That is a judgment of the Minister there.  It seems to me that it would be much more appropriate to have the decision that a man is not of good character made by a judge than by the Minister.</P>

      <P>In the first instance the Minister has satisfied himself as to whether a person is indeed a proper person to be given a certificate of naturalisation.  At that time he is satisfied that he is a fit person.  Certain things subsequently happen which <Col N="1436" /> convince him that the person is not a fit and proper person to continue to have a certificate, and he revokes it. He is acting practically in the same manner in both cases.</P>

      <P>The amendment which we are discussing does not really go quite as far as the principle which Deputy Fitzgerald has been defending. The amendment seeks only to lay down conditions for revocation, which after all are analogous to the conditions that have to exist before a certificate of naturalisation is granted.  Is there any reason why the Minister should be given absolute power to revoke, without his being called upon to supply any reasons at all?  Surely the amendment in the names of Deputy Dockrell and Deputy Good could only have the effect of ensuring that revocation would not take place unless proper causes for that revocation existed?  Is there any reason why the Government should not accept that point of view?</P>

      <P>The President seems to me to be taking up a most unreasonable attitude on this amendment. This section deals with the revocation of a certificate of naturalisation; in other words, it deals with the taking away of what is, according to the President, one of the greatest privileges a man could have &mdash;citizenship of this State.  How is this great privilege going to be taken from a man?  It is put entirely within the absolute discretion of the Minister. Unlike Deputy MacDermot, I think this amendment (No. 11) is one of the most important amendments in the whole Bill, because, when a man is having that privilege taken from him, namely, the privilege of citizenship, he most certainly should have the right to have that question decided in the courts.  The President is reluctant, of course, to take away that word &ldquo;absolute&rdquo; from any line of this Bill, and it is obvious why.  He has had the experience of the court here during the last six months interfering with Executive acts, and interfering rightly with them.  We may easily have cases in which citizenship is wrongly taken away from a citizen of this State.  I say that certainly that matter should not be within the absolute discretion of any Minister.</P>

It is quite clear that there are other cases in which it may be desirable, from the general point of view of public order, and so on, to cease giving a person the right to claim protection.  There are numbers of other cases besides this covered, and in which it is desirable that there should be power somewhere to deal with.</P>

      <P>The President takes up what seems to be an arbitrary attitude. If a person satisfies certain conditions, that he is of good character, he should get a naturalisation certificate, but the Minister has the right to take that away.  Surely the implication is that if a person's naturalisation certificate is revoked that is a condemnation of that person on some ground.  The President seems to regard any restrictions whatever on the Executive as completely bad.  He may be quite <Col N="1439" /> right.  The whole structure of the State is that while it is necessary that the Executive should have certain powers, they should be controlled by the Dáil, by the law of the country, and these arbitrary powers that the President seems to think so necessary, should only be granted when abundantly and clearly necessary.  Here a Minister may decide that a man is not of good character.  He revokes a certificate of naturalisation, as proposed here &ldquo;at his absolute discretion.&rdquo; He may not like the colour of a man's hair.  I think that is a caricature. Here is a judgment of a man's character in one case, and on certain factual matters.  A Minister takes the power of the most arbitrary judge and says with regard to citizenship, which should be regarded as one of the greatest rights&mdash;I do not say privileges &mdash;of the people of this country, he can take it away at &ldquo;his absolute discretion,&rdquo; whereas a court has to judge the evidence and give a reasoned judgement on it, while a Minister in his closed star chamber issues his condemnation of the man.  It seems to me, the clear thing should be that if the Minister judges that a man ceases to fulfil the conditions upon which naturalisation was granted, in his judgment that might seem to justify revoking.  The clear case would be to send the information to a judge, or to a judge in chambers, and let him decide.  For one Minister on the Front Bench to sit down in his office, and say that man should no longer be a citizen of this country, because he is satisfied he is not a man of good character&mdash;and I do not see what right he has to condemn a man on the strength of not liking his character, and to propose to take from him citizenship of this State is different.  I know that the President can get up and say that he can do that, as he has a majority, but surely the whole idea of the Dáil is that there should be some sort of discussion and reason, and that as a result a thing should be shown to be desirable or justifiable.  The President does not do that.  He says that we must assume that a Minister is going to act honourably <Col N="1440" /> and to have some sense of responsibility.  In that case why not give Ministers discretionary power to behead us at will.</P>

      <P>We have here a clash of opinions as to whether certain powers should reside in the Executive authority or not when terminating the right of a person who has got a privilege on a certain understanding.  The Minister satisfied himself that that person was of good character, and was a fit and proper person to remain a member of the community.  After a time the Minister from information at his disposal finds that this person is not conducting himself properly.  He may have come in to acquire citizenship really for the purpose of engaging in subversive action, or he may be the political agent of another country. These are matters which will be decided on the information the Executive Council has.  If we are going to give a Minister the power of giving a certificate, and of giving that privilege, there is no reason why he should not have equally the power of taking it away.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>My desire is to support the amendment of Deputy Dockrell and Deputy Good.  As regards the wider question, my point of view is that if the Minister is to have the powers that he is going to have under the Bill, of conferring citizenship he should have equally the powers of revoking it.  It seems clear that he should have as much power of revoking as of conferring or, if blunders are made, as they may easily be made, <Col N="1441" /> they can be undone.  One can take that point of view and still approve of the amendments of Deputy Dockrell and Deputy Good.  It would appear from a remark that dropped from the President that he had not really considered these amendments, and whether to accept them, before coming here.  He seemed to think they were connected with the question of the wife.  They are not connected with that question at all. I suggest that these amendments are well worthy of study on the merits, and amount to nothing more than that in revoking a certificate of naturalisation the Minister should be called upon to take into consideration the same sort of matters that he takes into consideration when granting the certificate of naturalisation, and that he should not be given absolute power to revoke without any of the causes here mentioned existing.  I do not think that is unreasonable.  I think it is reasonable and logical, and that it then makes it what it ought to be, a counterpart of the power given to confer naturalisation.  I ask the President to consider the matter again from that point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considered <Col N="1442" /> the matter and I am quite satisfied that it is necessary.  When a person has been given a certificate of naturalisation the Minister has certain information and satisfies himself from the information at his disposal that this is a person to whom a certificate of naturalisation should be granted. On his coming here, the Minister is able to get further information as to his conduct and satisfies himself, as the result of this information, that this person is not behaving himself properly.  On that account, he might think that that certificate had been unwisely given, or, at least, that the person who got it abused the privilege, and he should be allowed discretionary power to remove it.  As regards the other point, as the section stands, in certain cases he is compelled to revoke.</P>

      <P>In this section there is an assumption that the husband and wife should have a different nationality.  That, I think, is a hideous principle to maintain.  If nationality means anything and if Christian marriage means anything, then certainly there should not be a national frontier drawn between husband and wife.  This modern, ridiculous point of view of the wife having a different nationality from her husband, largely derived and became troublesome, in my experience, through the war fever in America. When America entered the war there was that hectic condition of mind where people wanted to denounce Germans.  They found that that included a number of American women who were married to German husbands.  In an insane way it was assumed that nationality had a greater reality than marriage.  To me, it is outrageous and unnatural to assume that in the event of war you have the husband who is of one nationality fighting for his country and you may have the wife making munitions to blow him up.  In this section here there is that assumption; there is that lunatic nationalism that marriage means nothing as against nationality. That is a complete denial of Christian marriage.</P>

      <P>They only prove the rule.  The general rule is that citizenship is unitary.  In the main, persons have only single citizenship. Here the right of citizenship is being taken from the parent.  It is also being taken from the child, who has committed no crime and no offence whatever against the State.  The child whose citizenship is taken away may be a perfectly loyal citizen.  I intended to speak on Section 9, but I allowed it to pass.  This is complete absolutism. What is to be done with those children whose citizenship is taken away?  It is bad enough to take away the citizenship of a person who has committed an offence against the State.  That is going very far.  My view is that the moment you issue a certificate of citizenship to a person you confer upon him an immutable right.  You have taken him as a citizen for good or ill, and the right should not be taken from him.  Here, you claim the right to take citizenship away.  On top of that, you are going to take the right of citizenship from the children.</P>

      <P>Why should they be brought into the matter?  They have committed no offence by omission or commission, by word, thought or act. Yet, the Government is taking powers to take away their citizenship because the parent has committed an offence, or rather because the Minister thinks he has committed an offence, and is a bad character whose right to citizenship should be withdrawn.  Deputies should ponder before they give a Government this power.  Are these children to be left without the possibility of getting citizenship here or elsewhere? If they do not get citizenship here, where they were born, where their parents have had their domicile and have had citizenship, where are they to get it?  It is all very well to take these arbitrary powers, but we should remember that this is a Citizenship Bill and that a very long view should be taken in respect of it.  All the implications of it should be taken into account.  It is a very drastic thing to take away citizenship.  It is a power that, in my opinion, should not be given to the Minister, to the courts, or to any other authority except in the case of treason.  Bad character should not constitute a case for taking away citizenship.  If you take citizenship from a certified citizen, why not take it from a natural-born citizen?  There are plenty of bad natural-born citizens in every country.  Yet no court and no Government can take away the right of citizenship from them.  When citizenship is conferred, it should be conferred for good or ill and should not be taken away except for treason. Under this Bill, children who have committed no offence may lose citizenship of this State, and it may be utterly impossible for them to obtain citizenship elsewhere.</P>

      <P>I should like to say a few words in answer to the rameis to which we have just listened. It would be a good idea if a Deputy like Deputy McMenamin, who is a lawyer, would choose his words more carefully when he gets up to speak on a matter like this.  He might have gone to the trouble of examining the laws of <Col N="1450" /> other countries before coming to the conclusion that this particular section is a drastic section introduced by an absolutist Government.  It is really a liberal provision.  It is far more liberal than is the case in other countries.  We have Deputy Fitzgerald stating that if he had his way he would insist that the moment the parent was deprived of citizenship the children would be deprived of citizenship in order to preserve the unity of the family.  Deputy McMenamin gets up and insists that the child should not change his citizenship with the father.</P>

I should like to draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that there is provision in the section to preserve the child's nationality, and that only by a positive act on the part of the Minister can a change be effected. As I said before, this is a liberal and not an illiberal section.</P>

      <P>Is there any machinery by which the Minister for Justice will deal with this matter?  The question to be decided, in this particular section, is the citizenship of the child of a person whose certificate is revoked.  Extraordinary power is given to the Ministry under this section &mdash;much more power than, I think, is appreciated by the Government.  I do not at all agree with Deputy Fitzgerald that the family should follow the father.  If the father goes to Maryborough prison, there is no reason why the children should follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe a very clear and accurate expression of these powers should be set out.  I do not suggest that the Department of Justice will be unfair, though it could and might.  But I think persons who are not citizens and who have children, and would come within Section 11&mdash; and other persons who would cease to be citizens under Section 11 and have children&mdash;should have some guarantee that there will be a most rigid and critical examination of the children's interest.  If that is so, and if a person is a bad character and has got a certificate of naturalisation and goes to Maryborough jail, I do not believe the children should go.  I do not believe <Col N="1452" /> the sins of the father should fall upon the children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on this matter before we pass from it.  Everybody knows the Minister would not operate this himself personally.  In 99 cases out of 100 this will be deputed to members of his staff, properly chosen.  They will gain experience as time goes on, and there will, in effect, be a little departmental court to examine these cases. It may be one person or it may be more.  Before the Minister gives his sanction he will make such arrangements as will enable him to see that the cases are tested and approved before they are settled.  He will, in ordinary administration, devise some machinery for examining all these cases.  I want to stress what the Attorney-General said, that what is done here is done in the interests of the children themselves.  That has to be got into the heads of Deputies.  It would be unfair that revocation of the certificate of a parent should automatically deprive the child of the privilege of citizenship here.  That would be directly visiting the sins of the father upon the children.  If the Minister revokes the certificate of naturalisation of the person to whom he gave that privilege&mdash;for it is a privilege, not a right&mdash;he is revoking a privilege, not a natural born right.  It is a privilege given to an outsider who has no natural right to it and who is given the privilege of adoption.  If such a person behaves in a way which is clearly an abuse of that privilege, and the Minister has to revoke his certificate, then the question of the children has to be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dual nationality is not a rare thing. The mere fact that we will give a certificate of naturalisation to citizens of another country would not, in every case, automatically deprive such citizens of their previous nationality.  In the case of Belgian citizens, the nationality or citizenship of another State does not deprive them of their previous nationality.  In the case of Belgian citizens, the nationality or citizenship of another State does not deprive them of their Belgian nationality. <Col N="1453" /> There are other such States. Suppose we gave a certificate of naturalisation to the citizen of another State and he abused that privilege, and did not behave in a manner that would be right for a member of our community.  We say there is no reason why we should continue to give this person that right, and that our Minister may revoke it.  He might immediately deport him to Belgium or to whatever other country he belonged.  It might be right in the interests of the children to send the children with him, not to have them parted from their parents. That might be in the interests of the children.  There are other cases where it might not be in the interests of the children.  Here discretion is given to the Minister to determine in every case what is the right and proper thing to do, and it is intended to exercise that right in the interests of the children so far as their interest is compatible with our country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

      <P>If a person comes here and is naturalised as an Irish citizen and is found, under conditions of strained relationship, acting against this country in the interests of the country of his origin, surely this State is going to treat that person as a traitor to this country and not merely as a patriot to his own country?  Such persons would be regarded as traitors acting against this country.  Therefore, when a Bulgarian comes here and is naturalised here he becomes an Irish citizen and not what he was originally. Such persons renounce their allegiance to another country and become Irish. The Government would say to such a person, you are no longer Irish.  We would say that man is not worth having here; we would dislike him and send him back to Bulgaria.  That is a thing, as the President knows, that happens at the moment in relation to <Col N="1454" /> Palestine, and that is causing considerable trouble.  A Jew goes to Palestine from Poland, and it was the rule, at least up to a while ago, that he automatically has all the rights of a citizen of Palestine&mdash;the British Government has insisted upon that&mdash;but if, after a time, he gets &ldquo;fed up&rdquo; with Palestine and goes back to Poland, the British Government were insisting that on going back he becomes a citizen of Poland.  That seems to me to be very inequitable.  I do not think that the children should go to jail because their father goes to jail, as has been suggested by a Deputy was my opinion. I do think, however, that if a person is living here permanently he has an ordinary right to be made a citizen. That is my view.</P>
      <P>With regard to this whole proposal about revocation, however, and the suggestion that the wife would not be affected by it and that the children would not be affected by it, the President said that, in the normal way, a man would be deported and sent back to the place from which he came.  I do not think the President can stand over that, because it must be remembered that the man has renounced his allegiance to that country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the President followed me in my point.  I am interested in the matter of how children are to be dealt with under this section.  In the ordinary course of events in this country, we know that a child is not sent&mdash;I think &ldquo;committed&rdquo; is the word&mdash;to an industrial school except by due process of law.  There must have been abandonment, or some offence or crime must have been committed, before the child can be committed, and there is a definite judicial act.  Some person, or some body of persons, sits, independent of all personal or political notions or anything else, who says, in effect: &ldquo;Yes, the best thing for that child, or for those children, is that they should be sent to such-and-such a place.&rdquo;  I do feel that this section gives a general wide scope and power to the Department of Justice to deal as they like with these persons or children <Col N="1455" /> and with no conditions laid down as to why or when these persons or these children should be denaturalised or denationalised&mdash;because they might be national citizens&mdash;and I think that it is a matter that should be very seriously considered.</P>
      <P>We, and, I suppose, every other country, have had ruffians come into the country who have afterwards developed into good citizens.  Their families have been good and have built up these countries&mdash;whether we talk of Tasmania or other countries.  I think that this particular section is too wide in its scope.  I am anxious about the actual working of the section.  I agree with the principle that there should be power to deal with a man who has proved himself unfit to be a citizen; a man who got, as the President said, privileges here which were not privileges of right and who abuses these privileges.  I do agree that there should be power in some way or another to enable that man to be put out of the country, lock, stock and barrel.  But I believe that in doing so the machinery set up to deal with him should be such as to leave no doubt as to the manner in which it should be done; in other words, that it should be in accordance with legal principles, and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">

      <P>In speaking of the machinery, I was speaking of the machinery in general.  The Deputy distinguishes between the general machinery set up to deal with this Act properly and the special machinery that would be necessary to deal with the interests of the children and the welfare of the children.  Again, I think that, naturally, the Minister there also, in order to administer the Act properly, would give a direction that some particular attention should be paid to this.  He might&mdash;I would not like to say that he would&mdash;have somebody along with him who was particularly qualified to deal with that problem.  If I myself were the Minister administering this Act, in all probability I would have, besides the person ordinarily administering the question of <Col N="1456" /> naturalisation and the issuing and revoking of citizenship and so on, somebody particularly qualified to deal with it.  From my own experience, I would not have the slightest hesitation in handing it over to certain civil servants to deal with it.  If that is what the Deputy means, I think that it would follow quite naturally from the Minister's responsibilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied with the case that has been made by the President.  I consider that it is a most serious thing.  The President has indicated that this matter might be transferred to officials of the Department&mdash;to civil servants.  I cannot think of anybody more unfit to deal with children that the junior officials, or the officials generally, of the Department. If it comes to that, I would prefer to have the Minister himself deal with it because he is a man who has been out in the world.  He is a man of the world and has been accustomed to deal with such problems.  I feel that in this case the utmost care should be used and that the machinery to be set up should be such as would exercise infinite care in the disposal of these children.  I think that the machinery should make sure, when a revocation order was made and these children were to be deported, that wherever they would be sent provision should be made with regard to their reception and their future.  How is an official in a Government Department to be expected to do that?  It is all very well for Deputies to shake their heads about it.  Their attitude evidently is that it is just a question of making an order about the children, putting them on a boat, and letting them take care of themselves.  I think that that is a very unwise, unstatesmanlike, and a very unChristian outlook. I think that it would need the utmost consideration, and my view is that all cases of that kind should be sent to the Chief Justice.  He is a man dealing with the minors of the country.  He has hundreds of children under him.  He has all these children coming before him constantly while he examines all the circumstances with regard to their disposal.  To say that <Col N="1457" /> an official of the Department, or two or three officials, would know anything about children or their care, and that they should be allowed to make an order as to the destiny of these children is, I think, a very serious thing. I am not concerned with the father at all.  If the father has committed a crime tantamount to treason, let us say, he has no right to citizenship, natural or otherwise.  But the State should take the utmost care of these children.  They have committed no crime or no offence, and it is a very old maxim that the sins of the fathers should not descend on their children.</P>

      <P>I have heard expression given to many weird ideas as to what a civil servant is, but this is the weirdest I have ever heard, I think. According to the Deputy, civil servants know nothing about children if they do not happen to be fathers themselves and have families.  I wonder what sort of people is our civil service staffed with.  There is also this question of &ldquo;grab.&rdquo;  There is no question here of grabbing citizens.  It is a question concerning somebody who might still continue to be a citizen of another country. There are 14 or 15 countries, I think, which do not deprive their citizens of nationality simply by reason of the acquisition of the nationality of another country.  Such a person may come into the country, and the Minister for Justice, simply on an application, may say: &ldquo;Well, there is no reason why we should deny this person the privilege of being one of us,&rdquo; believing that that person was going to behave properly. There is no question of grabbing.  It means that we are giving that person a privilege, and if after a time it is found that he abuses that privilege, is it not fair to say to that person: &ldquo;Very well, we will cut you off from that privilege and deal with you in the same way as you were before you got into this country, and we will send you out of the country&rdquo;?</P>

    <P>In regard to the children, there is the ordinary Christain obligation to see that innocence will not suffer: that children will not suffer, so far as we can help it.  There is also an obligation <Col N="1458" /> to look after the interests of our own people, and if they naturally belong to another country there is no hardship in sending them back to that country.  At any rate, there is no reason why we should not.  I agree that this is intended to be a liberal section to be administered in the interests of the children.  The Minister will set up proper machinery for doing that.</P>

      <P>Where a woman satisfies the Minister&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  that she is a widow, and</P>
      <P>(b)  that her husband, immediately before his death, was not a citizen of Saorstát Eireann, and</P>

      <P>(e)  that she is ordinarily resident in Saorstát Eireann,</P>
      <P>such woman shall be entitled to make and lodge with the Minister in the prescribed form and manner a declaration that she intends to continue to be ordinarily resident in Saorstát Eireann and desires to resume her citizenship of Saorstát Eireann, and upon so making and lodging such declaration such woman shall be deemed to have resumed her citizenship of Saorstát Eireann.</P>

    <P>Deputies will see, on reading the amendment, that this is a provision to <Col N="1460" /> enable a widow to resume her citizenship on returning here.  If it is evident that she is a widow and if the Minister is satisfied that she is a widow whose husband immediately before his death was not a citizen of Saorstát Eireann, that she was immediately before her marriage a citizen of Saorstát Eireann, that she relinquished under this Act her citizenship of Saorstát Eireann on account of her marriage to a person who was not a citizen, and that she is ordinarily resident here: if she comes back to be ordinarily resident and makes a declaration that she intends so to continue, then she is allowed to resume her citizenship upon making and lodging the declaration that she intends to continue to be ordinarily resident here and desires to resume her citizenship.

There is the serious position of girls who marry persons and acquire citizenship in other countries and then come back here, having being divorced.

      <Col N="1461" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 13 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, I disagree fundamentally with the principle which is very clearly involved in it.  I said earlier that the general view of Christendom has been that there is substantial and real unity in Christian marriage, and that there is some reality in nationality or citizenship.  If there is any meaning in citizenship at all, then it seems to me perfectly clear that there must be the one nationality or citizenship enjoyed by man and wife.  This situation became acute in our experience arising, as I said earlier, from a rather frenzied psychology in America when America entered the war, and it was, I think, fashionable to denounce the Huns in unmeasured terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Was it only in America that was fashionable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think America implemented that feeling, particularly in the decision that American girls who married Germans should remain American citizens.  The implication, therefore, was that nationality or something more real, the State, over-rode the family and had precedence of that nationality and was vastly of more importance than marriage: that loyalty, allegiance or affection for the State was infinitely superior and more binding than the affection that should bind married people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the implication clearly in it.  As I say, the origin of this acuteness came from that war condition. The implication there is that if an Irish woman, if you like, or an American woman, marries a man belonging to a country engaged in a war with America, that woman should engage in the manufacture of munitions&mdash;and I think to the Cumann na mBan this would appear an eminently reasonable thing&mdash;which will be used against the army in which her husband is fighting. That seems to me to be a most diabolical principle, a principle which is directed against the whole idea of Christian marriage, a principle that would not be tolerated in countries <Col N="1462" /> other than those in which the ideal of Christian marriage was very decidedly attenuated, to say the least of it.  If the most ardently patriotic Irishwoman marries an Englishman, a Lithuanian or a German, her allegiance to her husband absolutely wipes out and transcends completely the allegiance she owes to Ireland.  That seems to flow necessarily from the conception of marriage as Christianity has conceived marriage.</P>
    <P>Here we have a situation in which it would seem the normal thing that wives and husbands should have different citizenship and that, in case of war, with all that hideous racial hate which is created, the wife should pray for the complete downfall and destruction of the enemy army in which her husband is engaged and the husband would do his best to see that the munition works in which she, perhaps, was employed would be adequately blown up by bombs from an aeroplane.  That may be all right in countries where they do not believe in even giving lip service to Christian ideas, but it seems to me a most ridiculous thing to provide here.  Mind you, it is not the first time it has arisen.  I remember, I think it was in 1926, the British were very much concerned, as they have been concerned recently, at the thought of British women marrying foreigners who did not, according to the laws of the countries to which their husbands belonged, acquire citizenship automatically by marriage.  Certainly there was a time when the British were very anxious that there should be unanimous legislation on the point amongst the various members of the Commonwealth. If I remember rightly, we refused or we would not accept the principle that there should be this sort of national divorce between the husband and the wife.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Was it this State put forward this principle to which the British objected?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This State objected to that principle.  I remember an occasion perfectly well when the British Minister came to Mr. Kevin O'Higgins and myself&mdash;and I think the officials <Col N="1463" /> will remember it too&mdash;and said that they hoped that the legislation of the various Dominions would be identical.  We indicated that we could not legislate in such a way as would recognise what I might call national divorce between husband and wife.  I remember the occasion personally.  Whether it was official or unofficial I cannot say.  This thing can work in the most fantastic way.  The President has records of one case, the case of a woman born in Ireland and who went to America.  She married a man in America who had also been born in Ireland.  He did not become an American citizen although he lived there for 30 or 40 years.  In the course of time, he died and as her husband had not become a citizen, she came back and lived here I think in Leitrim.  After some time another American citizen came over here, met her and married her.  He then went back to America to prepare the house in which they were to live.  When all was ready he wrote telling her to come along.  She, not being an American citizen, although her husband was, applied for an American visa, but under the American quota system of the time, aliens were not permitted to emigrate to America unless they were literate.  This woman was illiterate and, by American law, had not the right to go back to America.  The conception of marriage under this Bill and in these circumstances is that the husband living in Oklahoma or in Arizona writes a letter to his wife in Leitrim which is read to her by some neighbour who can read.  The wife then dictates what she wants to say to a neighbour, who writes the letter to her husband in America.  I just give that case as showing how ridiculously extravagant this Bill can be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the House to legislate for this country.  The argument is that this non-receipt of nationality by a woman by the act of marriage, which has been discussed amongst various countries, largely derived from America.  It does not matter where it derived from.  It may have begun in Bulgaria, but I say it is a contradiction of something that the Irish people affirm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the British Minister's talk about?  The Deputy referred to some conversation with a British Minister.  That is nearer than Bulgaria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What I was pointing out to the President was this, that this question as to whether or not the wife should automatically have the nationality of the husband or the husband of the wife was considered by this country previously.  I then referred to an occasion when we took up a certain attitude, guided by no other consideration than the absolute necessity that the wife and the husband should automatically, by the fact of being wife and husband, possess one nationality.  The President now comes along with a Bill which says that marriage between people of different nationalities, one being Irish and the <Col N="1465" /> other not, does not automatically make them of the same nationality. Personally I do not care how it goes. You can say that if an Irish person marries a person of another nationality, that person becomes Irish or that the Irish person automatically ceases to have Irish nationality and, in our eyes, should possess the nationality of the husband or wife as the case may be.  I do not mind, provided we refuse to act otherwise than to assume that the husband and wife are bound together so closely that there cannot be a divorce of nationality or allegiance between them and that when a situation arises such as we saw in the case of the Great War, when practically the whole nation is mobilised&mdash;men, women and children&mdash;for fighting purposes or for activities ancillary thereto, we shall claim the allegiance and the services of the woman, say, to assist this State.  We shall say that it is morally binding on her to act so as to forward the cause of this State in its war against the other State. The implication is that the Government should do its utmost to prevent her engaging in activities so as to destroy her husband or in activities by which the army in which her husband is engaged would be blown to pieces. This modern distorted view in which it is assumed that an Irishwoman is an Irishwoman without any regard for her husband is to me a completely wrong point of view and I object to our legislating to pander to that point of view. The unity of husband and wife is a much greater unity, implying a much greater loyalty than the unity of a person and the State of which that person is a citizen.  I think the Government should never, even by any implication, accept the idea, which I admit is received in many countries, that the wife retains her original nationality when she has married a man of different nationality until she takes a specific act to discard her original nationality.  This seems to me to imply, <i>virtualiter</i>, a sort of denial of the union which we recognise in a Christian marriage and I object to it in this and other clauses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the same way, in regard to children, <Col N="1466" /> the argument was made that if the father goes to prison you do not send the children to prison.  I think it would be a greater penal act, considered generally, to propose that there be a hostility between the children and the father than merely that the father should go to prison.  In the case of revoked nationality, the children are what they are by virtue of their parents, either through their parents having acquired nationality here or through their parents having come to reside here.  The normal thing when nationality would be revoked would be for the parent to return to the country he came from.  That being so, the children should have the nationality of their father and not any particular nationality of their own. Children are not free agents.  Their actions and movements are decided for them by their parents or guardians and it is the will which decides with regard to the children which should be considered.  Consequently, I feel our legislation should at least assume and act always to provide that the children should have the same nationality as their parents and, although my colleagues think it is a terrible thing that a child should be deprived of Irish nationality, particularly because the father is a man of bad character and has forfeited it, I think it is much better for the child to have the nationality of the father, even if it be Bulgarian, rather than have it an Irish citizen and be divorced from its father in nationality.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy starts off by enunciating certain principles and assuming that they are correctly <Col N="1467" /> applied.  He is assuming that he is correctly applying principles and that we here are incorrectly applying them. I say, on the contrary, that what we are doing is we are making every possible provision by which the parties to a marriage can be of the one nationality. We are not legislating for the world.  We cannot, by saying that a woman possesses the same nationality as her husband, compel the United States, for instance, if that view was not adopted there, to regard the wife as of the same nationality as the husband.  As a matter of fact, there is considerable conflict of laws on this question of nationality and that conflict has fallen very heavily upon women.  It is not in America that they have suffered; they have suffered practically in every country; and it is not in war time merely that they suffer; they suffer in peace time, too.  We are making provision for both men and women, but it is in the case of the women that this particular hardship occurs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to see what we are doing here, just imagine an Irishwoman living here and some person from a country on the Continent comes here and marries her.  He does not acquire Irish nationality.  Are we to forbid him to marry her?  Are we going to say, &ldquo;You must not marry unless you belong to the same legal community.&rdquo; Surely all the traditional affection which a person has for the country of his birth, his origin, the country of his parents, is quite consistent with the unity of marriage?  One of the mistakes the Deputy seems to make is to consider that this question of nationality, being of the same nationality and the same legal community, is essential to the idea of the unity of the marriage tie.  I am willing to admit it is one of the various factors which might be considered in regard to the unity of the family.  I admit it would be preferable, as I would in general principles say it would be preferable, for people to marry others of their own legal community.  But it is new to me, if it has become a Catholic principle, that in order to secure the unity of the family you <Col N="1468" /> should marry only within your own legal community.  So far as I know it has never been stated in that particular way, nor was there any suggestion that it should be so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>There was an implication that there was something wrong in persons of two different nationalities marrying.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>There was the implication that if they continue their connections or ties with their respective countries, that if that occurs we are somehow sundering the unity of the family.  In principle I do not agree with the Deputy, and in the particular application here the Deputy is wrong. We are making provision, in so far as we can, to make it easy for the husband and wife to be of the same nationality. Take the case of an Irishwoman marrying a German, a Frenchman or a Belgian. If the husband did not become Irish this Irishwoman would become immediately, according to the Deputy, a Belgian or either of the other nationalities.  According to the Deputy she would have to become an alien in the land of her birth, an alien with all her relations about her.  She would be, for instance, put in a position in which she could be immediately deported. She might, for instance, as an alien, be prevented from getting employment. She might, for instance, as an alien, be prevented from continuing the occupation or trade in which she was engaged before marriage.  If war broke out she might have her goods confiscated&mdash;all that in order to preserve this phantom idea of the Deputy to prevent some sundering of the marriage tie.  If the marriage tie was not affected by the fact that the Belgian was a Belgian or the German a German at the time of marriage, I do not see how it was going to be affected afterwards.  The only way in which it could be detrimentally affected would be if there was some automatic law operating that operated irrevocably and irresistibly in all situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1469" /> What we are doing here is we are giving the amount of elasticity that is necessary in order to prevent hardship of that particular kind.  We say to the Irishwoman, &ldquo;You do not by your marriage, by that act of itself relinquish your Irish nationality.  You are still an Irishwoman amongst your people in your own land.  You remain so and your children, if they are born here, are natural born citizens of this country,&rdquo; but we say: &ldquo;We are willing to adopt your husband, who has come in here, into our community.  We are going to give him, because of the fact that he is married to one of our citizens, the privilege of belonging to our community on special terms.&rdquo;  On a two years' or a very short period of residence he will have all the rights and privileges of our citizenship.  We are making it possible for him and for her to come here and be united in the way the Deputy thinks is desirable and ideal.  Is there any severance of the marriage tie in that?  Is that not a better position than to make, in the case of a couple residing here, our Irish girl an alien amongst her own people?  We cannot make it a condition precedent to marriage that the Belgian should have given up his Belgian nationality and we are not going to deport them.  We may regard her husband as a very good citizen, as an addition to our community, and we do everything, therefore, to make it possible for these people, who married because they wished to be together, to remain here without any sunderance of the ties.</P>
    <P>Again, I ask the Deputy where, in our proposals, is this sundering of the marriage tie?  Where is this separation of husband and wife?  Is it not making it possible for husband and wife to become a unit in the legal as they would be in the social community here?  Take the opposite case.  Suppose an Irish girl goes abroad.  In some cases, she might be Stateless, if we said to her that she relinquishes her nationality.  The country of her husband might not be willing to accept her.  They might not be as generous&mdash; and some States are not as generous&mdash; as we are in that matter.  If her <Col N="1470" /> husband died, she would still perhaps be in a strange land, as they might not have been for any length of time in that country.  What we say is: We will deem you to have desired to adopt the nationality of your husband unless by some positive act, within a specified time, you clearly indicate that you wish to retain your Irish nationality.  Remember that we are not interposing by law any barriers, but there may be, in the circumstances of the case, a question of returning again; there may be reasons why this might be regarded as a short period of residence or something of that sort.  There may be an intention of returning and the person in that case, if he or she wishes to retain his or her nationality, can make a declaration to that effect within a specified time and we will not deprive him or her of his or her Irish nationality.  In any case, we do not propose to deprive her of her Irish nationality and leave her Stateless.</P>
    <P>In this Bill, the provisions are that if a woman, when she leaves this country, does not acquire the nationality of her husband, she continues to have our nationality and she only loses it when she gets the nationality of her husband.  Again, where is the hardship?  Which is the more Christian and proper thing to do?  We are proposing these sections in the Bill not, as the Deputy would suggest, in response to some general vague sentiment of equality or anything of that kind.  What we are doing here is making what I would call Christian provisions, so as to prevent hardship on women, and the more the Deputy will examine these sections, if he is minded the way he suggests, the more he will be compelled to agree that that is so; but in accordance with some vague ill-defined principle, he would have us, first of all, act as if we could legislate for other nations and, in accordance with his principle, he would have us not to do our part to end these hardships.  I say &ldquo;our part&rdquo; because a number of nations met at the Hague to consider this conflict of laws.  They did not meet, as was suggested last night, in order that they might get some common basis of nationality, to get some such idea <Col N="1471" /> accepted everywhere as the idea the Deputy has put forward, or the contrary idea.  They came to deal with a very pressing problem&mdash;the conflict of nationality laws and particularly that conflict as it affected the interests of women.  They came to certain agreements and this Bill is in accordance with the general spirit and provisions of these agreements by which we intend to prevent that Statelessness and also to make it easy for one party to be adopted into the community to which the other party already belongs.</P>

      <P>The Deputy said he was very fallible in these things and I want again to remind him that he could have looked these matters up. He was Minister for External Affairs for a period and he spoke as one who was fully aware of these problems and principles that were in question.  He said that at a certain time, on behalf of this community, he resisted certain proposals because they cut across what he called, as I understood him, a certain Catholic and Christian principle. The records show that the Deputy is completely wrong.  There was an advisory committee set up by the League of Nations.  Representatives of eight world-wide organisations of women were represented on that committee.  Four of these organisations were so widespread that they claimed to speak for 45,000,000 women. These pressed, because of the hardships on their sex, for a change in some of the laws and for an attempt to get some equality for women in this matter, and equality not merely on the ground that they were human and had to obey the laws of the various States and that the obligation of the law is <Col N="1472" /> on the individual.  The Deputy would not hesitate, as he indicated a short-time ago, to go into the family and take the father, if the father was a person who had acted against the law. The obligation of the law bears upon the individual and bears upon the woman equally with the man and it is not any mere sentiment of equality, that is in question but the hard fact of the affect of the law on individuals. They pressed to have their grievances redressed and there was a certain measure&mdash;not as much as satisfied the women&mdash;of agreement that they had a good case.  A convention was signed by a number of States, of which we were one.  The convention was not to come into effect until it was ratified and accepted.  It was signed by the representatives of the different States, but was not to come into effect until it was ratified.</P>

We are carrying it out in spirit here.  There was a great Catholic organisation of women which approached the League on this particular matter, representing, as the Attorney-General informs me, 25,000,000 Catholic women.  They pressed for a law, such as this law here, in order that the hardships which bore upon their sex would be mitigated.  They met this question of unity of the family, and its bearing on Christian principles.  There were petitions independent of that, signed by thousands of representative Catholics, laymen and clergymen, throughout the world; signed by Benedictines, Jesuits, Franciscans, and a number of the regular Orders; signed by thousands of clergy; signed by very many bishops and archbishops, urging that the hardships which have been indicated should be mitigated.  Here is the burden of the petition: &ldquo;That a woman, whether married or unmarried, <Col N="1473" /> should have the same right as a man to retain or change her nationality.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It does not matter whether it was organised or not.  We do not get petitions without organisation. The point is whether representative people have put their names to that petition or not.  We find there, for example, the name of a great Irish Archbishop, the Coadjutor Archbishop of Sydney.  We find there the names of the Bishop of Nice, the Bishop of Oklahoma City, the Archbishop of Tokio, and the Archbishop of St. Andrews and the City of Edinburgh. Those are names of people who were not going to be associated, we may well presume, with a petition which was contrary to any Christian or Catholic principle.  As I say, any attempts to attack the measures of this Bill on that basis are bound to fail because the facts are against them. Any attacks on the principles of this Bill, on the grounds that it tends to sever the unity of the family, are <Col N="1474" /> bound to fail because the principles of the measure have quite the contrary effect.  Nobody who examines the measure, and who does not want to get off cheaply on some glib suggestion that we are acting in an anti-Christian or an anti-social manner, would attempt to criticise the Bill on that basis.  I, for one, am proud of the section in the Bill.  I am delighted that we have got an opportunity of starting afresh, untied by traditions in the opposite direction.  I am delighted that we have an opportunity of dealing fairly with women in this matter.  I am not working on any question of mere abstract equality.  For example, I have refused&mdash;because of the confusion which I thought would arise from it&mdash;to accept the principle of nationality descending through both the father and mother, but we have in the Bill attempted to see that no hardship would result to women because of it.  We have made provisions by which women can return here.  We have made provision by which in the case of minors, children of widows and others who would be affected by it, there would be resumption or acquisition of our citizenship.  There are a number of good principles in the Bill, of which I am proud.  I am very glad to be the medium of putting into practice what a large number of people have wished to see in practice in all the nations of the world.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">

      <P>The President has a very peculiar way of arguing.  He quotes a certain document there, which, of course, I quite accept.  Those women's organisations have been presented with a situation in which women, because they did not automatically acquire the nationality of their husbands, were placed in a position of great hardship.  My objection is that the principle should be that the wife automatically assumes or acquires the nationality of her husband.  The President says we make it easier for a woman or man who is married to an Irish national to become an Irish citizen, than for a person who is not, and that therefore, we are to be congratulated. I disagree.  The President says that if a foreigner marries an <Col N="1475" /> Irishwoman he can, in only two years, become an Irish national.  I say that we should assume that the two automatically become of the one nationality on marriage.  I know perfectly well that if, for instance, an Irish girl marries an American she does not acquire American nationality.  The President, to begin with, wiped away my argument that the thing should be automatic unless otherwise provided for.  He thinks it is a splendid thing that when people of different nationalities get married they retain their own nationality, but it is made comparatively easy for one to acquire the nationality of the other.  That is not enough.  I think the basis should be that they would automatically acquire it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Here is a corporate Act of this State making a law with regard to its own citizens.  That law says that as far as marriage is concerned it does not actually make the two of the one nationality, though with great generosity and Christian spirit we are so good that we will allow the man to acquire Irish nationality within two years if he is living here.  That would be two years during which the national laws would be such that the wife might be making munitions to shoot her husband, and the husband might be trying to drop bombs upon the munition works.  The President says that that is splendid.  He says it is the very thing that the Archbishops, Benedictines, Jesuits and everybody else are looking for.  All this came about quite naturally; they were dealing with a contingency; I was dealing with a principle.  We know it is a fact that because women did not automatically acquire the nationality of their husbands great hardship has been experienced, and women have suffered a great deal.  I have been arguing that in our laws we should apply the general principle that the woman on marriage becomes automatically of the same nationality as her husband.  The President says we <Col N="1476" /> cannot.  I quite agree.  He goes on to assume that a State can only give privileges and services to its own citizens.  That condition existed, and the British assumed by their law, and if I may say so&mdash;without looking upon it as the President would say, pontifically, or speaking ex-cathedra&mdash;a much better Christian principle was enshrined in that than in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Long before I was born, or before the Attorney-General was born, that was the position.  The President talks about what hardships a woman could suffer if she has legally and in the eyes of the law, shed her Irish nationality by marrying a foreigner.  There is no reason why she should suffer hardship.  This State can say, so far as we are concerned, that we consider it right that in our eyes an Irishwoman has the same nationality as her husband while recognising that certain other States refuse to do that, holding that she automatically forfeited her rights of nationality.  That is the case of a woman who has not in some way acquired the nationality of her husband.  There is nothing to prevent the Government here giving that woman every service it gives to its nationals, as an act of courtesy. But the Government say they think she should have acquired American nationality.  As she had not done so, until such time as she does, all the services she would have got as a right as an Irish national, she could get until she acquires another nationality. It is perfectly simple.  The President went on and talked about some foreigner coming here and marrying an Irish girl, that she remains Irish and he remains Belgian, or whatever he may be.  The President suggested that I suggested that that would break up marriage.  It would not.  It does not <Col N="1477" /> make disharmony in the fissure between the two.  He asked: Are we going to make her an alien amongst her friends?  She is not to be an alien amongst her friends but she is to be an alien to her husband.  That was the President's argument.  Personally, she is the same person.  The truth is that the naturalisation of nationality does not amount to as much as the President would like to make it.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it amounts, not to as much as some people think, but I object to any difference, no matter how small or exaggerated ideas people have.  The President said it was ridiculous for me to say that it was going to interfere with marriage. He offered a positive argument and asked, are we going to make her an alien amongst her own people?  To my mind the President makes the point for me.  He said it was a terrible thing that an Irishwoman should be an alien to other people living in the same street.  Consequently, it is right that she should be an alien to her husband. That is the sort of wrong principle I object to.  He said that this man married this girl and that according to me she should acquire his nationality. Would that be fair?  He says that she would not be deported and would not lose her nationality, but that the husband could be deported.  If anyone is going to be deported and told to go to hell out of here, and to get back to Belgium, then, to quote an imaginary conversation, to my mind the wife should be on the ship too.  The President thinks she should retain her Irish nationality and stay here.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The President says: &ldquo;How terrible it would be if she had to go.&rdquo;  Other countries are doing what the President wants to do here; creating a law by which a wife does not automatically possess the nationality of her husband.  I think that is a rotten system.  He said that she may be <Col N="1478" /> Stateless and talked of the awkwardness of her position, in consequence. There is nothing in a natural-born citizen claiming certain services as a right.  If you go to France you have the right to claim the protection of the Minister because you are a citizen.  We do not recognise that a woman who married, to use the President's words, is an alien to her husband.  That does not deprive the Government here of the power of giving her every service she could possibly have had if she had retained her Irish nationality.  If she acquired other nationality there would be a difference.  For instance, a girl who married an American, and becomes an American, this Government would not give her the same service, because the American Government would claim certain rights over her as a citizen, and would say that it was their business to give that service. As long as she is Stateless this Government can do everything for her.  There is nothing to prevent this Government giving every service and protection to a person born here who is Stateless.  I see nothing in the President's argument. It seems to me to be laid down in our law, except in so far as it may be altered, that the wife has automatically the nationality of her husband.  The President says that can be done and that special provisions can be made.  To my mind the law should be that wife and husband are of the one nationality.  I do not think the difference of nationality is nearly as important as the President thinks it. He thinks it would be a terrible thing for an Irish girl, married to a foreigner, to be an alien amongst her own people. If it is a terrible thing to be an alien amongst her own people, it is a much more terrible thing to be an alien to her husband.  The President is talking in the realm of contingency.  Accepting the principle that we recognise only one nationality of husband and wife, why advert to the special circumstances in the world to-day?  Certainly we should do that.  We might say that as an American husband does not automatically give his wife, an Irish girl, American nationality, we are going to make it easier to acquire it.  That could be done while, at the same time, <Col N="1479" /> the basic law here will be that the wife automatically acquires the nationality of the husband.</P>

      <P>Will the Deputy allow me to say what I wish to say?  I am sure the House understands quite well what the Deputy has in mind. During the course of his speech he referred to the British position &mdash; the automatic loss of citizenship and the automatic gaining of citizenship on marriage as an example of the high ideals to be followed in this type of legislation.  I pointed out by way of interruption that that was only since 1844.  Before that under the common law rule, the alien wife of a British subject <Col N="1480" /> did not become a British subject. England was much more a Christian country before 1844 than she has been since; so that the fact that that particular principle did formerly appeal to them does not help Deputy Fitzgerald. Coming down to last year &mdash; 1933 &mdash; they have amended the Acts of 1844 and 1914 and have provided that</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where a woman has (whether before or after the commencement of this Act) married an alien, and was at the time of her marriage a British subject, she shall not, by reason only of her marriage, be deemed to have ceased to be a British subject unless, by reason of her marriage, she acquired the nationality of her husband.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The President has dealt so effectively with the Deputy's argument on the general principles that I consider it hardly necessary to refer to that part of the Deputy's speech.  However, I would like to refer to this point.  In the course of the history of the petitions directed to the League of Nations, which the President referred to, there was some trouble about the wording of the Catholic petition, and it was pointed out by way of explanation of these people &ldquo;that the memorandum had given rise to misinterpretation since in certain quarters it has been understood that affirming that unity of the family necessarily involves identity of nationality.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the fallacy at the basis of the Deputy's speech.  He seems to identify these two things and treats the identity of nationality as essential to the unity of the family, whereas at the end of his own speech he pointed out that a great many people attach an exaggerated importance to this idea of nationality. With that I whole-heartedly agree.  If the Deputy was here last night he would have heard Deputy McGilligan say from his experience that during war time the laws about nationality do not matter.  He said it does not matter <Col N="1481" /> what provision you have as regards the acquisition of nationality by the wives of aliens and that during the time of war they are treated just as badly, rounded into internment camps, deported, etc., and without any regard to what are the precise provisions of the law.</P>
    <P>There is only one other thing, which is rather personal to the Deputy, to which I should like to refer, and that is, that a great man for whom he cherishes admiration both as a Catholic thinker and a writer&mdash;M. Jacques Maritain &mdash; was one of the signatories to the petition the President referred to. That ought to satisfy the Deputy's Catholic principles.</P>

      <P>These amendments look rather formidable but in fact they are not.  What they are aiming at is a very simple matter.  They are really to prevent one of the things we have been trying to avoid all the time, that the automatic operation of the law would not create hardships.  We are trying to secure that the automatic operation of the Bill as it stood before we introduced these amendments would not cause an Irishwoman to lose her Irish nationality before she acquired the nationality of the State to which her husband belonged.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  We are dealing with the two.  I am dwelling on the case of the woman because that is the case in which there is particular hardship. This deals equally with either spouse.  The whole spirit is that of equality of treatment of either spouse, though in the main what we are most interested in is to prevent the hardships from which women suffer by the automatic operation of laws of which Deputy Fitzgerald seems to be in favour.  As it stood in its original form, after a certain period was reached the Irish nationality of a woman would have lapsed.  We are here providing that that cessor should not take place until the person affected should actually have acquired the nationality of the other spouse.  If you have that idea, you will find you will understand the meaning of all these amendments.  In regard to the first, the most important one would be No. 21 which defines the period after which Irish nationality would lapse. In the case of the other, the important one in a similar position would be No. 24.  If the Deputies have noted the construction of the Bill as it stood and read with it these amendments, I think it will not be difficult to follow.</P>

      <P>They explain themselves. I have only to say that I warmly support the amendments. Without the amendments I would certainly have strongly opposed Section 14.  The amendments change the situation altogether and make that a reasonable section.  The President spoke of the hardship that might otherwise have be fallen a woman.  As a matter of fact, under the original section there would have been much more danger of hardship befalling a man, because a woman who married a foreigner would not be taken by surprise on losing Irish nationality, whereas the man would very much. He would probably not have taken any steps to acquire any other nationality.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 15 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised a question with regard to the time limit.  The question applies to both Sections 15 and 16.  In Section 15 (b) there is a time limit of 12 months after the passing of this Bill, and in Section 16 (c) there is a time limit of 6 months after marriage.  I suggested the other day, and, I think, my suggestion appeared to meet with some friendliness over there, that there was really no need to insert a time limit at all and that it should be left open to the alien married to a citizen of the Saorstát to acquire citizenship at any time, without having to do it within a certain period after the passing of this Bill, or after marriage. I do not know why there should be a time limit.  I do not know whether the Government have any reason for inserting this time limit in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Personally, I think it is desirable.  I know what the Deputy is thinking of &mdash; he is thinking of the penalisation of the person who did not apply in time.  Is not that so?</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are looking for here is to try and induce the incoming spouse to adopt Irish nationality as soon as possible.  There is this view about the short time limit &mdash; that if you leave it without limit, and if it is indefinitely open there might be a failure on the part of the incoming spouse to acquire nationality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should the Government wish to force the inclinations of the incoming spouse?  I do not see that there is any need for the State to be peremptory in this matter at all. There may be substantial reasons for the alien spouse not seeking a change of citizenship.  There may be some reason connected with property why an American citizen say, may wish to remain an American citizen.  These reasons may vanish at a later stage.  I think the mere fact of being married to an Irish spouse should make it easy <Col N="1486" /> for the alien to become an Irish citizen, no matter how long after the passing of this Bill or after marriage. The State should make it easy for the alien.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy MacDermot's argument.  If we take the cases of those Irish people who went to America and deliberately decided not to become citizens because they had intended at some time or other to return home, how does it look?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>This time limit does not serve any purpose.  An alien may have a very definite reason for not becoming a citizen.  On the other hand, there might be cases where it would be an advantage to this State that an alien was compelled to become a citizen, but, after all, it should be a question for the person concerned.  We leave a lot to those people themselves. We are leaving a man or woman free to become a citizen or not.  Then, why are we using compulsion in this matter?  What is the object of it?  Is it not contrary to the principle running through the rest of the Bill?  I would like to know what is behind 15 (b) and 16 (c)?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>What is behind these sub-section is this: there is an idea that we are offering a privilege in virtue of an alien marrying one of our <Col N="1487" /> citizens.  We are offering the privilege of citizenship to a stranger coming amongst us.  We think that that offer and that privilege should be readily accepted.  If it is not availed of, we say: &ldquo;Very well, this offer is not to be open indefinitely.&rdquo;  We want the alien to decide what he is going to do. We say to him that: &ldquo;We want you to consider the circumstances and we do not compel you to decide one way or the other.  If you decide on a certain way, we give you an offer of our citizenship up to a certain date.&rdquo; Deputy MacDermot asks why should we take up that attitude.  I think it is advisable for us to know what is going to be the position in regard to that particular person. Dallying with citizenship after such an offer is made is a thing that we should not countenance.  In fact, the general spirit behind the Bill is to enable the people to decide, on marriage or within 12 months after the passing of this Bill, whether they would become citizens. The shortest possible time of probation was to apply.  The probation period after marriage was to extend to the shortest possible time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps we could meet the point raised by Deputy MacDermot by giving discretion to the Minister for Justice. Deputies do not like giving discretion to the Minister.  I do not want to commit myself in matters of this kind, but I think if there were special circumstances it might be got over in that way.  It is all very well to talk in general principles, but when you examine the consequences of some of these principles in detail, you may find that they do not work out nearly so well as one would imagine at first. In this matter, I want to consult the Department of Justice, who are closely connected with this measure, as to how the point raised by the Opposition may be effected.  I do not like leaving the matter indefinitely open.  I am inclined to think that it should be possible to get over the difficulty by allowing the Minister for Justice in special circumstances to keep the offer open.  I am thinking of cases where say, a person made representation after marriage and that that representation set out <Col N="1488" /> that becoming a citizen at that time would involve certain losses or that certain consequences would flow that would be particularly damaging to the person.  There might be cases where a heavy penalty, never contemplated by the Legislature, would follow.  It is not the intention that a person should pay dearly for this privilege.  But if the person said: &ldquo;If I get an extended period of time, then these consequences might not necessarily flow,&rdquo; I could imagine in such a case it might be well if the Minister had discretionary power. Suppose he had power to permit the intimation by the person that he or she wished to become an Irish citizen.  If that were indicated and accompanied, say, with the request that it should not become effective as early as we have it now in the Bill, discretionary power might be left to the Minister to consider it.  I do not want to commit myself to that.</P>
    <P>The difficulties in connection with this Bill are that Opposition Deputies wait to present their objections until we come here.  The more normal way would be to put their objections in the form of amendments.  There ought to be no complaint from the Opposition that time was not given.  When we were in Opposition we were not treated in the same way as I have been attempting to treat the Opposition on the question of this Bill.  At a moment's notice, we are asked questions which no Minister could take it on himself to answer right off.  He could not have all that information as to the results that might follow from general principles <i>a priori.</i> While not committing myself, I say there is a case made for having some dispensing power residing somewhere, but I would not like in general terms to extend the period of the Bill because there would be then an unnecessary inducement to delay applications for citizenship.  The only way I see at all, at the moment, of trying to meet the points raised by the Opposition is to give dispensing power to the Minister for Justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>

      <P>I can see no necessity for the time limit and, therefore, the suggestion of dispensing power being given to the Minister for Justice does not appeal to me.

The phrase does not mean anything.</P>

      <P>I think that it is entirely a matter for the husband and wife and for nobody else.  I think that the State should make it easy for husband or wife at any time to change from being an alien to being a citizen. It should not make change difficult by imposing a time limit like this.  I see no case for a time limit.  I agree that the President has a right to complain that I did not deal with this matter by putting down an amendment, as, perhaps, I should have done.  However, it is too late to alter that.  The President has time between now and Report Stage to give further attention to the matter.  I appeal to him not to close his mind to the idea that a time limit is unnecessary and, on the whole, undesirable.  May I hope that he will think that point over with an open mind.</P>

      <P>I do not think that it is necessary to dwell on this section. The provisions, in our conception, represent the most appropriate way of implementing our independent and equal rights.  We think that it is the only way, in fact, in which we can have association of that sort without surrendering precious rights which we are not prepared to surrender.

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>To add at the end of the section two new sub-sections as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  The common law relating to British nationality, if and so far as it is or ever was, either wholly or in part, in force in Saorstát Eireann, shall cease to have effect.</P>
      <P>(3)  The facts or events by reason of which a person is at any time a natural-born citizen of Saorstát Eireann shall not of themselves operate to confer on such person any other citizenship or nationality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a question as to whether this amendment is necessary at all.  My own opinion is that the sub-sections are not necessary.  However, certain criticism was levelled at the Bill on the ground that it did not do certain things. We believe it did.  However, where there is any shadow or suggestion of difference of opinion which might be presented to a judge in court, it is a very good thing for us in the legislature to resolve the doubt and make the matter particularly plain.  Deputies who have been following this debate will appreciate the full import of our amendment to Section 28.  The first part makes clear that we are putting an end to the operation of the common law here which might be regarded by some people as having been brought over here by Article 73 or some such <Col N="1491" /> provision and running side by side with the statute.  It is possible that, in the second part of the amendment, the phrase &ldquo;shall not of themselves operate&rdquo; may require a little comment. What we mean is that we might have in this country children born of American parents who, by the law of their country, would be Americans.  We do not want to seem to cut across any recognised general principle of that sort.  The idea is that these facts shall not in themselves operate to confer on any such person either citizenship or nationality.  We intend to make clear that henceforth, by Irish law, no person born in this country will be anything but an Irish citizen.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to detain the House with a speech on this section, or on the amendment, but I <Col N="1492" /> may say at once that the Opposition are opposed both to Section 28, as it originally stood, and to Section 28 with the amendments proposed to be added. Until the day comes, if it ever does come, when a republic is declared in this country, we see no advantage and no point in passing a section of a law which purports to deprive the citizens of this country of the common status possessed by citizens of every part of the British Commonwealth.  Of course, we are all acquainted with the fact that, under British law, what we do here on that subject has no effect. That makes it all the more hypocritical and undesirable.  We cannot see that any useful purpose whatever is achieved by Section 28 or by the amendments proposed to be added to Section 28.  We shall, therefore, oppose it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I move Amendment No. 28:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 29 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every person who is a citizen of Saorstát Eireann by virtue of Article 3 of the Constitution and every person who is or becomes a citizen of Saorstát Eireann by or under this Act shall be such citizen for all purposes, municipal and international.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This, like the other amendment, is probably unnecessary, but as certain doubts were cast upon the universality of this Bill or the extra territoriality of the law we propose here, I thought it well to make it quite clear. Of course, the fact is that it is clear that our laws apply outside the immediate territory of this State and that our laws can have extra territorial effect.  But to make it quite clear, because of any suggestions that might go abroad to the contrary, we state definitely here that everybody</P>
      <P>&ldquo;who is a citizen of Saorstát Eireann by virtue of Article 3 of the Constitution, and every person who is or becomes a citizen of Saorstát Eireann by or under this Act, shall be such citizen for all purposes, municipal and international.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is no doubt whatever that our law would be respected abroad.  At The Hague Convention, here is one of the general principles which were accepted:&mdash;</P>

      <P>There was a point raised by Deputy McGilligan &mdash; I do not know if the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is familiar with it &mdash; that the change in the title of the Bill as here proposed might necessitate a new Money Resolution. The Ceann Comhairle said that he would consider the submission that Deputy McGilligan made to him.  The suggestion was that it would enlarge, possibly, the expenses under the Bill and that as the Money Resolution already passed had reference to a particular title it might be necessary to have a new Money Resolution corresponding to the proposed new title.  I do not know whether that matter has been considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy is quite correct in saying that it was at this particular stage we would have to deal with that.  It is <Col N="1496" /> quite obvious that the Money Resolution had to deal with the expenses arising immediately and directly out of this Bill.  It is not a question of whether this Bill would involve policies which might lead to further expense.  I do not think the Chair suggested that at this stage we were going to consider that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>He indicated that the amendment was in order.  I quite agree as to that, but he seemed to be somewhat impressed by the submission that Deputy McGilligan made but not the submission that Deputy Esmonde made to him, and that even though it was in order the effect might be to necessitate a new Money Resolution.  I frankly admit that I am not sufficiently skilled in procedure to argue the point, but the point was mentioned and the Ceann Comhairle said that he would take it into consideration.  I am merely asking whether the results of that consideration are yet to hand.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The President agrees that he introduced radical amendments on the Committee Stage, amendments of such a nature that the normal amendments that might be proposed to the Bill were not proposed by the Opposition Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with that suggestion&mdash;good, bad or indifferent. There is no foundation whatever for it.  There were no radical amendments.  The amendments introduced were of a type that might have been introduced on the Report Stage. They were the normal type of amendment introduced into a Bill of this, I will not say, complexity, because the principles underlying it are not complex, but the necessary length of the drafting may hide some of those principles. Take, as an example, the last two amendments.  These were only to insist on the view which had been held on our side, a view which is supported by the best opinion I could get. But lest there should be any doubt about it, the amendments were introduced though they are not valuable amendments at all.  Then we have four or six amendments dealing with nationality, with the position of a married woman and her spouse where one was a citizen of ours and one a citizen of another country.  All these amendments were simply to deal with one very simple thing and that was the automatic operation of the law, which is one of the things we have been trying to avoid all the time, would not create hardships.  All these were the normal type of amendment.  There was nothing in the way of a drastic amendment introduced in the Bill at all.  As regards the time, if I recollect, we circulated the Bill on the 5th November. We had a Second Reading debate on the 12th November, and that was adjourned and carried over to the 28th.  Now, we are in the middle of December.  I do not think that anybody can suggest from the opposite <Col N="1498" /> benches that there is any real truth behind the suggestion that we are rushing this Bill.  I was anxious, I admit, to have the Bill completed before Christmas.</P>

      <P>Despite what the President may say, we happen to have the right and the ability to think for ourselves.  To say that the Bill has not been radically altered is simply ridiculous. Yesterday, amongst other things, the President stated that he was going to consider certain proposals put forward by Deputy McGilligan. We have the case under this Bill of a person of Irish extraction and Irish blood marrying a person belonging to another country, A son is born in that other country, a second son is born in Great Britain and a third son is born here.  The son born here has Irish citizenship and the other two cannot get it until they are 21.</P>
