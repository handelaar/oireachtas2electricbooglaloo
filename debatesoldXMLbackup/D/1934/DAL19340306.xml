Deputies do not know what are the terms of this Emergency Imposition of Duties Order.  Presumably it is going to be some time before we are in possession of the facts as to the duty that is at present being levied. I am merely wishing to draw the attention of the Government to the matter and I do not want to raise a discussion on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 2, before Section 2, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) In this Act the word &ldquo;importation&rdquo; and cognate words shall be construed as not including or applying to importation for the purposes only of transit and consequent exportation.</P>
      <P>(2) For the purposes of this Act, importation shall be deemed to take place when the importing conveyance is reported under the Customs Acts.</P>
      <P>(3) For the purposes of this Act, goods shall not be deemed to have been manufactured in a particular country unless the prescribed proportion of their value is derived from expenditure of a prescribed kind incurred in the said country in respect of materials produced or work done in that country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="5" /> (4) Each of the following persons shall for the purposes of this Act be a national of Saorstát Eireann, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) a person born in Saorstát Eireann or in the area now comprised in Saorstát Eireann;</P>
    <P>(b) a person born outside Saorstát Eireann or the area now comprised in Saorstát Eireann whose mother at the time of his birth was ordinarily resident in Saorstát Eireann or such area;</P>
    <P>(c) a person who at the relevant time is and for not less than five consecutive years immediately preceding that time has been ordinarily resident in Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    <P>This is a section to provide for a number of matters of interpretation. Sub-section (1) provides that the word &ldquo;importation&rdquo; and similar words shall not be construed as applying to importation for the purposes only of transit and consequent exportation; in other words, goods which come in transit are not deemed to be imported. It is necessary to have such a sub-section inserted, because otherwise it might be held that a ship calling at a Saorstát port with goods not intended for a Saorstát destination on board would, nevertheless, be importing those goods and they would be subject to the quota restriction.  Sub-section (2) provides that importation shall be deemed to take place when the importing conveyance is reported under the Customs Acts.  That is the necessary legal form.  Sub-section (3) provides a definition of the term &ldquo;manufactured in,&rdquo; to which reference was made on the Committee Stage.  I explained then that the use of the term &ldquo;manufactured in&rdquo; required some further provision in the Bill so as to make it quite clear what value added to the goods by a process undertaken in any country would entitle those goods to the description of being manufactured in that country. The proposal here is that that percentage of added value shall be preseribed in relation to the particular classes of goods subject to a quota order.  Sub-section (4) is merely a re-enactment <Col N="6" /> of the sub-section dealing with the definition of national of Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that sub-section (2) means when they are entered&mdash;that that is the moment at which they are supposed to be imported.  For the purposes of revenue that might be a very fair arrangement, but under this Bill, where certain whole cargoes might be shut out by hours, it seems a monstrous thing that a ship might be in the river with a consignment of goods coming in and, because the entry had not been passed, the entry of those goods might be prohibited. I should like to ask the Minister if he cannot see his way to make some provision for the case of goods that are actually on the high seas when a quota order comes into force.  It is a very serious point for importers and manufacturers of every description.  I should like to point out to the Minister that what would probably happen is, that if a quota order is likely to be made, or if the importer feels it is likely to be made, the goods will not be imported if there is not some means of allowing goods which have actually arrived in the port, but which have not been entered, to come in.  I should like to ask the Minister how far he has considered that phase of the situation.  I take it that this is the technical meaning of an import.  Certainly it seems extraordinary that a cargo should be moored alongside the quay and be deemed technically not to have arrived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This particular sub-section is not intended to deal with the particular matter of goods in transit to which Deputy Dockrell referred on the Committee Stage.  This sub-section merely defines in legal terms what constitutes an importation.  The picture becomes clear if one visualises a Customs post at the Border which is not exactly on the Border but some distance inland.  A person importing goods brings them into the Saorstát before he reaches the Customs post, and under the terms of this Bill might commit an illegality under certain circumstances.  The purpose of the <Col N="7" /> sub-section is to make it clear that the importation has not taken place until he has reached the Customs post and reported the goods to the Customs officer.</P>
      <P>The particular matter that Deputy Dockrell is interested in, however, is the possibility of goods being in transit to the Saorstát when a quota order is made.  I have indicated that we have a six weeks' period between the making of the order and the commencement of the quota period, during which licences for the importation of the goods can be issued, and issued fairly freely.  That period is provided to enable that difficulty of goods in transit to be overcome, as well as certain other difficulties.  Whereas in the case of certain goods it may not be adequate to the purposes, in the case of the majority of goods it will be adequate.  Where inadequate, the difficulties that may arise will have to be settled in consultation between officers of the Department of Industry and Commerce and the importers concerned, with a view to an adjustment of the first quota, and the duration of the first quota period, in a manner which will prevent difficulties being experienced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand that there is power to consider individual cases on their merits outside either the preliminary period or the quota period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is complete discretion in respect of the preliminary period, and each individual case can be considered on its merits and a special arrangement made to deal with it.  During the quotas period the allocation of quotas must be in accordance with the Act.  It is contemplated that in respect of certain goods if a quota order is made the first quota period will have to be short in duration and a liberal quota will have to be made so that there will be no hold up of goods in transit.  It is afterwards, probably in the second quota period, that any restriction in quantity will come into operation.  I do not want it to be taken that that will apply in every case, but it will be the <Col N="8" /> ordinary procedure, where difficulties arise which affect certain classes of goods which were ordinarily a long time in transit to this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>When dealing with the matter on the Committee Stage the Minister mentioned that there were certain goods which would not come within this import duty.  Flour was mentioned.  Where in the Bill are these exempted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 (5) provides:&mdash;</P>
      <P>A quota order shall not be made in respect of any description of goods the importation of which into Saorstát Eireann is for the time being prohibited by law.</P>
      <P>The reason I mentioned flour was, because its importation under licence is at present prohibited by another Act, so that it does not come under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the definition of the word &ldquo;manufactured,&rdquo; I presume that is intended to enable the Revenue Commissioners to operate the provisions contained in amendment 8, but in amendment 8 the alternative word &ldquo;produced&rdquo; is used, the phrase reading &ldquo;manufactured or produced.&rdquo;  Does the Minister not consider that a possible difficulty arises there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="9" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The term &ldquo;manufactured&rdquo; covers all classes of goods, except those properly described as raw material, which are the product of nature unaided by man.  If the goods have been subject to any industrial process whatever they are &ldquo;manufactured&rdquo; and come within this definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Produced&rdquo; then means a natural growth.  Yet &ldquo;produced&rdquo; is used here as an alternative to &ldquo;manufactured.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I noticed that when explaining the amendment the Minister referred to the power he is taking to prescribe the proportion of &ldquo;added value.&rdquo;  The amendment in my opinion applies to more than &ldquo;added value.&rdquo;  Would it not also apply to primary value?  Take a very common happening, the case of a machine partly constructed in the United States, which is sent to Canada to be finished.  Would not this amendment enable the Minister to prescribe the amount of work that would have to be done in the United States in order that it might qualify as an import from the United States; as well as enabling him to say how much value would have to be added in Canada, in order that it might qualify as an importation from Canada?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The phrase used is one with which customs officers and importers are familiar, and it appears in all Finance Acts.  The value is added to the raw material by the process of manufacture.  The procedure is to prescribe what that percentage must be in order to be entitled to be described as having been manufactured in a particular country.  Under the Finance Acts I think there is 25 per cent. added value which entitles goods consigned from Great Britain to get the preferential rate.  Cotton is grown in America and is brought to Great Britain, where it is spun and woven. If the added value is of the prescribed percentage it becomes entitled to enter this country at a preferential rate. The same thing applies in this Bill.  I do not anticipate any difficulty in interpretation; <Col N="10" /> because the phrase is standardised in all our Finance Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Minister did not get my point.  If this is only to be applicable in the case of added value, the amendment would be misleading. I want to know if it would apply in the case I mentioned, to the engine of a machine.  Take a motor car where the engine or the chassis is manufactured in the United States and is then sent to Canada for finishing. Will the amendment enable the Minister to say that such part can be regarded as an import from the United States provided there is a certain percentage of the total work done there; or, alternatively, can it be regarded as an import from Canada because certain work has been done there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that I used the term &ldquo;added value.&rdquo; but I want to point out that the phrase was my own, and not that of the draftsman. The definition in the amendment is fairly clear.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="11" /> The necessity of this was explained on the Committee Stage.  Section 3 (3) is designed to protect the rights of the Dáil against the Executive.  The effect of it is that where the Executive Council has made an order, and has either failed to get it approved by the Dáil, or has revoked it before coming to the Dáil, it cannot make another order of the same kind.  The section is all right as it stands, but one particular difficulty might arise. An order may have been made by the Executive and approved by the Dáil, but revoked subsequently for some <i>bona fide</i> reason.  It may desire to renew that order, and consequently it is proposed to insert the words &ldquo;before such quota order has been approved of by Dáil Eireann.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The six months is the period within which a resolution approving of the order must be brought before the Dáil.  If the Dáil fails to approve of it, then the order ceases to have effect at the end of that period.  The publication of the order will take place as soon as may be after it is made.

      <P>The Minister says that the publication of the order will take place as soon as may be after it is made.  I would like to have something more stringent than that.  At the present time we are dealing with a number of restrictions.  I submit that Deputies ought to be made aware officially of the terms of all those orders.  The official text of them ought to be before them immediately.  It is on that that I want to get an assurance from the Minister: that the presenting <Col N="12" /> of a quota order to Deputies will not be delayed for a long period.

      <P>The actual publication of the terms of an order for the information of interested parties and the submission to the Dáil of a resolution approving of an order are two different matters.

      <P>Does the Minister not think that those orders made by the Executive Council should come before Deputies practically as soon as they are made?  I think there was some machinery in existence some time ago by which those orders were brought before Deputies, but now we are left in ignorance of them, and what I am concerned about is that this practice will not be still further extended under the quota Bill.</P>

      <P>The terms of all orders, whether made under this Bill or under the Emergency (Imposition of Duties) Act are laid on the Table as soon as they are available.  The Deputy referred to an order made on Saturday last.  That order has not yet been laid on the Table of the House.  I think it would be most unusual if it were available in its printed form for laying on the Table within two days of its being made, but it will be laid on the Table as soon as it is available.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite a number of matters arise after the making of an order.  The full effect of an order cannot be seen until it has come into <Col N="13" /> operation.  There must be, in any event, a six months' period before the expiration of which a resolution must be submitted to the Dáil, seeking approval of an order.  If such a resolution is not submitted, then the order cases to have effect.  When a resolution for the approval of an order is submitted to the Dáil a discussion, of course, can take place on it.  That will afford Deputies an opportunity of ascertaining what precisely is intended, both in respect to the quota to be fixed as well as the period for which the quota will run.  That is one reason for fixing a fairly substantial period between the date of the making of an order and the submission of a resolution for approval of it.  In view of the fact that the Dáil frequently adjourns for a period of two or three months, the Deputy's suggestion that orders, as soon as they are made, should be submitted immediately to the Dáil in the form of a resolution, is not practicable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>My suggestion is that the order should be submitted in the form of a resolution, at the first opportunity, by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Ordinarily that will be the practice, but the Act provides a maximum period within which the order must be submitted and approved of by resolution of the Dáil.  Otherwise it will cease to have effect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be better if the Minister were to put himself in the confidence of the House and introduce immediately a resolution covering the order without waiting to see the effects of the order in practice?  I am sure the Minister is not going to make an order without having good reasons for doing so.  Once an order is made, then his boats are burned and it starts having its effects.  The reasons that prompted the Minister to make the order could, I submit, be fruitfully placed before the House with a view to getting its opinion on the order.  The House would take a greater interest in the subject matter of an order then than in, say, five and a half months after an order is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present there is the feeling that <Col N="14" /> the Executive Council is acting more or less independently of the Dáil.  In saying that I am not arguing against the emergency powers that the Minister has.  Personally, I feel that he should have them while we have a protectionist policy.  It could not be made effective if the Minister were not vested with such powers: powers to enable him to act quickly in a situation without having to wait for the authority of the Dáil.  While I agree that the Minister should have such powers, I think that in his own interests and in the interests of the country generally, he should seek the first available opportunity to put his reasons for making an order before the Dáil and without waiting to see the effects of the order in practice.  I am sure the Minister will not make an order without being able to stand over the reasons that prompted him to do so.  I would strongly urge on him to bring these orders before the Dáil as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there should be no undue delay in seeking the approval of the Dáil for any order that is made.  What is in the Bill. however, is this: that that approval must be got, at the outside, within six months after an order is made, even if a special meeting of the Dáil has to be held for that purpose.  Within that period the resolution can be submitted at any time.  I agree that there should be no delay, which can be avoided, in seeking approval for an order.</P>

      <P>I take it that you do not make an order without substantial reasons for doing so and that, therefore, you are prepared to stand over the making of that order for these particular reasons and to give the reasons to the Dáil.  That gives the Dáil a greater feeling that they are sharing in the making of the order rather than a feeling of being ignored and that the emergency powers are being abused.</P>

      <P>I should like, Sir, to press that point about the minimum period on the Minister.  Of course, the Minister mentions particular cases when the order cannot be brought up, but there may be urgent reasons for bringing the order up.  The dislocation arising out of the order may be serious to business.  I think it would be more satisfactory if something were inserted in the Bill to the effect that it is to be brought up as soon as possible and, in any case, not later than six months. I think that would meet the difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there should be no undue delay in doing it, but I think it would be most undesirable that the resolution should be brought here at once in the case of every order.  There will be circumstances where it would be obviously in the interests of the Dáil that they should know not merely the order but the quotas proposed to be fixed, and that will be announced at the end of the six weeks' period after consultation with all the parties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>Goods the importation of which is for the time being unlawful by virtue of this section shall be deemed to be included among the goods enumerated and described in the Table of Prohibitions and Restrictions Inwards contained in Section 42 of the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, and the provisions of that Act (as amended or extended by subsequent Acts) relating to the importation of prohibited or restricted goods shall apply accordingly.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 3, Section 5 (3), to delete all words from the word &ldquo;manufactured&rdquo; in line 47 to the end of the sub-section, and substitute the words &mdash;&ldquo;which are shown to the satisfaction <Col N="17" /> of the Revenue Commissioners either (as shall be specified in such order)&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  to have been manufactured or produced in a specified country, or</P>
    <P>(b)  to have been consigned to the importer from a specified country, or</P>
    <P>(c)  to have been manufactured or produced in a specified country and consigned to the importer from that country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember that, on the Committee Stage, I mentioned the necessity for this.  The section, as it stands, merely relates to goods manufactured or produced in the specified country.  That is inadequate in itself. If a general quota was made in respect of a particular class of goods and a special quota was also made in respect of a particular country, say, France, it might be desirable to be able to exclude goods manufactured in France, but, for the time being warehoused in another country.  It means that the Executive Council may direct that a specified proportion of the quota shall consist of goods manufactured or produced in a specified country, or goods which are shown to have been consigned to the importer from a specified country, or to have been manufactured or produced in a specified country and consigned to the importer from that country.  It is really an elaboration of the section and makes very little change in it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="19" /> This is another amendment which I mentioned on the Committee Stage. If we make a special quota in respect of some classes of goods, we do not want them coming in here after travelling all around the world.  We may want them to come here by the shortest and cheapest route.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand the explanation the Minister has given. He says that he does not want goods to go all around the world.  Presumably, if somebody has paid for them to go all around the world, it would be found that there was some method in their madness.  I should like to be sure that the Minister would look upon this in a rational way.  It must be remembered that you can put so many restrictions on the carrying out of the necessary condition that the goods may fail to arrive.  It is all very fine to specify that they should go by a particular route, and, on the face of it, it may look as if they ought to go by that route; but there may be very excellent reasons why they should not go by that route.  I should like the Minister to amplify his statement a little further and let the House know what is the idea of a special route, because this is going to amount to a special quota.  There will be as much trouble in getting goods, that have been quotaed by the wrong route, altered, as there will be in getting them altered for some other reason.  What is the Minister's idea in being able to specify one particular route and that route only?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a very desirable power to have, because it will enable us to see that the goods will be imported directly into the country.  Deputies, I am sure, are aware that there are many classes of goods produced on the Continent and elsewhere which, at the present time, can only be brought in through England, so far as we are concerned, and sometimes warehousing charges, agents' commissions, and similar charges which are unnecessary have to be paid in Great Britain.  Efforts have been made from time to time to get agencies here for these classes of <Col N="20" /> goods so as to remove from the consumers of such goods in this country the tax which is at present levied on them for the benefit of agents and commission men and warehouse men in Great Britain.  That is one reason. Another reason is to ensure that the most economic route will be chosen for the goods, so that the exporter, if a special quota exists under which he is operating, cannot use that position for the purpose of benefiting a particular transport or shipping company to the detriment of consumers here who must get the goods under that quota or do without them.  They might be forced, if somebody acted as I have suggested, to pay more for the goods in order to benefit some transport organisation in which the exporter was interested.  Again, we might require the goods to be imported directly into a Saorstát port instead of overland.  The power given under this subsection is necessary to protect the interests of consumers of imported goods here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Minister is over-estimating his powers of control under the Bill.  The Minister proposes to specify certain routes by which merchandise is to be taken into this country.  If the amount were small and if it had to be shipped direct here, the charge might operate against our interests.  The Minister says that, if he were not to specify routes, certain transport companies might be favoured, as against the interests of consumers here.  I am afraid we have no control over these outside transport companies.  No <Col N="21" /> matter what provision the Minister inserts here, I do not think that he will be able to exercise any control over these transport companies.  I do not think that the Minister is looking forward to big importations of these goods. If the quantity is small, it might be against our interests to have direct importation.  This provision may have re-actions that the Minister does not foresee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The section does not make it compulsory to define a route. The section merely gives power to do that when that course appears to be desirable.  If we were importing some commodity which is used extensively throughout the country, one would not like to see it all coming into one port and being distributed internally.  It would be desirable that the existing practice of importing to the port nearest to the point of consumption should be continued.  It is desirable that power should be given to ensure that that would happen.</P>

To proceed, I question the propriety of furnishing the Minister for Industry and Commerce with power to insert any condition in any licence.  I do so for this reason: under a previous Act passed by the Oireachtas, the Minister was given power to issue licences for the importation of flour free of duty&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In Volume 47, column 1, of the Official Report, there is a record of a question addressed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in connection with these licences.  Deputy Doyle asked whether any conditions attached to the granting of licences permitting the importation, free of duty, of 2,300 units of 280 lbs. of wheat flour into County Donegal during the month of February, 1933&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out in this amendment the Minister takes power to mark the route by which goods may be carried?  These goods are of a competitive character; they have been subjected to competitive estimates. The route by which they are carried will make all the difference.  One route may not cost half the money of another route.  As has been pointed out, if there is not a sufficient cargo or if there is not a sufficient of the commodity to make up a cargo, the goods cannot be carried at an economic figure.  You have either got to pay an uneconomic price for them or you have got to await the time when a sufficient cargo will be available.  That will make all the difference in the job I have in mind in which a large amount of these commodities are required.  I think we should have some undertaking from the Minister that he will consider that aspect, to ensure that all goods coming from a certain port shall come by one route so that other competitors of the importer will not have the advantage of bringing them by a cheaper route.  At the present moment it is not possible for economic reasons to get a cargo of such goods into the Free State as there would not be sufficient demand for them.  The Minister may say at a particular time: &ldquo;There are vessels now sailing and I want you to get that commodity in now.&rdquo;  It may cost double the price to get the commodity by that particular route.  It may be double the economic rate.  That I hold is interfering in business because it may be conferring an advantage on one man and places his competitors in business at a disadvantage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Very frequently, at the present time, they do not come in by the most economic route.  One always assumes that in business where there is the free play of competition, uneconomic elements are eliminated, but in these days of cartels and combines that is not always the case. In respect to a number of goods coming into the country it is not always true to say that they come in by the most economic route.  Consequently there has to be an increased charge for these goods. That situation may be easily aggravated when there is a quantitative limitation in respect of goods imported. In such cases there should be power to ensure, in respect of certain classes of goods at any rate, that they will be landed in the country in a manner which will permit of their being sold to consumers at the lowest price and not imported into one part of the country for general distribution throughout the country.  In every case full consideration will have to be given as to whether a condition should be attached, but such a condition will not be imposed where it would be uneconomic to specify a particular route.  We have no interest nationally in taking any other course.  If there were any national interest to be served by adopting some other course, it might be mentioned, and a decision to adopt a route that was, say, the second best route, might be justified on these grounds, but our only desire here is to use these powers so as to get the goods as cheaply as possible, and by the most economic route.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I might suggest that what is happening here is that the Minister's Department is deciding what is a purely business matter, namely, the question of what route is the most economic.  I suggest that is not the best method of deciding it, that a branch of the Civil Service should not be called upon to decide <Col N="30" /> which is the most economic route.  I should like further to suggest that that may not be the only consideration that may be introduced in deciding the route, that the Minister may choose certain routes in order to bar out certain other routes.  The Minister may want certain goods to be imported direct for economy reasons, he may say, but the direct route may not always be the cheapest route.  Already it has been put to the Minister that this Bill will put a strain on the importer down the country who has to get a certain amount of goods in a certain country where he has not been accustomed to get them up to the present.  If the quantity is small, he must depend on an agent here in Dublin.  He cannot import them direct.  There is an extra charge for that, and he is dependent on the business ability of the agent here in Dublin.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister will remember that he gave me that answer previously, that the business will be carried on by an agent of the country which is enjoying the quota.  That may work detrimentally to the liberty of the trade and to the detriment of the person down the country who will have to bear an extra charge.  The Minister may determine on a certain route. He may have, for some reason or another, a dispute with another country and he may determine to utilise this particular Act for the purpose of preventing goods coming in through that particular country.  I would suggest that a Civil Service Department, that is not engaged in the ordinary run of competition, is not the best body to decide what is the best or the cheapest route.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit to the Deputy that there are certain other considerations to which he has not adverted. So far as the individual importer is concerned he will endeavour to get goods in by the cheapest route&mdash;the cheapest in that connection being the cheapest to him of all those available but that is not always the cheapest possible, if other arrangements can be made.  Even in that regard, as I have mentioned, there are certain classes of goods which are costing us more to <Col N="31" /> buy at the present time than they should because the exporters of these goods choose that they shall reach us through a particular channel or have a particular method of marketing them.  We have no control over that at the present time, but we may have when this Bill is enacted.  There are quite a number of countries at the present time, to which it would be possible for us to export certain produce profitably if freight charges could be fixed upon the basis on which they would be fixed if return cargoes were offering.  These return cargoes are not offering despite the fact that from these countries we are importing fairly large quantities of goods. By the operation of the powers given in this Bill, it may be possible to provide for these return cargoes, that is, to ensure not merely the possibility of an export trade but also the possibility of cheaper routes for goods that we import, in preference to the haphazard arrangements in which goods reach us now from these countries either as a result of transhipment, warehousing or something of that kind.  There are quite a number of directions in which it is possible to use these powers not merely for the purpose of facilitating exporters but also for the purpose of facilitating the import of certain goods which we must import in any case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that his object in this amendment is that in connection with certain goods imported into this country he is satisfied that if he had the powers he asks for in this amendment he would be able to get in those goods more cheaply. I am not entirely against the spirit of this amendment, but I do not think the arguments which the Minister is advancing are convincing. Every man to his trade.  Surely the importer, whose job it is to import, and who is not importing for natural love and affection but to make money, is getting this stuff in by the cheapest possible route.  If not, he would soon be out of business, and another fellow would be getting it in by the cheapest <Col N="32" /> possible route.  I doubt if the second argument advanced by the Minister will give us those imported goods more cheaply.  In effect it amounts to this, that from certain countries we are getting goods&mdash;perhaps piecemeal, or bits and scraps by various routes. The Minister visualises that those countries could do with goods which we have to export, and that we could fill a cargo and export it to those countries; that all the little bits and scraps which we are getting from this particular country, if consolidated, would give a return cargo; that it would be to the mutual help of our export and import trade if the Minister had power to issue a licence that by a certain line of steamers those goods&mdash;we will call it timber; we will not call it flour&mdash;could be imported, and then to that country which is exporting timber to us we could export some surplus that we have. That is apparently the Minister's argument, but I am afraid that to attempt artificially to build up an import and export trade in that way will hardly work.</P>
      <P>The point raised by Deputy Good is important.  The Minister, I am sure, would give an assurance that if it is a matter of competing for an import trade no facilities will be given to one importer that will not be given to another, and that if a direct route or a route round the world is to be chosen&mdash;whichever it is &mdash;all importers will have to use that route.  If we have an assurance on that, I do not see a terrible lot of harm in giving the Minister the power, but the Minister should not have any powers of discriminating between routes.  If he selects the route that stuff has to be imported by, then there should be no other route.  There should not be fish for one and flesh for another importer.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 6, Section 9 (1), line 3. before the word &ldquo;a&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;and subject to such conditions <Col N="33" /> as the Minister shall think proper to attach to such licence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is to provide for the imposition of conditions when a special privilege is conceded to an importer who failed to make good his licence to import during a quota period, through causes outside his control, to import those goods during a subsequent quota period.  The necessity for having power to impose conditions will be obvious if one contemplates a possible case where the goods licensed and not imported might have been considerable in quantity, and if imported in the same quantity without being subject to restriction in a subsequent quota period might cause considerable dislocation, apart from defeating entirely the intentions of the Government when making the quota order.  The licensee or importer gets under this section, in any event, what is an <i>ex-gratia</i> concession. Consequently, there can be no objection to power being taken to impose upon the granting of that concession such conditions as are deemed necessary for the protection of national interests.  Deputies are aware that the section applies only where a licence has been issued in respect of a quota period, and for some reason the licensee does not fill the licence&mdash;does not import during the period the goods licensed.  It is provided that, at the discretion of the Minister, that person may be permitted to import those goods in some subsequent period, if this amendment is passed, subject to what conditions are deemed necessary in order to protect industrial interests here.</P>

      <P>That cannot be so in respect of a quota period.  The conditions under which the licences are given are set out clearly in the Bill. There is no power to attach to those licences any conditions other than those specified in the Bill, namely, the condition as to the quantity of goods to be imported, and, in certain circumstances, the country from which they must be imported.  Subject to the provisions of the Bill everyone gets the same treatment.  The particular case covered under the section to which this amendment refers is intended to deal with individual difficulties.  A man might, through no fault of his own&mdash;a strike or some other reason&mdash;be unable to import within the quota period the goods for which he got a licence.  Subject to conditions he may be allowed to import those goods in a subsequent period in order to get him out of a difficulty not attributable to his own fault.</P>

Deputy Dockrell asked if there was a statutory guarantee that every importer, every manufacturer and every merchant to whom this quota Bill applies will be on all fours, one with the other, by virtue of the terms of the statute, to which the Minister says &ldquo;Yes, quite.&rdquo;  I submit to the Minister that there is nothing to prevent him, under this special power for inserting conditions in postponed quotas, from prescribing one set of conditions for AB, and an entirely different set for CD, although both of them have been prevented from bringing their share of the quota in the quota period originally allotted to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have gone over it, and I am not going to go over it again.  All I desire to say on this is that, in my opinion, this is bureaucracy gone mad. Quota systems, admittedly, may be necessary in consideration of the <Col N="37" /> insanity that is sweeping over the whole world, but that there should be discretion left in the hands of a Minister of State or a high civil servant, no matter how high he is, to differentiate between two trade competitors, trading within the same jurisdiction, is to my mind, bureaucracy gone absolutely mad.  Every man in this State now who, for the purpose of his trade, desires to import is absolutely in the hands of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and his officials, and he can be wiped out by the imposition on him of restrictions that are not imposed on his competitor. We are all familiar with the assurances we get here when Bills of this kind are passing through, or when amendments of this kind are being inserted, but it is just as well for the commercial community in this country to realise that this Bill, with its amendments, represents bureaucracy gone mad, and, sooner or later, this Oireachtas will have to face this&mdash;that the right to discriminate as between citizens should not be left in the hands of any Minister, no matter what party he belongs to, or of any civil servant, no matter how high his integrity may be.  Citizens of this State should have statutory rights that they can enforce through the courts against the Minister or against the Civil Service or anybody else.  This Bill and this amendment takes those statutory rights away, and makes it legal for the Minister to impose arbitrary conditions at his own sweet will, and the courts are of absolutely no avail to prevail against the particular whim the Minister or his permanent officials have in their minds when they come to prescribe conditions provided for in amendment 14.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This particular amendment relates to the section of the Bill which provides for the granting of a concession under exceptional circumstances in exceptional cases.  So far as the Bill is concerned, a procedure is laid down under which, when a quota order is made and a quota fixed, licences are issued to all persons who apply for them in accordance with the rules set out in the Bill.  It may happen that, through causes arising entirely outside the control of the licensee, the licensee may not be able to import during the quota period the goods for which he has got a licence and it is provided that in such circumstances, if the Minister thinks fit&mdash;in other words, if he is satisfied that the causes were outside the licensee's control and were of such a nature that special favours should be conceded&mdash; that person may be permitted to import those goods after the expiration of the quota period, subject to such conditions as may necessarily be imposed in the public interest.  That section is completely useless unless there is an absolute discretion to deal with each individual case that will arise and I think there are associated with the Party opposite, to my knowledge, <Col N="39" /> a very large number of people who have had good reason to be glad that the Ministry had power to deal with the difficulties of individual cases which are bound to arise under all circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the point of the Minister's reply but still, to my mind, it does not do away with the possibility of discrimination, because, even though an importer may be prohibited by some reason or other beyond his control from importing the goods in the specified time, the Minister may, under this section give him the right to import at a later period and to prescribe the particular method in which he shall import, but there is nothing to prevent the Minister from giving a particular importer terms more favourable than are given to another importer who filled his quota at the proper time. I want to be clear that the Minister has not got in this section the power to discriminate between two different importers of goods.  So far as I can see the power of discrimination is there and we want, perhaps, more than the Minister's definite assurance, although I should be quite prepared to take this particular Minister's assurance.  I am, however, rather loath to take assurances from any Minister, because on two or three occasions during the last session we had explicit promises from Ministers in debating Bills here that certain circumstances would be taken into consideration and that certain things would not happen but these certain things happened immediately after the particular Bill had passed. We cannot, therefore, rely altogether on what a Minister says across the floor of the House.  For my own part, I am not at all satisfied that discrimination of a very extreme nature cannot take place under this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>One does not attempt the impossible.  This is the discrimination <Col N="40" /> that arises&mdash;this is how Deputy Bennett differs from Deputy Dillon.  I am quite prepared to leave this whole section and the amendment out of the Bill if any of the people in the Party opposite who are experienced in the importation of goods or in business are prepared to say that they want to leave it out.  This matter is put in entirely to deal with the difficulties that arise for business men, such difficulties as strikes, shipwrecks and so on&mdash;things altogether outside their control&mdash;and which may prevent them from importing the goods which they need to import.  In certain circumstances, it is desirable that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should have discretionary powers in order to permit of the difficulties in which business men are placed being met by the issue to them of an extra licence for a subsequent quota period.  Power must be discretionary, for the Minister must be satisfied that the failure to import was due to causes outside the control of the importer.  In other words, that no attempt was made to defraud other importers or to get an advantage from the Minister by misrepresenting facts.  It is the only way the Minister has of licensing and it is only in cases where the failure to import is outside the importer's control that the Minister would exercise his power.  He would do so solely to save the importer from serious loss. The obvious way to meet the difficulty would be to give the licence for another quota period.  This could not be fulfilled unless the discretionary power of the Minister was exercised so as to enable that to be done.  It is true that the Minister may have power to give in one case what he would refuse in another case.  The Minister is responsible to the Dáil and he answers here for his public acts.  If any Deputy feels that he has exercised a discretion in favour of one importer as against another under similar circumstances&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If the Minister will give an undertaking it would satisfy me personally, and that is that where the importer gets the benefit of this amendment of his quota being extanded he will not, under that extension, get terms more favourable than the similar importer got&mdash; that he will not be more favourably treated than the man who filled his quota.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>He might get more favourable terms under the new agreement. On the last amendment there was a discussion as to the route; for instance, that it might be specified that he might import by a definite route.  He might, the Minister says, be compelled under a previous agreement to import not by the quickest and cheapest route.  If he did not fill his quota the Ministry may possibly give him new terms which would be more favourable than the terms given him or a similar importer under the original licence.</P>

      <P>We were discussing the amendment in connection with the medical officers.  I am sorry that the Government has chosen to reject this amendment, because I think that a great deal can be said for it from every point of view.  I quite regret that the Minister has not yet spoken in this debate, but the power behind the throne has clearly indicated the views of the Government on the matter.  I think Deputy Corry told us on the last day that he really could not accept this amendment.  I am sorry to hear that particular announcment of the Government policy because I think a strong case can be put up for the various other bodies of men who were affected by this Bill, and a particularly strong case can be put up for the dispensary medical officers.  If there was any truth in the contention of members of the Government and of Deputy Corry that the country was never so prosperous as at present and the people never so well off, if there was any pretence that the Government believe that, it is very hard to understand their attitude in this particular matter.  Why should they actually propose to hit these particular professional people?  We have heard very strong appeals from different sides of the House.  We have heard particularly strong and able appeals from Deputies Rowlette and Davitt, who gave out very strong reasons why this amendment should be accepted by the Government.  If I might say so, I think that, instead of adopting the Government's point of view that the country is so prosperous now that there is no justification for the Bill, they should look the actual facts in the face and admit that the community is hard hit and that the farmers particularly are hit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="44" /> I suggest, however, that one of the first classes that feels how hard the farmer is hit is the dispensary doctor. Everybody who knows anything about the country knows that it is not on account of the salary attached to the post of dispensary medical officer that that position is sought.  It is sought for two reasons.  One reason, but it is not the major reason, is the salary attached to the position.  There is another reason as well, namely, the desire of the doctor to establish himself in a particular district, and the official position that he has, and the salary that he has, inadequate as it may be, as a dispensary medical officer helps him to the attainment of that end.  If the Minister makes inquiries he will find out that the private practice, which with most of them forms the greater portion of their real income every year, is gravely hit by the economic crisis.  What the Minister is doing is practically this: The economic crisis having taken away a percentage of the major portion of the doctor's salary, the Minister now proceeds to take away a certain portion of the rest of the salary. Undoubtedly there are many doctors who now, practically speaking, have to attend cases for which before they would get paid and who have now little prospect of getting paid.  That is a consideration that particularly hits this class of practitioner.  If anybody has been hit severely by the economic war, hit directly and quickly, I say, after a certain amount of inquiry, that it is the dispensary doctor.  Therefore, I should be glad if the Minister could see his way for once to revise the opinion of his main force behind the throne and consider this amendment favourably.</P>
    <P>A great deal of the salary of the medical officer goes in expenses in connection with carrying out his duty and a great deal of these expenses goes in attending cases for which he is getting no return in the way of private fees.  The necessity of a motor car in modern times and the cost of it should be taken into account in this connection.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should not follow the example of others who <Col N="45" /> get up here and be full of sympathy for the doctor, full of appreciation of the services he gives, especially to the poor, and then, not satisfied with what he has suffered in his private practice, seek to inflict this further hardship upon him.  If the Minister is not willing to accept the amendment, I suggest that he can, at least, spare the House and the profession his lip sympathy and his appreciation of the excellent work they are doing. It speaks well, not merely for the medical profession, but for humanity in general, the way in which doctors as a whole, or at least the great bulk of them, treat the poor.  They may occasionally charge heavy fees to the rich, but the very best service of the profession, even where there is no obligation to give the very best service, is at the disposal of the poor, and especially the very poorest. Everybody knows that.  I suggest that it is no real appreciation of that humanitarianism on the part of doctors to come along now when, as I say, the country practitioners, are so severely hit, and, in addition to the blow they have already received gratuitously to inflict this particular blow on them.  I ask the Minister, therefore, for once to take his courage in his hands and now, as the Deputy has not yet turned up, accept this amendment before he is caught.</P>

      <P>I would not have intervened in this debate were it not for the fact that if I did not do so I might be taken as acquiescing in remarks of Deputy Corry a few weeks ago when this amendment was previously before the House.  On that occasion it would have been sufficient for Deputy Corry to confine himself to arguments in favour of the rejection of the amendment without going out of his way to slander the medical profession throughtout the country.  Deputy O'Higgins, I think, already very ably refuted those slanderous statements and, because I am associated with Deputy Corry in the same Party, I wish also to let the House know that Deputy Corry in his own viewpoint and his own only. <Col N="46" /> I venture to say that he would not have the support of a single member of the Party here in making those statements.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry said that the dispensary medical officer rushed off to hospital every case without paying it a second visit.  Deputy Corry is a member of the Cork County Council and is, no doubt, in possession of a book from which he issues red tickets for the attendance of medical doctors in that area.  If the dispensary doctors in that area have been as negligent as Deputy Corry alleges, then it was the duty of Deputy Corry to bring those matters before the notice of the Cork Board of Health. In speaking of the county medical officers of health, Deputy Corry referred to them as the specimens that he had seen going round, just as if they were specimens of chickens on Deputy Corry's own farm.  I am very glad to say that public representatives on these benches, holding very responsible positions in the public administration and life of the country, have assured me that there was never a more satisfactory official in the Country Cork than the county medical officer of health for that county.  They are all agreed in paying the highest possible tributes both to that official and his assistants in the County Cork, no matter what Deputy Corry may say here or anywhere else about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan asked the Minister to exclude a certain body from the scope of this Bill.  I am in these position that I know that these medical officers work very hard.  They are called upon at all times of the day and the night to do certain work for which nobody&mdash;not even Deputy Corry&mdash;can allege they are overpaid. I feel, however, that nobody is more sympathetic towards that section of the profession than the Minister.  He showed that when he raised the minimum salary from £210 to £260 yearly, and gave very valuable concessions to dispensary medical officers.  The concession may not be as big as the profession would like to see it, but it was, at any rate, a gesture of goodwill <Col N="47" /> on the Minister's part the profession appreciates.</P>
    <P>I should like to have seen Deputy Corry and other speakers taking a different line when discussing amendments of this kind.  I am sure the Minister when replying will give to dispensary medical officers, to county medical officers of health and to medical officers who are officials of local bodies, the protection that they look for from slanderous statements that are made by persons in a privileged position about people who are unable to reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt whatever that the Minister will be lavish with the inexpensive solatium that the learned Deputy asked for the medical officers of health and other dispensary doctors.  I am sure the Minister will be glad to give them all the praise, and all the expressions of gratitude, which he is apt to command. But, seeing the independent way in which the Deputy looks on this question, I thought that he would have gone on with his speech, and pointed out to the Minister something else which has not been pointed out so far.  Quite apart from the merits of the general policy of economy of reducing salaries, there is an element in that policy which requires special consideration, that is that the reduction should be equitably imposed. You should not ask one man to sacrifice 40 per cent. and let another man, equally well off, get away with five per cent.  What do dispensary doctors get their salaries for?  What work do they do for their salaries?  Is it not really attending to the destitute poor? It may be said that a dispensary doctor is paid for the red ticket cases he attends, that outside the red tickets he can charge a fee, and that that fee is part of the income, over and above the salary of a medical officer of health.  Admittedly, he has other minor duties as medical officers of health.  But the principle duty he discharges for the salary is attendance on red ticket cases.  There are two ways of reducing his salary, one is to take off £15 per annum, and another <Col N="48" /> way is to enlarge the district, or to increase his work.  The Minister knows, just as well as I do that the rural population have grown much poorer in the last 18 months.  The Deputy knows as well as I do that dispensary doctors are getting more red ticket cases now than they were getting two years ago.  There are fewer fees available from the average small farmer for the dispensary doctor than there were two years ago, and there are people now going to him on red tickets who never did so before. In so far as that is the case it operates as a reduction in the salary of the dispensary doctor, because he is doing more work for the same pay, and on top of that&mdash;which I submit should be regarded as his contribution to the cost of the Government's economic war&mdash;the Government is going to impose upon him the cuts provided for in this Bill.  Quite apart from the ethics of an Economy Bill along these lines, I submit that that is not common justice, because you are purporting to impose the same percentage of a cut on a dispensary doctor as you are imposing upon everybody else when in fact you are imposing twice the cut on a dispensary doctor that you are imposing on anybody else, because he is losing at both ends.  You are burning both ends of the candle, Government policy having created an economic situation which has reduced his revenue from private practice, but which has increased the volume of his work on red tickets.  Now Government legislation is going to take from him a percentage of the salary which he enjoys in respect of the work he does on red tickets.  That is not equity, and no matter how willing a man is to weigh in with his neighbour and to share the adversity of his neighbour, no man who is human will willingly submit to a double burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have thought that the Deputy, with his experience of a rural dispensary, and expert knowledge of the truth of what I am saying, would have made bold to make that case to his own Minister.  It would come much more strongly from him, and would make a much more profound impression on the Minister, if the <Col N="49" /> Deputy made the case I am making. I do not think the Deputy would attempt to controvert the case I am making.  He has had the independence of mind to reprove his colleague, Deputy Corry, but when he has listened to Deputy Corry as long as I have listened to him, he will not waste his time reproving him.  Even in his lighter moments Deputy Corry is an individual to whom no sane man in this country pays the slightest attention.  Let me reassure the Deputy that when Deputy Corry gets up and says, as well as I remember his words, that the medical officer of health for Country Cork was an extravagant individual, and had a host of assistants&mdash;even if Deputy Corry got up and said that the medical officers of health treated patients with something approximating to savagery &mdash;that is only Pretty Fanny's way, and the Deputy does not mean it.  He said it because he could not think of anything else to say at the time, and no one who knows the Deputy will be in the least perturbed.  We are now in Committee and the Deputy may intervene again.  I invite him to do so, and to say if I have over-stated the case for the dispensary doctors in any particular.  I invite the Deputy to intervene again, and to deny or to correct any contention that I have submitted to the Minister.  I invite the Deputy, not rhetorically but sincerely, to intervene again and admit that I have converted him to my point of view.  I submit that if he does so it is more than possible, nay, it is highly probable, that we will shake the hitherto impregnable fortress of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  He is a softhearted man, he is a just man, he is a generous man, and the Deputy and I together may succeed in preventing him, all unwittingly from doing an injustice to the medical officers of health in this country.  I invite the Deputy to lend a hand.</P>

      <P>I do not for an instant attempt to deny the accuracy of every statement that Deputy Dillon made, but I pointed out that the Minister did certainly make a distinction in the case of medical officers when he gave <Col N="50" /> them, not a very big concession, if you like, but a concession that was not given to other public servants.  I speak on behalf of several dispensary medical officers.  In the case of those in Deputy Dillon's own town and around it, I speak with authority when I say that if sacrifices are necessary in the present economic distress they are quite willing to make them as well as everybody else.  Speaking for the medical officers in the constituency that I represent, I can say that 75 per cent. of them will not be touched at all under this Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon, in asking for the intervention of Deputy O'Dowd, was of course putting him in a rather awkward position, because I am quite satisfied that if Deputy O'Dowd were allowed to give a free vote it would be against the proposed cuts.  However, his position is such that one can possibly excuse him if he should vote the other way.  The main question here is the Minister's attitude.  I think that if we could succeed in getting the Minister to change his mind on this, that Deputy O'Dowd would be just as glad as I would, even though both of us, for obvious reasons, may be prevented from taking too active a part in persuading the Minister to change. It is quite obvious that this proposal to cut the salaries of dispensary doctors has very little support behind it&mdash;it was attacked by Deputy Norton, the leader of the Labour Party&mdash;apart from Deputy Corry, who, I was glad to see, was brought to book for his wild statements. I had proposed making some comments on that Deputy's speech, but Deputy O'Dowd rather stole my thunder, so that I think the less said about it now the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But, apart from Deputy Corry, I have heard no member of the Government Party defend or advocate the cuts in the case of the dispensary doctors <Col N="51" /> or of the county medical officers of health.  I believe that a great many members of the Government Party are not in favour of these cuts on public servants who are already underpaid. When Deputy Dillon stated that the present economic conditions had resulted in an indirect cut, by causing an increase in the number of red ticket cases in any given district, he failed to mention, though he meant it by implication, that not only was there an indirect cut in that way, but that there was also a direct cut by the fact that the increase to the red ticket list was accounted for by those who had been taken off the dispensary doctor's list of private patients.  We have not only the doctor being overworked, but also the fact that he is losing a great number of his private patients, and that these are being added to his red ticket list.  That really is an argument for increasing and not diminishing the salaries of dispensary doctors, because they are getting more work to do as a result of the present economic conditions in the country.  As poor law medical officers they are getting more work to do.  On that alone the dispensary doctor is entitled to an increase in his salary, but when, in addition, his private practice also suffers, it surely is an added argument for an increase.  I suggest to the Minister that we should have the difference and leave the present salaries untouched. No case has been made for cutting down the salaries of unfortunate dispensary doctors who are terribly hard worked and definitely underpaid.  I think the Minister will admit that putting this section into operation will not mean much of a financial gain to the Government.  The gain to the local bodies will not be considerable either. I should say that the political gain even is a very doubtful thing.  The Minister would be likely to reap as many political kudos by omitting the section altogether as by pressing for its retention unchanged.</P>
    <P>The expenses that a doctor has to meet have been mentioned, and particularly those that relate to the upkeep of a motor car.  A good many people who have talked on that aspect <Col N="52" /> of the question probably do not realise that the upkeep of a motor car is very costly for a doctor whose dispensary district is widespread.  Say that a doctor has a car that is value for £200. Everybody knows that a new car costs less to run than an old one.  Take a car that has been in use for two or three years.  I calculate that the running costs of such a car will be between £130 and £150 a year.  A car is an absolute necessity for a dispensary doctor and, as I said here before, some special concessions should be granted to them as regards the amount of tax they have to pay, because a motor car is a necessary part of their business.  In comparison with doctors at the other side, who get the same type of car much cheaper than it can be got in the Free State, a doctor here is severely handicapped.  A doctor at the other side is also able to run his car at far less than it costs his confrere in Ireland.  The question of a car, therefore, is a very important one from a dispensary doctor's point of view.  I think the Minister will have to admit that it is a definite injustice to cut down the salaries of dispensary doctors at the present moment.  As somebody has stated before, the Minister, probably, will take up the attitude that if you except one class of men from the scope of the Bill you will have to except everybody.  That, of course, does not follow, and, in any case, as Deputy O'Higgins stated, if the proposed action is an unjust one, that should take precedence of the value of the opposite proposition, from the point of view of argument.</P>
    <P>I do not like to delay too long, as I have spoken already on this section, but I would again appeal to the Minister from all points of view to reconsider his attitude on this&mdash;from the point of view of justice and from the point of view of economy, because I do not believe any economy will result from it.  Secondly, I do not think there will be any political gain for the Government in it, and I have not heard any Labour representative or farmers' representative indulging in any thunderous phrases in favour of it.  Indeed, I do not think the Minister himself is in favour of it.</P>

      <P>I only want to say one word in support of Deputies Davitt and Dillon.  It is admitted that medical officers, generally, are the worst paid servants of the State and of public bodies in comparison with the services they render.  There is no question or doubt about the fact that the medical profession as a whole, including the dispensary doctors, have suffered a very severe cut in their incomes through circumstances over which they have no control, and I think the Minister should consider very seriously accepting the suggested amendment to omit them from the scope of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I only feel called upon to enter into this debate because of the fact that dispensary doctors, and the medical profession generally, never thought it too much to give their services voluntarily and freely in every case where suffering humanity demanded their services.  In particular, in the days gone by, the medical profession, as a whole, established a standard which I should like to see maintained, and I should be sorry to see any Irish Government, which is more or less the result of these activities, taking it as part of their policy to inflict hardship on that great profession.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment and to give way to the suggestions made by Deputy Dillon, Deputy Davitt and other people who spoke on this.</P>

      <P>I was very glad indeed to hear the many tributes paid to the medical profession, and particularly to the dispensary medical officers in the public service, from, I think, all sides of the House.  I am quite satisfied that, taking them all round, they do excellent service to the State and to the community as a whole. I am quite happy as Minister for Public Health to bear testimony to the satisfaction the Department gets, generally speaking, from the medical men in the service.  I do not think I need say any more, especially to the medical men.  I have had deputations from them.  I have had deputations from the several committees&mdash;local committees, as well as what I might call national committees&mdash;of the <Col N="54" /> medical body on this question of cuts, and I told them, through their representatives, my opinion of this question and what my answer must be on this amendment.  I think that Deputy O'Dowd was a member of, perhaps, more than one deputation that waited on me on behalf of the medical profession. I do agree that it is probably correct that medical men have suffered some loss of income from their private practice in the last few years. What professional man has not suffered? There has been in this country, as well as, I think one could say without exaggeration, all over the world, a very serious decline in the last six or seven years in the value of agricultural products.  That decline has been steady for the last six or seven years, and the decline in the last five years, probably, has been about 50 per cent. In the Irish Free State, which is so very largely an agricultural community, it is natural that we have felt that loss or decline, particularly the farmers and agriculturists of the community generally.  As a result of that, doctors as well as others have suffered a decrease in their incomes.  I do not think that Deputy Dillon or Deputy Davitt or any other Deputy on the other side of the House can say that the doctors have a greater number of red tickets now than in the last two or three years.</P>

      <P>Somebody else talked of the heavy cut on the doctors.  Now the doctor&mdash;the dispensary medical officer&mdash;is in a privileged position in this Bill.  In every other case, the whole income of the part-time officer is taken into consideration.  In the case of the dispensary medical officer, only the salary he derives from the local authority is taken into consideration. The cut is made on that.  He is, therefore, in a privileged position.  He is similarly privileged in getting advantage of a special allowance of £50&mdash;an allowance which is made to no other official of a local authority. Those speaking on behalf of dispensary and county medical officers should bear that in mind.  The medical officers have done magnificent work, and I am sure they will continue to do it.  I believe, no matter what their pay, they will continue to give loyal and beneficial service to the community.  I have read in the last few years, since the economic crisis commenced, claims from responsible men that all classes of the community should bear a share of the loss of income suffered by the agricultural community.  Those of us who have read the Lenten pastorals must have noticed the claim put forward by high authority that the salaried people should bear a portion of the fall in values that has taken place recently.  That claim has come from responsible people&mdash;that salaried officials should not be allowed to go scot free.</P>

They might be inclined to be unjust. In a few cases they would probably be unjust, and I should not like to see that.  But I do stand for the principle that the whole community should be prepared to bear a share of the burden.</P>

      <P>Two points arising out of the Minister's reply may cause some confusion.  One point is as to the professions.  What professional man has not suffered?  This Bill is not really aimed at professionals.  The <Col N="58" /> majority of people who will suffer under this Bill are not professional people but people with fixed salaries. If they have to do travelling, they have an allowance for that.  The salary of the dispensary doctor really covers his travelling expenses.  It rarely does more than that.  Because of that, his position is not comparable with the positions of public officials with a fixed salary who have no travelling to do, such as secretaries, and other officials of local authorities.  So far as the doctors are concerned, the cut is not equitable.  The Minister has made a very fair admission when contrasted with other Ministers, like the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who have stated that the country is prosperous. The Minister for Local Government and Public Health does not say that at all and he is quite right.  The country is not prosperous.  The Minister for Local Government says that these cuts are necessary and that everybody should bear his share.  The cuts should, however, be equitably distributed and I do not think they are in the case of the doctors.  The Minister ought to reconsider the question of the professions because the Bill does not apply really to professionals but to officials of a different type with fixed salaries.  As regards the red tickets, I think that there was a general misunderstanding. It is well known in the country, even if the number of red tickets has not increased, that the services for which doctors are not paid have increased tenfold owing to the conditions which the Minister knows exist in the country.  Consequently, I think that the Bill will not apply equitably so far as the medical profession is concerned.</P>

      <P>I shall give one reason in a moment.  I suggest to the Minister that no money will be saved to <Col N="59" /> the local authorities by this cut, but that greater expense will be placed on them because of the number of men who will claim pensions as a result of the imposition of the cut.  The local authorities will be put to the expense of paying pensions and also paying salaries to the newly-appointed successors of the medical officers who have resigned.  That point has been made against the Bill by some local authorities&mdash;that it will increase the cost to the local authorities.  That point was particularly made by the Joint Committee of the Grangegorman Mental Hospital a few days ago.  As has been pointed out, there are a large number of men in the medical service who are approaching old age.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>I am getting too near the margin myself to offer a definition to the Minister.  I suggest that the cost to the local authorities will be increased for the reason I have stated. The Minister stated that a claim was put up by many responsible men throughout the country that everybody should share equally in the deprivations that may be necessary owing to the present economic position.  I take it for granted the Minister will be willing to leave to the local authorities the decision as to whether cuts should be imposed in their particular areas or not and, therefore, will accept the amendment that will be presently before the Committee. The most responsible people, as regards expenses, are the local authorities.  If there are to be cuts made it will be fair that they should decide what cuts should be made in their particular area.  I would point out, also, to the Minister that the <Col N="60" /> local medical officers have already shared fully in any hardship the community as a whole has to bear.</P>
      <P>It is agreed, I think, that farmers are in a bad way at the present time. Medical officers and dispensary doctors are entirely dependent upon the farmers for their private practice. Their private practice has diminished to almost negligible proportions in the last few years.  The Minister has made the point, and fairly, that the number of red tickets is not increasing according to official reports.  The Minister must be aware, as every dispensary doctor is, that the amount and number of free tickets is no measure of the free work that dispensary doctors do.  They attend poor patients whether they have rate tickets or not.  The Minister says that the increased number of free attendances does not appear normally on the register.  He cannot accept the number of red tickets as an indication of the present state of things.  Although a doctor may attend three or four people, perhaps only one goes on the register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is said that the depression is only temporary, as we all hope.  The dispensary doctor does not wish to transfer to the poor law people those who had formerly been his paying patients, even though what they paid was small.  He does not wish to put these people to the humiliation of having to go to the relieving officer, or to procure a ticket from the relieving officer.  The Minister, no doubt, is perfectly correct in stating that the number of red tickets has not increased, but the House should know that the amount of work thrown upon the dispensary doctor has increased.  The Minister referred to the privileged position into which he puts the dispensary doctor under this Bill.  I have already expressed appreciation of the fact that the Minister has given them some consideration though I think he did not give the exact reasons.  It is because the dispensary doctor receives, in truth, very small remuneration towards his out-of-pocket expenses for the work done. The Minister very properly took some notice of the fact that the salary must <Col N="61" /> include provision for the doctor's mode of locomotion, for getting around and seeing his patients.  I do not think that the Minister would suggest that the £50 provided in the Bill will be able to bridge over the difficulty the ordinary dispensary doctor has to encounter in connection with travelling in his district for poor law purposes only.  The Minister, again, has said, and he is right, that the present medical officers will continue to give their services loyally whether paid their due salary or whether they are docked.  Of course, these are not the Minister's exact words.  I should say that that is so but the Minister must look to the future and he is not likely to get as competent medical services in the future as at the present time if the conditions of to-day are to be applied in the future.  I think I have now expressed my opinion on this amendment, and as I do not wish to take up any more time I shall leave it at that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think it is a slight hardship on us, that when we asked him what the amendment we submitted is calculated to cost he is unable to tell us?  He refuses to make this concession without having even considered the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that dispensary doctors were only half-time officers, and that it was only proposed to take a proportion of the salaries they are receiving as dispensary doctors.  Deputy Rowlette touched on the point of their private practice, but I do not think he laboured sufficiently the fact that while their remunerative private practice diminished, yet their free private practice has increased, because when persons within their area are sick they will have the doctor whether they are able to pay him or not.  In many cases, before the economic crisis, when a family would send for this same doctor to attend and pay him for his visit, they are now reduced to the position of having to send for him on a ticket so that the doctor has to give practically the same service for <Col N="62" /> nothing.  He will have more poor to attend and yet we are going to diminish his salary for doing more work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder would the Minister give the local authorities power to give a travelling allowance to dispensary doctors.  Other officials of the local authorities get travelling allowances. For some it is up to 6d. a mile.  Now, if the dispensary doctor got the offer of a lump sum, or if power was given to the local authorities to give him a lump sum, or a mileage rate for travelling, it might define what opportunity he has got for his skilled services. County surveyors and assistant county surveyors, and architects to the boards of health, all get their mileage rate.  Travelling instructors to the Committee of Agriculture and the Committee of Vocational Education get their travelling allowances.  If the dispensary doctor got his reduced emoluments plus allowances he would be in a better way to live.  I agree with the Deputy that private practice, for country doctors, has practically ceased to exist, just as practice for the veterinary officers of local authorities, who will also get cut, has ceased to exist.  Of course, a man will try to get some remedy rather than die, but in the case of the animal it is hardly worth sending for the veterinary surgeon and if the animal is let go the veterinary surgeon has no chance of a fee.  But in the case of the human he is not now able to pay the doctor, and the doctor is asked to come free where formerly he would be asked to come for a fee, or he is at any rate, paid less than he was before.  It is argued that this is a Temporary Economies Bill, that the economic situation is a temporary one.  Well, during that period the doctor's private practice has been almost annihilated, and at the same time his part-time salary is reduced.  Instead of being in a privileged position, as pointed out by the Minister, he is in a worse position than the whole-time official, for the whole-time official loses only a small percentage of his whole-time salary but the dispensary doctor loses a similar percentage of his part-time salary and his private practice has <Col N="63" /> almost disappeared.  I think the dispensary doctor would have suffered enough if his salary were left untouched.  He would have suffered more than is represented by the percentage reduction in similar salaries. <Col N="64" /> He would suffer more in the loss spread over the income from his private practice and his dispensary salary put together.  I think the Minister would be well advised to leave the dispensary doctor as he is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (3), line 44, after the word &ldquo;authority&rdquo; to add the words &ldquo;but shall not include any veterinary surgeon in the employment of such local authority.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The insertion of those words as indicated would have the effect of removing veterinary surgeons from the cuts which are proposed.  There is nothing like the same case to be made on behalf of veterinary surgeons, which could be made for the medical man. There is, however, some case, and in <Col N="65" /> the present circumstances of the whole live stock business I am not sure that in the end there could not be &mdash; relative to past conditions&mdash;a better case made with reference to the veterinary surgeons.  There was, at one time, quite a flourishing business done in this profession.  It centred around horses and cattle.  As far as veterinary work is concerned at the moment it is based almost entirely upon racing stables.  There are a lucky few in the country who live in the neighbourhood of, and have their experience about, certain racing establishments.  Those people might still get something in the way of decent professional life.  As far as the rest are concerned, I think it can be said without any fear of contradiction that the only people who are those who are anything whatever are those who are in any way attached to or have their services engaged by a local authority. There is next to nothing done in the way of private practice.  Live stock has gone to such a point in the way of prices that it is not worth while &mdash;even where it once was&mdash;to call in a veterinary surgeon to attend to an animal.  There has, of course, been an attempt made under the Veterinary Surgeons Act to establish those people in a better professional way, but that Act, of course, was passed in old-time circumstances and envisaged the continuance of them.  Although the Act has better bound together the profession it has failed altogether to give them what it was then thought, in the opinion of this House, they were entitled to.</P>
    <P>In the special circumstances of the case, because of conditions not of their operation and not of their wish, I do suggest that there would be very little loss to the Exchequer or to the local authorities by the acceptance of an amendment of this type.  It would give to those people, who are the remnant of what was once a rather good professional corporation and a rather flourishing business, some idea that there were still people looking after their interests, and that it was not regarded as being wholly in the interests of the country that their <Col N="66" /> profession should be allowed to die out. It is, in fact, almost dead.  The number of those who go year by year to veterinary colleges is very small.  It is something less than one-eighth of what is used to be.  If one goes back to the flourishing days before transport took the change that it has taken, the annual recruitment to the veterinary college is only one-twentieth.  After the outflow of those called to the profession there is only about one-twentieth of what there used to be. The cut, if imposed, would lead to still further depressing that profession. There is not much loss involved in accepting this amendment.  There is no great breach of principle that can be pointed to.  The few who are affected by it would get a corresponding uplift, and there would be some repercussions in the whole business.  As I say, on humane grounds there is not the case to be made here that there is for the medical men, but, in the changed circumstances, which they did not bring about, I do suggest that there is some case here, and that the amendment should be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">

      <P>Deputy McGilligan has properly said that there is not the same case to be made for the veterinary surgeons that can be made for the medical profession.  That is quite true. He has stressed the question of the diminution that has taken place in the number of veterinary surgeons.  I believe it is considerable.  Since the days when horses were more in vogue the number of recruits has become very much smaller.  The number of veterinary men practising in the country, at present, according to all I hear, seems to be only about sufficient for the country, with the result that they are able to dictate terms now when they apply for posts.  I am told that there are veterinary posts available now for which veterinary surgeons cannot be found, or, if they are available, they will not accept the salaries that are offered.  They are, therefore, in a much more privileged position than are the members of the medical profession, because, certainly, as the House knows, there is no scarcity of medical men for any post that is <Col N="67" /> offered.  I cannot accept the amendment. I think it would be unfair to other classes of professional men if veterinary surgeons or doctors were to be eliminated from the scope of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy McGilligan in this amendment.  In the present condition of things in this country, our live stock have depreciated to such an extent that the private practice of veterinary surgeons is gone absolutely.  The Minister says that the fact that fewer people are now entering the profession means that they are in a position to dictate terms.  I do not know to whom they are dictating terms.  They are not dictating terms to the farming community, because the farming community are not engaging them.  My experience of veterinary surgeons is largely the same as my experience of doctors&mdash;they are very bad people to collect their debts, to say the least of it.  They have been very generous with their advice and, like doctors, they have very heavy travelling expenses.  I do not think that even if this amendment were carried, as Deputy McGilligan pointed out, it is going to affect local authorities or the Executive Council to any great extent financially.  I think the effect will be very small, and I think that, in view of what the Minister knows and admits with regard to the live stock business of this country&mdash; and, of course, the veterinary surgeon's job is to deal with live stock&mdash; the Minister ought to see that whatever little remnant of this profession that we have left should be allowed to keep the little allowance they have at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support Deputy McGilligan's amendment.  Its acceptance will entail very little cost either to the local authorities or to the Ministry.  The number of persons affected is not very large and, so far as local bodies are concerned, most of the veterinaries employed are part-time officials and their remuneration is very small indeed.  To cut that remuneration, therefore, would be practically to <Col N="68" /> make most of the offices not worth holding.  The Minister, in reply to Deputy McGilligan as to the number of veterinary surgeons in the country, said that his information was that there were scarcely enough to cope with the needs of the public.  That is not my experience.  In my own county and, I am quite certain, in others, there are numbers of them who are practically on the unemployed list or doing very little business.  A few years ago they used to do a little in the doctoring of cattle, which business is now practically extinct, and men will grasp at any job whatever.  I know that even if the cut were a good deal bigger than it is and some of the present surgeons relinquished their positions, surgeons could be found to take up those positions at very much lower rates, simply as a means of starting some kind of business.  That is a state of affairs that nobody will wish for.  I know a number of veterinary surgeons employed by local bodies and the remuneration for whose work, mostly part-time, is very small indeed.  A cut in their salaries will not produce a very big saving, while it will inflict a very great hardship on a number of veterinary surgeons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with one aspect of this matter to which the Minister referred, that is, the question of dictation.  We had a couple of cases of this kind in my constituency, and far from its being a question of dictation, the facts were quite the contrary. The position is that in the present condition of the live stock market, it is quite useless for a veterinary surgeon to take up a local appointment in a district and to receive £100 and have no private practice.  That does not suggest that dictation to which the Minister referred.  The amounts the surgeons receive are such that a man could not pay for his lodgings, much less run a motor car and do his work. That is the reason why these cases exist.  There are no applicants; there will not be any applicants, and we must make up our minds that there will be no applicants.  The reason is that the £50 or £100 which a veterinary surgeon would get from a local authority would be quite useless&mdash;it would not pay for <Col N="69" /> his motor car.  The Minister suggests that that is dictation, but quite the contrary is the case.  We have had at least two examples of that in County Donegal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another point I should like to put before the Minister with regard to notifiable diseases of live stock.  The duties of veterinary surgeons in that respect have been increased very considerably in the last few years.  Originally, when they were appointed, this was not included amongst their duties, and for some years the matter was really in abeyance.  It was then put on to the veterinary surgeons, and in most cases the local authorities, I believe, did not give any increase in salary in respect of the extra work imposed on them. The new duty means, of course, a very large increase in travelling expenses, because they have to cover very large areas.  On the whole, I think that veterinary surgeons are very poorly paid for the services they give.  They are essential so far as these notifiable diseases are concerned.  Bad and all as our live stock trade is, we must keep it clean, and for that we have to depend on the veterinary surgeon.  I do not think it will be any help to us if the Minister puts the cut into operation against them.</P>

      <P>Oh, the World Conference.  It is so bad that although we have won the war and saved, I think, £7,000,000, we are unable to pay a few veterinary surgeons the absurd salaries they used to get.  I plead for veterinary surgeons as I plead for any of these professional classes.  There ought to be some little regard for education and experience, particularly when that education and that experience have been bought dearly and, particularly, when you have in this profession, in the main, the sons of the small people representing the democracy of this country whose fathers and mothers out of, in the main, the very poor moneys they were receiving paid for their children's education in order to get them into these professional posts, and who made sacrifices to get them into these posts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The children, when they got into these posts, were very often faced with liquidating the debt which their parents had incurred over their education.  It is not fair that because these people happen to be near the Government there should be this blind attack on them and cutting of their salaries.  I have not heard it said about the doctors, except the statement bred of the ignorance of Deputy Corry, that they were overpaid or sufficiently paid.  I noticed that that particular argument of Deputy Corry's was not accepted by the Vice-President.  I have not heard anybody say with regard to the veterinary surgeons that they were over-paid with regard to the work they have to do.  If that argument is made it can be met but it has not been put forward here, not even whispered.  Instead of that, the Vice-President says that the veterinary surgeons in practice in the country at the moment are so limited in numbers that they can, in fact, dictate their own terms.  Let us examine that.  I do not believe it.  The refutation is <Col N="72" /> clear to anybody who considers the facts.  At what age does a boy go to train for the veterinary surgeon's profession?  Somewhere about the 17th year.  As it used to be, it was a difficult course.  Let us assume that that five years' course was, on an average, taken out only in seven years and the man emerges as a veterinary surgeon at 24 years of age.  What is the average length of life in the country? Certainly a man can look to have 35 or 40 years in the profession.  Does the Vice-President tell me that those who were inclined to enter for the veterinary surgeon's profession 35 years ago saw the depression that we have here to-day and, therefore, refrained from going to the veterinary college to study?  If that is not the case where are the veterinary surgeons who trained and became qualified in the last 25 years?  I think that the number of people in practice in the country has not gone down.  It has gone down by a very small number if at all, the number which would represent the loss by deaths annually, and the failure by natural recruitment to make up for that loss.  But to represent, as the Vice-President has done, that the number of qualified veterinary surgeons is very small in the country, and that they are so few that they can make their own terms, is to misrepresent the fact.  If there has been a falling-off in the numbers in practice in the country, there has been a much greater falling off in the work to do. If there were the same demand for veterinary surgeons in the country as there was 35 years ago and if, for some reason, better terms were offered abroad and the number in this country had gone down by half, then they would be in a position to dictate their own terms.  But you have a very big change in the amount of practice here in this country.  I do not suppose there is a quarter of the work to be done to-day that the veterinary surgeon used to do some years ago. Yet in those circumstances the Vice-President says they can dictate terms and, therefore, that this amendment will not be accepted.  That was the only argument put forward.  I do not suppose that there is a country <Col N="73" /> Deputy who does not know that that is a fantastic argument to put up. Then there is the other side of it that the veterinary surgeons are such a small class that there should not be such pother about them at the moment.  My answer to that is that because of the reputation that the Irish horse owner had won, because of the weight that is attached to training in this country, further because of the very big livestock business done in the country and because of the reputation that these animals gained, undoubtedly there was big money in both these businesses.  Because of that there was a very good call on the services of the veterinary surgeons who got a very big reputation.  The veterinary surgeons trained here had a very high reputation.</P>
    <P>The college at Ballsbride had a very big reputation, so much so that when there was a discussion about separation of the college here in Ballsbridge from the college in London, the demand came from London that they should keep in association with us. In order that we might achieve that, they offered terms on the joint board which gave us far more than we were entitled to by our numbers.  That was because, as they said, the reputation of the Irish Veterinary College was very big.  I do not think anybody who has an eye on the facts at all can deny that the work the veterinary surgeons used do has been, to a very big extent, swept away.  We have only to think back on the prices that used to be paid for cattle to realise that in those times the fees paid for cures, when illnesses occurred, were relatively high.  A mere collation of these two sets of prices would make anybody understand how it is that to-day when certain animals are sick it is not worth while to call in a veterinary surgeon.  If the animal does not cure of itself the animal is let die.  There may be some research in the case of a cow doctor.  Then in the present circumstances one has only to look to the prices in the main to see what is going to be the result in research to the veterinary surgeons.</P>
    <P>Private practice having gone, is it fair to ask that the salaries paid to these men by the public bodies should <Col N="74" /> be kept at some sort of nucleus and to continue the small salary these men have got to the point where it was fixed when their private practice was better and when the livestock business was better?  I think the amendment deserves much more consideration than it has got.  We may never again get to the point at which we once were with regard to the veterinary surgeon's work.  The change in the matter of transport would have brought about a change in the demand for the veterinary surgeon.  But there is sufficient hope that again there will be business doing in this country both with regard to horses and cattle.  The young people could be kept here and parents should be able to see some outlet for their children who have a disposition towards veterinary science so that they might be inspired to send them again in bigger and better numbers to the college at Ballsbridge to get a training in a big way.</P>
    <P>There has been no argument used so far that these men are overpaid. They are not overpaid.  There has been no argument that this would mean an enormous load on the local authority, or that if the local authority do not get this section it would mean an enormous sacrifice to them.  The only argument used is one that I characterise as being fantastic &mdash;that is the argument of the Vice-President that the numbers are so small that the residue can get any salaries they demand in relation to the work offered.  That is a most fantastic argument and one that cannot hold.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister not to press this section and to accept the amendment.  The income of the veterinary profession has been very much reduced already compared with what it was some years ago. Now, as a result of the economic war when two-year old cattle are being sold for £2 or £3 there is little prospect of the veterinary surgeon getting much private practice.  I would like to remind the Vice-President of the statement made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce recently that soon a big percentage of our cattle <Col N="75" /> must be destroyed.  As a result of that, the prospect of employment for veterinary surgeons will be a great deal less.  It may be, of course, that <Col N="76" /> the Minister may be able to give some hope to the profession that they will find employment superintending the destruction of these cattle.</P>

      <P>I move: That the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 7, sub-section (2).  The following words added at the end of the sub-section:&mdash;&ldquo;and includes a person, other than a dependant of such workman within the meaning of sub-section (1) of this section, who is not under the age of 15 at the date of the death of such workman and who was resident with such workman and wholly dependent on his earnings at the said date.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>When the Bill was before the Dáil, a question was raised about including amongst the dependants of workmen entitled to compensation, adopted children.  At the time I indicated that an amendment was being prepared which would have the effect of including adopted children, although not saying so in precise terms.  This amendment and amendment No. 3 are intended to cover the points raised.  It is admitted that they cover persons other than those who could properly be described as &ldquo;adopted children.&rdquo; They include a person other than a dependant of such workman within the meaning of sub-section (1) who is not under the age of 15, while the next amendment effects the same provision in respect of persons under 15 and covers persons who are resident with such workman, and are wholly dependent on his earnings at the date of his death.  I am advised that the section carries out the intention to cover such persons. Although legally they are not members of the workman's family, nevertheless, they are recognised by the workman as persons ordinarily resident with and dependent on his earnings.  The definition covers the case of &ldquo;adopted children&rdquo; referred to particularly by Deputy Finian Lynch.  The amendment goes a little further than was contemplated in the Dáil, but, at the same time, I do not think that objection can be taken to it.</P>

      <P>Section 7.  A new sub-section added at the end of the section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5)  For the purposes of the immediately preceding sub-section insurance shall be deemed to be one of the ordinary necessaries of life.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>When the Bill was before the Dáil on Report reference was made to the fact that the English Courts had, by a sub-section of the English Act which is similar to Section 4 (7) of this Bill, in the case of the Welsh Steam Coal Company versus Evans, precluded savings or insurance out of the balance of the deceased's contributions, after providing for food, clothing and shelter and other necessaries of life.  I indicated at that stage that I was prepared to offset that decision by inserting a sub-section by which insurance would be deemed to be one of the ordinary necessaries of life, so that in the event of the family having undertaken liability in respect of an insurance policy, the premiums of which were in part paid by the contributions of the injured member, that the fact could be taken into account when compensation was being awarded, so that the insurance could be continued.</P>

      <P>Section 8.  Two new sub-sections added at the end of the section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="79" />&ldquo;(5)  Where a person is employed by the owners of a ship which is not registered in Saorstát Eireann under the Merchant Shipping Acts, the agent of such owners shall for the purposes of this Act be deemed to be the employer of such workman.</P>
    <P>(6)  Where a person is employed under a local or other public authority, such authority shall, notwithstanding that the appointment of such person by such authority was or the dismissal of such person by such authority is subject to the approval of a Minister of State, be deemed for the purposes of this Act to be the employer of such person.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was complained that cases have occurred where workmen who were employed by a master of a ship to clean it, or to do other jobs, when injured, have been unable to recover compensation. As the owners may have no place in the Saorstát, and as the ship may have left port before the judgment of the court could be executed, or a claim under the Act formulated, this amendment provides that in such cases the agent shall be made liable for any compensation due to the workman. Section 66 of the Bill provides that a ship may be detained by order of the Minister but it cannot be made use of, except where a member of the crew was injured.  The new amendment is intended to cover persons or members of the crew casually engaged on work while the ship is in port.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not meet the case where agency is the basis.  It would cover the case of ships in the habit of calling at ports in the Saorstát, where the agents are men on a full time basis.  Take the case of tramp vessels which call casually.  It may be said that the agent would be deemed to be the employer but, whether an injured workman would ever recover damages would depend on the financial stability of the man who is the agent.</P>

      <P>Will the effect be to let out owners of the ship and to make the agents exclusively liable?  If that is so it may possibly lead to very serious hardship on the workers.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take an analytical case.  Supposing a large number of workmen were engaged on a boat, and that something happened and that there were 50 injured, as the law stood any property belonging to the shipping concern was attached or the vessel could be seized to satisfy the judgment.  For the future, instead of that valuable property, which might be attached, you have merely an agent, with whatever property he may have as an individual.  There are obvious circumstances in which it would be far better to have a right against the owners of a line and their property, when it comes inside the jurisdiction, than to have it against relatively, a man of straw.  Would it not be better to put it: that this would not be in substitution for but would be in addition to, previous rights?  I suggest that you should <Col N="81" /> not do away with the old protection which was good in certain circumstances: that you might seize a vessel which came within the jurisdiction, but that in addition you would have this right, that if the boat did not come in then you had as a last resort an action against the agent.  This seems to be substituting the agent to the exclusion of every other remedy. That has its obvious advantages, but it would not look to be always the better course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a completely open mind on this.  Representations were made that cases have arisen in which workmen were unable to get the compensation awarded to them because the ships at the time of the accident were not registered in the Saorstát.  There have been cases in which it was not possible to collect the compensation awarded.  Under this there will undoubtedly be somebody in the Saorstát against whom an action can be taken, and on whom liability for compensation can be placed.  Having regard to that I think it is preferable to the other course suggested, seeing that the number of cases where the agent would be a man of straw&mdash;a person unable to pay the compensation awarded&mdash; would be very few indeed.  There is a limited number of shipping agencies in the Saorstát, all of which, of course, are in positions to meet any claims likely to arise under this Act.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister, when considering the points raised by Deputy McGilligan, to make provision that in the case of tramp steamers which have not regular agencies here the persons acting for them should be made liable under the Act.  I can see cases arising of an agent being appointed to discharge one of these steamers.  I can also see the point made by Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Costello that a number of shipping companies, with permanent agencies here, are themselves better security than the agents representing them.  But these tramp steamers may only call here occasionally.  They are of the class that may even change hands while at sea.  Because of that I would <Col N="82" /> ask the Minister to provide that a discretion be given to injured persons to proceed either against the owners of such vessels or the agents acting for them here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy's suggestion meets my point at all.  Take ships which ordinarily ply here but are not registered here. Under the law as it stood there was a good right and there was a flaw. The good right was that, even although they were not registered here, when you had got your judgment you could go against their property.  You could hold the ship in satisfaction of it. For the future you will not have that. As I understand it, you will have, first of all, an action against the agent.  The agent is deemed to be the employer apparently to the exclusion of the real employer.  Take the case of the Head Line.  A workman gets injured.  They have not their boats registered here.  A judgment is obtained against them.  Their boats apparently&mdash;I say this subject to correction&mdash;cannot be seized to satisfy that judgment.  All you are left with is an action against the agent.  When I used the term &ldquo;man of straw&rdquo; I qualified it with the word &ldquo;relatively.&rdquo; Take it that an agent will insure against the ordinary run of accidents, but let us envisage circumstances in which there are a number of accidents.  Something breaks in a boat and there is a catastrophic collapse, something which causes injury to a squad of workmen.  It is conceivable that the ordinary insurance rates a man had been paying would not be big enough to meet the number of judgments resulting.  Under this amendment, I take it you would have lost the old valuable right of seizing a substantial piece of property which remained inside the jurisdiction to meet these judgments.  The amendment has its good points in that it does give a man somebody to attack in the event of a boat casually putting in here and clearing out before there was time to satisfy a judgment.  I think we might say in the amendment that the shipping agent shall be deemed to be the employer of the worker without prejudice, and without <Col N="83" /> upsetting any right which previously or at the moment exists in relation to this type of case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, I think that is probably the interpretation that would be put on it.  Of course, in practice we must also recognise the fact that the majority of the agencies here are themselves substantial owners of property.  In fact, the shipping agencies that act for the Head Line are themselves ship owners.  At any rate, they are in a position to offer very substantial assets to offset any liability that may accrue to them.  It may be that there would be, here and there, shipping agencies that would not be able to do that. But taking the general run of cases, the workman, I should say, would have as good a mark in the shipping agent as in the company.  However, I have no objection to the matter being left over with a view to having the point examined as to whether, in fact, this sub-section would operate to deprive a worker of his right to proceed against a ship-owner if he so desires.  The amendment, I should say, is double-barrelled.  Sub-section (6) is intended to provide against a doubt which arose as to whether certain employees of local authorities were included in the scope of the Bill as drafted.  It was feared that it might be a contention that there did not exist a contract of service between the local authorities and these employees because of the fact that the local authority could not dismiss them without the sanction of the Department of Local Government.  This sub-section is intended to make it quite clear that such employees of a local authority are included.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee disagree with the Seanad in the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 16 a new section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>16.&mdash;(1)  Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  personal injury by accident occurring outside Saorstát Eireann is caused to a workman, and</P>
      <P>(b)  such workman was at the date of such accident employed under a contract of service made in Saorstát Eireann, and</P>
      <P>(c)  the principal or only place of trade or business of the employer of such workman was at the said date in Saorstát Eireann, and</P>
      <P>(d)  such workman was at the said date normally employed in connection with the employer's trade or business in Saorstát Eireann,</P>
      <P>such accident shall for the purposes of the immediately preceding section be deemed to have occurred in Saorstát Eireann.</P>
      <P>(2)  Where in any employment personal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment is caused to a workman, and such accident occurred in a country, other than Saorstát Eireann, and such accident is, by virtue of the immediately preceding sub-section, deemed to have occurred in Saorstát Eireann, the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  in case such workman has in such country already been awarded or entered into an agreement for the payment of compensation or damages in respect of such injury, <Col N="87" /> the employer shall not be liable under this Act in respect of such injury;</P>
    <P>(b)  in case such workman has been awarded or entered into an agreement under Part VI of this Act for the payment of compensation under this Act in respect of such injury and such workman subsequently in such country is awarded or enters into an agreement for the payment of compensation or damages in respect of such injury, the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the court shall on the application of the employer set aside the award or agreement for the payment of compensation under this Act and direct any moneys lodged in court in the matter and then standing to the credit of the workman to be paid out to the employer;</P>
    <P>(ii)  if any moneys have been paid by the employer to such workman in respect of compensation under this Act or any moneys have been previously paid to such workman out of moneys lodged in court in the matter, the court shall also make an order for the payment by such workman to the employer of such moneys.</P>
    <P>In the ordinary manner, when these amendments came from the Seanad, I intimated the intention of moving here that they be accepted by the Dáil. Since then, however, a judgment was given in the Supreme Court last week, which, in my opinion, removes the necessity for this amendment.  I propose now to ask the Dáil to disagree with the Seanad on that amendment. This amendment was designed to secure that where the worker was injured in an accident outside Saorstát Eireann and, at the date of the accident, employed under a contract of service made in Saorstát Eireann by an employer whose principal or only place of trade or business was in Saorstát Eireann, and where such worker was normally employed at the date of the accident, in connection with the employer's trade or business, such <Col N="88" /> worker should be entitled to get compensation in respect of that accident from the employer in the Saorstát. subject to certain provisions designed to prevent him getting double compensation in respect of the accident.  The Supreme Court of the Saorstát has now placed upon the section of the 1906 Act, which is precisely similar to Section 15 of this Bill, an interpretation different from that placed on the same section by the British courts.  The effect of the Supreme Court's decision is to make it clear that the workman employed under the conditions set out in the amendment, and meeting with an accident outside the Saorstát, is entitled to recover from his employer here compensation in respect of that accident.  Under these circumstances, I think that the best course is to rely on that decision of the Supreme Court and to delete this section.</P>
    <P>I contemplated, at one time, retaining the part dealing with double compensation, but I do not think it is necessary to do so, and there appears to be some case against it.  It is preferable, having regard to the interpretation now placed on it by the Supreme Court, to leave the Bill as it was originally introduced without this further section.  I do not know if that view is shared by Deputies opposite, but it is one that I have arrived at after some considerable consideration.</P>

There are certain other cases which the Chief Justice made it clear would not be covered by his decision and which might be the subject of action at a future date, but we decided that it should be left subject to the Supreme Court's decision&mdash;that is, where the contract was for services to be rendered entirely outside the Saorstát and other cases of that kind.  It is quite clear from the terms used in the judgment that the particular case covered by (a) (b) (c) and (d) of this amendment is also covered by the decision of the Supreme Court.</P>

    <P>The Courts of Justice Act provides that rules of court may be made to provide machinery for any Act passed by the Oireachtas.  The method of making rules under that Act is, however, slow and cumbersome.

It appears that there will be little saving of time if the making of rules is left to the Minister for Justice and it is thought better to adhere to the practice usually followed.

    <P>
      <Col N="93" /> I think that it is desirable that this section, which appears to have aroused considerable controversy, should be explained to the Dáil and, particularly, that the history of it should be stated.  When the Bill was before the Seanad in Committee, an amendment was put forward with the design that the doctor should be secured, out of the compensation payable to the workman, his fees, without limit, for attending on the workman.  The amendment was withdrawn at that stage and put down in slightly altered form for Report Stage, when another amendment was also tabled, designed to secure the doctor his fees without limit but the fees to be payable, this time, by the employer, in addition to the compensation payable under the Bill.  It was quite clear from the statements made by various Senators that one or other of the amendments would be inserted in the Bill.  I thought it desirable to have an amendment prepared which, if not entirely acceptable to either party, was, nevertheless, an attempt to meet them, while at the same time not imposing any undue burden upon either the workman or the employer. The amendment is, in fact, designed to secure that where fees are due to the doctor for attending an injured workman, up to the extent of £5, the doctor can recover these fees from the employer, while he takes his chance of recovering later the balance from the workman.  I put forward that amendment indicating to the Seanad that, in my opinion, it was preferable that the Bill should be left in the form in which it was introduced.  Perhaps, I should read the words I used in the Seanad on that occasion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As Senators are aware, I have not been at any time enthusiastic for the insertion in this Bill of any section with respect to the payment of fees due to doctors for attendance on a workman injured in the course of his employment.  I have felt that any statutory provision governing the payment of these fees would be bound to result in a general increase in the cost of <Col N="94" /> medical attention to such workman and that, therefore, the cost of workmen's compensation and the cost of insuring against employers' liability in respect of it would be increased.  As, however, there appears to be a substantial body of opinion in the House in favour of the insertion in the Bill of some section securing the payment of fees to doctors attending such workmen, I felt that it was desirable that a proposal, embodied in the form of an amendment to the Bill, should be submitted which would be to some extent half-way between that suggested by Senator Foran on the one hand and that suggested by Senator Sir Edward Coey Bigger on the other hand.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The amendment was carried.  Since the Bill left the Seanad, I have received a very large number of resolutions, adopted by chambers of commerce, the Federation of Irish Industries and other trade associations objecting to this amendment on the ground that it will considerably increase the cost of workmen's compensation insurance.  The statement was made&mdash;apparently it was inspired from one source, because it was made with consistent regularity by the various organisations&mdash;that the Bill was, in any event, going to necessitate a 15 per cent. increase in premiums and that this amendment would occasion a further 25 per cent. increase in premiums.  I cannot accept the view that the Bill, as it stood, would have necessitated a 15 per cent. increase in premiums, having regard to all the circumstances, or that the other amendment, by itself, would necessitate a 25 per cent. increase. Nevertheless it is quite clear that the amendment will occasion some increase in the cost of insuring against workmen's compensation liability.  The average amount paid to injured workmen is, on the whole, quite small&mdash; from £18 to £20 per case.  If, on top of these payments, there were to be an all-round charge of £5 per case, it would, of course, necessitate such an increase as was mentioned&mdash;25 per cent.  That, of course, is not likely to be the position.  On the other hand, <Col N="95" /> it is argued that the effect of the insertion in the Bill of a section such as this will be to encourage malingering, that the only check on malingering is the doctor and that, however high the principles of the profession be, the doctor's interests will now coincide with the interests of the worker if the worker is inclined to malinger, inasmuch as the doctor will have no inducement to terminate treatment until he has, at least, justified the £5 fee provided for in the section.  There were a number of other arguments of a similar kind, all designed to emphasise the fact that the adoption of this section would increase considerably the cost of workmen's compensation. On the other hand, it was argued on behalf of the doctors that very frequently, indeed, they did not get paid at all for treatment given to workmen injured in industrial accidents, and that it is not unreasonable that some provision should be made for them, either at the expense of the employer or the employee.</P>
    <P>In this Bill as now amended and codified it was argued there should be a definite provision to secure, at any rate, that reasonable fees to doctors should be provided for.  I have examined the legislation of other countries and I find the practice varies to a considerable extent.  In some cases there is provision somewhat similar to this, in others they have smaller fees. In other countries there is free treatment provided, sometimes subject to limitation of time and sometimes not. In other countries there is no provision at all.  It is very hard to find a basis of comparison between the practice in one country and another.  A number of countries have got a section in their Acts providing for payment of fees by the employer up to a certain amount.  In some cases the amount is smaller than £5.  In other cases, I think it is smaller, but I would not like to say with certainty without getting the rate of exchange worked out in detail.  The position, is, however, that very strong objection is taken to the section on the one hand and on the other it is advocated with great zeal by representatives of the medical profession <Col N="96" /> who, in this matter, claim that there should be the same provision for them as is made for the lawyers' fees as Deputies are aware in another section.  The reason for that section relating to lawyers is entirely different to the reason given by persons who advocate on behalf of the doctors the insertion of this section.</P>
    <P>I am disposed to leave the matter to the Dáil to be decided on its merits. An amendment, which is in the name of Deputy Briscoe, proposing to reduce the fee from £5 to £2 is one that might be considered.  I know that some of the doctors consider that if that amendment were accepted, it would be preferable that the whole section should be deleted.  I do not know whether they press that argument very strongly but it was made.  It is quite possible that reasonable fees to doctors might not amount to £5, and it is true that there might be a tendency to prolong the treatment so as to justify the claim to a fee of £5.  On the other hand, there would be a number of cases where even £5 would be very inadequate remuneration to the doctor for service rendered.  At the present time the doctor, in a number of cases, does not get paid any fee, but in relation to his claim now he would have the same right as any other person to whom an injured person owes money. Under this section he will be secured his fee of £5.  He would have the same remedy if the £5 is reduced to £2.  He will be able to sue for the £2 and to recover that sum.  The whole matter is one upon which I would like the Dáil to express its decision.  There are many sides to the arguments.  I shall formally recommend the adoption of the section.  Though not enthusiastic I am still of opinion that it would be better if the Bill were left in its original form.  This amendment was brought forward in the Seanad in preference to other amendments.  As the other amendments were withdrawn I could not withdraw this amendment because if I did so it might be regarded as a breach of faith by Senators who withdrew their amendments because this was to be introduced.  Despite the speech I then made, it was adopted in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 18a to amendment 18:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In the proposed new section to delete the word &ldquo;five&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;two.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the main the statement made by the Minister on this section and the proposed amendment agrees with the representations made to me from various places, and the particular sense in which the amendment was introduced.  There is one point I would like to stress, which I think the Minister did not stress, and which reduces the matter to a very small proportion. This particular amendment deals exclusively with cases that come to court.  It does not deal, at all, with cases that do not come to court in the ordinary way.  As Deputies are aware, the majority of workmen's claims for compensation do not come to court. It is only in a few instances that they come into court.  I think those who have any knowledge of the liability of employers for insurance will agree that in one instance employers' liability is a charge upon industry and business. It is to be increased because of this Workmen's Compensation Bill.  They generally admit that the average payment by the insurance companies arising out of workmen's compensation claims is a very small amount, still the amount of £5 would have to be calculated by these insurance companies. As far as I understand this is not to be merely an increase of five per cent. The employers might find themselves with their insurance premiums very greatly increased for a few years until the insurance companies were able to <Col N="98" /> say: &ldquo;We now have had experience over a number of years and the sums that have to be paid to the doctors make the necessary increase so much.&rdquo; On the one hand, that only concerns cases that come into court.  The doctors argue, &ldquo;Why should you attempt to limit our fees?&rdquo;  Several doctors spoke to me on the subject and some of them are rather abusive about the matter.  They say this is the only chance we have to get our fees.  They argue the case of a major injury, because it is only those cases that come into court.  It is only cases where serious injuries arise that come into court and where the person is likely to be ill for a long time.  In these cases the doctor forgets that in industrial centres where major injuries arise the patient is taken off to hospital and does not come under the care of the ordinary practitioner at all.  In country districts, of course, it is quite different where accidents occur a long way from hospitals, and where the doctor may have to give serious attention to a major injury arising out of an accident.  On the one hand, you have to weigh up, in fairness, the amount of damage this amendment is going to do to doctors in obtaining their fees as against the imposition it is going to put on industry generally, and I do not think that one should be regarded as hostile in showing that it is not at all unfavourable to the doctor.  Because, remember the cases that come into court are very few and if the doctor comes into court he will certainly get his payment.  I have heard of doctors who objected to being subpoenaed to attend court because they only get a guinea for their attendance, whereas they might have attended fifty patients in the time they were attending the court.  However, that does not arise.  These are the points as far as I can judge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the fee for attendance at court is something entirely different from this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  I am saying that the representations made to me by persons representing the medical profession range chiefly about the loss of time that would be involved for them <Col N="99" /> in going to the court, the loss to themselves in not being able to attend to other work and also the small fee they would get in return for their attendance in court.  The doctors claimed that it was another imposition on them in addition to the reduction of the fee from £5 to £2.  I read the speeches on the Bill in the Seanad and the Minister argued there the position of the shopkeeper and other people. He said that it could be reasonably argued that if the doctor is entitled to protection to the full, so also is the chemist entitled to protection. The very first thing that would be required in conjunction with the doctor's attendance at an accident would be bandages or splints from the chemist's shop.  I do not want to delay the House on the matter and I should like to hear what the doctors have to say in regard to the proposal that the figure should be left at £5.  I do not know what the position would be if the section were deleted altogether, but from the statement the Minister made I do not think he is very decided one way or the other and I presume to hope that he will accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>I want again to draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Minister has quoted a figure of £18 per claim as the average.  The average that has been put to me is less than that and, as I pointed out before, if the average is less than £18 per case, fixing the maximum fee at £5 is going to be regarded by the insurance companies as a continued liability which would justify them in demanding a very heavy increase in the premiums to be paid by the employer.  As I have said also, the fixing of this fee only applies to cases that come to court and the number of cases that come to court is very small, but as against that the insurance companies are not going to agree to continue premiums at the old figure because they will say that they must cover themselves against the possibility of all cases going to court.</P>

      <P>I rise to oppose the amendment moved by Deputy Briscoe. I do so because the medical profession <Col N="100" /> refuses to be exploited for all time. Workmen's Compensation Acts up to the present have been parasitic on the charity of the medical profession.  It is because we object to that position, is because we are determined to force a way out and to put an end to that condition, that we oppose the amendment moved by Deputy Briscoe.  The original amendment which was inserted in the Seanad as a Government amendment did not by any means satisfy the profession but, at any rate, it was an acknowledgment of the right of the profession to be paid for work done.  The Federation of Irish Industries and the chambers of commerce now come along and they ask this House to believe that a fee of £5&mdash;and that fee the maximum fee which may be awarded&mdash;is an exorbitant fee and that it should be reduced.  Deputy Briscoe wants the House to reduce it to £2.  I should like to ask Deputy Briscoe, some of the members of the Chamber of Commerce or some of the members of the Federation of Irish Industries, how they would like to get up at one or two o'clock in the night, attend one of the big hospitals in the city, perform a major operation, and keep the patient under their charge for seven or eight months afterwards&mdash;a period for which an injured workman may be under the care of any surgeon attached to any hospital here in Dublin&mdash;and at the end of that time receive as their only fee £5, the only fee which they may recover under this Bill.  Deputy Briscoe wants the House to believe that £5 is an exorbitant fee and that £2 is enough for the surgeon in that case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce said that this £5 may be recovered from the employer or from the insurance company but that any balance due would have to be recovered from the injured workman.  I do not know if the Minister is aware of the fact that if a surgeon attached to a hospital attends a patient in the public ward of the hospital he cannot recover any fee from that patient.  In that way he is in a different category to the grocer, the butcher, or anyone else who may supply the injured workman <Col N="101" /> or his family with anything he may require.</P>

      <P>The insurance companies, Federation of Irish Industries and the chambers of commerce want us to believe that the acceptance of the amendment from the Seanad will lead to an increase in premiums to the extent of 25 per cent.  The increased premiums are based altogether on the assumption that every case will go to court and that in every case the judge will award a fee of £5.  That is to assume that every case will be a major accident and that every case will go to court.  Cases of the minor accidents will not trouble the courts at all.  It is only a very small percentage of the cases that will ever go to court and in very few cases will the maximum fee of £5 be awarded by the judge.  The judges, who have a long experience of the Workmen's Compensation Acts, will be able to assess the amount of the fee due in each particular case.  I venture to say that only in major cases will the fee of £5 be awarded at all.  As regards the case made by the insurance companies, that it would lead to an increase of 25 per cent. in premiums, I would be rather interested to know how they arrived at these figures.  When motoring insurance became compulsory in this country and when it meant an increase of business for the insurance companies, when, if anything, we should expect a reduction in premiums, the insurance companies increased premiums by 25 per cent. Perhaps they will do something <Col N="102" /> similar now.  There may be a slight increase in the premiums, but the fact that there will be a slight increase is no reason why the employers or insurance companies should expect free treatment from the medical profession for all time.  I do not think there is very much more to say.  Though we in the medical profession are not at all satisfied that the maximum fee of £5 is an adequate one, we recognise that it admits the principle that we should be paid for work done, and I ask the House with every confidence to reject Deputy Briscoe's amendment and to accept the amendment from the Seanad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertEDavitt" hpid="Dr. Davitt Dr. Davitt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Davitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Dr. O'Dowd in opposing Deputy Briscoe's amendment.  As he says, the medical profession have for a long time suffered in silence under the injustice which they felt was their lot in connection with the work they have to do, especially in regard to workmen's compensation cases.  Actually we felt that it called for criticism of ourselves that we had not moved before in the matter to see that we got justice.  To me it is rather an amazing thing that on the first occasion when doctors got together to say a word for themselves you immediately had the heavy guns of the Federation of Irish Industry appearing in the field and levelled at the unfortunate medical profession.  Of course, one must remember that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is a Minister for Industry and Commerce, and consequently is likely to be a little more interested by the Federation of Irish Industries than he would be by the medical profession.  I would earnestly appeal to him, however, to think a little bit more deeply before running away from his own amendment, so to speak.  The fact of the matter is that extra work is thrown on doctors as a result of injury arising out of an industry which is run for profit by employers.  The treatment of the injured workman is of benefit to the workman, first of all because it makes him better sooner, or it is directed to make him better more quickly than if he were not treated.  It is of value to the employer because it replaces at an <Col N="103" /> earlier date the workman who is trained, and prevents the possibility of the employer being forced to employ a new man who is not so well trained. It makes the workman fit for his work in a shorter space of time.  It is of value to the insurance company inasmuch as the treatment shortens the time during which the workman will be out of work, and consequently lessens the amount of money payable by the insurance company.  The argument has been made that if this section is accepted or passed by the Dáil, malingering will result, and that that malingering will be aided by the doctor who is attending the injured workman.  That is an argument, of course, which you could apply to the doctor attending any private patient. All he has to do is to give the patient some medicine to make him worse instead of better, so that he can continue his visits and increase his fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertEDavitt" hpid="Dr. Davitt Dr. Davitt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Davitt</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Norton says, the doctor could do that in any case. That is a silly argument.  Why should professional men suddenly, as a result of the acceptance of this section, turn into criminals, because that is what it amounts to?  If there are some doctors who, by prolonging the illness of or their visits to private patients&mdash;I dare say there are some; as somebody said there are black sheep in every family&mdash;in the hope of getting more fees, they are not any more likely to do it in the case of an injured workman simply because this section is passed by the Dáil. Employers have rather a wrong idea of doctors as regards workmen's compensation cases.  Very often a workman's compensation case entails much more trouble for a doctor than an equally serious form of illness which is not due to an accident.  You have conversations with solicitors, consultations with barristers and visits to court.  Altogether they can be described as a definite nuisance.  I am not referring to the actual treatment of the patient; from that point of view no doctor would ever say that <Col N="104" /> a case is a nuisance, because if he has any interest in his profession he is as keen on seeing a workman brought right as he is on seeing a millionaire brought right, but there is more work actually associated with the treatment of an injured workman than there is with the treatment of an illness of similar severity not due to an accident.</P>
      <P>The experience of doctors in the past shows that employers are not by any means free from blame in certain respects in connection with workmen who are injured.  Anybody who has been resident house surgeon in an hospital will know the devious ways and means which employers adopt to get certificates for their own use by sending a workman to a doctor for treatment.  You have a workman who is injured attending the hospital, and when he is going away he says: &ldquo;Doctor, give me a certificate to say I was attending here to-day, how long I will be laid up and whether I am able to work or not.&rdquo;  That certificate most likely has been requested by the employer, but he has sent the employee as an intermediary to the doctor, knowing that in the long run he will get the certificate in that indirect way and will not have to pay for it, although he is, to a large extent, getting the benefit of the certificate.  That undoubtedly has happened and is happening still.  Though employers may bring a charge of malingering against the doctors&mdash;that it might happen&mdash;I can definitely bring the charge against the employers that they have gone to rather mean ways of getting certificates for nothing to help them in workmen's compensation cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the Federation of Industries, and their opposition to this long-delayed half loaf of bread, what would happen, I wonder, if the doctors formed an association, or if the doctors passed a resolution refusing to attend any workman who was injured?  It would be looked upon as a horrible position and as very discreditable to the profession.  Let us hope they will not be driven to any such action.  If a machine&mdash;and I think this argument was used in the <Col N="105" /> Seanad&mdash;is damaged in a factory a fitter is sent to repair it.  Whether or not the fitter is actually employed regularly in the factory a fitter receives money to repair the machine. That costs the employer something, either directly or indirectly.  Why should the employer not pay for the treatment and repair of the human machine&mdash;that is, the workman?  He should be even more ready to do that, because the workman is far more important than the machine.  It has already been pointed out that other professional men, solicitors, counsel and so on, are paid in those cases. One does not see why the most important man, the doctor who puts the injured man right, should not be paid as well as the solicitor who simply makes a case for him in court. Deputy Briscoe said that a very small percentage of those cases come to court, and also that some of them do not go to private doctors for treatment, but are sent to hospital.  He apparently considers that once a case gets to hospital it is finished with&mdash; that all the doctors in the hospitals are such plutocrats that they do not need to be paid at all.</P>
    <P>I should like to state the position of hospital doctors quite clearly, because I have come to the conclusion that a large number of the people in the country do not realise what it is.  I know that even patients who come into hospital do not realise what is the average position of the doctors on the staff of the Dublin hospitals.  Doctors&mdash;be they surgeons or physicians, or ear, throat and nose men, or gynecologists&mdash;on the staff of the voluntary hospitals in Dublin are absolutely underpaid.  They get no salary whatsoever and all the work they do in attending the hospital is absolutely free, except for an odd fee they may get by agreement from a patient, who, although in a public ward and not compelled to pay a fee, offers to do so.  A small income of that kind accrues to the surgeons especially in public hospitals in Dublin.  They are not legally entitled to it but they do get a certain amount out of the public wards in that way.</P>
    <P>So far as the physicians are concerned, <Col N="106" /> I am sorry to say&mdash;and Deputy Dr. Rowlette will agree with me&mdash;very little accrues in that way.  In any case, a surgeon or physician is not entitled &mdash;that is, so far as I know; I speak subject to correction&mdash;to claim fees for treating cases in the public wards of an hospital.  That does not say that he is not morally entitled to a fee. Then, you may have the case of a patient attending the out-patients' department of a public hospital although not actually in a ward.  A doctor is not entitled to claim a fee from such a patient but if this section passes, I assume that it will not preclude him from claiming a fee from the employer.</P>
    <P>The argument that only a small percentage of cases come to court, which Deputy Briscoe stressed two or three times, is, in my opinion, one of the strongest arguments in favour of the doctor because if only a small percentage of cases comes to court&mdash;and it is only in cases that come to court that judgment is allowed to be entered for the maximum fee of £5&mdash;it is obvious that the amount of money which would be levelled against the employers in general will be very small.  From our point of view, this Bill does not go far enough at all.  Doctors will still be faced with the difficulty of trying to collect fees from the majority&mdash;about 80 per cent.&mdash;of workmen whose cases do not go into court.  It is a well known fact that although doctors are entitled by law to collect fees from a workman, it is never done.  I think I would be right in saying that it is never done.  It is not necessary to go into why it should not be done.  It would not make the doctor very popular&mdash;I will put it that way and leave it at that.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that if special provision is made for the doctor, there is no reason why special provision should not be made for the butcher, the baker and the candlestick maker but there is a great difference between them.  The bills of the butcher and the baker and traders generally are examples of expenditure recurring from week to week, month to month, year to year and from decade to decade, whereas, in the case of a doctor, the liability is <Col N="107" /> only occasional and contingent on an accident.  That makes a great difference. The food shops such as butchers' and bakers' shops do, in the average, get paid.  You may be quite sure of that.  They get their money eventually and they get it much more quickly than the doctor will get it even in the case of private patients.  The Minister said that he had looked up the legislation in other countries to see if any similar provision was made and he stated that in some countries, similar provision was made but that the amount was small.  I think that one has to take into consideration the conditions under which doctors work in other countries.  Take even the case of the Six Counties.  You have a panel system there similar to the panel system in England and contributions to the medical charities under the Medical Charities Act which allow an income to a doctor which is non-existent in the Free State.  I think I am correct in saying that.</P>
    <P>The main objection by the Employers' Federation is that this will send up the insurance premiums.  It seems to me that this whole country is soon to be under the foot of insurance companies.  If one looks at the dividends paid by insurance companies, one will see that they are not such poor bodies by any means but whenever any legislation is brought in which affects them, they say that they are going not only not to suffer from that legislation but are going to gain a great deal from it.  That is probably what is feared by the employers in this connection but if the insurance companies are greedy, it is no reason why doctors should continue to suffer by reason of a long-existent grievance which is not rectified and any attempt to rectify which is opposed by the employers in this instance.  The employers cannot object to the payment of a doctor on principle because they have admitted their liability to pay by the establishment of dressing stations in several industries and in some cases, actually the employment of a half-time medical man who is paid a regular salary in the year.  I can quote several instances of that here in Dublin.  The medical <Col N="108" /> man is paid a regular salary in the year by an industry, factory or business house and in addition, there are one, two, three or four nurses and a dressing station, all at the employers' expense.  If they do that&mdash;and it has been done long before this amendment came before the House&mdash;they have admitted the fact that the employer is liable for payment for medical attention to his workman so that the principle in any case is admitted.  It is, of course, mainly in the case of big industries that that is done.</P>
    <P>It has been calculated that the total amount of premiums in respect of workmen's compensation is £8 a year for a wage bill of £500 a year.  That was stated in the Seanad and £8 a year is not a very large amount for a wage bill of £500.  If the wage bill was £5,000, I suppose the premiums would be £80 and that would be a large amount but on the other hand what is that to big factories in which a doctor is sometimes paid a salary of £200, £250, or £300 a year and in which nurses are employed and a dressing station is maintained?  I do not see any reason why the premiums should rise as high as has been suggested.  If they do, it merely shows the stranglehold that insurance companies have in this country.  It practically means that they have a monopoly.  They have a monopoly of business in certain directions&mdash;in respect to the Traffic Act, for instance&mdash;but the increase of premiums there, as was mentioned by Deputy O'Dowd, is far more than it should be and, most people think, excessive.  The companies do not seem to realise that what they will lose on the swings, they will make up on the roundabouts, so far as the Traffic Act is concerned, at any rate.  I admit that they will not make up much of this but I do believe that insurance companies are inclined to act in too high-handed a fashion altogether.  Anybody who has dealt with them in the matter of reports of cases will know that a great many of them, at least, always try to get a lot of information for a very small fee.</P>
    <P>I have very little more to say on this except again to object to the charge which the Minister says that the bold, bad employer has made, that the doctors would enter into a conspiracy <Col N="109" /> with workmen to compel the workmen to malinger so that they would get their maximum fee of £5 &mdash;their maximum fee, remember. The judge in charge of trying a case of this kind will know perfectly well that this objection has been brought by employers, and it is very unlikely that the maximum fee will be regarded in every case at all.  The doctor has enough trouble as it is in workmen's compensation cases, and if he is going to enter into a conspiracy, driving cases into court, he is likely to gain the enormous maximum fee of £5.  If he thinks it worth while to go to all that trouble for £5 I think you will find that there are very many of them whom it would not pay to do so.  At any rate, I resent that charge very much and I am sure every member of the medical profession will resent it. It is hardly what I would expect from the Federation of Irish Industries. This opposition which they have shown to right and justice is very unworthy and very undignified.</P>

      <P>There is agreement between Deputy Briscoe and the Seanad that provision should be made for the payment of expenses to medical practitioners.  There is just this difference between Deputy Briscoe and the Seanad, that whereas the Seanad wanted to make the maximum fee £5, the Deputy makes it £2.  Therefore, I take it that the Deputy accepts the principle that a medical practitioner who attends a workman should be paid. He thinks a medical practitioner should get £2 maximum fee, whereas the Seanad thinks the maximum ought to be £5.  Deputy Briscoe is strangely vague about the reasons which induced him to take the view that £2 is the maximum which should be awarded to the medical practitioner.  The Deputy did not give us any evidence to show that £2 is a reasonable fee.  Neither did he subject the Seanad amendment to any kind of examination which would show that £5 was an unreasonable sum.  At one time Deputy Briscoe told us that in order to recover this sum of £5 as his maximum the medical officer would have to go into court <Col N="110" /> and sue there for the payment of his compensation.  The Deputy mentioned that many doctors would resent having to go to court.</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation or correction, I want to say that what I said was that the doctors, in making representations to me, put up the argument that they did not like the idea of going into court because they had to spend the whole day there and sometimes two days, and that they only got a very small fee, a fee of a guinea, which was a loss to them from the point of view of their ordinary patients.  I only made that statement to inform the House of the facts the doctors told me.  They did not like the idea of going to court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know who the doctors were who interviewed Deputy Briscoe, but judging by the representations made by the Medical Association the official view of that body is that the doctor ought to be paid for his services.  Presumably, from the speeches delivered by Deputies O'Dowd and Davitt, the doctors are quite satisfied to be paid in the manner set out in the Seanad amendment.  Whatever difficulty there may be in respect of a doctor going to court and getting compensation as set out in this section, Deputy Briscoe does not remove the disability in that direction by giving the doctor £2 instead of £5.  If there is any hardship in having the doctor going to court to seek his compensation that hardship will be accentuated if Deputy Briscoe's amendment is carried because he will only get £2 for going to court no matter what services he has rendered to the workman. That is what will happen if the amendment is carried whereas under the Seanad amendment he will get £5, if he can satisfy the court that he is entitled to it.  But if he can satisfy the court that a fair claim for his attendances on the patient would be £50, the court can only award the doctor £5.  I would like to know on what grounds Deputy Briscoe thinks <Col N="111" /> that £2 should be the maximum the doctor should be paid for his services. The injured workman may have been in the hands of the doctor for a long period and £2 may hardly represent the value of his work or services to that patient for one day or one week. But Deputy Briscoe wants to make sure that if the doctor has attended that patient for a year he is still only to get £2.  I wonder in whom is Deputy Briscoe interested.  It was clear from his speech that he was interested in the chambers of commerce and Employers' Associations. These bodies set up quite an insincere squeal over this.  Remember you have employers in industry for gain not for charity at all.  The group of Irish industries are in business to make profits.  They say they should be paid for the goods and services they supply themselves.  Deputy Briscoe comes in here and, speaking in unison with that body, says &ldquo;by all means pay us for our goods and services for our respective businesses, but do not pay the doctors who attend to our injured workmen.&rdquo;  I cannot understand that point of view at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, as Deputy Dr. Davitt says, the employers should be very glad to pay the doctor for attending to the injured workman, because the fact that the doctor can be got to attend the workman means, in the long run, a reduction in the liability of the employer.  The speedy attention which the doctor gives the workman results in that workman being able to resume his work in a shorter period than if there had not been the assistance of the doctor.  Anything that mitigates the sufferings of the workman and enables him to resume his work earlier is a saving to the employer.  Now Deputy Briscoe wants to ensure that if the doctor is to be paid at all he is to be paid only £2 in respect of his services.  That is an unfair amendment. In fact, the Seanad amendment cannot be said to err on the side of generosity.  Deputy Briscoe said it was only on coming into court that this fee should be paid.  That is true, but it furnishes an answer to the arguments of the insurance companies <Col N="112" /> that it would be necessary to increase the premiums paid to the insurance companies if the compensation suggested for the doctor is going to be paid.  But that will only be paid in certain cases coming into court.  Is it not perfectly clear that an increase in the premiums is not rendered necessary by this amendment?  Deputy Briscoe says that very few cases relatively will come before the court and, consequently, very little compensation will be paid to the medical practitioners through the court.  If that is so, the insertion of this amendment does not furnish the insurance companies with an excuse for raising the premiums to any great extent.  Even if it were necessary that the premiums should go up, that would be no argument against the payment.  Deputy Briscoe surely does not suggest that the premiums should be kept down to their present level so as to insure that the doctors should be kept down?  He does not make that suggestion. Nobody suggests that the premiums should be kept artificially low because of the fact that they consider the doctor should be deprived of his compensation, or that he should be deprived of his compensation, lest the premiums should go up.  I think an employer ought to be glad to pay for medical attendance on an injured workman, because it is in his own interest.  It gives him back an efficient workman in a speedy manner and, perhaps, prevents his being liable for a greater sum in compensation than he would otherwise be.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe asked: &ldquo;Why not include the chemist in the scope of this amendment?&rdquo;  There might be a very good case for including the chemist and an amendment by Deputy Briscoe to include the chemist would be very much more understandable than an amendment to reduce the fee of the doctor.  If, in a case of accident, a chemist on the spur of the moment has to hand out some medical requisites, why should he not be paid? It is a special kind of contract associated with misfortune and the chemist has as good a right to be paid in the matter as the doctor.  I would support Deputy Briscoe if his amendment were <Col N="113" /> to include the chemist instead of reducing the doctor's fee and making no provision for the chemist.  I think the Seanad amendment is a reasonable one.  It will not compensate doctors for all the skilled attention they give injured workmen, because they will be only able to recover their fee in this manner in a limited number of cases.  The amendment, however, does give some State recognition to the fact that the doctor is entitled to be paid. Human nature being what it is, even doctors ought to be glad that the State has now seen fit to give that kind of recognition.  I think there is a very good case for the Seanad amendment and no case at all for Deputy Briscoe's attempt to whittle down the amendment by prescribing a maximum of £2 for the doctor.  The Deputy would be well-advised to withdraw his amendment and vote for the Seanad amendment.</P>

      <P>Whether it is in the Bill or whether it is not, I want to oppose Deputy Briscoe's amendment and support the Seanad amendment. It is not as one member of what, I am sure, Deputy Norton regards as a rapacious profession supporting a member of another rapacious profession that I am opposing this amendment. I oppose it entirely from the point of view of the workman and from a point of view that I think has not been put so far in this debate. Deputy Doctor Davitt and Deputy Doctor O'Dowd put their case really on the principle that the labourer is worthy of his hire.  I should like to put it on the basis that the workman is entitled to the best medical attention he can get and that the person who gives him that is at least entitled to fair remuneration, if not full remuneration, for the work he has done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody who has had experience of conducting workmen's compensation <Col N="114" /> cases in court knows that you have this particular position occurring in all these cases fought out in court&mdash; that usually there appears for the workman a doctor&mdash;I am not casting aspersions on the people who give their services to workmen when I say this&mdash;who is not as eminent in his profession as the doctor who appears on behalf of the insurance company.  The insurance companies have at their service the most eminent surgeons and physicians in Dublin who appear for them in court opposing the workmen's claims and give expert evidence of an eminent nature which will impress the court, or which they think will be likely to impress the court by reason of the eminence of the physician or surgeon who gives it.  The eminent physician or surgeon is available for the insurance companies at a comparatively moderate fee, because he has a standing retainer, and the result is that the insurance companies are able to bring down the heaviest weights in the medical or surgical profession in Dublin against the comparatively obscure physicians or surgeons who appear for the workman.  I do not say that it does affect the minds of the court, but you have this position &mdash;that most medical men would do anything to avoid attending people where the result of their attention on these people will eventually land them into giving evidence.  It is the experience of everybody that no medical man or surgeon is any way desirous of giving evidence in court even at a fairly remunerative fee.  When it is a matter of giving evidence in a workman's compensation case, every medical man, no matter how hard up he is, will do his best to avoid appearing in court, because it means hanging around the court for at least an entire day at a fee that does not pay him, apart from the inconvenience he is put to in attending court.</P>
    <P>The real reason why I say that this amendment of Deputy Briscoe's is a mean amendment is that it is cutting down the remuneration of the comparatively obscure physician or surgeon who comes into court and rendering it less likely that anybody will be willing to give his services in court on behalf <Col N="115" /> of the workman in a situation where the people on the opposite side have at their disposal the most expert, eminent medical and surgical opinion to be produced in court to outweigh any evidence given on behalf of the workman. I think there is nothing to be said for Deputy Briscoe's amendment. I think the Seanad amendment providing merely for a fee of £5 is a very reasonable one.  I think a fee of £5 is very small for the doctor.  The fee of £2 proposed by Deputy Briscoe is ridiculous, in my opinion.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, even if the section put in by the Seanad remains in the Bill I do not think any doctor, or very few of them at any rate, will get anything at all.  First of all, it is in the discretion of the judge how much they will get.  Secondly, it would appear, on the face of the section itself, that the doctors will have to employ a solicitor to apply for the £5 for them.  They will, at all events, have to attend in court in cases where they might not have to attend in order to get the remuneration.  They are supposed to make application there and then when, perhaps, they would have no notice whatever that the case was coming on.  I do not think that the insurance companies have any justification for increasing the premium. They may use this as an excuse for increasing the premium but they will have no justification for it.  In point of fact, I think it will probably assist the insurance companies in dealing more quickly and in a better way with cases that might ordinarily come into court.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton referred to the fact that industrialists were primarily concerned in this matter. The Deputy seems to forget that everyone, whether in industry or in a private capacity, if he is wise and has any interests in the persons he employs has an employer's liability policy.  I am not anxious to press the amendment. I would prefer to see all the Seanad amendments out of the Bill and things left as they were.  The doctors are making the case that they should get a fee of £5 out of the very few cases that go to court.  In 95 per cent. of the cases, and probably in all cases of accidents to workmen the doctors attend the patients in the ordinary way.  Probably in 90 per cent. of the cases they do not get paid at all.  They do the work voluntarily and I say every credit to them.  If they were to argue that they were to be covered in every case in which a workman is injured, I could understand the position.  I cannot understand it if they press for a minimum fee or for a maximum fee to be fixed in the few cases that go to court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From inquiries I made I am satisfied that insurance companies are going to penalise very heavily people who take out employers' liability policies.  The argument is that what they will exact in the first few years will be out of all proportion to the number of cases met by this proposal. I do not know how £18 was given as the average amount paid by insurance companies in these cases.  I was given to understand that the amount was somewhere in the region of £5.  On making a calculation I feel that the companies would argue that they were entitled to at least 25 per cent. of an increase.  I do not know what the exact increase in premiums will be. The premiums for motor-car insurance have already been increased.  We will <Col N="117" /> have to wait to see what the experience of the companies will be, and what will be the average payment, to know whether they will increase or decrease premiums.  As far as I can see any increase made will remain, because competition is no longer what it was, insurance now being more or less compulsory for everything.  If the premiums go up they will not go up against the Federation of Industries in which I am not interested, but against every employer, including doctors, and for every domestic servant. It will apply all round.  As this only applies to a small number of cases, I say that the doctor is not going to lose much in the turnover, because in 95 per cent. of the cases the workman pays, so there is no grievance on the part of the doctor that he has not been paid.  I am concerned mainly about the extra imposition on persons who took out policies, because it is going to be out of all proportion to the £5.  I hoped by making the amount £2 I was going to reduce the increase that will accrue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to start by saying that in the contest that has risen, apparently between sympathy with the medical practitioner&mdash;whether it is right or not&mdash;who does not in fact sue for fees, and appreciation of the insurance companies' point of view, that I am all for the amendment.  But I say that with reservations.  The whole point of Deputy Briscoe's amendment is to reduce the £5 maximum to £2 maximum, irrespective of what type of case, what kind of accident, or what amount of care and consideration a medical man gave to a case.  That is quite fair!!  I want to point out one or two things that were not stressed.  The first was made in detail in the Seanad, that the £5 maximum applies in relation to each and every doctor on the job at a particular accident.  If there happened to be an amazing accident, in which five medical practitioners were concerned, they might get £25 in all, or a maximum of £5 each.  It is admitted that that would be the position. The second point was made clear, and was stressed by Deputy Norton in answer to Deputy Briscoe, the question <Col N="118" /> of the medical man's fees for attendance in court.  That does not come into it.  That is not dealt with. That is not the £5 referred to, and it will have no relation to the matter. Whether he gets fees for attending in court will be determined as it is determined now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I misunderstood the Deputy.  As to Deputy O'Dowd's point, a man who has gone into the public ward of an hospital, where no charge is permissible, as far as I can read this, fees will not be due and consequently will not be covered by the £5.  The point raised as to statistics, the number of cases that go to court, and the number settled, whatever else happens if this amendment goes through, will have no relation to the facts afterwards.  I am in some doubt as to the meaning of the Deputy's amendment, but I am going to put forward this construction to see if it is right or not.  I find that the only way a doctor could get the £5 maximum is by a court order, and that court order can only be made on the application of the medical practitioner on the making of the court order.  So, in order to get £5, the medical man must force the case into court.  I take up paragraph (d) of the amendment (paragraph read).  If Deputies turn to Part 6 of the Bill they will see that that is quite good and that arrangements are made for registering by the court registrar without the order of the court, where, say, weekly payments are contested and about which no statutory objections are taken.  It seems to me, unless in cases of compulsory awards, sums up to £5 can never come in and the only way the medical man can get the fee is by attending and getting an order of the court made on his application when the payment of the £5 will follow.  Deputy Costello pointed out that that entails for the future an appearance on behalf of the medical man to make the application to have a sum of money fixed as payment for fees due.  I think this view should be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="119" /> I am in favour of trying to get payment for medical men, but whether that payment should be the subject of the maximum of the flat rate is another matter.  I am certainly against this proposal which seems to suggest that in order to get payment cases must be forced into court, even if it is for the purpose of having registration effected subject to some ad hoc objection to registration.  That would mean, and I think it was commented on in the Seanad, that while 80 per cent. of the cases are settled without court intervention, they will not now be in future.  I want to view that from another angle.  If all cases have to be brought to court, even to get fees for doctors, some solicitor or barrister will have to be briefed.  The cases would go to court in any event, but instead of having them registered in an easy way, if they are made the subject of litigation, which involves some expense, there is no doubt premiums are going to go up.</P>
    <P>On that then there was a difference of opinion.  I read that in the Seanad debates the Minister said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The average payment in respect of workmen's compensation for six industrial groups, excluding agriculture, in 1930 was £22 10s.  The average payment in respect of agricultural workers injured was only £13 11s.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister used the phrase &ldquo;average payment.&rdquo;  I take it that included contested and non-contested cases.  A Senator who followed on that said that he had been informed&mdash;I do not think his statement was queried very much in the Seanad &mdash;that the provisions in the Bill for a £5 maximum were likely to add 15 per cent. to the cost of insurance in this country, and would likely raise premiums by that amount.  The Senator who made that assertion also asserted that the £5 maximum would necessitate, as he put it, the bringing of cases into court and would add a further 20 or 25 per cent.  I do not know whether that 20 or 25 per cent., used in conmotation with the word &ldquo;further,&rdquo;<Col N="120" /> meant that it was to be added to the 15 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator meant that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then it means that, according to his contention, insurance is going to be raised by 35 or 40 per cent.  That, taken into consideration with the particular points I have been stressing, means that possibly all cases hereafter will be brought into court. While I am not against the medical man getting his reward I think some better system than that proposed ought to be arranged.  Instead could there not be some arrangement like this: that the doctor might indent the court register for his payment and in some way get rough and ready satisfaction without having to go to court?  I do not see why we should go to all the extravagance in regard to what is accepted both here and in the Seanad: that the medical man would be secured the payment of his fee.  I would urge that this matter should be further considered. There is definite agreement that the medical man should get payment and that it should not come from the compensation awarded the workman. These are the two points of principle that were decided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe raises the matter of an overriding maximum rate; that it should be reduced from £5 to £2.  It seems to me that a better line of country to follow would be this: there are minor accidents which happen, arising out of employment.  Generally the people who suffer from these are taken right away to the public wards in public hospitals.  There they get treatment.  Possibly if another division of the work were made medical practitioners would not object even to having their wards to a certain degree more crowded than they used to be by reason of these people being admitted.  Supposing that this payment to the doctor were to be measured by some association with the sum afterwards awarded which, of course, will have a bearing on the type of accident&mdash;the accident will have its result in either temporary or permanent incapacity and will have its result finally in the amount which the <Col N="121" /> court will award&mdash;I have the feeling, remembering all the time that I speak subject to the correction of more experienced Deputies on the medical side, that it would be a far better thing to have it that the payment granted to the medical man should bear a relation to the amount of money awarded.  That would be getting back to the type of accident itself, and, therefore, to the care and trouble that the medical man was put to in his attendance on the case.</P>
    <P>I think the amendment, as it has come before the House, is not in the best form.  It was a compromise amendment in the Seanad.  The matter was first raised on the Committee Stage.  There were three disagreeing amendments, and these were reconciled to a certain extent by this amendment which was produced by the Minister, but not, I think, with any great enthusiasm on his part.  It might be well if this could be left over to see if there could not be a better wording found to carry out at any rate the two principles which have, in the main, been agreed upon: payment to the medical man being made compulsory, and that the payment should not come out of the award made to the injured man.  I support both principles.</P>

      <P>The suggestion has been made that the consideration of this amendment from the Seanad might be adjourned, so as to give Deputies an opportunity of considering possible improvements on it that have been suggested here in <Col N="122" /> the form of alternatives.  I am quite open to adopt that course.  This Bill has not been rushed at any time, and I have no desire to rush it now.  If there are any Deputies who think that they can produce an amendment more acceptable than the one on the Order Paper I am quite prepared to give them adequate time and opportunity for doing so.  It is quite clear that this amendment from the Seanad does not, on the one hand, accomplish all that the doctor-Deputies want to have accomplished.  Deputy McGilligan made it clear that this amendment, as it stands, does not provide for the elimination of all the injustices that certain doctor-Deputies have waxed eloquent about.  On the other hand, the contention that it is going to increase insurance premiums by 25 per cent. is preposterous.  It could not possibly do that unless the insurance companies are going to make insurance doubly sure by the most flagrant profiteering on the strength of the insertion of this amendment.  If, in fact, the increases which have been mentioned in the various resolutions adopted by chambers of commerce and other bodies took place in the cost of workmen's compensation insurance in consequence of the passage of this measure, there would be a very serious situation which would have to be dealt with, because I do not think there is anything in the Bill, even if the amendment were inserted, which would justify such increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that, first of all, doctors do not get paid for attendance given to workers in the public wards of public hospitals and they are not going to get paid in consequence of the passing of this amendment.  If there is any suggestion that the law in that respect should be changed then that has got to be done in some Bill other than this.  This Bill merely seeks to provide for the payment to a doctor of the fees due to him.  Although certain doctor-Deputies talked about doctors being called out of their beds in the middle of the night to undertake major operations which involve continuous attention on their part over a number of months, the average case is not that kind at all, but rather a <Col N="123" /> sprained thumb, a cut wrist, or some other minor accident which keeps a workman out of employment for two or three weeks.  It is quite clear that the average case must be something of that nature, having regard to the average compensation paid, and no matter how a doctor may try he will find it very hard to justify a claim for £5 in consequence of the attention given to workers injured in that way.</P>
    <P>It has been argued, and argued with some force, that the insertion of any such section is going to bring more cases to court and is going to result in a fewer number of voluntary agreements. I cannot see any alternative. It was generally agreed by the representatives of the various medical associations which I met, and by those who spoke in the Seanad in support of some such amendment as this, that it would be hard to make any provision for any cases except those that come before the court, either where the amount was fixed by the court or where an agreement was registered by order of the court, and an agreement is only registered by order of the court in a case where there is some objection to the agreement.  Otherwise, it is registered by the court registrar. Where it is registered by the court registrar without reference to the court, or where there is no agreement, and where the statutory compensation is paid without question, then the doctor's position is in no way changed except in so far as his moral position, so to speak, in claiming his fee may be slightly improved by knowledge of the fact that this section has been inserted in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Personally, I cannot see what improvement in the section can be made.  However, if Deputies feel that they would like to try their hand at making an improvement, I am quite willing to give them time to do so. I do not think we could take the risk of adopting provisions which, because they are likely to be acceptable to the workers and to the doctors, might necessitate a serious increase in the cost of insurance.  We have got to bear in mind that the cost of insurance is a matter of great importance.  It is of <Col N="124" /> importance, not merely to the employer who has got to pay it, but also, I think, to those who speak in the interests of labour, because any substantial increase in the cost of insurance is going to mean lesser insurance in cases of this kind and is going to mean, in consequence, that a larger number of workers will find themselves in the position of being unable to get compensation when they are injured because of the employers' inability to pay.  There is also the fact that the burden imposed on trade and industry by any substantial increase in premiums would be bound to have its effect indirectly on employment. On that account, I think we should be very slow to adopt any measure which would necessitate an increase in premiums, even though we would have to go very far to necessitate an increase in premiums of the dimensions suggested by certain organisations and insurance company representatives.  As I said before, I am putting this amendment to the Dáil without any enthusiasm.  I think that a strong case can be made for leaving the Bill as it stands and letting the position remain in this country as it is in Great Britain and in a very large number of countries where workmen's compensation laws are in operation.</P>
    <P>There is a case for keeping the maximum fee, to be provided under this section, down considerably.  Deputies have spoken as if the proposal here is to pay the doctor a maximum of £2 or £5 in all cases.  That is not so at all.  What is proposed here is that, to that amount, he is to be secured his fee at the expense of the employer; but he still has every legal remedy that is already open to him to secure the balance of the fee, if any, from the worker.  It may be that doctors find their fees inadequate in cases of this kind.  That, however, is something that cannot be rectified in respect of this particular Bill, because it must apply in other matters as well, and is, no doubt, the subject of grave consideration by the members of the profession. I am prepared to leave the matter over to another date with a view to seeing what amendments will be produced, but if Deputies do not <Col N="125" /> think that they can produce acceptable amendments, then these can go to a free vote of the House, in which each Deputy will be free to vote in accordance with his own views, irrespective of his Party affiliations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two facts that I should like to impress on the House in considering this matter. Workmen's compensation insurance is a very important charge on industry, and a charge that, for many years, has been increasing annually, so that it has now become what is to many a considerable burden.  Accordingly, I think we should be slow, if we are anxious to encourage industry, to add further burdens to it.  Every person who is in industry must insure.  There was no reason at all for the insurance companies to have informed us of what their charges would be.  In fact, I think, after hearing the debate, they ought to be inclined to feel that it would have been better for them to have held their tongues until the Act was passed and then to increase the charges to meet the liabilities.  They have warned us beforehand what the charges will be if this Act is passed, and I think that for that information we should thank them instead of abusing them.</P>
      <P>There is another point in this that deserves consideration.  To get these fees&mdash;this fee of £5 that is set out&mdash; every case will have to be settled in court.  Where 80 per cent. of the cases are settled outside the court at present, every case will be settled in court.  Without any disrespect to the doctors, they will ensure two to three visits to that case before it comes to the court in order to qualify for the £5, so that each doctor, when the case appears in court will be entitled to the £5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In most cases, or in many cases, at any rate&mdash;I do not want to be unfair to the doctors&mdash;there will be more than one doctor.  Let us take it that on an average there will be two doctors.  That will mean £10.  Now, take the information which the insurance companies have given us as to the average costs being in the region of £20.  The relation of £10 to £20 is <Col N="126" /> 50 per cent., so that, by our own action, we are going to increase the charges 50 per cent.  That is what I want the House to bear in mind.  We are in sympathy with the doctors and their charges.  We want every man to get a fair recompense, but where you are going to increase the costs by 50 per cent., I think the House should hesitate, and I want the House to hesitate and consider the matter. Industry in this country is in no state to bear an additional charge of 50 per cent., and I would urge, both in the interests of the doctors and in the interests of industry, that this matter should be further considered.  It certainly should not remain in its present form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrRobertJRowlette" hpid="Dr. Rowlette Dr. Rowlette">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has spoken of the burdens that industry will have to bear if this very modest amendment of the Seanad be adopted. Why does industry escape this burden at present?  For the simple reason, which can be stated in three or four words, that it is parasitic on the free service of the medical profession. That is how it has escaped this burden and that is the burden that industry wishes to escape in the future.  Exactly the same complaints made to-day by the Federation of Irish Industries, the chambers of commerce, and some Deputies in this House, were made years ago, when the principle of compensation for workmen's accidents came into force at first.  It was urged that industry could not bear the burden, that the cost would be too great and that it would break industry. This minute addition, if any, to the cost of insurance now occupies the consideration of this House and the further demand is made that industry should continue to be a parasite on the free service of the medical profession. The Minister is quite aware&mdash;I think that he admitted as much in the Seanad&mdash;that, for most of the service given by the medical profession in relation to workmen's compensation, it is quite impossible to collect any money whatever.  That applies not only to those who give their service in hospitals, where the difficulties in this respect are greater, but also to those who give their service privately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="127" /> The comparison has been made&mdash;it is a false comparison&mdash;with the position of the shopkeeper, the butcher and the baker.  If the doctor is to be protected, why not, it is asked, the butcher and the baker?  The bills of the butcher and the baker are not due to the accident.  The doctor's bill is due solely to the accident.  It is part of the loss the workman suffers on account of the accident.  He does not eat more bread or beef on account of the accident.  In all probability he eats less.  But the doctor's bill is an incident directly arising out of the accident and has a special relation to any compensation or legal responsibility there may be for the accident. The medical attendant is in intimate relationship with any dealings between the workman and his employer, whether these dealings be in court or out of court.  He is a necessary part of the proceedings.  Without his help no assessment can be come to as to the injury the workman has suffered. But far more important than that is the fact that it is his work that tends to reduce the compensation and tends to reduce the responsibility placed on the employer or the insurance company. That fact has been almost altogether overlooked in the debate to-day&mdash;that the doctor's services, instead of increasing the amount to be paid, tend to decrease the amount by promoting the complete recovery of the man, or by restoring him to a fair degree of health in a moderate space of time.</P>

That sums up the attitude of the Federation of Employers, <Col N="128" /> Deputy Briscoe and the chambers of commerce to the amendment passed by the Seanad&mdash;that the attendance of the medical profession does not tend to restore a workman to health and render him fit for work.

      <P>Deputy Briscoe, judging by his speech and his interruption, is clearly in touch with an entirely different class of the profession from those concerned with this measure or with whom I have had any conversation concerning the measure or who have had conversation with the Minister concerning the measure.  He is in touch with a very much happier group of the profession than those I am acquainted with, because he is in touch with doctors who are regularly paid by workmen patients in compensation cases.  I do not want to weary the House by relating personal experiences. I remember only one workman's compensation case.  It was the case of a girl who did not choose to be treated in hospital, who preferred to come to my own house.  I attended her over several weeks and she paid me many visits.  She was awarded a very generous sum by way of compensation. It was three times the amount I would have awarded her if I had been assessing the compensation.  The only return I got in that case was a fee of a guinea for attending the court.  I got no payment for treatment.  That is the common experience of people who attend this class of case.  I am very glad that these cases do not come very much into the work of the general practitioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="129" /> There has been a good deal of mathematical computation, which must have puzzled many Deputies.  Deputy Briscoe gave us a very interesting computation of the probable amount of increased expense which this amendment would involve.  He told us that the average amount of compensation was £18.  He told us later that he did not know what the authority for that was.  Deputy McGilligan read the statement of the Minister as to what the average was in these cases.  Supposing it was £18, Deputy Briscoe adds to that average compensation a maximum medical fee of £5.  He adds two different quantities&mdash;an average and a maximum&mdash;and he estimates that that will give an increased cost of 25 per cent.  I cannot follow that.  Deputy Good goes further and decides that there are going to be two doctors in every case and that each of them is going to get £5.  He assumes that in every case the court is going to award the maximum fee.  I see no reason for assuming that the judge is going to be such a stupid person in every compensation case.  Our experience of the judges is that they are extremely astute in dealing with these cases. The assumption that a rather dishonest doctor&mdash;who, judging by his own description, is the doctor in Deputy Good's mind&mdash;will pay unnecessary visits in order to be in a position to command the maximum fee and will succeed in hoodwinking the court into granting him the maximum fee for unnecessary visits in connection with, as the Minister said, a cut finger or a sprained thumb, is not easily accepted. The whole assumption of a doctor getting the maximum fee of £5 and two doctors in every case is based on a hypothesis.  There is no basis of fact for it.  These simple cases do not demand the services of two doctors and do not have the services of two doctors. The assumption that the cost will be increased by 50 per cent. seems to me to have no basis in fact or in mathematics. I have been very puzzled by Deputy Briscoe's argument.  He said that, at present, the great majority of cases do not go to court.  That is true. He said further that doctors do not like going to court.  Nevertheless, his <Col N="130" /> whole anxiety is that, though the majority of cases do not go to court and though doctors do not like going to court, the maximum fee will be awarded.</P>
    <P>Everything given in regard to this increased cost is hypothetical.  Not one solid argument was advanced in support of it, either by Deputy Briscoe or anyone else.  The medical profession, as far as I know, put forward in the Seanad the suggestion that the court should award such fee as they thought properly earned by the medical man in the case.  That was not accepted.  The Minister has proposed the very modest maximum of £5.  Even in regard to this maximum there is considerable misrepresentation. He is quoted as saying that that would be awarded in every case whereas the Minister was very clear upon the matter.  He stated in the Seanad: &ldquo;The court in a great many cases will hold that a smaller fee will compensate the doctor for his services.&rdquo; In spite of that these misstatements of his opinion have appeared repeatedly, in the newspapers, and, to-day, in the debate it is assumed that the maximum would be awarded.  What Deputies really mean by that is an attack upon the competence of the judges.  They will use their discretion as to the amounts they award and as to the fee allowed in regard to compensation.  The case as made is merely an effort to meet what I think would be fair and what most people think would be fair, namely, that the medical men should be left in the hands of the judges who would say what fees should be secured.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe proposes to reduce that modest maximum to a still lesser sum.  I need not remind the House of the arguments of the leader of the Labour Party.  The point is made that a better principle to adjust the amount of the medical fees could be devised.  Of course it could.  We are not satisfied, but half a loaf is better than no bread; even a crust is better than no bread.  I would point out that a percentage of the compensation up to the maximum might not be suitable unless the judge used his discretion. <Col N="131" /> It is not the cases in which most damages are given that medical attendance has to be secured.  The largest amount of compensation may be given in a case where the workman suffered death.  In such cases there might be no medical fees at all.  I do not think a percentage would give an effective standard although it might be better than the proposal before the House.  As far as I know, the men of the medical profession, and those who speak for them, would prefer that the Seanad amendment should be accepted than that the matter should be kept any longer in doubt.  That is the position. Deputy Briscoe wants to give the medical men £2; perhaps he wants to give them nothing at all, but being a moderate man he would split the difference.</P>

      <P>Suppose paragraph (d) were amended by the insertion after the word &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; of the phrase or by the County Registrar under Part VI of this Act.  That would allow attached to the payment of the medical man an <Col N="132" /> agreement registered by the County Registrar.  The phrase would then run &ldquo;the court may, if it so thinks fit, upon the application of such medical practitioner made immediately upon the making of such order, direct the employer to pay in addition to the compensation to such medical practitioner in respect of such fees, such sum not exceeding £5, as the court may fix;&rdquo; then put in there the phrase &ldquo;or the County Registrar decides.&rdquo;  A sum not exceeding £5 or if agreed upon a sum that shall be included in the agreement of the Registrar for the payment of such agreed sum and then the rest follows.  And the payment on foot of such direction shall be taken to be the payment for the work of medical practitioner.  That would avoid a lot of cases being brought into court that otherwise would be so brought.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>&ldquo;and if such direction is given ...the payment shall be deemed to be a payment by such workman to such medical practitioner.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>You want the same thing with regard to the agreed payment.  That point had to be covered.  There is the other point.  If there is an agreement in regard to paying the medical practitioner, what is the sum that will be paid?  In one case there will be reluctance on the part of insurance companies to pay medical fees.  Suppose you have a case of a bad accident and obviously permanent and full incapacity, the only way in which the medical person may be secured his fee is by going into court.  Under the threat of being brought into court merely to get a legal award you can get an enforcible arrangement about payment of the medical men.</P>

      <P>I think where there is an agreed settlement which does not come into court, and particularly an agreed settlement in which an insurance company is involved, there will be payment to the doctor.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.I. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I am against the amendment chiefly for the reason that it seems to me to make the workman the catspaw of the doctor.  There is no doubt about it, this Bill is framed for the benefit of the workman, but this amendment is entirely for the benefit of the doctor.  In other words, the workman, because he can do better without going into court, <Col N="134" /> possibly has no intention of going into court, but the doctor comes along and, because he knows that when the workman's compensation is paid he will have to take his chance of being paid, says that he must get a fee of £5.  The employer may be willing to give a lump sum of, say, £100 in settlement, or rather the insurance company may be willing to pay that amount but they will stop short at that £100 and they are not going to pay £105.  It is a small thing like that which will upset a settlement.  That is what I mean when I say the workman would be made the catspaw of the doctor.  This is not a doctors' compensation Bill. Some Deputies might have gathered from the speeches made on the amendment that it is a doctors' compensation Bill, but we have to treat the position as far as the doctor is concerned exactly as if no workmen's compensation code existed.  The doctor will have to take his chance as to whether he will get paid or not for his attendance on the workman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the point that an order is necessary if the doctor is to get his fee at all, there seems to be nothing in that point.  The aspect from which it has been viewed seems to me to be that because a person is given a legal right under the Act, in order to secure that legal right he must go to court, get a definition of that right and an order made to that effect.  There are thousands of us who have legal rights which, in fact, we enjoy without going to the courts to seek an order setting out that we enjoy them.  Under this amendment it is sought to provide that the doctor will get an order to ensure that he will get his fee.  If there is a right to be got in court the parties will take that into account and they will make any settlement that is made on that basis. It should also be remembered that the solicitor for the workman will also be the solicitor for the doctor.  When the workman's case is being considered by the solicitor, the solicitor will have to take into account the claims of his quasi-client, the doctor, and he can foresee that if the workman, who could get a favourable settlement outside the court, is dragged into court the whole <Col N="135" /> question of liability under the Workman's Compensation Act will be opened up.  Questions will be raised by the defence in regard to bringing the claim in time, the service of notice and many other matters and you may have the result that the workman will get practically nothing at all in the end.  I shall conclude these few remarks with the observation with which I opened, that the object of this amendment is to make the workman the catspaw of the doctor, and for that reason I most certainly shall vote against it.</P>

      <P>I suppose I have the right of replying to the wildly extravagant statement of Deputy McGuire that this Bill&mdash;not even the amendment &mdash;but the Bill is to make the workman the catspaw of the doctor.

      <P>Although this Bill deals with workmen's compensation, at the same time there is no reason when you are providing compensation for workmen, why you should not see that the rights of people who are affected contingently in the event of an accident occurring, should not be properly protected, too. Deputy McGuire talked about a solicitor and the doctor, his quasi-client. That is the position even at the present moment before this Bill goes through at all, because in a case at present where a doctor has to attend a patient who is injured, the solicitor who is acting on behalf of the patient I imagine very often does make an effort to get a fee for the doctor if he thinks it is possible for the workman to pay.  At the same time, I do not think the doctor is always on his doorstep or is always ringing him up asking him &ldquo;Have you got that ten bob yet?&rdquo;  There are some cases where a solicitor does try to get a fee for the doctor.  He succeeds in a very small minority of cases, but I think he succeeds in the majority of cases in getting a fee for himself.  Why should he be entitled to a fee any more than the doctor?  If counsel is briefed in the <Col N="136" /> case you may be sure that he gets his fee in advance before he does the case at all.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (3), line 44, after the word &ldquo;authority&rdquo; to add the words &ldquo;but shall not include any engineer in the employment of such local authority.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is to exempt any engineer in the employment of a local authority, and I base the appeal for engineers very much on the same grounds as those on which I based the appeal in relation to veterinary surgeons.  First of all, there is the general argument that people who have had to go through a certain course and spend certain moneys in order to get professional qualifications ought to be protected <Col N="139" /> from any sort of casual interference with the emoluments that were given to them and secured to them in such a way that people entering this service under local authorities had a certain type of life standardised for them.  I think that, particularly, we should avoid interfering with these in a sort of incidental way; we should avoid making any attack on these salaries and the standard of living which attaches to the salaries, unless there is some argument going to be used that, in fact, these people are being paid too much for the work they do.</P>
    <P>The medical men, I think, had their case based very definitely on grounds of hardship and humanitarian grounds, to a certain extent.  So far as the veterinary surgeons are concerned, I based my plea on the fact that this old-time and rather distinguished profession had almost got into decay and was in the lowest position it ever reached in the country, and that the period we were passing through, as I hoped, at any rate, was transitory and that we should retain these people and show that we had some regard for them until things bettered.  Also, there was the point that there was no financial sacrifice imposed on a local authority to any extent in agreeing to exempt veterinary surgeons.  So far as the engineers are concerned, I simply want to add this, that of all the various types of professional people I have had experience of from time to time, the engineers have caused me most wonder, in this respect, that when I view the salaries they earn, or, at least, the salaries that are held out to them, and compare them with the very arduous and very difficult course which they have got to follow, the engineering profession I found to be on the whole much the worst paid of all the professional people.  There are undoubtedly much fewer plums in the way of very big posts falling to engineers than to any other group of men I know.</P>
    <P>It has been notorious that, up to about five or six years ago, most of the engineers who got their professional qualifications here emigrated. We had then a burst of engineering <Col N="140" /> activity in the country which meant that we not merely catered for those coming out of the universities and the technical schools at the time, but that we had to get some of them brought back from abroad.  That phase of development, although still occupying a big number of engineers in the country, has almost stopped as a means of bringing new engineering graduates into professional work and we are, therefore, back again.  There will be, of course, a certain wastage there, particularly in later years, and there will then be an annual recruitment to it, and in that way there will be provision made for occupation for engineers, but, at the moment, the avenues are blocked and the vacancies have been filled.  There are very few new posts being created these days. The engineer is back again to the work on which he had mainly to rely in the old days, that is to say, either drainage work, somewhat attached to Government, or work under the auspices of a local authority.</P>
    <P>I do not know how many engineers attached to local authorities will suffer under this Bill.  I do not know, in other words, what salaries come above the limit of the salaries which are attacked in this Bill, but whatever the number may be, I know that it is going to be small and, again, I can urge that there will be very little financial sacrifice imposed on a local authority.  I think that in the case of these men, who have spent a considerable amount of time and have had to go through an expensive course and have moral debts due to their parents and are engaged in paying something back for the education they have got, we should not rashly and incidentally interfere with their salaries fixed in other times, on receipt of which they decided on a particular standard of living for themselves and we should particularly not do that when there has been no argument made that they are overpaid, that the work which they do is not sufficiently important and not sufficiently well performed as to warrant the receipt by them of the particular sums of money that accrue to them.  I should like to have this amendment sympathetically considered.</P>

      <P>This deals with professional men of the type of solicitors employed by local authorities.  I do not make any appeal of the same type in relation to these solicitors as I did in relation to either the medical doctors, the veterinary surgeons or the engineers. I say this, however, about them, that they have to deal with a branch of law which is most difficult and very unattractive.  As a matter of fact it is so complex that nobody of the legal type who drifts into work in association with the local authorities ever gets out of it.  It cuts off any other branch of work even if he had the time and were allowed to deal in outside work in addition to local authority work.  Because of the fact that it is so arid, so unattractive and so complex, and that in fact it does almost definitely disentitle and incapacitate a man for work of any other type, I should like to have some consideration shown to these people.</P>

      <P>I can hardly credit what the Deputy says about lawyers who act for local authorities.  I know one or two myself for a long time and they have quite a varied practice.  I certainly have in mind two lawyers, one of whom I think is known to the Deputy as well as to myself.  He is a solicitor to a county council and he has one of the biggest private practices in the country, so far as I know.  I do not think there is much in that argument.  Probably some reasonable arguments might be put up in connection with the other professional men with which these amendments deal, but I think there is not much to be said in this case, as the Deputy evidently realises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I put this down.  Again, I found myself on a certain experience in this matter in my association with engineers when I was a student.  I do not suppose there is a more difficult examination or test than the test which has to be passed by any man who wants to have himself even listed as qualified to be a county surveyor.  It is not that once the test is passed a man gets into any of these posts.  Certainly it used not to be that way.  Men in the engineering world did direct themselves towards this examination.  They directed themselves much as some medical men direct themselves to getting a Fellowship of the College of Surgeons.  It was a most difficult examination.  Men very eminent in their profession, as it turned out afterwards, and who had very good academic records and passed brilliantly the examination test in relation to their own profession, had to approach this test two or three times before they succeeded in qualifying.  I have stressed that the test was not held merely for appointment.  It was a thing any man could take.  Eventually he had to run the gauntlet with two or three other men who were equally qualified when an appointment fell vacant.  You had a group of men qualified in the ordinary way.  They then put in extra work for this difficult test and, having got qualified, they had to go up in competition with a <Col N="145" /> group of men equally qualified in this difficult test before they could get any of these positions.  In fact, it is clear that you had absolutely the cream of the profession in these posts.</P>
      <P>I have said before in relation to engineers that there are not very many plums in the way of work coming their way.  This was absolutely the thing at which most men in the particular profession aimed.  It seems to me again to be very hard and a very immoral thing that, on no argument based on their incapacity to do the work put to them, and on no argument based on the fact that they are overpaid in relation to the services demanded from them and which they give, we should, nevertheless, proceed to make a cut in their salaries.  I do not see why, just because the Government finds itself in difficulties, and decides that it is going to whack-out at salaries, it should come along with this measure, which is to save, to some extent, local authorities who have not demanded this.</P>

I want to get a record of the councils who have approved of this since it came out and of any subsidiary bodies attached to the councils who have approved of this, and have approved of this on the ground that the men in their service are overpaid&mdash;that they are either just in the abstract being overpaid, or being overpaid in relation to the service they give.</P>

      <P>I will not argue against the Deputy, as I could not do so, on the question of qualifications.  All these men&mdash;a greater number of them at any rate&mdash;I believe are very highly qualified and have to be highly qualified for their positions.  I know that the great majority of them render excellent service.  Needless to say, it is not on that account that the salaries are being cut.  We have to bear testimony to their qualifications and to their services.  I do say, however, in reference to the arguments used by the Deputy, that in speaking to the representatives <Col N="146" /> of those county surveyors they told me that they would much rather if the Government introduced a measure of this kind than be left to the tender mercies of the local authorities.  That statement was made to me by a deputation of county surveyors. They realised that, in the circumstances of the day, something of the kind was bound to come.  As a matter of fact, at or before the time that this Bill was announced, certain local authorities, if they had not actually passed resolutions making cuts in salaries heavier than are proposed in this Bill, had announced that they would do so.  I cannot say what number, but certainly the number of county surveyors for whom the deputation that waited on me spoke, would much rather that the Government should carry this measure than that they should be left to the tender mercies of the local authorities&mdash;of certain local authorities, at any rate, that they feared might do them much greater damage.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister to give further consideration to this matter.  There have been two tendencies in the Department of Local Government and Public <Col N="147" /> Health with special reference to appointments of this kind.  There has been a definite scaling down of salaries for county surveyors during the last ten years as compared with the scales that these officers were in receipt of before that, and very substantial reductions have taken place in the types of salaries paid.  On the other hand, there has been a substantial development in the responsible nature of the duties they carry out.  Not only that, but there has been a greater tendency to make these duties even more responsible.  As the work of county councils and urban district councils develop county surveyors or, as the Department has in some places succeeded in getting them called county engineers, are really the men upon whom local authorities have to depend for the economic carrying on of the work.  Big schemes of road construction and public works of various kinds have been carried out by local bodies, and the tendency has been to secure that county engineers will be the technical advisers and supervisors of the increasing number of such works.  The mind of the Department and the appeal made to engineers appears to be to regard the engineering service, particularly in county councils, as a very big field of experience for men who are devoting themselves to the profession. At a time like this, when I suggest the mind of the Department, and the mind of the country is looking more and more to the development of county engineering services, the Department would stultify that very important development by taking such action as is now proposed.</P>

    <P>The Minister would appear to have taken shelter behind the action of a certain county council in suggesting salary cuts, or in providing for the cuts set out in the Bill.  I think the Minister, if he was speaking his own mind, would agree with me that any attempt made recently, or even within the last two years by any county council, to reduce the salary of a county surveyor or a county engineer has been most grotesque and was founded upon bad temper, ill-humour and personal prejudice.  In the case <Col N="148" /> in which an engineer was subjected to that action he was a man eminently fitted for his work who rendered absolutely first class service.  Most likely he saved the local body in whose service he was a considerable amount of money, and perhaps saved the State finances.  If any kind of demand is made by any councils for a reduction of salaries paid to county surveyors I think the House would be very glad to hear the details.  Any attempts I have seen have been most grotesque and prejudiced.</P>
    <P>It is very hard to distinguish between the various county surveyors. Many of the old officials are giving admirable service, and have responded in a magnificent way to the wider and the newer duties that have fallen on their shoulders.  On the other hand, some who have come in during the last few years under the Local Appointments Commission, who have been the cream of the applicants for such positions, realise that the service was what might be called a newly developing one of a most important kind.  This Bill will be a very big set-back to the service as a whole.  When the Minister takes into consideration the amount of public work that these men may be called upon to do in the immediate future, and the amount of money that must be spent on public works, because of the unemployment there is in the country, I think it is a case of being very much penny wise and pound foolish, in insisting on cuts of this kind being made.  The Minister says that county surveyors generally would prefer to have their salaries cut in a small way by Ministerial edict or by statute rather than risk what might be done by local bodies, particularly local bodies given a headline by this Bill.  I would like to know from the Minister whether this Bill does not secure that there will be a minimum cut, and that there is not also a general invitation to local bodies to take off another slice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the Minister realises that engineers, even when acting as clerks of works, hold key positions with local authorities in the road <Col N="149" /> services, the rapidly expanding sewerage and water services, and in housing, in which the Minister is so interested, as well as in drainage and relief schemes.  Many young engineers are graduating in order to climb the ladder of local services.  If there is one branch of any service that should be contented it is the engineers, because all public services depend upon their supervision, upon their honesty, and their honour, whether the work is carried out by direct labour or by contract.  No local authority can supervise public work and, even if it could, the members would not be competent to do so.  It is the engineer watches over the execution of the work and certifies when it is done.  The Department and members of local authorities are aware that certificates have been supplied to local authorities that public works have been finished according to plans and specifications and in a satisfactory manner, but the Department finds, when complaints reach it in a year or two, that the work was not finished according to the plans, and was not done in a satisfactory manner.  In the execution of works, such as local authorities have to carry out, there is very little difference between competency and incompetency in the matter of strict supervision and attention to detail, and it is there that the services of engineers are most required. We are told that only a little bit is going to be taken off these men temporarily. We all know that these cuts are going to be permanent.  Why are they to be temporary?  Because of the economic war, and we have it dinned into our ears that it is going to continue. These cuts, I suggest, are only a prelude to some bigger ones that must inevitably come later.  The Minister has appeared here as a kind of devil's advocate.  He told us that it is better his Department should make the cuts rather than leave these officials to the tender mercies of the local authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>That was what they said to the Minister.  I wonder what they <Col N="150" /> would say if they were not speaking to the Minister.  We know that a man will not always speak his mind to his boss, especially when he knows the mentality of the boss on a particular matter.  It is strange that it is from the boss this proposal emanated.  No such suggestion came from any of the local councils I am connected with.  I have the feeling that the engineers employed by the local authorities in the City and County of Dublin with which I am connected would prefer that these bodies, with all their faults, should deal with their salaries rather than the Minister.  When I speak of the Minister in that connection I am not referring to him personally.  The local authorities instead of asking the Minister to cut salaries have passed resolutions protesting against this Bill. As regards the deputation that waited on the Minister they were there representing a particular class and they felt I take it that if there was going to be a reduction it was desirable that there should be uniformity about it.  I suppose, for that reason, they preferred that it should be made by the higher authority in Dublin, than by the local councils which necessarily would have to deal with individual cases.</P>
      <P>I put it to the Minister, however, that there has been no demand from the local authorities to reduce the salaries of their engineers.  He knows that no local authority has any power to reduce the salary of a permanent official without his sanction.  In connection with the various engineering and other schemes that are being carried out it is of importance to have a satisfied staff.  Take the relief scheme discussed last week in connection with which the sum of £50,000 was voted. If full value is to be got in the spending of that money it is of the utmost importance to have satisfied, reliable men in the key positions.  If not, a particular job may cost ten times the amount that this pretended saving will effect.  The little saving which this Bill will effect is only a pretence.  I put it to the Minister that it is bad business to go on with this Bill.</P>

      <P>I was surprised to hear Deputy Belton say that no local <Col N="151" /> authority has called for a reduction in the salaries of officials such as engineers and others.  As a member of two or three local bodies I wish to state that that is not so.  A demand for such a reduction was made long before the present Government came into power.  Local bodies for years have been calling for a reduction in the exorbitant salaries that are being paid.</P>

      <P>I have not the figures available at the moment.  I wish also to question a statement that was made by Deputy Mulcahy, that it is from a feeling of ill-will towards the persons concerned that this Bill has been brought in.  That is not so.  It is not long since a resolution was passed by the County Council in North Tipperary demanding a reduction in the salaries of the county officials, county surveyors and others.  While that demand was made the members of the council paid tribute to the different officials. They could not have done otherwise, because they are undoubtedly excellent officials, but at the same time the members of the county council felt that as representing the people they were in justice bound to effect reductions if possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>I desire to join with the previous speakers in saying that, in my opinion, it is unwise and unjust to proceed with the making of these cuts.  The saving effected would be negligible.  The proposals in this Bill, so far as county surveyors, assistant surveyors and others on whose shoulders at the moment increased responsibility is being placed in the execution of new works throughout the country are concerned, certainly mark a lack of appreciation of the services which these officials are rendering to the State.  There may be a case to be put up that certain county surveyors are fairly well paid, but if a person impartially examines the volume of the work, and the details connected with it, for which they have to be responsible over a vast area of their county, and the big number of schemes and men working on those schemes for whom they are directly responsible for their carrying out, I do not think anybody could say reasonably that they are unduly paid. Whatever may be said for the county surveyors, however, it certainly would be hard to find anybody to say that the assistant surveyors are even reasonably paid.  From my own experience, and I am sure from the experience of other Deputies, these men are giving of their very best in order to co-operate in the carrying out of these schemes and to give satisfactory results for the money spent on these schemes.  The evidence from all parts of the country would bear out that the success of these schemes has been contributed to very largely by the loyal co-operation and active work of these surveyors.  If anything should occur now to mar their enthusiasm, I agree with Deputy Belton that it would be very bad, because, if these men were to get slack in their duties and to believe that this cut is only a preliminary to further cuts, and that the best appreciation that can be shown for their work is that this is going to be not only one sample of a cut but that they will be subject perhaps to further cuts. <Col N="153" /> I have grave fear that, economically, the experiment will have a very different result from that which the Minister intends.  I think it is altogether unfair and unjustifiable to make any cut in the salaries of these men who have given and are giving such loyal and excellent service.</P>

      <P>Yes, but justice must come from a comparison with something else.  Did the council that originally fixed those salaries feel that something had happened?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRyan" hpid="Mr. M. Ryan Mr. M. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The council did not originally fix the salary of the county surveyor.  He was appointed there some three or four years back and the salary and travelling expenses were fixed by the Local Government Department against the wishes of the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>They were fixed by the Local Government Department?  Well, I will accept that statement.  I do not know whether it is 100 per cent. correct or not, but let us take it that it is. The county council advertised for a job, let us say at £700, and I doubt if North Tipperary gets so much.  Perhaps £600 would be nearer the mark. You got applicants for that job.  What type of applicants did you get?  You got £600 applicants.  If you advertised a job at £400 you would get £400 applicants, and after getting a man at a £600 standard salary, now you want to reduce his salary.  Surely, that is not the way a business man in North Tipperary would treat his employee when he got a good one.  Surely he would not, when the employee was tied up after having left another job, and after praising the man as being above expectations, then reduce his salary.  Would he do that?  Of course <Col N="154" /> he would not.  You got a man to go there.  He was induced to go there by the salary you offered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRyan" hpid="Mr. M. Ryan Mr. M. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, that is the human way of looking at things.  When you set a salary for a certain job, you expect that a man of a certain class will apply.  You could set a salary of 30/- a week and you would expect to get a 30/- a week man, and that is what you would get.  You could offer £5 a week and you would get a £5 a week man.  This salary was fixed after consultation and it was a salary that would attract a man capable of doing the job.  You got that man and now you want to reduce his salary.  I know of a case in the University, in connection with the Faculty of Agriculture. All concerned with the setting up of that faculty agreed that there was a certain branch of teaching there which should be given a certain status, and they agreed that a man would have to be got there at a certain big salary. The Director of Agriculture agreed with that, but he felt that there was not a man in the country capable of filling it.  If there were a man in the country to fill it, that job would have been fixed in the way that all present unanimously agreed it should be fixed.  It was not fixed, however, and it has not been fixed yet, all because it was felt by the Director of Agriculture that there was no man in this country competent to do that job and that, if we were to fix it at a certain standard, which it should be fixed at for the sake of agriculture, we would have to import a man, and the majority would not face that. That was a case of a job which was wanted to be done.  To get a man to do it you had to offer him almost what we might call in vulgar language a bribe.  You had to offer him a very big salary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if Deputy Ryan was here when Deputy McGilligan went over the various tests and examinations and processes of elimination through which candidates have to go in order to qualify for the job of county surveyor.  It showed that these <Col N="155" /> men were the cream of the profession in this country.  We got these men by offering certain salaries, and now we want to reduce them.  The county surveyor in whom I am interested&mdash;I do not mean that I am personally interested in him, but that he is the county surveyor of my council&mdash;had a job on the Canadian Pacific Railway. He came back to this country and worked in the Midlands as a county surveyor for a number of years.  He was offered a considerably better job again with the Canadian Pacific Railway, and he was going back there only that he got the job in which he is now. He settled down here.  He is now advanced in life and, of course, we have him in such a position that even if we took off a couple of hundred pounds from his salary it would not suit him to make a change now.  But, if we take men who have passed the Rubicon of life and who are stuck in their jobs, so to speak, and then reduce their salaries, will we be able in future to induce brilliant young engineers to remain at home and to give their brains to the service of this country? <Col N="156" /> I should be interested if Deputy Ryan would develop his idea as to how the new element of justice came into the consideration of the North Tipperary County Council, especially in view of the fact that everything in the garden is lovely, as we have been told by the Front Bench opposite.  If everything in the garden is lovely, I should like to know what is wrong with the garden.</P>
