      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware (a) that the Longford County Council promoted the accountant in the secretary's department of that body to the position of secretary rendered vacant by the death of the secretary; (b) that they did so in accordance with Section 5 of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act; (c) that all the regulations which were necessary under that section were observed; (d) that the person promoted has a great many years' service in the office of secretary and accountant; (e) that he is highly suitable for the appointment; (f) that his promotion was the unanimous decision of the council, which is composed of all parties and if he proposes to sanction the appointment, and if not, on what grounds he refuses to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Longford County Council adopted a unanimous resolution purporting to appoint one of their officers to the vacant office of secretary of the county council.  Before doing so they did not receive sanction, as required by law, to their filling the office without obtaining a recommendation from the Local Appointments Commissioners, and I informed them I was not prepared to give such sanction.  Not having received sanction to proceeding <Col N="1664" /> under Section 5 of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926, the resolution of the council was of no effect.</P>
      <P>In an important administrative post such as that of secretary of a county council the machinery for selecting a suitable candidate provided under the Act of 1926 should be utilised and I am not aware of any reason for departing from the established practice in such case.  I have, therefore, on behalf of the county council, requested the Local Appointments Commissioners to recommend a person for appointment.  The Local Appointments Commissioners will, I have no doubt, give due weight to the qualification, service and experience of the person whom the county council wish to appoint, if he is a candidate for the post.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister say that the officer who has been promoted is not efficient, and highly efficient, and does he not think that refusing to sanction the appointment militates against the efficiency of every officer on a public board inasmuch as he is removing the chance of promotion which should be available to every officer or official, provided he is efficient?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O. Ceallaigh Mr. O. Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that the man is not an efficient employee of the county council, but I do say that it is better that the Local Appointments Commission should have the opportunity of getting the best man possible for the service of the county council.  If the officer who has had long service satisfies the Local Appointments Commission that he is the best person they will, no doubt, take that into consideration when making their selection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>The officer in question has satisfied the county council after 30 years' service that he is capable of filling the appointment. The county council must have more knowledge of that officer's capabilities than the Local Appointments Commission can possibly get by meeting him for a few minutes at an interview.  It was an unanimous decision by the <Col N="1665" /> council&mdash;or there may have been one exception.  I may be making a speech, Sir, but I should like to ask if it is not a fact that Section 5 is there for the purpose of allowing promotion to be made by local authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Section 5 is for that purpose and it is frequently used by local authorities, but the Minister has always the discretion of deciding whether in respect of a particular office or post that section should be permitted to be used or not.  In this case, I decided that, as it was such an important office, the Local Appointments Commission ought to have the opportunity of investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister if that was really the reason or if there was another reason for his deciding not to give the necessary sanction?  It is suggested that if another name had been submitted sanction would have been given.  The statement has been made that if the name of the President of the local Fianna Fáil club, who is also a candidate, had been sent forward, the sanction would have been given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It is undoubtedly true that, notwithstanding all the efforts which the police are putting into the discovery of the people who are causing disturbances, they have failed in a number of instances.  In a large number of instances, however, their efforts have proved successful.  The Government, as a whole, hopes that the police will be successful in their efforts to trace all the persons who are causing disturbances throughout the country, and put them in jail where they should be.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware with regard to question No. 4 that a very considerable time has passed since this outrage was committed, and that apparently nobody has been traced in connection with it?

      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister, in his introduction of this Estimate, did not give us some more information as to the efficiency or economy that has resulted from the remarkable changes in the administration of national health insurance which have taken place within the last 18 months.  Two very remarkable changes have taken place from which much might be expected: the abolition of the Insurance Commission on the one hand, with the bringing of the work of national health insurance administration directly into the Department itself; and secondly, the beginning of the establishment of the unification of the societies some months later.  I think the House would like to hear the Minister's views, though they must be provisional at the moment, as to the economy and efficiency that have or have not resulted from those changes.  We were given to understand in advance with regard to the unification of the societies that enormous economy would be effected and also that there would be greater efficiency in the carrying out of administration.  In evidence submitted by the National Health Insurance Commission some years ago to a Committee of Inquiry it was stated that some 45 per cent. of the expense of the central administration would be saved.  So far as we can learn from the Estimates there is as yet no economy whatever in the working of national health insurance. There is a slight increase in the expenditure of £2,703 net.  Of course, I can understand that it is too soon to expect the major part of the economy that might be expected, but one would like to hear from the Minister <Col N="1672" /> whether he still holds that anything like the expectations of economy held out to us are likely to be verified by experience.</P>
      <P>I should like particularly to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that whereas he has by the Act of last year made a very radical change in regard to the administration of national health insurance, he has as yet only touched the first part of the programme that he himself set before the Dáil and the country some years ago.  It was in the year 1929, when the late Government introduced a Bill dealing with National Health Insurance, that the Minister moved a very important amendment which is to be found in Vol. 32, Parliamentary Debates, Col. 77:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete all words after the word &ldquo;that&rdquo; and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;declines to give a Second Reading to the National Health Insurance Bill, 1929, until proposals have been laid before the Dáil providing for&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The administration of national health insurance through one society, and</P>
      <P>(2)  Medical benefit.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister there set before himself, we understood, that when he was in a position of responsibility and power and able to carry out his programme there were two main reforms desirable in the system of National Health Insurance.  One was carried out by the Act of last year; the other we have heard nothing about in recent years.  I hope the Minister still regards that as a desirable and necessary reform if National Health Insurance is really to be a health insurance in more than name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have this system of what would be more properly called sickness insurance in this country for something over 20 years, but it has never as yet contained what is the essence of every health insurance scheme in other countries and what is the natural essence of any health insurance scheme, namely, provision for the care of the insured person himself; that is, his care as regards the prevention and treatment of sickness.  Under our scheme we have no such provision.  It <Col N="1673" /> has always been regarded by those who gave any study to the matter of health insurance in this or other countries that the scheme was thoroughly deficient in not having any such provision within its scope.  The Minister was quite clearly of that opinion when in a position of less responsibility than now.  We have, however, no reason to suppose that he has changed his mind. In his speech proposing the amendment I have read he summed up very carefully and methodically the evidence in favour of the establishment of a scheme of medical benefit.  I would prefer to call it provision for treatment of the sick insured as the term &ldquo;medical benefit&rdquo; is likely to be misunderstood as meaning some method of giving such treatment on lines similar to those in vogue in Great Britain, a system which, in the opinion of those who have studied the problem as regards this country, would be unsuitable to this country.  The Minister summarised and built up a complete case in favour of the establishment of some scheme of medical benefit.  I hope that he still has that before him and that, while it may be necessary for him to proceed step by step, he is not going to draw back from the programme he laid down in 1929.</P>
    <P>It is rather unfortunate that we in this country, among the more reputable civilised countries, are almost alone in this lack of provision for giving treatment to the sick insured.  The whole of Ireland was without such a provision until late in 1929, when a scheme of medical benefit on the British lines was introduced in Northern Ireland. The definite reasons for its introduction are somewhat interesting.  I should like to read a brief extract from a letter issued at that time by the Minister of Labour in Northern Ireland as to the reasons which led him to introduce this legislation.  He stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the first place, I should explain that Northern Ireland is being urged by the Imperial Government to enable them to ratify Conventions drawn up by the International Labour Offices at Geneva in 1927.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1674" /> That is to say, that the reason why Northern Ireland adopted the scheme of medical benefit was, under compulsion, to attempt to put themselves in line with the more enlightened countries of the world.  The letter went on to state:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These Conventions require the subscribing countries to provide medical benefit for workers, including agricultural workers, on an insurance basis, and have already been ratified, or are in process of ratification by 15 other countries, including Germany, France, Austria, CzechoSlovakia, Hungary, etc.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are the only names given, although there must be eight or nine others.  It appears, therefore, that in this almost essential social service the Irish Free State is one of the countries which is not in a position to ratify the Conventions drawn up by the International Labour Office in Geneva.  It is, I think, unfortunate that we should have to confess that we do not make as good a provision for our insured workers as other countries, the names of some of which I have mentioned.  I think it is particularly unfortunate that we should have to admit that in this particular social service we are lagging many years behind the neighbouring State of Northern Ireland.  I quite realise that in some of our medical services the Irish Free State is in advance of the condition of things in Northern Ireland, but in this very essential part of national health insurance we are four and a half years behind them and we have no word from the Minister as to any advance in this direction.</P>
    <P>In the evidence which the Minister gave the House in favour of a system of medical benefit, he was able to quote the advice of every Committee or Commission which ever studied the question&mdash;from the Report of a Committee as long ago as 1912-13; from the Report of the Irish Public Health Council in 1920; and, in certain terms, from the Report of the Committee of Inquiry on National Health Insurance appointed by the Minister for Finance of the late Government. It is true that that Committee was rather hesitating in its advice.  It <Col N="1675" /> advised that such a system would be ideal, but, for &ldquo;various reasons,&rdquo; which were unstated, it was unable to recommend that steps should be taken at the moment.  That, however, was eight or nine years ago, and there has been time for many steps to have been taken since.  Not only have no steps been taken, either by the last Government or the present Government, whose Minister is in favour of such a step, but there has been very little said about this natural development of National Health Insurance.  The Minister was able to quote the deliberate opinion of the various Labour organisations in favour of a medical service for working people.</P>
    <P>He might have said, if he had been aware of the fact, that that has been the policy urged on successive Governments by representatives of the medical profession for the last 25 years or longer.  They have been unanimous for many years in the view that an adequate medical service could not be rendered to the working people of this country except by some medical service associated with the National Health Insurance Act.  I have said that I do not want to stress the term &ldquo;medical benefit&rdquo; as it is misleading, but I would draw the attention of the Minister to the advice given by the Labour authorities, which he quoted here before, that the service ought to take the form of a National or a State Medical Service, and that it is the considered opinion of most people who have studied the question that the best service for insured persons and poor persons can be given by a combined National Medical Service which would undertake the duty both of attending to insured persons and attending to poor persons as is now done under the poor law dispensary service.  The whole system of medical service would not, of course, end with attendance on the sick person in his house, but should include provision for hospital treatment and special arrangements. I do not want to delay the House by going into the details.  I merely wish to indicate on broad lines the programme which the Minister himself had before him, and which I <Col N="1676" /> hope he will still keep before him.  In his argument for a medical service on that occasion I think he was supported by his present colleague, then Deputy Lemass.  I hope the Minister, in reply, will give us some expression of his opinion as to how the changes in the administration are working and are likely to work in future.  Secondly, I hope he will hold out some hope of some further developments in the National Health Insurance system so as to make it a real live system in this country and not a system of money payments as it has been up to the present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I deliberately left out of my statement in introducing this Vote, any reference to the working of the schemes put into operation as a result of the passing of the National Health Insurance (Amendment) Act of last year for the reason that the Act is in operation only for a few months, and that anything in the nature of statistics that I might put before the House might mislead the House rather than be of assistance to it.  A number of insurance societies have been taken over.  A big step has been taken in the direction of unification, and I have no doubt that, long before the period specified in the Act, we shall have working in the country a unified national health insurance scheme such as was adumbrated and recommended by myself on the occasion referred to by the Deputy when, in opposition, I was discussing this Estimate.  The Deputy, I think, suggested that no step had been taken in the direction outlined in that speech of mine which he quoted, but I think that an important step has been taken.  Almost the biggest step has been taken in the direction of the improvement of the national health insurance scheme by the passing of the Insurance Act of last year, which is to bring into operation the unification of national health insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was, I think, most unlikely that any Government would seek to change the system of what is called medical benefits or medical treatment, as Deputy Dr. Rowlette prefers to call it, so long as the old system of separate <Col N="1677" /> societies remained.  The first step in the direction of the improvement of national health insurance that was necessary in this country was unification. I think that was realised by my predecessor, because he took certain steps in the direction of bringing it about, perhaps more gradually than I did.  Still, he was going in that direction, and it looked as if his mind were running in the same direction to bring about unification.  That has been achieved, but not completely.  It will be some time yet&mdash;some considerable time, comparatively speaking&mdash;before all insured persons have been brought into one organisation.  That will be a big step in advance.  It will lead unquestionably to considerable economies in administration both at headquarters and through the organisation actively administering insurance.  <i>Pari passu</i> with the changes that are being brought about, consideration is being given to other changes to improve efficiency and the efficacy of national health insurance throughout the country for the benefit of the country as a whole, and particularly for the benefit of insured persons.  I do know that the Provisional Committee which is in charge of national health insurance is making a study of the subject of national health insurance in different countries where such schemes are in operation, and the results of their inquiries, researches and studies will be available for the Minister.</P>
    <P>Our first aim is to put national health insurance on its feet financially. As the Deputy and the House are probably aware, it was not in such a condition: I do not think I use too strong a word when I say that it was in a parlous condition when this Government took office.  Unification will improve, and the step we took in passing that Act will very considerably improve, the financial position of national health insurance, and the changes and improvements that were referred to by me some years ago as desirable, these and others are being studied.  Certainly the improvements that were desired and are necessary will be brought into operation according as it is thought possible and according as opportunity offers.  I cannot say <Col N="1678" /> any more at this stage, because it is too early to give any promise as to what is likely to be done, say, during the current year.  We have, first of all, to watch developments in regard to the new organisation.  It is, in these countries, a new type of organisation and it will have to be careful.  We shall have to husband our resources and see that the finances, which were in such a bad way, are carefully nursed and that we shall not do anything that would jeopardise the improvements that we hope may be introduced with regard to medical treatment and matters of that kind in the years to come. It is true, as Deputy Dr. Rowlette says, that we have not got perhaps the most efficient or the best type of medical treatment under national health insurance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>All the societies are not done away with.  There are still some of them carrying on in that direction. While that is so, insured persons are not without medical treatment, because we have the Medical Charities Act, under which every person is entitled to get attention from a dispensary medical officer.  I am not saying that that is the most desirable arrangement, but I would not like anyone to be misled, or to say that there is not treatment available for insured poor persons, as well as for non-insured people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Medical benefit is one of the subjects that has been closely studied, and recommendations made by one or two commissions that went into the question, and the improvements suggested are being watched, as well as what has been done in other countries.  We hope that members of the Unified Society will, when we have national health insurance on a sound financial basis, get the benefits of the improvements <Col N="1679" /> that are thought desirable, and that are in operation in most up-to-date countries, and that eventually they will be brought into operation here.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce shows a net increase of £103,707.  The various headings under which that increase takes place, and also the headings which show an estimated decrease in expenditure, are shown on the face of the Estimate.  In sub-head A there is an increase, mainly owing to the necessity of increasing the staff in the Trade and Industries Branch, and in the Finance and Establishment Branch of the Department.  The increased duties devolving on the Trade and Industries Branch on account of Government policy, and the enactment of various measures have occasioned an increase in the staff of that branch.  The additional expenditure on the Finance and Establishment Branch arises very largely from increased work resulting from the operation of the Unemployment Assistance Act.  Sub-heads B, C, D, E and F require very little explanation. They are, in fact, explained very fully in the notes.  Sub-head G&mdash;Subscriptions, <Col N="1680" /> etc., to International Organisations, Special Services, Enquiries, etc.&mdash;also shows an increase, resulting from the additional contributions which have to be made this year in respect of items (4), (5) and (6). Items (1), (2) and (3) are the same as in previous years.  I presume it is not necessary to make any comment upon them.  The increase in respect of the contributions to the International Commission for Air Navigation arises from the fact that previous to 1933 the British Commonwealth was a member of that Commission as a unit.  Different members of the Commonwealth had not separate membership, and the aggregate expenses of the Commonwealth were shared between the different members.  Owing largely to the initiative of the Saorstát, the Dominions were granted separate membership from May, 1933, whereupon each member of the Commission became liable for the future to make a separate contribution to the funds of the Commission.  A new allocation of the expenses of the Commission was made for the year 1934, and the Saorstát was placed in the second class.  Representations have been made to have the Saorstát placed in the first class, which will involve a lower contribution, but, until the result of these representations is known we have to budget for the contribution required for members in the second class.</P>
    <P>The matter of the Imperial Economic Committee was discussed here at some length some months ago, when the report of the Committee on Economic Co-operation was submitted to the Dáil.  That Committee recommended that the Imperial Economic Committee should continue to discharge its existing functions, and take over certain other functions, and particularly that the several Governments should agree to contribute to the services to be performed by it.  The Saorstát contribution was fixed at 4 per cent.  The total expenses of the Committee are estimated at £20,200, and the Saorstát contribution at £808.  The contribution to the Imperial Shipping Committee was also discussed at that time, and the same considerations apply in <Col N="1681" /> that respect.  Sub-heads H (1) and H (2) &mdash;Grant-in-aid of the expenses of the International Labour Organisation (League of Nations), etc.&mdash;require little explanation.  The notes on the face of the Estimate will give Deputies any information they may desire in that connection.</P>
    <P>Sub-head I.&mdash;Coal Freight Subsidy&mdash; is a new service, initiated some time ago in order to assist owners and crews of small registered vessels, which have become wholly or partly disemployed, in consequence of the changed conditions operating in respect of the importation of coal, consequent on the development of the dispute with Great Britain.  It was decided to grant a subsidy of 2/6 per ton in respect of each ton of coal imported by such vessels into the smaller ports from the 9th May, 1933.  The subsidy is restricted to small cargo vessels, with registered tonnage not exceeding 170 tons, which are owned by Saorstát citizens, and manned entirely by masters and seamen who are citizens of the Saorstát.  The subsidy is not payable in respect of coal imported by any one vessel in excess of 500 tons in any one month, and applies only to cargoes discharged at the smaller ports of the Saorstát.  The number of vessels coming within the scope of the subsidy is 35, of which 23 have actually availed of the subsidy, and the number of hands employed is 200 permanently, and 100 additional from time to time. The approximate tonnage imported on the vessels to date is 42,000 tons.  The Ship Owners' Association, the body interested in getting this small bounty, reported some weeks ago that the bounty was working satisfactorily in the case of motor and shipping vessels, and that three additional motor vessels, which had been lying at Arklow for some time, had put to sea within the previous month.</P>
    <P>Sub-head J.&mdash;Minerals Exploration&mdash; is also a new service.  In 1932 the Executive Council gave instructions that arrangements should be made to explore the mineral resources of Arigna and Slieveanierin areas.  At first, it was intended to carry out the exploration by geophysical methods but later it was decided to employ the <Col N="1682" /> direct method of investigation by borings and cuttings.  Accordingly, a contract was entered into with Associated Contractors (Ireland), Limited, representing a group of French engineering firms, to carry out explorations and furnish a complete report of their investigations.  The contract stipulates that local labour is to be employed and materials of Saorstát manufacture used as far as possible. The actual boring is being done by an Irish firm under the supervision of Associated Contractors, Limited.  On the basis that approximately 48 borings may be made, it is estimated that the cost will be over £13,000.</P>
    <P>The next item in the Estimate is the Prices Commission.  The Prices Commission was appointed in April, 1933, and has been requested, from time to time, to undertake certain investigations. It has been asked in particular to investigate the prices charged for bread, wheaten flour, wheaten meal, mineral hydro-carbon heavy oil, and it was recently required to hold a public inquiry under Section 17 of the Housing Act, 1932, into the cost of materials and appliances used in the building of houses.  Additional members were appointed on the Commission for the purpose of the inquiry.  The inquiries regarding the price of bread and the manufacturer's price of wheaten flour and wheaten meal are nearing completion, and the Commission expects to be in a position to furnish a report regarding each of these commodities at an early date. The inquiry regarding the manufacturer's price of mineral hydro-carbon oil has been completed and the report has been furnished.  The inquiry regarding the prices of materials and appliances used in the building of houses is being actively pursued at present and it is anticipated that reports upon certain sections of the inquiry should be completed at an early date.  The first annual report of the Commission, covering the period from its appointment to the 31st December, 1933, has been prepared and submitted.  The desirability of holding an investigation into the prices charged for other commodities is under consideration.  In addition to the <Col N="1683" /> work done by the Commission, the Comptroller of Prices received and investigated a number of complaints during the year in respect of prices charged at particular sales for a number of commodities and, in a number of cases, he was successful in securing reductions in prices.</P>
    <P>The next heading of the Estimate deals with Peat Fuel Development. The results of the efforts to popularise and extend the use of turf as a fuel encourage the hope of further success in the present year.  It is proposed to work along the same lines as last year, but in a more extensive way.  It is intended to purchase immediately an additional 150,000 sacks at 1/7 each, approximately, and it may be found necessary later to purchase additional sacks.  The purchase of macerating machinery for experimental work in different parts of the country is also under consideration.  The co-operative idea of working the production scheme was a very distinct success last year. Only about 25 societies were effectively organised, because of the late start that was made.  Seventy-three societies are now registered and some 30 societies are in course of formation.</P>
    <P>The work of the organisation of the societies is being entrusted to the I.A.O.S., and it is proposed to finance that organisation to the extent of £3,200 for that purpose.  It is proposed also to set up a central marketing organisation under the auspices of the I.A.O.S., with representation from the Department of Industry and Commerce, to ensure proper distribution of orders, regular supplies, and to eliminate long-distance transport as far as possible.  It is estimated that the central marketing organisation will cost the Department about £1,600 during the present year.  Publicity in connection with the sale of peat will be entrusted to this central marketing organisation.  It is proposed to rely again upon coal merchants to sell the turf, and it is hoped to get from them throughout the country more extensive co-operation than was obtained previously. One of the chief things in this connection is, of course, bog drainage and road making, and certain engineering <Col N="1684" /> staff has been employed for that purpose.  On another Vote, the Dáil is being asked to provide the money required for the purpose of bog drainage and road making.  The function of the department directing these activities will be to ensure that a market will be available for all the high-quality turf which is produced. The producers will be asked to supply the turf this year at the same price as last year&mdash;11/6 per ton on rail.  There were 314 applications for appointment as approved distributors under the Government scheme and, of these, 179 were appointed in 90 towns throughout the Saorstát.  It was, however, considered desirable to suspend the appointment of distributors in January, as turf supplies began to run out. Advertising had to be suspended for the same reason about the same time.</P>
    <P>The next item in the Estimate is the Industrial Research Council.  An Industrial Research Council was set up a couple of months ago with terms of reference which were submitted to the Dáil and published in the Press.  24 members have been appointed to the Council, representing various branches of science, engineering and industry. The functions of the Council are of an advisory character, and its duty will be to consider and advise the Minister for Industry and Commerce on such matters, coming within its terms of reference, as the Minister may, from time to time, refer to the Council.  It is intended that the Council will advise as to the establishment of a library and bureau to contain the records of research associations in other countries, and such technical and scientific publications as have a bearing on existing industries here, or industries likely to be established in the Saorstát.  The Council will also have certain duties with regard to the award of research scholarships and will advise, from time to time, as to how the money allocated for this purpose can be best used.  The Council will also advise as to the best means to be adopted to stimulate and promote the establishment of industrial research committees in collaboration with either general industrial organisations or other groups of industrial firms.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1685" /> The next main sub-head deals with the production of industrial alcohol for which a sum of £120,000 is being asked.  This matter has already been debated on a Supplementary Estimate which was introduced last year.  It is proposed, as Deputies are aware, to undertake the production of industrial alcohol in experimental plant.  The construction of the experimental plant, which will take the form of five small distilleries and a central refinery, will be commenced in the present year.  A tentative agreement has been made between the Government and a continental firm of experts, as a result of which the technical knowledge, skill and advice of the continental firm will be placed at the disposal of the Government in all matters relating to the design, construction and operation of the plant for a certain period.  It will be necessary, of course, to have legislation before an agreement with the firm of experts can be finally concluded, or before the actual operation of the plant and sale of the product can be undertaken.  In the meantime it is intended to proceed with the construction of the plant.  It is expected that a beginning will be made, in that connection, in the course of a couple of months.  It is not possible to say yet to what extent it would be possible to get the plant into operation during the course of the present year, or whether it will be possible to deal with any portion of the present year's crop. Certain delays have occurred in negotiations with other parties, and we have not yet been able to get final information as to the length of time it will take to have the distilleries constructed, but it is hoped to have them constructed before the end of the present year so that some of this year's stock at least will be dealt with. Neither is it possible to state the price at which the raw material will be purchased or the finished product will be available for sale.  These are matters yet to be determined and it is for the purpose of getting information that the present experimental work is undertaken. Certain figures are available, and it is on the basis of these figures that the decision to proceed was made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is not the type of matter that would ordinarily be referred to the Council of Research.  If we asked their advice they would, no doubt, refer us to the fact that industrial alcohol is made as a commercial proposition by firms in other countries, and that everything to be known about it, therefore, can be obtained from such firms.  The Council is only consulted where it is not possible to get information in the ordinary way, and where experiments have to be carried out, having regard to the conditions in this country, the commercial utilisation of raw material here and matters of that kind.  There is no technical problem; the only problem is a commercial problem. Industrial alcohol is manufactured from potatoes in a number of countries. There are many methods of doing that, and the experiment is really to find out if the industry can be satisfactorily established here on conditions more favourable than in certain continental countries, and what benefits it is likely to confer upon the country as a whole.</P>

      <P>Yes, a number in connection with the utilisation of peat, and investigations that have been proceeding in various places in that connection; also the pursuit of a number of investigations into the utilisation <Col N="1687" /> of certain seaweeds.  These also have been proceeded with.</P>
      <P>On the general work of the Department I am rather in a difficulty as to what I ought to say.  I have not received from any Deputy an intimation as to his intention of dealing with any particular matter.  The functions of the Department cover such a wide field of activity that it would be impossible in detail to deal with all its activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of the past two years we have introduced, and passed through the Dáil and the Seanad, 23 Acts, of which the principal were:&mdash; The Control of Manufactures Act, the Control of Prices Act, the Road Transport Act, the Railway Act, Trade Loans Act, 1933; the Cement Act, the Unemployment (Assistance) Act, the Control of Imports Act, and there are in course of preparation certain other measures which it is hoped will be brought before the Dáil before the conclusion of the present session, and the nature of which, I think, is well known. In the transport branch the work during the course of the past year was very heavy, arising out of the working of the Road Transport Act and the Railway Act, which were passed in the early portion of the year and came into operation in June.  It was necessary to bring into operation the system of licensing the business of merchandise transport by road.  A substantial part of that work remains to be done during the present financial year.  It will be necessary to make representations to the Railway Tribunal in connection with schedules of charge and other matters under the Road Transport Act of 1933.  There have been a large number of applications for compulsory transfer of passenger licences to the Great Southern Railways Company under Part V of the Road Transport Act, and it is anticipated when the Appointed Day is again fixed under the 1934 Act that there will be a large number of applications for acquisition of merchandise licences by the same company.  Under the Railways Act of 1933 the whole of the machinery in relation to the standard railway charges, set up under Part III of the Act of 1934, is changed: and it is <Col N="1688" /> anticipated that a considerable number of orders will be applied for, under the Act of 1933, for the purpose of discontinuing train services on certain branch lines.  Four such applications have been made by the Great Southern Railways and one such application has been made by the Great Northern Railway.</P>
    <P>The Great Southern Railways Company have submitted to the Railway Tribunal their proposed superannuation scheme of 1933, and it is at present under consideration by the Railway Tribunal.  Work under the Foreshore Act, 1933, has been delayed but steps will be taken, in the current year, to secure a better recognition of the State's title to the foreshore, and better control over the removal of beach material, and the deposit of material on the foreshore.  It is antici pated, also, that under the Harbours (Regulation of Rates) Act, 1934, a number of applications for the revision of harbour rates will be made, and possibly some such revision will be initiated in the Department.</P>
    <P>I do not think that it is necessary to make a lengthy statement concerning the work of the statistics branch. A preliminary survey following the census of industrial production for 1931 has been published.  It was followed by a series of preliminary reports on the various industries. The final report for that year is at present in the hands of the printers. The returns for the census of 1932 have been collected, scrutinised and summarised. The preliminary figures will, I hope, be available shortly.  The forms of inquiry for the 1933 census have been issued, and the returns are now coming in.  The census of distribution, which, as Deputies are aware, is the first of its kind to be undertaken by any European country, is also in progress. Some 51,000 firms were circularised. By the end of March more than 30,000 replies had been received.  It is anticipated that it will be possible to commence publishing the results of that census at a comparatively early period. The usual work of the Department in connection with trade, shipping, agricultural and transport statistics, etc., has been proceeded with.</P>

      <Col N="1689" /> The main work of the Department of Industry and Commerce is, of course, in relation to the stimulation and direction of industrial development.  It would be a very lengthy task to give a review of everything that has been done, or that is in contemplation in that direction.  Following the change in policy, consequent on the coming into office of the present Government, the work of that Department was, of course, very greatly increased. Applications for protective duties were dealt with departmentally, and a very large number of these were received. It may interest Deputies to know that two out of three applications for protective duties were rejected as the records of the Department indicate, so that they can appreciate there is still a very considerable amount of work possible in that connection.  Ten emergency orders were made during the year imposing duties under the Emergency Duties Act.  The other duties which it had been decided to impose were dealt with by Finance Acts of the ordinary kind.  There were three references to the Tariff Commission: casks and barrels, prayer books and compounds of lard and fats.</P>

      <P>Some years ago I had no doubt as to what should be done in the case of fish barrels, but the reference in this case to the Tariff Commission covered a much wider field than they had previously reported on. <Col N="1690" /> The position in that particular trade has also considerably altered in the meantime.  I do not know to what extent it will be possible for me to give a review of the industrial position. The Departmental estimates show roughly that 20,000 additional people have been placed in employment in consequence of the industrial development that has taken place during the course of the past two years. There have been a number of new factories established although the greater part of the development which took place was in the form of an extension of existing factories.  Many existing concerns have been very considerably increased.  They have undertaken new lines of production which represent the establishment of new industries, in some cases, in addition to the extensions which have taken place in existing concerns.  The records of the Department show that there have been over 100 new factories established employing over 20 workers each and some 300, probably smaller in size and mainly workshops registered under the Factories and Workshops Acts, in respect of which information is not available.  If, during the course of the discussion on the Estimate, Deputies express a desire for it I can give them a review in respect of any particular industry, but unless that is pressed for I think I can pass on to deal with matters of Departmental administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Trade and Industries Branch of the Department is dealing with the Control of Manufactures Act.  That Act came into force on the 1st March, 1933.  During the course of the past year cases relating to over 600 firms, carrying on business in the Saorstát, have been investigated, and except as regards a very limited number all these businesses were found to have been carried on in accordance with the law. The question of instituting proceedings in cases of suspected default is at present under consideration.  Thirty-two new manufacture licences were issued. The industries concerned were footwear, in which case three licences were issued; clothing, 8; hosiery, 1; household linens, 1; bacon and pork, 2: packing 2; animal medicines, 1: paint <Col N="1691" /> and varnish, 3; builder's woodwork, 1; egg case fillers and flats, 2; printing, 1; golf clubs, 1; cycle assembly, 2; marble quarrying, 1; manufacture of oxygen gas, 1; oil refining, 1; and leather goods, 1.</P>
    <P>Licences, of course, were refused in a number of cases.  Where licences are issued conditions are attached requiring the employment of only Saorstát nationals and the use only of Saorstát materials, where procurable, in connection with the manufacturing process and also in connection with the advertising and distribution of the goods. The departure from the terms of the licence in respect of these matters is only permitted with the written consent of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  In certain cases a further condition was added requiring that the licensee would establish his factory in a particular locality.</P>
    <P>The employment given by 21 of the 32 firms on the 1st September last was approximately 1,500.  Information was only available as to the employment given by these 21 firms.  In the majority of cases, of course, where the firms did approach the Department with a view to being dispensed from complying with the conditions, we persuaded the firms, or else they decided themselves, to conform to the terms of the Act by securing the necessary proportion of Saorstát capital in order to engage in manufacturing without licence.  Approximately about 70 companies have commenced operations following recommendations of that kind by us.</P>
    <P>The intelligence section which was responsible for the publication of the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i> is also embodied in the trade and industries branch and has been of very considerable value to the Department in the collection and preparation of information relating to industrial changes in this and other countries in the course of the year.</P>
    <P>In connection with the administration of the Trade Board Acts, a board was established during the year for the packing trade and eight of the existing boards were reconstituted.  Requests have been received for the application <Col N="1692" /> of the Trade Board Acts to certain additional trades and these requests are at present under consideration. In connection with the administration of the Apprenticeship Act the designation of trades under that Act has been under consideration and notice of intention to apply the Act to the furnishing trade and the hairdressing trade was published in January.  No objection has been received to the designation of either of these trades, although application has been received for an extension of the eligible area which was originally confined to Dublin.  Trade Boards for the boot and shoe trade, the brush trade, tobacco, women's clothing, tailoring, etc., were consulted as to whether the trade, as defined in the Order establishing the Trade Board should be designated a trade under the Apprenticeship Act. Replies from these boards are not yet completed but so far as the replies have been received they are under consideration.</P>
    <P>The functions of the Department in connection with the operation of the Cereals Act have been frequently discussed here in the Dáil, and I do not think it is necessary to make any further reference to them.  The importation of flour under that Act was prohibited on the 31st March, 1933. The imports of flour have been consistently reduced in each period since, and the production of flour in the Saorstát mills has been increased. Nine mills have been permitted to increase their capacity; four mills, which were silent, have recommenced operations, and eight mills are at present in course of construction or construction is about to be commenced.</P>
    <P>The operation of the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act, as amended by the Act of 1933, has also considerably increased the work devolving on the Department.  During the past 12 months about 500 applications have been made under that Act.  It has been necessary to divide the work of the Advisory Committee and, whereas, previously one advisory committee was sufficient to deal with the applications, we have now four committees meeting weekly considering these applications.  Despite the fact that <Col N="1693" /> there are four committees there has, of course, been considerable delay in disposing of the applications that have come in.  We are endeavouring to get rid of them as rapidly as possible.  In a substantial number of cases the State guarantee has been given in respect of the amount proposed to be raised, but in a much larger number of cases the applications have been refused.</P>
    <P>The payment of export bounties upon certain industrial products was continued in the course of the year, although the list of the products in respect of which bounties operate has been substantially reduced.  It will probably be further reduced at some point in the near future, and although the bounties may not disappear altogether it is not intended that they should constitute a permanent feature of the industrial organisation of the country.</P>
    <P>The mines and minerals section of the Department, which deals with administration under the Mining Act and the proportion of the relief of the funds made available for the relief of unemployment allocated to mineral exploitation and development and the matters relating thereto, have also had a considerable amount of additional work placed on it during the year. About 30 applications for mining leases have been received.  Four leases were made and the remainder are in different stages of progress.  The minerals include gold, silver, slate, marble, calixbar and silica.  About 33 grants were made out of the funds provided for the relief of unemployment and allocated to mining development, making a total of £21,000.</P>
    <P>In the main the grants were to assist the mining of slate, marble, silica and limestone.  These grants have been instrumental in all cases in bringing about increased production.  That was particularly so in the case of slate, a commodity the demand for which was far in excess of the supply.  The percentage of grants devoted to labour represented from 85 to 100 per cent., so that apart from increased production a considerable amount of direct employment was given.  Many persons, both inside and outside the Saorstát, have been manifesting interest in the <Col N="1694" /> mineral resources of the country.  The Department has arranged for a supply of the latest information relating to mineral deposits and the examination of samples submitted.  Every person and group about to undertake mineral development receives the fullest possible assistance and advice from the Department.  We have at the moment under active examination a number of interesting proposals for the development of certain mineral deposits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I had no report apart from the preliminary report which was mainly designed to enable a decision to be arrived at as to where borings should be carried out.  These borings are now in progress.  I have received no report, apart from reports as to the progress made with the work, from those engaged in the task.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They have been proceeding for some time.  It is anticipated about 48 borings will have to be made altogether before a really satisfactory report upon the whole area can be submitted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, the Vote last year was £11,256, and we are asking for £13,000 this year.  I think there was some delay in starting the work last year, and the whole of the amount voted was not expended.  The greater part of the work remained to be done, but it is now in full progress. I do not anticipate there will be any very substantial delay before the <Col N="1695" /> actual work on the spot will be concluded. Of course it will be some time after the conclusion of the work there before the experts will be able to submit their report as to the commercial value of any minerals they may be able to locate.</P>
      <P>We have investigations also proceeding into mineral resources in other parts of the country, and it may be necessary to follow up those investigations with boring operations just as in Arigna.  Of course that will depend very largely on the nature of the report submitted by the experts carrying out the preliminary investigations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister is still on minerals, I might say that with regard to the new beet factories I saw a statement in the newspapers to the effect that the furnaces in these factories are in some cases being constructed to suit Irish coal rather than other coal.  Can the Minister tell us something definite about that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is intended to use Irish coal almost entirely in the beet factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>In all three?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>At Carlow the furnaces have been reconstructed to permit of the utilisation of Irish coal.  That can be said of all four of them.  Of course a lot will depend on the experience gained during the first year.  It may be found necessary to have some admixture, but the intention is to use Arigna coal at Tuam and 50 per cent. of Irish coal at Thurles and Mallow. To what extent they can utilise Castlecomer coal I cannot say from memory, but I know they have been using it at Carlow with, I think, considerable success.  Certain arrangements have been made for the use of Arigna coal upon the railways.  I think the Great Northern Railway Company has already commenced to use a proportion of Arigna coal, and it is anticipated the Great Southern Railways will commence in the near future.  I was endeavouring to give a sort of rough picture of the activities of the Department during the last year and during the present year. <Col N="1696" /> The picture is necessarily fairly rough, because in respect of any single branch of the Department a detailed statement would take a very long time. There have been a number of these activities to which I have not made reference.  If Deputies desire to have a more detailed statement upon any particular form of activity, I shall endeavour to give it when I am concluding. I have purposely avoided referring to the administration of the employment branches in connection with the Unemployment Insurance Act and the Unemployment Assistance Act, as presumably matters in that connection will be discussed upon the relevant Votes.  If there is any desire to discuss the policy behind the administration of these Acts, this will be the proper time to do it and I will endeavour to deal with any representations that are made in that connection.</P>
      <P>There are other matters to which I would like to make reference briefly in order to indicate that they are not being lost sight of.  The first is the possibility of developing a satisfactory Saorstát-owned mercantile marine.  We have taken the viewpoint that it is reasonable to arrange that 50 per cent. of the traffic which passes between the Free State and Great Britain should be carried in Irish-owned ships and that we should also have a reasonable proportion of the continental traffic from Saorstát ports.  Various steps to secure that end have been taken and certain progress has been achieved.  A new Saorstát shipping company has been recently brought into existence in connection with the continental trade and it is hoped that we will be able to record some development in respect of cross-Channel services before the end of the year.  It is not possible, because of the position in which things are, to give a more detailed statement at present.  I merely refer to the matter so that Deputies will appreciate that it is being attended to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the organisation of a Free State Air Navigation Company and the institution of air services under Irish auspices between Free State towns and from the Free State <Col N="1697" /> to other countries is also being dealt with and certain definite proposals are at present being considered by the Department of Industry and Commerce which are likely to lead to the submission of a scheme to the Dáil before the end of the year.  It is unlikely that that development will reach the stage of the actual institution of a service this year, but we hope to have brought matters to the point that these services can be inaugurated at the beginning of next year.  The construction of aerodromes and the utilisation of the facilities available in this country for the purpose of attracting aerial traffic are also having consideration and certain action is being taken which may have desirable results in that connection.</P>
    <P>The activities of the Department have also been devoted during the year to the negotiation of trade agreements with other countries.  To some extent the activities of the Department in that connection overlap the activities of External Affairs and to avoid waste of effort an arrangement has been made by which both Departments now act through one channel.  Certain arrangements of a tentative nature were made with beneficial results for Saorstát trade.  At present negotiations are in progress with a number of countries for the granting of reciprocal preferences or involving an arrangement for the exchange of stated quantities of specified goods.  Negotiations with India were initiated early in the year and were adjourned because of the necessity for the Indian delegates to get more specific instructions from their Government.  They will be resumed in the very near future.  Negotiations and discussions with the Governments of Spain, Belgium, Germany and France have also taken place and tentative arrangements of various kinds have been made pending the conclusion of more permanent agreements, if such agreement are found possible.  The activities of the Department have included the investigation of market possibilities in a number of countries and the possibilities of external trade for Saorstát products from these investigations are by no means pessimistic in respect to <Col N="1698" /> certain lines.  In the case of other commodities, in respect of which market possibilities were investigated, the openings shown to exist did not appear to be very considerable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Minister is referring to products other than agricultural products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In the main, yes. Although the Department of Industry and Commerce is responsible, under the Ministers and Secretaries Act, for the arranging of trade negotiations in respect of all products, we have to act, in respect of agricultural products, in very close consultation with the Department of Agriculture because there are technical problems associated with the shipment, sale, and handling generally of agricultural goods in regard to which the Department of Agriculture alone is competent to give advice. However, the question of the sale of agricultural goods has been investigated also and in regard to some of these goods prospects are good.  I am referring here to what might be called semi-manufactured agricultural goods. The work of the Department in the course of the present year is likely to be very considerable because a number of tentative discussions and negotiations which have taken place are now coming to the point where definite negotiations may be opened up, in which case any agreements made will be submitted for ratification to the Dáil.  The type of arrangements made heretofore has been more in the nature of informal agreements than trade treaties, and although they have been adhered to as if they were treaties, nevertheless it is desirable that our trade agreements with a number of countries should be put on a more stable basis than at the present time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that I would.  I do not think so.  The bulk of this Estimate is taken up by the industrial alcohol plant and, in so far as that does not account for it, by the peat fuel development, the Industrial Research Council, and the increased staffs necessary to deal with the increased duties devolving on the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the motion standing in the name of Deputy McGilligan: &ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not know exactly what Deputy McGilligan would say in his opening remarks introducing this motion, because the Minister has shown us an extraordinary phenomenon here to-day. He has studded himself round with all the various bits of machinery in his Department, has paraded all the machinery of his Department in front of us, and said: &ldquo;Is it not very hard to see exactly what people want to know when I am handling a machine that has all these particular sides to it and that has all this particular kind of machinery?&rdquo;  The Minister has shown himself in an attitude and in a frame of mind that the House is not accustomed to see him in.  Then, hidden away in the heart of all his difficulties, we see just little statements to the effect that he, apparently, appreciates, nevertheless, what his position is and that, to paraphrase his own words, the principal function of his Department is to direct and develop industry.  He told us that during the last two years the policy of his Party has put 20,000 people into additional manufacturing industries, that 100 new factories, with employees in each factory numbering not less than 20, have been set up, and that there are about 300 workshops whose employees number less&mdash;20, let us say, an average of ten.  That is all the information we have got with regard to industrial development and with regard to the matter which, as I say, is stuck in with all its nibbling at difficulties, and which, as he told us, is the really important work of his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would imagine that the Minister <Col N="1700" /> in introducing his Estimate in a year like this would have forgotten some of the details of his machinery and would have endeavoured to deal with that matter which he considers the most important part of his Department. About six months ago he told the people in the market square of Athy that on the development of industry that took place this year and next year would depend the whole future of the Irish nation.  The main development that the Minister has in mind as, apparently, the tit-bit of industrial development in this country, is that we are going to have additional services that will take us up into the air and will export our gradually diminishing production, and that we are going to have agreements made with all the countries that we can possibly make them with, and all as far away as we can possibly get them.</P>
    <P>The Minister addresses himself in the House to-day to the important matter of his Department at a time when people are meeting together and trying to do something in industry, people who are co-operating with and consulting one another and trying by mutual advice to help one another in their industrial difficulties.  In this morning's newspapers we have the report of the annual general meeting of the National Agricultural and Industrial Development Association.  From the Minister's point of view they are not a very critical body.  One of them found that the recent budgetary statement of the Minister for Finance showed &ldquo;an excellent foundation for the reinstatement of prosperity in this country.&rdquo;  I would be inclined to say that that speaker is not unsympathetic to the Government.  Another found that the present Government had helped the horse industry in every way and had done a great deal for that industry. Anyone concerned with the horse industry in the country will certainly agree that the people who make remarks like that are not unsympathetic to the Government.  We find, however, that complaint is made there, that they had the extraordinary position that despite the fact that virtually every commodity was tariffed, we are importing millions of pounds worth of <Col N="1701" /> goods, and that the degree of efficiency in the existing factories and in a number of the new factories was not all that might be desired&mdash;that some of the factories were operating under conditions that were not desirable, that the Minister for Industry and Commerce was helping to exploit girl labour in the City of Dublin and that he was preventing the development of industry here by placing obstacles in the way of importing machinery from Great Britain.  One speaker mentioned that in one instance the President had to be appealed to to get Mr. Lemass to climb down so as to allow factory machinery to be taken away from the North Wall where it was held up.  The speaker said, I think, that this factory was catering for 180 workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The speaker reported is Mr. T.J. Cullen, Maureen Buildings, Temple Bar, and Mr. S.P. Campbell of the Dublin Typographical Provident Society said that he agreed that conditions of employment were bad, but that the Association could come together and endeavour to improve matters.  As I say, these are the things that are pressing on industrialists at the present time, together with the statement which is made in to-day's paper also, that Free State firms were very much handicapped by the invasion of foreign contractors. A previous President of the Federation declared, on 26th April last, that the situation here was bad as a result of the large number of externally controlled manufacturing firms that were opening and had opened in the Free State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the employment of juveniles.  It is reported that the members of the confectionery and food preserving trade boards had approved of a recommendation of the sub-committee of the board that juvenile labour in industry should be considerably curtailed.  They made a proposal that only 20 per cent. of the employees in the confectionery, <Col N="1702" /> preserving and food packing trade were to be under 18 years of age, and they state that, in many other industries, anything from 50 to 75 per cent. of the workers were under age, so that in spite of the great effort that the Ministery are putting forward to develop industry here, those engaged in that industry are pointing out that a very considerable number of juveniles are, and, apparently, have to be employed; that there is a very considerable import of goods that are tariffed in spite of the number of tariffs and in spite of the high tariffs; that the conditions in many of the employments here are bad, and that they are still oppressed by the incoming here of foreign capital.  Probably, what is at the bottom of a lot of their difficulties is what is pointed out there, that there is no living to be got out of agriculture to-day, and that the purchasing power of the people is very considerably reduced.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us again that he has set up a certain number of new factories and new workshops.  He tells us, for the first time, I think, that a certain number of companies have been started here which it was not necessary to license, because there was the necessary supply of Irish capital in them, but there is no attempt to let the House know to what industries he refers, where they are established or how the distribution of industry throughout the country, which the Minister says is his policy, is going on, and there is no attempt to give any information to the House as to the extent to which capital is being put into new Irish industry here and the extent to which that capital is Irish capital.  I suggest to the Minister that when, as he confesses, he regards the things that are going to happen in the development of industry in this country during the current year, as of such importance to the nation and to its future, it is an extraordinary thing that he would not address himself in his remarks here to-day to these things instead of to a general ramble through, say, the halls of his Department.  The Minister is usually in a different frame of mind, and in the previous discussions on these matters here there <Col N="1703" /> have been long litanies by him of uplift and achievement.  We had them in May last year; we had them in August last year; we had them at various societies, at the Chamber of Commerce and the Industrial Federation meetings in the city, but when he comes, in what he confesses to be the critical year, to address the House we hear none of this uplift and we get very little information.</P>
    <P>He tells us that his Estimate is dominated, as we see it is dominated, by a vote for £102,000 for the production of industrial alcohol, but it is not necessary to say much about that, because it was all dealt with before.  The Minister has a Prices Commission, and he has given it a few jobs to do, and he is proposing to spend a considerable amount of money &mdash;£4,309&mdash;on it during the year.  I think that any worker in the City of Dublin could tell the Minister that his wife is paying, rather reluctantly, about 9d. a stone for potatoes at the present time.  The Minister's industrial alcohol proposal is that, as an experiment, he will take from the farmers about 25,000 tons of potatoes, giving them about 2½d. a stone for them, and when he has got those potatoes we are going to have a financial transaction of this particular kind.  The Minister has argued here that he is likely to produce industrial alcohol at a price lower than that which it has been produced elsewhere, and lower than that put forward by any of the experts who, arising out of the proposal, have addressed themselves to a discussion of the matter recently.  The Minister proposes to pay 35/- for a ton of potatoes, and he says that there will be certain by-products from every ton of those potatoes which can be used as cattle food if they can be fed hot to the cattle.  Giving the Minister credit for disposing of every scrap of those by-products, we find that the net cost of the raw materials for the production of a gallon of this alcohol will be 1/4½ and, when the cost of conversion and the overhead charges are taken into account, the Minister is going to be lucky if he turns out a gallon of industrial alcohol at 2/4.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1704" /> The Minister tells us that his first approach to the subject is that, as an experiment, he is going to do it for only 500,000 gallons, while we import about 40,000,000 gallons of petrol every year.  To produce, in this particular way, at a cost of 2/4 a gallon, 500,000 gallons of industrial alcohol is going to have certain financial effects on the country.  In the first place, the revenue is going to lose on the 500,000 gallons £16,660, taking the duty at its present rate of 8d.; and, in the second place, the motorist is going to pay extra for his petrol, spreading the additional cost over the whole of the motoring population, at least £33,333, and those who know most about the business in the country have pointed out to the Minister, in elaborate articles recently, that it may cost about 3/- to produce his gallon of alcohol and, in these circumstances, the motorist will have to pay £50,000 additional for his petrol, so that, between the taxpayer and the motorist, the cost of the scheme is going to be from a minimum of £50,000, for which the Minister is told he cannot do it, to a maximum of £66,660, for which the Minister is told he will be lucky if he is able to do it in the earlier years.</P>
    <P>The taxpayer and the motorist are going to face approximately £60,000. The farmer is going to get £43,750. He is not going to get that as a pure transfer from those out of whose pockets the £60,000 odd are taken. He is going to be asked to give in return for it 25,000 tons of potatoes.  In fact, for every 2½d. of the £43,000 the farmer is going to be asked to give a stone of potatoes.  That is the internal position so far as the Minister's proposal affects the farmer, the taxpayer and the motorist.  The great return nationally is that the trade balance will be reduced by £8,333.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his long litany of industrial uplift in May last year, dwelt on the development of the industrial alcohol business here.  I do not know whether he stated that he was going to put 60,000 acres under potatoes for industrial alcohol purposes, but I think that is what the Minister was proposing to do.  If the <Col N="1705" /> Minister proposed then to extend his industrial alcohol business beyond the experimental stage and to provide that, say, 25 per cent. of the petrol used here would be Irish-produced spirit, then the revenue would lose £330,000 at the figure of 8d. customs duty, and the motorist would pay not less than £666,000 and, probably, £1,000,000.  If the Minister had brought his experiment to a successful industrial conclusion the taxpayer and the motorist jointly would have to find something between a million and a million and one-third; the farmer would receive £875,000 if he gave the potatoes at 2½d. a stone; and the trade balance would be benefited after all that transaction to the extent of £166,000.  As I say, that is what the Minister's industrial alcohol proposal comes to, and this is the proposal of a Minister who has a Prices Commission at his disposal to see that people get value for their money; that at the present moment has carefully paid no attention to, say, the price people pay for potatoes, and that the farmer gets; and that certainly must be keeping its eyes very much shut, from the Prices Commission point of view, to what the Minister is proposing to do ultimately for industrial alcohol or to what the Minister is doing on behalf of the people who pay the £102,000 which is marked down for industrial alcohol in his Estimate to-day.</P>
    <P>When the Minister in May last was dealing with the industrial alcohol proposal he passed on to another great venture, the turf proposal.  He said, as reported in column 916 of the Official Debates of the 11th of May:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We hope also to give considerable employment in the production of peat as fuel.  At present our efforts have been concentrated upon the methods of winning and marketing a first quality peat.  Considerable employment can be given in that direction, and a considerable improvement can be effected in the national accounts by reducing the imports of foreign fuel.  If various enquiries which we are undertaking at the moment into the possibility of marketing peat in another form prove that difficulties have been overcome <Col N="1706" /> and that a method of doing so has been invented, we will be able to establish an industry which will be by far the most important in the country, and which will provide us with a fuel not merely as good but better than coal.  Those are some of the things we are planning.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister asks the House to-day to pass an Estimate for £6,845, all for salaries for his peat fuel development. He indicated in his remarks that he was going to develop a central marketing organisation.  I do not know whether that means that there is going to be a Supplementary Estimate for additional expenses in connection with the central marketing organisation. The details that are given in the Estimate make no suggestion that the expenses of the central marketing organisation are included in the Estimate which is before the House.  The Minister is apparently not holding out any prospects of going ahead with that development in connection with the peat industry which he indicated on the 11th of May of last year as likely, if gone ahead with, to be the biggest industry in the country.  He tells us to-day that he is confining his proposals with regard to turf to the same kind of thing that went on last year.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Education, in the absence of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, was introducing the scheme last year this is what he said, as reported in column 578 of the Official Debates of 14th June:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government has been considering the possibility of developing our bogs on a large scale, thus giving a considerable amount of employment to people in the poorer areas of the country who are not reached, or who may not be reached, very often, by the setting up of other industries, the building of factories and so on.  These are often the poorest and most congested districts in the country, and the Government has been particularly anxious to do what it can to help the increasing population in these areas to find a livelihood.  We have taken steps, accordingly, to set up an organisation to bring about the <Col N="1707" /> development and the use of peat fuel. It is proposed to set up a small staff to carry out that work.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A fairly considerable amount of money was voted last year for it, and the fuel scheme began.  A considerable amount of money was spent on advertising. Quite a large number of sacks were purchased and distributed around the country.  Anyone who regarded the expected developments from the light in which the words of the Minister for Education would suggest they were going to take place, must have been pretty well astounded at the method of distribution of the sacks that were to be provided for the turf scheme which was going to assist people in out of the way districts where industry was not expected to show its face.  Seventy-five per cent. of the 86,000 sacks were distributed in Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Wexford.  If it is a fact that they were distributed to coal merchants in those places, it would be interesting to have some information from the Minister as to where exactly the turf came from.</P>
    <P>The only information we have as to how the scheme worked out is information that we had from the experience of the Board of Assistance in the City of Dublin.  It was stated by the Minister for Education at the time that the price which would be paid to persons delivering the turf in the sacks at a railway station would be about 10/6 per ton.  It was indicated that the railways would carry the turf at a flat rate, and that it would come at the same rate from Achill as it would from the Midlands.  The Minister for Defence, who was giving a hand to the Minister in the matter, said that, where coal was being used by people at 40/- a ton, turf at 24/- a ton would be just as good.</P>
    <P>When the Department of Local Government allocated £13,000 for the delivery of free fuel to the poor of Dublin to begin from December last, they found that they were not able to get any turf delivered to them during December, and that they were not able to get any turf delivered during January.  They wanted 450 tons per week, and not until the last day of <Col N="1708" /> January was a sod of turf delivered. What were the taxpayers asked to pay for the turf?  The quotation that the Dublin Board of Assistance got was that the merchants would distribute turf to the poor people in the city at 38/4 per ton inside the canal boundary, but that if the poor of Ringsend or Rathmines were being served under the scheme it would cost 40/- per ton.  The Minister has a Prices Commission and a Controller of Prices.  Some person put his eagle eye on the fact that bellmen selling coal in the City of Dublin were charging the unfortunate poor 30/- per ton for coal.  The Controller of Prices intervened and the Minister informed us in reply to a question the other day that the price of coal was reduced by 1/-.  The bellmen were made reduce the price of coal from 30/- to 29/- as a result of the intervention of the Controller of Prices.  But when the Dublin Board of Assistance considered that 38/4 per ton for turf, 40/- delivered in Rathmines, was a bit too much, apart altogether from what they had heard from the Ministerial Benches here as to what the price of turf would be and the price of its carriage, they submitted the matter to the Minister and the Minister told them that the price was reasonable.</P>
    <P>When the Supplementary Estimate was introduced, the Minister's great scheme was said to be an experimental one.  Is it in the experimental stage still this year, or have we come to the point at which the scheme will pay for itself?  Obviously the Minister has not reached the point at which the scheme is going to pay for itself, as he provides for an expenditure of £6,845 this year for propaganda purposes really, because I take it that the coordinating and linking-up work of the officials is a matter of propaganda and helping people out by advice and a kind of fosterage, rather than actually doing any work for them.  Assuming the taxpayer has to pay that, are we still going to be in the position that turf, delivered in the City of Dublin is going to cost 38/4, and 40/- per ton when delivered to the poor?  It was indicated by the Minister some time ago that the cause of these high prices is that the turf has to be delivered in small <Col N="1709" /> quantities.  It is delivered in small quantities and probably to the top of tenement houses.  But bellmen's coal, which has been forcibly reduced from 30/- to 29/- per ton, is delivered in small quantities, and when the Lord Mayor of Dublin organises a coal fund and distributes coal to the same class of people in the City of Dublin it is delivered in small quantities and delivered to the top of tenements. While turf costs 40/- per ton delivered in Rathmines, that coal can be delivered at 36/6.</P>
    <P>If, as well as assisting the scheme by voting £6,845 for propaganda and direct official assistance, this particular type of turf industry is also going to be assisted by the paying of these high prices from State funds, will the unfortunate people in the West of Ireland and in the out-of-the-way districts be informed, through some of the official machinery that the Minister has, and for which the taxpayer is paying, of the magnificent prices that can be got for turf in the City of Dublin?  If the taxpayers are paying 40/- per ton for turf for the poor of Rathmines and if the railway company are going to bring it from Achill at 6/- per ton, just as they would bring it from the midlands, I think that the people that the Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke about who are in out-of-the-way districts, where not much of the new industrial development is seen, ought to be informed by means of propaganda or direct approach that such a valuable market for their produce exists.</P>
    <P>On the threshold of this important year, almost the last lap of hope that the Minister would give the nation to understand it has in the race for industrial development, after industrial alcohol is turf, and that is the position up to the present of the turf scheme which the Minister speaks about.  The Minister has not said anything about cement and I feel that the cement industry ought to be put in the same category as the Minister's turf scheme and the industrial alcohol scheme.  I should like to know from the Minister what exactly he has to say about cement.  A final word might be said about turf.  There is a certain <Col N="1710" /> type of Gaelic Leaguer who goes to the Gaeltacht very seldom but who is called &ldquo;Lá breagh.&rdquo;  People down the country speak of this type as the &ldquo;Lá breaghs.&rdquo;  The Minister's turf scheme is certainly one of the &ldquo;Lá breaghs&rdquo; of our industrial development movement.  If the Minister thinks that anything is going to come out of this scheme for any of the people connected with the turf industry, I should like to hear him develop it in a serious way.</P>
    <P>The Minister, as I say, glossed over again his reference to the important function of his Department&mdash;the development and the direction of industry. He gave us no information, good, bad or indifferent, as to the classes of industry that have developed or their distribution, or any of the other matters that are troubling industrialists, such as juveniles, capital and aliens.  There is one thing that has characterised the Minister's attitude in the House in the matter of supplying information and that is that he either refuses it or prevaricates about it.  Various questions have been raised from time to time here dealing with a matter which is the most important part of his Department's work according to himself, and we have never got a straight answer from him on anything. The Minister was questioned in October, 1932, arising out of contradictory statements made by himself and the President at that time in different areas.  When I asked him in connection with statements made with regard to the new factories if he would state the address or location of each new factory, the class of goods produced, the amount of capital, nominal and paid up; whether the control was native or foreign, and the number of men and women, boys and girls at present employed, the Minister said it would take too much work to supply the information.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I will consider laying on the Table of the Dáil at a later date a report of the kind indicated in the Deputy's question.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A few months later the Minister developed the idea that he was going to have an industrial directory.  That was in January, 1933.  Fifteen months <Col N="1711" /> have passed since.  At a meeting yesterday of the body about which I spoke already, the National Agricultural and Industrial Development Association&mdash;I am quoting the <i>Irish Times</i>, but the Minister will find the very same remarks or, if not exactly the very same remarks, similar remarks with the edge taken off them, in his own paper&mdash;one of the speakers stated that they should consider the publication of a directory of Irish manufactures, and that it had been postponed because they had been told that action was about to be taken in other quarters.  The secretary of the organisation said that &ldquo;she learned on the previous day that the Free State Ministry for Industry and Commerce was publishing a directory, but only 2,000 copies at 2/- or 2/6, which would be bought in one day, whereas they intended publishing 250,000 free of cost, and these would have been published had they not been told that the Government was to publish the directory.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister has from time to time accused speakers in the Opposition of making statements that would undermine the confidence of the people in the Irish industrial development that was going on, but no one has done more to produce a want of confidence in the people than the Minister himself. As I say, as early as October, 1932, he was boasting about the number of factories that were here.  There were so many factories for the making of barbed wire and so many factories for the making of shovels, but he would not tell us where they were, because it might be unfair to the other people engaged in the industry.  Then other difficulties crowded around him.  He was induced to make statements that were not correct.  He was induced to call things factories that were not factories, and anyone who had any touch at all with the type of industrial development that was taking place in a way about which Deputy Norton had to complain, and under conditions that he called Babylonian, must have been concerned about what was going to happen.</P>
    <P>I put the Minister certain questions, <Col N="1712" /> first and foremost, to draw his attention to the fact that there were aliens getting into back-lane industries and undermining industries that were pretty well established here already and that had established a fairly decent standard for their workers.  The question arose particularly in connection with the furniture and upholstery industries, but the conditions existed in other industries too. Brought into contact with them as a result of the conditions in the furniture industry, I came up against a situation which I thought should be exposed, and I asked the Minister, in respect to these new factories, if he would say&mdash; this was in November last&mdash;how many of the factories, which he was boasting had been opened as new factories, were opened by persons with the names of Matz, Gaw, Lucks, Galette, Keye, Wigglesworth, Woodington, Vogel, Witstan or Whizton, Caplan or Caplal, Hastello, Silverstein, Boys, Mendelberg, Levins, Vereker, Minster, Michaels, Griew, Levy, Mennel, or Yaffe.</P>

      <P>The Minister replied and said that the answer to the first part of the question was four; that two factories were engaged in the manufacture of women's clothing, one in the manufacture of furniture and one in packing.  But even on his own statement he had already admitted another name in connection with the boot industry.  The Minister was, in fact, claiming as factories, at that time, so-called factories or establishments that were being run or were being claimed as factories by more than four of these persons, because in the wholesale ready-made clothing there were in fact persons with the name of Mendelberg and Matz.  There were a Levy and a Minister connected with the upholstery trade.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can tell the Minister he did claim it and that he had in mind these factories.  Take the furniture industry.  There was a so-called factory in the name of Levins, another in the name of Yaffe, another in the name of Griew.  Then in medical and veterinary preparations we had the names of Wigglesworth, Boys and Galette.  He had packing factories with the name of Gaw and Mennel, and a hosiery factory in which some of the owners were Vogel, Witstan and Caplal, and women's light clothing factories with the names of Michaels, Lucks, Hastello and Silverstein.  We would have got lists of the new factories and something in the form of an industrial directory earlier from the Minister, if he could reconcile his statement with regard to new factories with his dislike of showing that these were the type of people that were starting what were called at that time new factories.</P>

      <P>The Minister claimed them as new, and one of his difficulties in the preparation of an industrial directory was that while he would like to deny these names, he could not have produced his directory and show a list of factories that would have squared with his original figures. The sooner the Minister is prepared to tell us the bad as well as the good, in what is happening industrially, the <Col N="1714" /> better it will be for the sound development of Irish industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to drive the Minister to talking about the good.  I shall talk about the good and then work back a little bit.  The Minister says he has put 20,000 people into new industrial employment during the last two years, that he has been the cause of establishing 100 new factories, each employing more than 20 persons, and 300 new establishments that may at least be called workshops, each employing a number of persons but not as many as 20.  On the good side of things the Minister has said that he has finished his job in a certain number of matters.  These matters are glass bottles, soap and candles, sugar and confectionery, hosiery, wholesale clothing for men, furniture, constructional steel, wire manufacture, certain class of galvanised work and timber work as far as planing and dressing of wood is concerned.  He has done his job in these particular lines but, as far as any information he has given to the House goes, the only industry in which we can congratulate him, in bringing about increased employment, as far as he has told us, is in the hosiery line, in the boot and shoe line, and in motor bodies.  But he has given no information of any kind with regard to any of the other matters in respect of which, in August last, he said his job was done, that would enable us to congratulate him.  We can say, as far as boots and shoes are concerned, that employment has increased there from 1,205, the last figures that are available for our period of administration, to 2,450, the last figures quoted by him.  We can congratulate him on that new employment.  I do not think the Department's statistics for April are out, but, if the Minister was dealing with different operations of the Department, it would be interesting to know why some of the periodic returns are running further and further away from the date that ought to represent the date of publication.</P>

The value of imports for the first three months of last year was £209,553 and this year £264,265.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The explanation of the figure, if it includes rubber and other materials, is that there was an enormous quantity imported in the early portion of the year, so much so that we had to impose a duty by way of Emergency Order, in order to check down importation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>To give details: women's and girls' shoes of leather or skin show an increase from £51,212 to £57,930.  Light shoes, men's and boys', have increased from £50,320 to £68,545; light shoes, women's and girls', from £85,152 to £102,915.  There is a reduction in the case of men's and boys', heavy, from £11,394 last year to £9,641 this year.  Women's and girls', heavy, increased from £13,300 to £20,222 and there is a fall in the case of children's boots.  There is an increase in shoes of rubber and other materials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the exception of a small decrease in men's, heavy, and boy's shoes, and a small decrease in the case of children's shoes, in every branch of shoes that is separately enumerated in the Trades Statistics, there has been an increase of imports.  While praising the Minister for an increase of employment in the boot and shoe industry, I would like to know if he has any comment to make on the other figures. I would like to know also if he has <Col N="1716" /> any comment to make on the increased employment of 1,245 persons, when placed against the Fianna Fáil promise of increased employment for 5,801 persons in the boot industry.  The next thing the Minister, from the point of view of the numbers of persons employed, has to be congratulated upon is hosiery, where employment has increased, according to the last figures available during the period of the previous Administration, the figure being 1,237 in 1928, to 2,269, being the figures available up to September last.  Compared with the first three months of last year there has been an increase in the imports of hosiery, from £66,852 to £78,853 during the first three months of this year, and the increase of 1,032 persons has to be placed alongside the Fianna Fáil promise of additional employment in the hosiery line of 6,395 persons.  That is one critical remark against the praise given to the Minister in connection with the hosiery industry, that employment has increased by 1,032 persons against a promise of 6,395, with increasing imports in the first quarter of this year, although the Minister said in August last that his job was done.</P>

      <P>What I am concerned about is employment.  The Minister has given additional employment in the hosiery line.  His performance is less than one-sixth of his promise, and that is so a certain number of months after he told the House that his job was done.  As the Minister is looking for praise, the next bit of praise I will give him is that he has increased&mdash;I will not say at what cost&mdash;employment in connection with the motor bodies industry from 309&mdash; the last figures available during the term of the previous Administration&mdash; to 950, and then my praise stops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1717" /> I should be prepared to praise the Minister further if he would give us information to show that praise was deserved.  He has not given us that information.  I should certainly be prepared to withhold criticism for a reasonable period if he would undertake to explain, in respect of those industries of which he said, seven or eight months ago, that the job was done, what the position is from the point of view of wages, employment and capital invested.</P>
    <P>There is another side to this job-done business.  The Minister for Finance, when questioned last night about the position with regard to tobacco, said that considerably increased employment had been given. I suggested to him that that increase was not reflected in the figures issued in respect of the tobacco industry.  I find that I am borne out by the figures of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. On the 1st September last, the last day for which we have information, there were 72 fewer persons employed in the manufacture of tobacco than there were on the last day for which he has allowed our figures to be published&mdash;the 1st September two years ago.  In an industry which had only 500 persons employed in 1922, there were two years ago 2,317 persons employed.  The position in September last was that there were 72 persons fewer employed.  Nevertheless, the Minister for Finance tried to pass it off on us last night that there was a considerable increase in employment.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that, in respect of sugar confectionery, the job is done.  In fact, there were fewer persons employed in that industry in September, 1931, than there were in September of 1928.  In September, 1931, 5,096 were employed.  About 450 persons have been added by the Minister to this industry.  But the Minister has not only told us that that job is done, so far as the Fianna Fáil Government is concerned, he has told the House that employment and output have been doubled.  As regards shirt-making, the Minister has added very little to the increase by us from 410 in 1924 to 1,762 in 1931.  The Minister has added 304 there.  In furniture, we are <Col N="1718" /> told that the job is done.  But it is done without any additional employment being given.</P>
    <P>There has been a certain amount of propaganda as to the increased output in the manufacture of soap and candles. But there are no Ministerial figures to back up that argument.  There is a Ministerial visit and a speech suggesting that there has been great development in that particular line, but no figures, good, bad or indifferent, have been given to support the Minister's enthusiasm.  The Minister was very mild in his approach to the discussion of the Estimate for his Department to-night.  I ask him to face up to the situation and, in some industrial publication, to tell us about the industries in respect of which he says the job is done.  I ask him to pick out these industries and tell us what the position is, from the point of view of keeping the undertaking he gave the House when he started his policy of refusing information here with regard to industry. Will he produce his directory of Irish manufactures?  There is no use in the Minister in his glib, politic kind of way saying that criticism of his policy is detrimental to the credit of the country and to the serious development of industry here. What is detrimental to the proper development of industry here is the Minister's known policy of obscuring the position and prevaricating about it when he is driven to say something. I think that it is nothing short of a scandal that the Minister should have approached the situation by saying, in October, 1932, that he would consider the laying of a Report on the Table giving particulars of industrial developments, that a few months after he should have said that a directory of Irish manufactures was being prepared and that we should have the excuse from him recently that development is so rapid that the men in the office cannot keep abreast of it.  The Minister has been playing the part of obscurantist about this directory.  Was there any notification to manufacturers earlier than March of this year, when an advertisement appeared in the newspapers, that the Minister was preparing an industrial directory?  Will the Minister <Col N="1719" /> say that he approached manufacturers about the matter earlier than that?  I do not believe he can.  The secretary of an industrial organisation virtually suggested to-day that it was almost the first time he heard of this proposal.  When the Minister takes up an attitude like that with regard to an important publication, it shows that he does not take his responsibilities seriously and that he is doing a very considerable amount of damage to the Irish industrial position.</P>
    <P>The Minister should deal with the complaints made with regard to the employment of juveniles.  The suggestion that foreign contractors are excluding a number of native manufacturers from getting work in the country is a matter with which the Minister should also deal.  The complaint made, that many of the new factories are foreign controlled, is a complaint which ought to be dealt with by the Minister in view of his policy and of the powers he has taken to control the influx of foreign capital, so that it would not dominate and control Irish industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with considerable interest to the Minister's speech.  I do not know whether he was responsible for the form or the text of his speech or whether it was just one of those Departmental memoranda handed to Ministers, for the contents of which they are not always responsible. It struck me as being rather an extraordinary speech to come from the Minister.  I once knew a Deputy by the name of Lemass but whether he is the same as the Minister for Industry and Commerce, I do not know.  The Minister might as well have been addressing the House to-day as managing director or chairman of a million-pound company, because his whole review of his Department consisted of expressions of appreciation of what was being done according to industrial and commercial standards.  Listening to his speech, the delivery of which occupied more than an hour, I heard not a single word from the Minister about the social activities of his Department, nor did I <Col N="1720" /> hear a single indication given as to the measures of social reform which his Department propose to carry out.  Not a word was said about the human material engaged in the industries which the Minister was surveying.  We were told about peat, industrial alcohol, transport, airways and many things&mdash; all from the commercial standpoint&mdash; and not a single word about the human material engaged in these industries. One might have forgiven the Minister if he had spoken for an hour about what he proposed to do in the way of introducing new legislation regulating the use of factories and workshops. One could have listened to the Minister for two hours if he had told the House of the imperfections of the factory system.  One could have listened to him for three hours if he had told the House what he proposes to do with the sweat shops and child-farms that exist in the City of Dublin. One could have listened to him for four hours if he had told the House what he proposed to do in the way of shortening the working week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We did not hear a single word about the inadequate factory inspection and the exceptionally low fines inflicted for breaches of the Factories and Workshops Act.  If anyone breaks the regulations under the Factories and Workshops Act one may be satisfied that an offence is committed, but in reality it is almost impossible to get a conviction so wide are the loopholes and so unsatisfactory is the law in this matter.  The Minister knows perfectly well, and his Department has got plenty of complaints to show it, that factory inspection is entirely inadequate in the Free State to-day.  It was always bad.  Now the Minister tells us that there are 100 additional factories in which not less than 20 people each are employed and over 300 factories additional with less than 20 people, so that we have a total addition to our present factories of 300 or 400 factories.  Surely 11 industrial inspectors employed to carry out the work of inspection in the old factories, plus an addition of 300 new factories, is totally inadequate for the work.  I would ask the Minister, does he consider it possible to carry out factory <Col N="1721" /> inspection in the whole of the Free State with 11 inspectors?  Every trade union and every trade unionist who has any knowledge of the condition of the factories and workshops in Dublin to-day knows that the present inspectorial staff, under the Factories and Workshops Act, is totally inadequate for the duties that have to be discharged.  I think the Minister might have devoted some of the money that he is going to spend in the development of industrial alcohol in employing additional factory inspectors.  If he did so the benefit that he would confer upon the community would be much greater, I think, than will be conferred upon them by industrial alcohol.  There is a crying need for up-to-date factory and workshop legislation in the Free State. Anything can be called a factory in the Free State.  Work can be started in a kitchen, 15 feet below the level of the ground, and yet it is called a factory. It could be up in a loft and be called a factory.  It could be in a back yard and still be called a factory.  It could be in a building where the rain comes in from four sides and where there is no ventilation, no sanitary arrangements, no heating and yet it is called a factory under the Factories and Workshops Act.  If we have 300 additional factories in the country, and if we are to have more, I suggest to the Minister that that makes it all the more necessary, before further vested interests are created, that an effort should be made to introduce a Factory and Workshops Bill in order to regulate properly factory and industrial conditions and life in this State. Legislation should be introduced to regulate the size of the factory, to define what a factory is; to regulate the lighting, the heating, the ventilation and the cubic space, and to provide proper sanitary accommodation and rest rooms for the workers engaged in industry.  Not a word did we hear in the Minister's long speech as to what he proposes to do in regard to that matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy referred to the furniture industry.  Everybody knows that the position of that industry at the present moment is a perfect scandal. <Col N="1722" /> There are many very well regulated furniture factories employing adult male labour, paying trade union rates of wages.  These legitimate firms are handicapped in the open market by people from Whitechapel and Billingsgate starting in back yards and working with the aid of a few young children. They slap together a few pieces of wood, daub them over with polish, and then make them up with a mark on them in connection with Irish industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what trade mark they get.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is himself a Deputy for the City of Dublin, and he knows well what is happening in Dublin.  The new organisation known as the Federation of Irish Industries has a liaison officer between it and the Minister's Department.  He will tell the Minister that in the furniture industry a lot of sweated jobs have grown up, where young children are employed, where no decent wages are paid, yet, later on, when an Industry and Workshop Bill is introduced we will hear squeals going up from the owners of these shops not to be driven out of existence.  They ought never have been allowed to come into existence, and we should have had factories and workshops legislation to prevent such places as these from growing up.  I have no use for any industry that cannot pay a decent wage.  Many of these places carry on only by employing young workers under conditions that would not be tolerated in any Eastern, not to mind European country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows perfectly well that that is not true.  Most of the trade unionists in the Minister's own constituency will tell him that these institutions are not connived at by trade unionists.  Many of these trade unionists in his own constituency have asked the Minister to introduce legislation to ensure that industry should be carried on under proper <Col N="1723" /> conditions and that decent rates of wages should be paid.  These so-called factories are a menace to decent firms that pay decent rates of wages.  The Minister might well have devoted some part of his speech to that subject.  We know that there is a most cruel and inhuman exploitation of child labour in connection with these places.  Young girls who cannot secure any kind of clerical employment because there is a surfeit of this labour, are forced to go into these new factories, and are employed at diabolically low rates and exploited for a 54-hour or a 58-hour week at scandalously low rates of wages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave the Minister the information 18 months ago, and he knows quite well the conditions that prevail.  Let him send one of his eleven inspectors to investigate the conditions in these places.</P>

      <P>They have been set up under the trades boards, and if the employees are not properly paid their employers are liable to prosecution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not care whether the trade boards are used to justify this, but I say that the wages are scandalously low.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They are the rates the unions agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing of the kind. The chairman of the trades boards is here behind me.  What the unions are concerned with is getting the highest possible rate, but it is the chairman who fixes the rate.  Trade unions only regard the trades boards as a desperate remedy for a desperate disease.  No trade union in a well-organised industry would touch a trade board with a forty-foot pole.  The chairman of the trades boards, who is sitting behind me, knows that very well. The reason is, that trades boards go hand-in-hand with sweated rates of wages.  Then we had the Minister recently&mdash;apparently <Col N="1724" /> when he was allowed to express his own views he did it excellently&mdash;going off to a meeting of the Wolfe Tone Branch of Fianna Fáil in Trinity College and there talking of a social and economic policy.  May I say that I consider he made a very fine speech on that occasion, dealing with the way in which industry should be regulated and suggesting the lines upon which our economic development should take place.  He suggested, for instance, that in many countries it had, apparently, been found necessary to regulate and to introduce shorter working hours.  If I understood the Minister's speech correctly, he gave his benediction to a scheme for reducing working hours.  In saying that, I think I am fairly interpreting what the Minister said on the occasion.  But there was not a word in his speech here as to proposals from the Department of Industry and Commerce in connection with a reduction of working hours.  As I said on a former occasion in this House, it is nothing short of economic lunacy to have one section of the people working 48, 50 and, in some cases, 60 hours a week, while you have 80,000 people denied the opportunity of getting work.  Any sensible nation, not concerned with the mere exploitation of human beings, would do something to reduce working hours in order to ensure the absorption into industry of those who are unable to secure employment because of the very long hours worked by some.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pass on to a question touching a number of employees with the smaller bus companies.  I understand that the transfer of their passenger-carrying licences to one monopoly in the City of Dublin has been approved of, and that the transfer is likely to take place at a fairly early date.  Complaint is made by the staffs that, instead of securing employment with the company which is going to take over these smaller companies they are losing their employment, and that new staffs are being taken on by the merger company.  If that is so, it represents a very unsatisfactory state of affairs.  The Minister piloted the measure through the Oireachtas which makes that possible, and I suggest to him that he should <Col N="1725" /> come in at an early stage and use the good offices of his Department to try to secure employment for as many of the employees of the smaller bus companies as are likely to lose it under this merger.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the course of his speech, referred to the Trade Loans Guarantee Acts.  He mentioned that in certain cases a State guarantee had been given, and that in other cases it had been refused.  I would like to know from him whether, in considering applications from firms seeking the benefits of these Acts, any attention is paid to the rates of wages paid by them.  A particular industry in the County Kildare recently, I understand, got a guarantee enabling it to obtain a few thousand pounds at 2½ per cent. from a bank.  If my information, which has been published in the local Press, is correct, it surprises me that the State should guarantee a loan or facilitate in any way a firm of that kind, in which the wage for adults&mdash;men of 40 and 50 years of age&mdash;is less than £1 a week.  That seems to me to be nothing short of a scandal.  In some cases the wage paid by that firm is as low as 16/- and 17/- a week.  These figures have appeared in the local Press and have not been contradicted.  If it is possible for the Minister to do so, I suggest to him that he should recall that guarantee until such time as this firm pays decent rates of wages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The point that I want to put to the Minister is this: that in considering applications for trade loans there should not be a repetition of that class of case.  The advisory committee ought to make sure that if the State is going to assist industry it will only assist those which pay decent rates of wages and not those paying scandalously low rates of wages, such as the one I have just mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1726" /> Yesterday we had a discussion on boot factories and probably part of the discussion to-day will take the form of further references to boot factories.  I would like to know if it is within the knowledge of the Minister that some of these boot factories, ostensibly Irish owned, which have started here under the protection of tariffs imposed by this State in order to protect its own industries, have a very strong objection to trade unions taking any steps to protect the interests of the workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a national agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there may be a national agreement, but there is a conspiracy on the part of the people connected with some of those factories to prevent the workers joining the union of their own choice.  The Minister was at the opening of one of the factories that I have in mind.  The workers in it wanted to join a union of their own choice, as they were quite entitled to do, but they were told by their employer that they must not join that particular union; they must join another union, although the union they wanted to join was the one which, in the first instance, attempted to organise the workers.  The Minister ought to make it clear to those people that, if we do permit them to come in and use foreign money here because it is going to yield a substantial dividend to them, the workers of Ireland still have the right to choose the union they will belong to: that while these people are given the right to come in here to manufacture and sell boots they have not been given the right to buy the souls and the minds of our working classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two other matters in which I am keenly interested to which I desire to refer.  Would the Minister say what has become of the two pet Government rabbits&mdash;one of which is the decentralisation of industry?  That used to be a strong point in the Government's policy at one time though I never believed in it.  I do not believe in it now.  I do not believe that you can have decentralisation on the basis of competition.  You can <Col N="1727" /> have it on the basis of quotas and of co-operation.  Where, however, you are going to have industry run on a competitive basis, then the big business in the big town will prevent for all time any hope of the smaller industry developing.  If you want to have decentralisation in industry you must regulate it as you have regulated the flour industry.  You must have a quota system with a fixed output for each factory.  That is the only way in which you can decentralise industry.  You can never have it on the present basis of unrestricted competition.</P>
    <P>I would like to know from the Minister if the Government have given up completely any attempt to introduce industrial decentralisation by any means, including the means I have suggested of a fixed output per factory, or by some definite scheme of co-operation which will eliminate unrestricted competition.  So long as unrestricted competition continues it will kill any attempt at decentralisation in industry. The Government have had two years to show what the decentralisation of industry has done.  They have this baby of decentralised industry. If they want it to develop into a healthy economic citizen of this country they must, I suggest, nurture it on the lines I have indicated.  But if this child is going just to be what I am afraid it is, then the sooner it is killed and buried the better.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister now tell us how many new industries have been established in the last two years in County Kildare; how many have been established in Offaly; how many have been established in Leix; how many in Carlow and how many in Wexford?  Let the Minister tell us, under this policy of decentralisation of industry, what factories have been established in these five counties?  Will the Minister tell us the total number of workers employed in the factories so established there and the total number under the heads of men, women, boys and girls? Will he tell us what is the average wage paid to men, women, boys and girls apart from managerial salaries in the factories established in these five counties?  That would be a fair test <Col N="1728" /> of the efficiency and the effectiveness of the Government's decentralisation policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>And what is the capital?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is easy to ascertain what the capital is.  Have the Government abandoned all hope of decentralisation and, if not, what hope have they of ensuring that this child of decentralisation will live and thrive? None, so far as I can see.  A fair test would be to say what industries have been started in the past two years in these five counties I have mentioned. These, from the point of view of the Minister's policy, are five favoured counties, and if decentralisation is to have any growth at all we ought to begin to see its germination there. Then again there is the question&mdash; about which we have heard so much in the past&mdash;of the economic council. We heard a good deal about that from the Minister, who was very eloquent about an economic council, when he was on the Opposition Benches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  It was the President then.  The President, as the Leader of the Party opposite, used to tell the House frequently and eloquently about the necessity for the establishment of an economic general headquarters.  He used to tell them of it as something that would plan, something whereby a committee would be formed to help our industries, a piece of machinery which would be the eyes, ears and brains of our economic life. They have had two years now in which to create that machine, but not a single thing has been done to create that economic general headquarters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the extraordinary spectacle of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who, at one time, did not believe that the Tariff Commission should be composed of civil servants, now, apparently, converted to complete faith in civil servants as part of the machine to help to alter the economic and industrial policy of the country.  I give the Minister credit for an amazing amount of energy.  I <Col N="1729" /> give him credit for very good intentions industrially and economically, and for the enormous amount of work he does. But I am satisfied that a single Minister in charge of his Department of State cannot do all that should be done in this matter.</P>
    <P>The best way to do that work is through the establishment of an economic council, which will survey our industrial life and plan to improve its industrial needs and make sure that all its requirements are met at the earliest possible opportunity.  In any case, we are entitled to know from the Minister whether the Government has thrown over the principle of the question of an economic council or an economic general headquarters.  At one time that we were to have such a council was an important part of their policy. We are now entitled to know whether with decentralisation of industry that policy has been jettisoned.  I understand the Minister invited a discussion of unemployment assistance on this Estimate, and the Ceann Comhairle made no demur.</P>

      <P>It is with administration we are concerned.  Passing from the purely industrial and commercial work of the Minister's Department, I should like to ask him whether any decision has been arrived at in connection with insurable workers when engaged on arterial drainage schemes or employed on other schemes carried out by the Board of Works?  So far as I understand no definite decision has been arrived at in this matter.  I think something should be done to get a definite decision on the whole position as it is at present.  Many workers engaged on the Barrow drainage scheme have no reason to thank the Minister for the manner in which they have been treated.  There were 700 workers employed on these schemes. They are now unemployed and have no cards stamped.  I submit that their cards should be stamped while employed on that scheme.  They have been placed in their present position by the procrastinating attitude of the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <P>A number of test cases were selected&mdash;every class of case that would arise out of relief work.  One worker in each case was chosen. A decision was made as to whether or not his particular employment was to be regarded in that class as agricultural and, therefore, uninsurable or otherwise as insurable.  In the great majority of cases the decision was that the work at which they were employed was to be regarded as agricultural employment, and therefore uninsurable. Large works like the Barrow drainage scheme are in a different class altogether.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>Yes.  Every Deputy representing a constituency adjoining the Barrow area has been hearing complaints about cases of Barrow workers who are not eligible for insurance benefit, because their cards were not stamped.  I have advised these people to make application to the Department of Industry and Commerce for a test case to know whether they are insurable. The decision should have been given in these cases already.  When a workman goes into a particular job it is the responsibility of the employer to get the position there examined, and ascertain whether that man is insurable under the Act.  That decision should be there already in the case of the Barrow workers.  The workers should be able to produce in reference to a particular class of man a definite indication to show whether he is insurable or not.  I would like the Minister to get a return from the Board of Works as to the number of people who were employed on the Barrow drainage scheme, and whose cards were not stamped.  We should also like a return <Col N="1732" /> of the number whose cards were stamped, and for what period.  The Minister will find from that return that there were large numbers on the Barrow scheme who had not their cards stamped.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce knows nothing about it until the facts come before him for a decision.  It may be a number of workers engaged on the work were not in what would be insurable employment. I have no recollection that any point has been raised for decision in that connection by anybody employed on the scheme.</P>

      <P>Is it not the duty of the officers of the Department to see that the cards of those normally engaged in insurable employment are stamped?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is wrong in stating that his Department only comes in for the purpose of giving a decision.  Suppose I employ three carpenters in the City of Dublin and I say to them: &ldquo;I am not going to stamp your unemployment insurance cards and you are getting employed on that understanding.&rdquo;  They say &ldquo;All right; we are quite satisfied with that, sir.&rdquo; There will be no complaint made by me as the employer and there will be no complaint by the carpenters, because they have agreed.  Is the Minister's Department not obliged to take steps to ensure that there is compliance?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There were 700 men employed on the Barrow drainage scheme.  Large numbers had not their cards stamped and they think it is the job of the Department of Industry and Commerce to require the Board of <Col N="1733" /> Works to submit for decision every one of these cases in order to decide whether or not they were insurable.  If you decided one case that would affect a large number.  It is felt there is an obligation on the Department to get the Board of Works to produce exemption certificates in respect of these particular people.  That apparently was not done and the Minister's Department is responsible.  In any case, 700 employees on the Barrow scheme are now paid off because the job is finished. In the case of a large number there is no prospect of employment for a considerable time.  If the cards had been stamped in the ordinary way these people would have been entitled to unemployment insurance benefit which they are not now getting, either because the Minister's Department has not ensured compliance or the Board of Works have been allowed to get away with it pretty softly.  The Unemployment Assistance Act is a subject which will agitate a considerable number of Deputies.  I imagine Deputies from all Parties have their pockets choked with letters complaining of the delay in issuing certificates of qualification.  I can imagine that with such a large number of applications there must be some delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Norton has certainly covered the ground pretty fully on this Estimate, and he has succeeded in getting away without losing his scalp at the hands of the Minister.  I take it the Minister must have had some difficulty in repressing his feelings and not giving way to such an outburst as he gave way to last night, when he said to Deputy Anthony that any stick was good enough to beat an Irish industry.  Deputy Norton did not use an ordinary stick at all; he used a battering-ram.  Of course, the Minister could not let loose his feelings on Deputy Norton as he did upon Deputy Anthony, for very obvious reasons.  I sympathise with the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">

      <P>So do I.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite obvious that Deputy Norton, any more than Deputy Anthony, does not desire in any way to injure Irish industries or prevent their development.  It is equally clear that Deputy Norton, as well as other Deputies, does not want factories established and developed upon wrong lines.  We do not want them developed at the expense of the health of the juveniles of the country, and the employment of juveniles to the exclusion of the heads of families. However.  Deputy Norton and Deputy Mulcahy have dealt pretty fully with <Col N="1735" /> that aspect of the situation.  I want to get from the Minister some information regarding his activities with our old friends, the cement factories.  The Minister may remember that we had two or three measures here giving him power to establish cement factories.  I do not think that at the time we agreed as to the number of hands that would be employed as a result of the setting up of the factories, but the Minister was very anxious then to get the necessary power.  Eventually he got the power, but, apparently, we are now no nearer to having a cement factory, to having people employed in the production of cement, than we then were.  If the Minister did not state it explicitly, certainly by implication he led us to believe that all he required was to get the Act and immediately we would have at least one cement factory if not four.  I think the Minister mentioned four factories.  We would like to have a little information about the position with regard to cement.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to tell us whether during the last year any representations have been made to his Department regarding the development of the Slieveardagh coal mines in Tipperary.  Could he tell us if inquiries have been directed to his Department from persons interested in the development of these coal mines, what results have followed from those inquiries and, generally, what the position is at the moment and, in a nutshell, whether there is any possibility of any development of those coal mines taking place in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton touched upon another matter that I raised here on more than one occasion in the last two years, and that is regarding factory inspectors.  The Deputy, I think, mentioned that the number of inspectors at the moment is 11. We are told that we have from 300 to 400 more factories than we had two years ago but I think&mdash;I am speaking from recollection at the moment as I have not the Estimates before me&mdash; that we have fewer inspectors to-day, if Deputy Norton's figure is correct, than we had before the Government's <Col N="1736" /> push for industrial development took place.  I am quite satisfied, from information supplied to me and, in one or two cases, from my own personal knowledge, that there is not that close inspection that is necessary for the safeguarding of the conditions of work for the employees in the different factories, and that is necessary in some cases for the safeguarding of their lives.  I do not want to mention here in the House the cases that are known to myself personally, because I think it would be unfair to mention them here, but I do say&mdash;and the Minister may remember that I raised this matter on more than one occasion previously&mdash;that the visits of inspectors are not made as frequently as they should be made.</P>
    <P>There is just one point in connection with this matter of inspection that I would like to refer to.  I would like the Minister to deal with the question of whether or not action has been taken on reports made by inspectors. As far as one can gather from the newspapers&mdash;and after all we have to depend largely on the newspapers&mdash;I do not remember seeing a single prosecution under the Factories Acts made this year.  If the inspectors are doing their duty and are reporting infringements of the factory laws as, in my opinion, they should report them, and if the Department are acting on those reports, I am quite satisfied that there would have been a number of prosecutions.  I would like the Minister to give particular attention to this matter because it is a question not only of working conditions but a question, I might say, of the safety of human life.  I myself know a little about factory conditions and I know that it is a small thing that may lead to the maiming or perhaps to the killing of an employee in one of those small workshops or factories.  If the making of proper reports as to conditions in these factories entails the employment of an extra two or three or a half-dozen inspectors, then, I think, no question of expense should be allowed to enter into the matter. I have something to say on the question of unemployment assistance also but, as I understand that we are to leave that over for discussion on <Col N="1737" /> the particular Estimate, I will not refer to it here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether I am in order in raising the question of juvenile employment at this stage, but I should like, very briefly, to draw the Minister's attention to some figures that are rather alarming in connection with the employment of juveniles. Unfortunately for juveniles, emigration has practically ceased in this country.  That fact was a cause of misfortune to many of them who were not able to find employment at home and who used to go to other countries. Within the last three years emigration has ceased altogether and these juveniles have been thrown on the market here.  The figures to which I wish to draw the Minister's attention show a rather serious state of affairs. Last year&mdash;that is, the year 1933&mdash; fresh applications were received from boys&mdash;I suppose on leaving the primary schools&mdash;to the extent of 2,593, and for girls to the extent of 2,427. Those were fresh applications in the year.  There were already applications on the register from 272 boys and 181 girls, making in all, 2,865 applications for boys and 2,608 for girls.  The Education Committee was only able to find employment for 430 boys and 463 girls, leaving 2,435 boys and 2,145 girls without any employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of boys the employment that many of these got was as messengers. That leads to nothing.  There is a case here, I think, that particularly requires the attention of the Minister and his Department.  If these boys are allowed to go about without getting any employment it is demoralising to them and they are growing up without knowing anything at all of industry.  That is an unfortunate matter because the parents complain that they lose control of these boys who get demoralised after making a number of applications to different places and not finding any success.  It occurred to me that the Minister might do something in the way of the recommendations that were adopted by the Committee that was set up to report on technical education. That Committee recommended that something should be done in the way of continuation schools for those <Col N="1738" /> boys where they could be given some knowledge of industry so that, if any application were made, they would have some knowledge, because, as the Minister knows, employers will not take boys who have practically no knowledge of any industry.  They are not going to waste time teaching them. Modern industry cannot afford that time and the boys must be taught somewhere else.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I suggest that there is scope here for the Minister's Department to do something in the way of providing training schools for these boys.  The Minister may answer that that is a matter for the Minister for Education, but when I go to the Minister for Education he says that it is a matter for the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Evidently, it is somewhere between the two, and it would be well, I think, if they both could collaborate in bringing forward some scheme.  Employment for juveniles is getting more scarce year after year&mdash;that is, for juveniles of 14 which is the age when they leave the primary schools.  There are very few industries prepared to take them at 14, and the Minister for Education, of course, cannot see his way to raise the school age to 16 which would be very desirable.  On account of the condition of affairs in the schools they are all overcrowded and there seems to be no hope of raising the school age.  Large numbers of these juveniles are going wild and that is very unfortunate.  We see them all over the city at every street corner. It is a most unfortunate thing to think that there is so little employment for them.</P>
    <P>I draw attention to this matter in the hope that the Minister will be able to do something for them.  In the absence of any emigration or any hope in that direction, it seems to me that there is nothing to do but to adopt the proposal of continuation schools of the type envisaged by the Technical Education Committee in their report. It is a matter that is getting very serious on account of the numbers, year after year, for whom there is no employment.  In a recent report of those connected with the housing industry, it was mentioned that there <Col N="1739" /> was a shortage of skilled labour.  I do not mention that in any contentious sense but if there is a shortage of skilled labour in the building industry and there is a want of employment amongst the juveniles of our city, there ought to be some means of bringing the difference to an end.  There seems to be an opportunity of giving employment to a number of these and amongst them are many talented, able and bright boys for whom there is no employment at the moment.  I would direct the Minister's attention to the serious situation and ask him to get something done, both in the interests of the country and in the interests of the boys.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather surprised at the attitude displayed by the Minister here this evening in connection with the failure of his Department to insist on the stamping of unemployment insurance cards in the case of men who have been employed on major drainage schemes, such as the Barrow and other arterial drainage schemes.  The Minister is aware that, not alone since he became Minister but previous to his appointment as Minister for Industry and Commerce, this matter was raised year after year in the House and I hope I am right in thinking that the Minister, when this matter was raised last year, gave an assurance that the matter would be looked into at once.  I am satisfied, at any rate, that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance gave that assurance when the matter was raised as affecting the minor drainage schemes by Deputy Norton.  Deputy Norton is correct in stating that the number of people now affected by the failure of the Department to insist on the stamping of these cards is in or about 700, and I am aware that the Minister recently received a communication from the men, who, within the last three or four months, were employed on the Barrow drainage work in the Mountmellick area, protesting against the failure of his Department to provide the necessary application forms for unemployment assistance. There are a number of people destitute in that area at the moment and the board of health in the County of <Col N="1740" /> Laoighis have refused, since the 1st of April, to provide home assistance for people who otherwise would be entitled to it.  However, the mistakes of the past can surely be rectified in the light of the knowledge the Minister has now received and I hope the Minister will take immediate steps to see that the cards of men who are to be employed on arterial drainage work, for which a sum of £35,000 is allocated, in the coming year, will be stamped.</P>
      <P>I think that if the Minister has any right to insist on the stamping of unemployment insurance cards in the case of men engaged in other insurable occupations, he should give a good example by seeing that those who work for the State, and who are engaged in continuous employment by the State, will have their cards stamped in the same way or he should give his reasons to the House why it should not be done.  There is, in the opinion of the members of this Party, a clear case for the stamping of unemployment insurance cards in the case of all State employees who are continuously engaged on the same class of work for a given period.  These arterial drainage schemes cover in most cases a period of at least six months, and, in some cases, they cover a period of six months for a few years as in the case of the Barrow scheme. In the case of the Barrow itself, there is a sum of £6,500 to be expended in the present year and I hope that the matter will be looked into at once and that, in the case of all those schemes, proper and effective steps will be taken to see that the cards of men employed on those works by the State in future will be stamped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have received, as has every other Deputy, a considerable number of complaints alleging political preference in respect of employment on State subsidised works.  Personally, I do not think there is a lot in these allegations. They arise mainly from personal animosity between individuals living in an area, but I am personally very strongly of opinion that the time has arrived when the Department of Industry and Commerce, under whatever regulations exist at the present time, or will exist in the future, should be the medium through which all able-bodied <Col N="1741" /> men are recruited for works carried out by the State or by local authorities.  I have received complaints, for instance, in respect of works carried out by the Land Commission under the heading of improvement works.  I brought this matter to the notice of the Minister for Defence when he was in charge of the Department of Lands and Fisheries some time ago, and I pointed out to him, both by correspondence and by a certain case which I quoted here in the House, that individuals who had got holdings of land on estates which had been divided were given a preference for employment as against able-bodied men registered at the local labour exchange.  I think that, in the present circumstances, and for a long time to come, the able-bodied individual who is registered for work at the local labour exchange should get a preference as against the person who has got a holding on an estate which has been divided.  I should like to hear the argument against that and I hope that in the allocation of the work to be carried out under the sum of £250,000 which has been set aside for work of this kind during the coming year, the labour exchange will be the medium through which the men will be recruited.  I should like to hear the Minister arguing, if he can do so, in favour of preference being given to landholders in respect of employment on improvement works as against those who are registered for employment at the local labour exchange.  That is going on to a very great extent all over the country in connection with the expenditure of that particular money.</P>
    <P>Allegations have been made against county surveyors with regard to unfair treatment in the selection of men for public works in my area.  Whether there is anything in those allegations or not, I think it is simply a ridiculous state of affairs to find that a county surveyor, when carrying out road maintenance works out of grants provided by the Local Government Department, must recruit his men from the local labour exchange, whereas the same county surveyor, when carrying out works the money for which is provided <Col N="1742" /> solely out of rates, can select, in any way he likes, the men who are to be employed on these works.  It should be carried out either one way or the other and, in my opinion, the proper channel through which all these men should be selected for employment on works carried out by local authorities, is the labour exchange in accordance with the regulations existing at the time.  Speaking as a Deputy, I would be satisfied with the regulations that are made and accepted by a majority of the House and I think that if the Minister and the Government could see their way to insist on the recruitment of all classes of men for all works carried out by the State or by local authorities through the local labour exchange, every Deputy in this House would be relieved of the responsibility of dealing with a peculiar type of complaint which it is not for a Deputy in the ordinary way to deal with.</P>
    <P>At any rate, I certainly would not be receiving the number of letters I am receiving at the present time, and which should not be received by any Deputy.  The only way to deal with that matter is to have those people recruited through the labour exchange, thus saving Deputies and other people the responsibility and trouble of inquiring into petty personal complaints of this type.  I think I told the Minister quite recently, and I am sure the Minister's advisers will tell him in the very near future, that if there is to be an effective check against fraudulent claims under the Unemployment Assistance Act there will have to be some kind of continuous check upon the work of the people who normally would be entitled to claim unemployment assistance.  The only effective check you can have is to see that those people who look for work on public works, such as the Barrow drainage or arterial drainage, or land improvement work, should be employed through the medium of the labour exchange.  If you insist on that, you will have the most effective check possible upon those who desire to make fraudulent claims for unemployment assistance.  I think if the Minister's advisers look into the <Col N="1743" /> matter very carefully they will see it is the only way to have an effective check against fraudulent claims of that kind being made and sanctioned.</P>
    <P>Some short time ago I put down a question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce as to whether the Food Prices Commission had received any complaints, or made any investigation into the prices charged by butchers for fresh meat throughout the country. The Minister, to my surprise, informed me that only a few complaints had been made, but that the question of the prices charged for fresh meat, by butchers, to the consuming population of this State, had been referred to the Food Prices Commission for investigation. I read a statement recently made by a member of that Commission to a certain body in this country, consisting, mostly, of hotel managers, in which he indicated that, generally speaking, the food supplied in hotels was good, and that the prices were moderate.  I wonder did the gentlemen concerned realise, or does he realise even now, that the farmers are receiving about 1½d. or 1¾d. per lb. live weight for their fat cattle at the present time, whereas the local butcher in the provincial town is charging 8d. or 9d. per lb. for fresh meat, and in the City of Dublin and suburbs as high as 1/2?  The butchers, as far as I can find out, are the people who have made the most money out of the economic war, within the country at any rate.  I hope the Food Prices Commission, which were charged with the responsibility of investigating this aspect of excessive prices some time ago, will bring in their report in the very near future, and that the Minister will act upon whatever report is submitted to him by them.</P>
    <P>It is true that the consuming population, especially in provincial towns, are not overanxious to make complaints publicly as to the prices that are charged by the local shopkeepers or butchers.  The reason is fairly clear, I am sure, to Deputies representing rural areas.  The reason is that the people are &ldquo;in the books&rdquo; of the local merchants and butchers, and, therefore, they are not going to <Col N="1744" /> come before the Minister or before the Food Prices Commission and disclose the prices charged to them by the butcher who gives them their fresh meat &ldquo;on tick.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>If the consuming population for that reason or some other good &mdash;or bad&mdash;reason fails to discharge their duty even to their own families, as well as their duty to the community as a whole, I think the Minister has a medium through which those matters could be put right, and I hope he will give the Food Prices Commission more work to do in future than they have got up to the present.  I hope he will ask the Food Prices Commission to investigate the difference between the price paid for eggs to the producer in the country and the price charged to the consumer by the shopkeeper, for the same Irish eggs, in the shops throughout the cities and towns in this country.  I had hoped that this Food Prices Commission would be more energetic than what they appear to have been, and that they would make use of the power&mdash;which I presume they have&mdash;to initiate investigations into the prices charged for food.  At any rate, we have up to the present seen no report of the activities of that body, arising out of their limited number of investigations into the excessive or alleged excessive prices charged for food, such as fresh meat, bacon, eggs, etc.  Perhaps the Minister in his reply will enlighten the members of the House, and the people as a whole, as to the activities of that particularly important body; as to what reports, if any, he has received up to the present from the members of that body, and what steps, if any, he has taken as a result of any report so received.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated that he had a very wide review of subjects, and he touched upon some of them very lightly.  I want to ask him, in his reply, to go somewhat more fully into one particular item, namely industrial alcohol.  The reason why I think he ought to do that at the present time is that the Government are starting out on a very important venture and I <Col N="1745" /> should like to be quite sure that they have considered all the aspects of this matter.  Are they quite sure, supposing they find that they can produce industrial alcohol cheaply, that they are prepared to take their place in the distribution? What is the way that they propose to distribute the industrial alcohol?  The first question I should like to ask the Minister is how he proposes to deal with those particular companies which are manufacturing industrial alcohol?  Are they going to be run on commercial lines, and publish a balance sheet?  I think that, whatever excuse there is for State trading, there is absolutely none when no figures are available, and the losses are simply made up in the Estimates. As I said before, this is the start of a venture in the carrying through of which the Government presumably thinks there is some chance of success. I am neither a farmer nor a farmers' representative, and I do not want to say anything about the price of 35/- a ton which, I think, is the figure that the Minister indicated he was prepared to pay to the farmer for a particular type of potato.  I am only wondering whether the Minister is quite sure that when times get better he will not find that he has to pay a higher price for his raw material.  That is only one aspect of the matter, but there are other important aspects upon which I did not notice the Minister touching at all.  I believe he stated, or it was stated formally, that the Government hoped to produce this spirit at 1/9 per gallon at their factory.  I do not know whether I can ask the Minister if I am correct in that statement.</P>

      <P>Those who have been listening to the case made, or rather to the case that has not been made by the President on this particular Bill, are possibly looking forward, even at this late hour, to his realising the necessity of bringing forward, some argument in favour of the abolition of one of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Without going into the particular philosophy involved, but regarding it merely as a statement, the Constitution declares that the power comes from the people and that for legislative purposes it is vested in the Oireachtas.  Whether it is keeping a bargain with the people, without definitely putting before them, so that they can decide in the matter, the question of abolition of one of the Houses of the Oireachtas, and whether that is either a moral or legal procedure, I do not propose to discuss at present.  From a legal point of view, it is not a matter we can decide here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real gist of the case that the President has made up to the present is that the Government has been elected by the majority of the people and you must trust that Government; everything depends on that.  If you cannot trust either the good will or the wisdom of that Government there is nothing more to be said; but you must trust the Government.  That really is the whole gist of the case he has made; trust them to act well; trust them to act properly; trust them to act wisely.  I suggest&mdash;and this is not a question of mere words; it goes very far beyond that&mdash;that exactly the same argument can be used for getting rid of the Dáil; that all the people need do in a case of that kind would be to elect the Executive Council and to trust them; that there is no necessity until the next period of election comes round for having anybody <Col N="1747" /> who would keep them in check because, in the last resort, according to the President's argument, everything must depend on the Executive Council being trusted.  As I say, an argument of that kind could quite as easily lead to the abolition of the Dáil as to that of the Seanad.  Not merely that, but I suggest that, in practice, that is very easily what may occur. As I said on a previous occasion, there is a danger, and by no means a remote danger, that this House, being then the sole House of the Legislature, may be turned, as other similar one-Chamber systems have been turned, into a mere machine for registering the edicts of the Government.</P>

      <P>The President is terrifically keen on that; but if he had the slightest knowledge of the first attempt made in modern time to set up a unicameral system, he would know that that is precisely what happened.  I had hoped that in the time which has intervened since the last stage of this Bill the President might at least have looked up that particular point for himself.  The President knows that I have a certain objection to bringing purely professional matters into a House of this kind.  As the President might know, the outstanding example in the history of Europe of an attempt at a unicameral system was the three Assemblies in the case of the French Revolution.  A great deal of the failure of that particular movement was due to the dispatch that the President seems to be so keen on having in this particular case.  Even the most powerful of these Assemblies, namely the Convention, became a mere registering machine to carry out the wishes of the Committee of Public Safety, which was practically the Government of France at that particular moment.  So severe was the lesson that France was taught at that time that, though democracy had won out in France at that time and in subsequent periods in her history, she never repeated the experiment of a single Chamber.  There was one short period of a few months in 1848 in which there was a Constituent <Col N="1748" /> Assembly in France but, even thought democracy had been established there, never again did she go back to the disastrous experiment of a single Chamber.  I had hoped that in the meanwhile the President might have looked up these very elementary facts. As the President knows, I have an objection, as I said, to dealing with these purely professional matters&mdash; matters that could be quite as well known to the President as to anybody else.</P>
      <P>I should have imagined that the President would ask himself whether there is any country in Europe at present in which such power is proposed to be given or has been given into the hands of a single Chamber as he proposes to give into the hands of the Dáil.  There is not a single example. Where you have unicameral systems at present there are checks on those systems.  You have one in Finland, for example, but there the President, who is elected, not by the Legislature, but by a different system altogether, performs exactly the same functions as the Second Chamber does with us in the Free State.  Why have he and his Government, who on other occasions have been so keen on finding examples as justification for the various schemes of legislation, not brought forward examples here?  I shall leave out of account altogether countries like Costa Rica, Guatemala, China and Persia and places like these.  I do not know that the country wishes to follow the President in following their example.  Let us confine ourselves to Europe.  How many unicameral systems are there in Europe? If there are not unicameral systems in Europe as a general procedure, has the President ever thought of asking himself why that is so?  He cannot bring forward the ludicrous excuse that it is because the people had not come into their rights, because it is when the people had come into their rights that they insisted, in most cases in Europe, either on the retention or setting up of a Second Chamber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many constitutions at present in force in Europe are of quite recent creation&mdash;practically the creation of this century.  Yet, in most of these you <Col N="1749" /> have Second Chambers.  The one place in which the President might find some support for saying that the people &ldquo;have not come into their own&rdquo; in this respect would be Great Britain. As usual, with the members of that Party, Great Britain is identified with civilisation.  For them, British institutions are democratic institutions. They are the only political institutions to which they pay much heed.  But take the other countries. Why have they Second Chambers? Why have they found them necessary? They are democracies; they are not aristocracies; they are not bound down by tradition.  There are a few countries in Europe which have only a single Chamber in the Legislature.  What has been their fate?  Two of them have become dictatorships in the last couple of days &mdash;Latvia and Bulgaria.  Turkey and Esthonia&mdash;you will notice the countries &mdash;have practically a dictatorship.  In Finland it is quite true that they have not a Second Chamber.  I have, however, indicated already that the power of the President, who is not elected by the one Chamber, is practically identical with the functions performed by the Seanad in our State.  I cannot speak exactly about the form of government at present in Lithuania, but I know that a few years ago there was a dictatorship there.  It certainly is one of the most unsettled Governments in Europe.  Albania?  I am not quite clear whether it has a Second Chamber or not.  Spain?  Does the President want us to follow that example?  They have a unicameral system, but there are checks even there on the single Chamber so far as constitutional amendments are concerned.</P>
    <P>These are the examples in Europe that the President would have us follow.  Let him ask himself, or let those who support this measure ask themselves, if there are not unicameral systems in most of the other countries in Europe, why is it?  Why did these people think it wise to have a Second Chamber?  Even a very radical French statesman had to point out&mdash;and he was quite as radical as the President would wish, quite as radical as his friend, the Abbé Siéyés ever was &mdash;speaking at a later period, with <Col N="1750" /> a long experience behind him, that the Republican Constitution in France had to be saved by the existence of a Second Chamber. &ldquo;Give us a perfect Second Chamber and I shall adopt it,&rdquo; says the President.  That was meant as a serious contribution to a constitutional debate.  The President must know perfectly well that such a demand is absurd, that, as I have said already, outside a glass case you cannot get anything of the kind.  Only his friend the Abbé Siéyés could produce a constitution of that kind.  He was the only person able to do it and, as I have said already, his constitution did not work.  You cannot have any legislative Chamber against which objections cannot be made&mdash;either a First or a Second Chamber.  Objections can be made against all of them.  None of them can have the mark of perfection that the President demands.</P>
    <P>This Bill is slightly different from the Bill introduced.  Two amendments, the value of which the Opposition at the time discounted, have been introduced. I should like the House to consider why these amendments alone have been introduced.  Are the other rights of the people that are now to be at the mercy of the Dáil and therefore of the Executive Council, because that is what it comes to in practice, any less fundamental?  The independence of the judiciary is important. The independence of the Auditor-General is even of some importance. But there are other rights of the people that should be looked upon as equally fundamental&mdash;that is, if the Government of this country is to continue as a constitutional democratic Government&mdash;certain rights for which there is no guarantee if the Executive Council want to trample on them in the morning; certain rights in respect to which there is every sign that, once they have the power, they are determined to trample upon them; certain rights that the President, whilst he gave a nominal acceptance to them, took good care he was not going to observe in practice and took good care that he would not preserve.</P>
    <P>Although he acknowledged that there were certain fundamental rights <Col N="1751" /> in that way, he took no steps to safeguard them.  All apparently was to depend on the goodwill of the Government, as if the very purpose of the Constitution is not to put a check on Houses of Parliament and on Governments. That is one of the main purposes of a written Constitution.  The President ignores that as one of the purposes.  Again, everything must depend on the goodwill of the Government as to whether the fundamental rights of the people of the country are to be preserved or not.  It must depend on whether the Government and their machined majority decide so or not.  Does anybody who has been in attendance at this House expect that the Government will receive any opposition from the majority which it has at the present time, if it determines to wipe away all these fundamental rights of the ordinary people in the Constitution?  The President spoke of reaching bedrock.  Well, there should be plenty of what is bedrock in this Constitution.  It is rather difficult to imagine a democratic Constitution that will not safeguard these rights.  Why is he not doing it?  Why is he obstinately refusing to do it?  From various remarks that he let drop about the judges we had reason to apprehend his conduct, so far as they were concerned. They hampered the Government just, I presume, as the Bishops were &ldquo;misled,&rdquo; and are still apparently misled, about Communism and other things, &ldquo;but he learn'd them.&rdquo;  But it is not a mere matter of inference so far as these fundamental rights are concerned.  The whole action of the Government, since last August, is ample proof that one of the reasons why the President does not guarantee these rights and refuses to guarantee them, is that he, his Government, and his machined majority are determined to trample upon them.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious, I should say, from this debate, from the attitude taken up by the President, from the arguments that he put forward, from the fact that on the whole he has put forward very few arguments, that he has no conception <Col N="1752" /> whatever of the constitutional rights of the ordinary people of this country.  As long as he is in power he does not think that any guarantee is required for the continued existence of these rights.  That is the very negation of democratic constitutional government, that ignoring of the idea that Governments must have checks put upon them, whereas that is the purpose, and one of the fundamental purposes of the Constitution. If does these things at a time when he professes to believe that this is one of the most peaceful countries in the world, what is he likely to do in times of excitement? The introduction of the very Bill itself is proof of what the Government can do in a fit of bad temper.  If the position becomes what the President may consider more serious, there are no limits to which we should not expect the Government to go in pursuit of its policy.</P>
    <P>The whole rights of the people are, undoubtedly, put in jeopardy.  The very refusal of the President to guarantee these rights, except at some distant date, justifies the gravest apprehension as to the purpose behind this Bill.  There is no respect for constitutional rights.  He treats the Constitution as if it were Dutch cheese, that he can split up any way he likes, as the Minister for Agriculture treats the calves, and as the Minister for Local Government treats the counties. These things amount to nothing.  The rights of the people are just as sacred in the eyes of the President as the calves are in the eyes of the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;not a bit less, and not a bit more.  What does he really want? Does he want a working Constitution? It is quite obvious from his speeches that he does not.  First of all he wants no Constitution.  He wants complete and unfettered control of the country by the Government, and by the Party that supports the Government.  If he has an idea of a Constitution, it is not of an organically working instrument; it is simply a formula of some kind, a thing that can be put down on paper. If he could find a formula he would be satisfied, whether the formula would give a working institution, or give a <Col N="1753" /> machine that would refuse to go.  That would be a secondary matter in his eyes, and in the eyes of the Government. The whole line that he and his Government have followed all through has been to abolish and to destroy.  He alleges as a reason that he wants to have a clear foundation, that he is going to build up.  But, it should be quite obvious to anybody, as revealed during the various stages of this Bill, that, in fact, there is nothing to build up.  There are no rights that the people can rely upon.  There are no stones by which the new edifice is to be built up.  The work of destruction. I have no doubt, he may complete.  We have yet to see some sign of the ability to build either constitutionally or economically, so far as this country is concerned.  The matter is something more than whether the present Seanad should go or not.  What is really at stake&mdash;and I think no one could make this clearer than the President&mdash;are the rights of the ordinary citizens.</P>

      <P>When the British Parliament Act was brought in, reducing the powers of the House of Lords, it contained a preamble announcing that it was intended to proceed to a reconstitution of that body at some early date.  By a curious coincidence, when the President invited us some months ago to reduce the powers of the Seanad, he simultaneously informed us that the Government was going to devote itself to a period of hard thinking about what a Seanad ought to be.  I pointed out, on the Second Reading of the present Bill, that, like the authors of the Parliament Act, the Government had departed from their intentions in that particular, and I quoted a statement made by the President himself as to his reason for bringing in this Bill.  I will quote it again from column 3212 of the Official Debates:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I brought in this Bill to show the country the extent to which opposition to the elected Government of the country can be carried on when playing this game.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That rather vaguely worded declaration is, at any rate, illuminating as to this, that the Government brought in this Bill because it was in a temper. That is why it brought in this particular <Col N="1754" /> Bill, and that is why it chose the particular moment it did choose to bring it in.  It is worth while considering again whether there was justification for the Government for departing from the method of calm reflection which we had been given to understand was to be adopted, and following instead the strong-arm method represented by this Bill.  The ground given is that the Seanad was acting so outrageously that something spectacular had to be done.  I want to ask Deputies on the opposite benches to consider fairly and candidly whether there is justification for this anger with the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The Seanad is accused of three crimes since the present Government came into office.  I think it is not denied that since the present Government came into office the Seanad has passed many measures that were antipathetic to it, many measures that it cannot have at all enjoyed passing. But it has rejected three Government measures&mdash;the Extension of the Local Franchise Bill, the Oath Bill, and what is known as the Blueshirt Bill.  I maintain that these are measures the Seanad could scarcely have passed if it had any regard for its duty to the country.</P>
    <P>As regards the Local Franchise Bill. it has been quite freely admitted that no place was found for it, even in the very swollen programme that Fianna Fáil put before the country in the election of 1932.  Room was found for a great many matters that have since been dropped.  A great deal of Fianna Fáil policy has been thrown overboard. and, in some cases, perhaps so much the better.  In other cases one regrets it.  At any rate, no room was found for this particular bit of policy.  After all it was a novel principle that the local elections franchise should be given to people who do not pay rates.  I can see nothing at all for the Government to complain about in the Seanad's action in throwing out that Bill. especially when it is recollected that, even as things stand at present, the throwing out of the Bill by the Seanad means only a comparatively short delay before it passes into law if the Government remains in office and persists with the measure in question.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1755" /> Then, as to the Blueshirt Bill, you have got to remember that that Bill was the last stage in a whole series of measures of a coercive character, directed against a wing of the official Opposition.  You have got to remember that that series of measures was in violent contrast with the Government's own statements of principle before they came into office; that whereas the Government had recommended methods of patience and brotherly love in dealing with turbulent elements of the community who had actually committed crimes, they were now asking the Seanad to acquiesce in methods of a very different character, applied not to people who had committed crimes but to people who were merely suspected of being about to commit crimes.  A measure similar to the Blueshirt Bill was introduced only a few days ago in the British House of Commons and, though there is probably no country in Europe where there is so little sympathy with Fascism, or so little sympathy with anything in the nature of militarisation of politics as there is in Great Britain, nevertheless only a handful of people were found to support that Bill, because it was argued, with the good sense which is, after all, characteristic of British democracy, that the forces of the law were quite adequate to deal with any crime when it came to be committed and that the effect of passing a sensational measure of that kind would be more to encourage and to stimulate the Fascist agitation than to injure it.  We on this side of the House entirely deny that the organisation called the League of Youth is a Fascist organisation.  We maintain, on the contrary, that that organisation have saved Parliamentary government in this country by saving the essentials of Parliamentary government.  But even assuming that the Government took the view they said they did of the aims of that organisation, they have utterly failed to show that any dangers had arisen which were not capable of being dealt with by the ordinary law.  That is all I propose to say about the Blueshirt Bill.  Obviously, we cannot discuss in detail the various measures with <Col N="1756" /> which the Seanad dealt.  The point I am trying to make is that it was a very natural Bill for the Seanad to hold up, that it represented a new departure in public policy and a violent departure from the principles which members of the Government had themselves enunciated before they came into office.</P>
    <P>The third measure in respect of which complaint is made of the action of the Seanad is the Oath Bill.  When the Fianna Fáil Government came into office in 1932, they had, as I said, an enormous programme&mdash;a very long list of items.  It was extremely doubtful which of these items should be regarded as having been mainly responsible for their victory at the general election.  The propaganda of the Fianna Fáil Party for the removal of the Oath had insisted, I think, on two things.  One was that the Oath could be removed without a breach of the Treaty and without creating serious trouble with Great Britain.  The other was that the effect of the removal of the Oath would be to reconcile to our Constitution elements in the country not hitherto reconciled to it.  Before the Seanad was called upon to deal with the Oath Bill, these two propositions had been demonstrated to be untrue.  The Oath Bill was creating great annoyance in the minds of the British Ministers.  It was obvious it was going to lead to trouble.  On the other hand, the elements whom it had been hoped to reconcile to the Constitution were declaring at the tops of their voices that the removal of the Oath was going to make no difference to them, that they would still deny the legality and authority of this Legislature. In view of these facts, in view of the very serious consequences that seemed likely to ensue to the country and to the prosperity of the people by the passing of the Oath Bill, the Seanad were fully justified in holding it up.  The President says that the second general election resulted in a still more decisive verdict for the Government and that after that, at least, the Seanad should have given way and passed the Bill.  I cannot accept that proposition either because, after all, on the second occasion on which the Seanad had to deal with the <Col N="1757" /> Oath Bill there was no question of delaying it.  As a consequence of the general election, the Seanad had now become powerless to delay it.  In casting their votes on the subject of the Oath Bill, there was no reason why Senators should think of anything beyond what they believed, each one of them, to be right.  There was no reason why they should vote against their consciences and against their convictions, seeing that the verdict of the country &mdash;if it was the verdict of the country&mdash; was going to be carried out in spite of them.  It would merely look as if they were renegades to their principles if they had voted for the Oath Bill, without any real motive for doing so, after voting against it on the previous occasion.</P>
    <P>These are the principal crimes alleged against the Seanad, and these are the excuses by which the Government seeks to justify its petulant conduct in bringing in this particular Bill at this particular time.  I submit that nobody who considers the matter fairly can attach any value to these excuses.  The Seanad acted reasonably and rightly in the performance of its functions as a Second Chamber of the Oireachtas.  That disposes, I think, of the suggestion that there was any need for haste or any call for sensational methods in dealing with this question.</P>
    <P>There remain, of course, the general question of the suitability of the Seanad, as at present constituted, and the general question of the desirability of a Second Chamber.  To my mind, the strongest argument against our present Seanad is that it was too subservient to the Cosgrave Government. I think that that is true.  I think that it was too subservient to the Cosgrave Government.  But that is a fault for which very strong excuses can be found.  Consider that the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;the bulk of them at any rate&mdash; had been in arms against the State not very long ago.  Consider, further, that among the institutions of the Irish Free State which had been most violently denounced by the Fianna Fáil Party and those associated with them was the Seanad.  It is easy to understand that the Seanad was more violently prejudiced against one of the great Parties in the State than, <Col N="1758" /> frankly, one would have wished them to be.  I think Deputies opposite might, perhaps, consider whether there is not a good deal in that point, and whether, if things went on without constitutional change of the sort proposed here, it is not quite possible, with the existing membership of the Seanad, that it would function more as a check upon whatever Government might be in office than in the past.</P>
    <P>But, of course, the Seanad is not going on with its present personnel, because a system of election has been adopted, with the connivance, or at the instigation, of the President himself, which cannot fail, in my opinion, to have a bad effect upon the personnel of the Seanad.  Speaking merely for myself I say, quite frankly, I would not be content to leave matters indefinitely as they are with regard to the Seanad. I think as things stand, and with the method of election now adopted, the Seanad must degenerate.  It must consist more and more of politicians, of people actively associated with political Parties, and elected to the Seanad by the nomination of those political Parties.  Whatever else is done, or left undone, I, personally, would wish to see that changed.</P>
    <P>We heard a good deal in the course of this debate of the various constitutions in various countries.  It is quite true, as Deputy O'Sullivan pointed out, that there is a very decided majority in favour of the bicameral system as opposed to the unicameral system. Personally, I do not feel quite as much impressed as I might otherwise be by the example of foreign countries, owing to the fact that during the past ten or 15 years, ever since the European War, it can hardly be said that constitutions in general have been working well.  I would be much more affected by an examination of our own internal condition than by an examination of other countries.  I imagine the place where, on the whole, democracy continues to work best, is Great Britain.  In Great Britain there is, perhaps, the most illogical Second Chamber of all&mdash;a Second Chamber founded upon the hereditary principle.  Perhaps it is worth noticing that it should be in a country where the Second Chamber is founded upon so <Col N="1759" /> very undemocratic a principle that, in point of fact, democracy seems to work best.  It is a very odd thing, at first sight, but I take it the reason of it is this: That democracy has certain inherent faults, and that these faults are mitigated by the insertion in the constitution of checks of an undemocratic kind, or of a not wholly democratic kind.  But when we consider sometimes how much damage the House of Lords has done to the British Empire in years past, say, by its opposition to Catholic Emancipation, by its opposition to parliamentary reform, by its opposition to the disestablishment of the Irish Church and, above all, by its opposition to Home Rule, one cannot be very enthusiastic about the House of Lords either.</P>
    <P>I think, however, that it is worth while, when considering the general question of a Second Chamber, not to devote all our attention to the defects of the existing Second Chamber or any other Second Chamber which might be devised, but to think about our own defects as well.</P>
    <P>I know it is the fashion to talk of the Dáil, as if it was an ideal Assembly, a microcosm of the nation, reflecting everything in the nation that deserves to be reflected.  But that is not really facing the facts.  Nobody who has experience of electioneering and does not merely pass a sponge over this experience can really be so enthusiastic about the merits of this Chamber, or any other democratically-elected Chamber.  We know, and cannot deny it if we are candid, what an enormous part clap-trap plays in securing election in many cases.  We know how many empty assurances are given; we know what promises are made, and are not carried out; we know how candidates for the Dáil play down to the prejudices and passions of the people. It would be rather painful to compile an anthology or collection of sayings by members of all Parties.  We have had specimens of such an anthology, from time to time, when Deputy McGilligan digs up the past of members on the opposite benches; and quotes the things they said at Grangegorman and elsewhere, things that make everybody laugh, they are in such violent contradiction <Col N="1760" /> with the actual facts, and the subsequent actions of the Deputies who made these statements.  But I do not claim, though I hope we have less on our conscience upon this side of the House than Deputies on the other side, that any Party has a monopoly of speeches of that kind.  I am sure we have all heard, from time to time, on our own platforms, things we would much rather not have heard.  If we were really what we purport to be&mdash; a true reflection of the wisdom of the nation&mdash;and could regard ourselves as a body that was in every way satisfactory and that realised the most optimistic estimate of what democracy ought to be, then we might begin to think that a Second Chamber was unnecessary and cumbersome.  But such is not the case.  We have our defects; and another body assembled on a different principle&mdash;whatever that principle may be, but anyhow on a different principle&mdash;from us, even though it has defects, and many defects, may be very valuable as a check upon our defects.</P>
    <P>I personally would like to see a law that only a small proportion of members of the Seanad could be persons who had been candidates for this House or had been members of this House.  I would like to see members of the Seanad unpaid, because I would like to see a Second Chamber consisting of a body that was less professionally political than ourselves.  I would wish, of course, that their expenses should be paid so that poor men could belong to it just as well as wealthier men.  But I see nothing undemocratic in principle in non-payment of members of the Seanad any more than of members of county councils.  After all the Seanad meets, on an average, only 35 times a year, and, I suppose, the average member does not attend more than 26 times a year, in other words, once a fortnight, and then for only the afternoon, from 3 o'clock to 7 o'clock.  I cannot believe there would be anything undemocratic in having duties of that sort performed without payment, other than reasonable expenses because of taking a man away from his other occupation. If that were done, and the <Col N="1761" /> system of election changed, and such restrictions introduced as would prevent a Second Chamber from becoming a body composed of party politicians, many of whom would otherwise be discarded, I think that would be a very great improvement not only upon the situation as it is now, but on the situation as the President proposes to make it by this Bill.</P>
    <P>The President talks of clearing the foundations before proceeding to build something better.  That is a misleading metaphor for him to use, if I may say so, because there is nothing whatever in the continued existence of the Seanad to prevent him and his colleagues from thinking out something better&mdash;nothing at all.  They can do their thinking or they can get other people to do some of it for them by having a parliamentary committee or a commission composed of people from outside the Oireachtas.  Whatever procedure they choose to adopt they can do their thinking about what a Second Chamber ought to be just as well during the continuance of the present Seanad and without the introduction of this Bill as they can do it after the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I come, finally, to an aspect of this Bill which has for me a special importance.  I referred to it on the Second Reading and the President made some remarks about it in his speech concluding the debate on the Second Reading.  I refer to the question of Partition.  The President said that that was a matter only accidentally associated with this measure.  That, in a sense, is true, but I regard this measure, nevertheless, as having a very considerable bearing upon the question of Partition. I am proud to recollect that it was the Centre Party which introduced in this House a motion to the effect that the reunion of the Irish nation, by the consent of all concerned, should be the fundamental aim of Irish statesmanship, and that every constitutional issue ought to be subordinated to that.  The motion in question had a chilly reception in this House, but nobody could be found actually to oppose it, although the President said that he refrained from <Col N="1762" /> opposing it on the strict understanding that it meant nothing at all.  Now, it seems, that even Deputies opposite have come to believe that that motion did mean something and that it is worth while thinking about Partition in connection with constitutional measures here that may affect the minds of people in the North.  I am glad that the President took that aspect of this Bill seriously, although from my point of view he aggravated his original offence in bringing in this Bill by associating it with some further constitutional action that he proposes to take some day in connection with the King.</P>
    <P>The President must know just as well as I do that language of that kind has a bad effect upon Northern Unionists. He knows that, but he argues that we cannot make any progress on the Partition question until we get down, as he says, to bed-rock, and allow Northern Unionists to see in practice what the sort of State is which we shall invite them to join.  Now, I confess that I have a certain amount of sympathy with that argument.  I have indeed urged myself on several occasions that a Republic in prospect is at least as great an obstacle to reunion with the North of Ireland as a Republic in actual being can be.  As long as one of the big political Parties in this country is committed to Republicanism, so long must Partition endure, and so long is it impossible for the Opposition even with their policy to make any headway against Partition. In fact, if speakers in our Party took the line on public platforms that it would be time enough to think of a Republic after we had got rid of Partition, I consider that we would be doing harm instead of good.  At any rate we can make no headway at all along these lines.  We shall only make headway in the matter of Partition when we get together&mdash;both the big political Parties&mdash;on the basis of discarding Republicanism, and that is why I, for one, hope against hope that many years will not have passed before we have a coalition Government in this country on that basis.  The discarding of Republicanism is something that probably could not be done without a <Col N="1763" /> national Government in this country; just as national Governments have performed tasks elsewhere which could not have been performed without a national Government.</P>
    <P>The President's phrase about getting down to bed-rock has, therefore, a certain amount of appeal for me.  It should be realised that what the President says is a declaration for a Twenty-Six County Republic.  That is what it comes to, because that is the only sort that can be achieved by our action, and if there is no way of getting Republicanism out of our system except by having a Twenty-Six County Republic, let us have it.  If members opposite are right as to its glories, well then the North will have an opportunity of seeing it in operation and will be attracted into it.  If we are right, and if the Irish people find that we are right, in thinking that there is absolutely nothing in a Republic&mdash; that it has nothing at all to give us&mdash; the sooner we have it, then perhaps the sooner we will learn sense, and will be prepared to discard it, to unite with the North as one nation on another basis.</P>
    <P>But when it comes to a series of measures tinkering with the Constitution&mdash;measures such as this Bill and further Bills that are threatened to eliminate the Crown&mdash;that does not evoke a shred of sympathy in my composition, because it is merely playing politics.  The President says that he dislikes it himself.  If he dislikes it why does he do it?  I have never heard any intelligent explanation as to why we should have a series of pin-pricking measures that are to lead up some day to a declaration of a Republic.  The President keeps on hoping for the day when he can do the real thing.  Why this attitude of patient yearning?  Why did he not ask for a mandate?</P>

Deputy MacDermot has reopened that discussion, and is not in order in so doing. On the Fifth Stage Deputies are confined to advancing reasons why this Bill should or should not now pass.

      <P>Certainly not.  I regard what I said as entirely relevant to this measure, but I was doubtful as to how far on the Fifth Stage it would be regarded as permissible by the Chair.  I will therefore close what I have been saying about this matter by just one remark&mdash;that the President reminds me of nothing so much as a reluctant bather on a cold day who keeps dipping his toe in the water for the purpose of convincing his admirers that he really is going to take the plunge.  That is the impression that is made upon my mind by this series of constitutional measures that do nothing except exasperate, that achieve no useful purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I oppose this Bill.  I wish the Government would think better of it and drop it.  I oppose it because I consider that the complaints which have been made against the Seanad are not justified for the reasons I have given.  I oppose it because I consider that democracy is not such a perfectly working institution that we can dispense with certain <Col N="1765" /> checks upon even such a meritorious Assembly as this House.  I oppose it because this Bill and similar Bills and the language used in support of these Bills do a great deal to postpone the day when Ireland will be reunited in one nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, should not pass or should pass.  From my point of view should not pass.  I propose to adopt a phrase the late Kevin O'Higgins used on another occasion when he said of a measure that was introduced: &ldquo;This Bill should not pass because it is a bad Bill, a useless Bill and an unnecessary Bill.&rdquo;  Deputy Professor O'Sullivan, deference to the oft-repeated wish of the President and the Attorney-General, allowed himself to lapse from one of the principles of his professional life, and he gave us a slight glimpse into history.  If he had allowed himself to lapse a little more, Deputy Professor O'Sullivan, who is a Professor of History, would have told the President and the Attorney-General that he could find an example of the unicameral system, and the things that evolved from that system, much nearer home than the French Republic.  He could have referred the President and the Attorney-General to Cromwell because my recollection&mdash;and I am speaking now as an ordinary individual and not as an historian&mdash;is that Cromwell was the first to try out the unicameral system.  He tried it a long time before the Abbé Siéyés tried his system on the French people, and it led to certain consequences with which to use a much quoted phrase even every schoolboy is familiar.  It led to Cromwell becoming a dictator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pretty similar reasons to those which led Cromwell to discard the principles of unicameral Government have led in recent days to the Latvians and the Bulgarians discarding their bicameral system of Government.  If the President and the Attorney-General <Col N="1766" /> wish to go back to the roots of history they can find a good example of the evils or, if they like to call it so, the good of the unicameral system.  You will find the evils of this unicameral system, if you are against dictatorships, in the fate that overtook the Long Parliament and its successors. and if you are in favour of dictatorship you will find that the setting up of the unicameral system is the easiest road to the creation of a dictatorship.</P>
    <P>There is no topic on which I have less rigid theories or a less rigid conception of ideas than on the benefits of a written Constitution or the benefits, advantages or disadvantages of a rigid Constitution.  As I have said on the numerous occasions on which I have spoken on this Bill from time to time here on its various Stages through the House, if we were to consider what form of Constitution we are to have for this country I would be prepared to listen to any theories put forward on their merits as to whether there should or should not be a Seanad or whether a unicameral system would be better than a bicameral system.</P>
    <P>I would consider that this particular Assembly is the worst possible Assembly that you can conceive in a nightmare for a discussion of these topics.  But we are not considering what is the proper system of government for this country.  We have reached the Final Stage of a Bill which is going to do away with one of the institutions of this State which has existed for 12 years.  We are going to do away with that particular institution not because there is any cause advanced for its continued existence as against either the wishes of the Irish people or the principles of democracy or the particular needs of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>We are getting rid of the Seanad because the Seanad threw out the Blueshirt Bill.  This Bill was introduced for no other reason, for no other theory of government, or for the upholding of any other principle of democracy than that the Seanad stood in the way of the Government in respect of one measure on which they had set their heart.  I would say in parenthesis that the events which <Col N="1767" /> have happened since that Bill was thrown out by the Seanad have justified the Seanad not merely in throwing out that Bill, but have justified the existence of the Seanad.  The only really effective powers that the Seanad have under our Constitution are powers of delay, powers to say to the Executive Council &ldquo;you will take your time to consider whether your decision is in the best interests of the people; we think it is not; in order that the Government may have time for consideration we will exercise our powers of delay.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Blueshirt Bill was introduced and passed through this House on the representations of the Government that if it were not passed it would be impossible for them to maintain order in this country; that there would be almost a state of civil war.  The few short months that have elapsed since the Seanad threw out the Blueshirt Bill have demonstrated to every impartial observer that the action of the Seanad was justified and that so far from the non-passage of this Bill impeding the Government in their efforts to maintain law and order it saved them from having to deal with a very serious situation in this country.</P>
    <P>I have, from time to time, found it a little difficult to get people, even professionally-trained people, even lawyers of standing and experience, to understand that the powers of the Oireachtas are not derived from the Constitution; that the Dáil and Seanad in accordance with their powers under the Treaty are sovereign except in so far as their sovereign powers are cut down by the Constitution. In other words, that the Con stitution which we have in this country at the moment is something which cuts down the powers of the Dáil and Seanad and is not something from which the Dáil and Seanad derive their powers.  If, therefore, you put the Dáil, as it is proposed to be put by this Bill, into the position that it is the only Assembly in the country with power to make laws you put it into a position under the Constitution <Col N="1768" /> that it can itself take away the only check&mdash;the only limiting authority upon its powers.  It can sweep away the Constitution and it becomes, therefore, in effect and in fact, truly sovereign.</P>
    <P>There is only one road, and there is only one end to that road, and that is dictatorship.  We have been accused here, from time to time, and in the country, of being the Party that stands for dictatorship.  The Attorney-General, during the course of the last stage of this Bill, mentioned the danger of dictatorship arising from such a fundamental change in the Constitution and in the institutions of this State as is proposed by this Bill, and indicated that if there is any danger of a dictatorship it came from the members of this Party.  We offered, and we offer now, definite suggestions. We asked the Government why they did not provide, in this Bill, some safeguard for the fundamental rights that are enshrined in the Constitution and that are supposed to be guaranteed to the people by the institutions of the State set up 12 years ago. We, the would-be dictators, are still pressing the Government to find some method of safeguarding such rights as the right of adult suffrage, the right of free expression of opinion, the right of the liberty of the subject, the right of freedom of conscience and the liberty of the Press.  We ask them to safeguard the theory on which our whole State is based&mdash;that all powers are derived through God from the people. When this Bill is passed you put into the hands of one Chamber in this country the power to take away every single one of those fundamental rights, to change the very theory on which our State is based.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as Deputy O'Sullivan pointed out, contains two changes from the time it was introduced.  It contains two additions purporting to provide for the independence of the judiciary and the independence of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  The very fact that only these two provisions are inserted in the Bill brings into bold relief, emphasises and underlines the fact that far more fundamental rights are not being guaranteed or preserved <Col N="1769" /> but are being left to the mercy of any chance Executive.  The President bases his whole theory of government, apparently, on a general election.  We have some experience of the way general elections are fought and won in this country.  I dislike to think that that is going to be the foundation of democratic rights in this country for the future.  It will just mean that power will be obtained by an Executive that happens to filch the votes of the people from time to time by fair means or foul.</P>
    <P>Article 30 of the Constitution provides that Seanad Eireann shall be composed of citizens who, by reason of useful public service, have done honour to the nation, or who, because of special qualifications or attainments, represent important aspects of the nation's life.  That is the theory on which the Seanad was constituted. That is the ideal to which, in the composition of the Seanad, efforts should be directed.  Is there any better ideal that can be devised than to have a Chamber supervising, advising, but not controlling, the actions of the popular Assembly&mdash;a Chamber composed of men who, by reason of useful public service, not by reason of political services and because they were the hacks of political Parties, but because of public service, have done honour to the nation, or because they possess special qualifications or attainments and represent important aspects of the nation's life?  I fully admit that, as a matter of practice, it would be very difficult to find a satisfactory or fully efficient method of selecting people who will come within the descriptions of these persons who are directed by Article 30 to be proposed for membership of Seanad Eireann.  But that is no reason why the effort should not be made. That is no reason why this nation should be deprived of the services of men who have, by reason of useful public service, done honour to it. That is no reason why the nation should be deprived of the specialised knowledge and experience that can be put at its disposal by men who have special qualifications, or attainments, and who represent important aspects of the nation's life.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1770" /> The people envisaged by Article 30 of the Constitution are, normally, not the type of people who are either willing or capable of going down to the hustings and seeking votes in the way that votes have to be sought for in present circumstances.  They are unwilling to give up the time that is involved in political activities, as they are known at the present moment, but they would be willing to offer their specialised and useful services in such an institution as the Seanad, if it was properly constituted.  They are not willing to submit themselves, as most of us who are Deputies have to submit ourselves, to the incessant demands of our constituents, to the wearying task of looking after our constituents, and they are not prepared to do what the Minister for Industry and Commerce referred to on the occasion of the Bill abolishing University representation, to go and persuade 7,000 people to vote for them.  But because they are not prepared to do that sort of thing, because they perhaps dislike that sort of thing, is no reason why the State should be deprived of their services and, unless there is some sort of a Chamber attached to the Legislature of this country into which these people may be put, where their experience and knowledge, their specialised knowledge above all things, may be put at the service of the Government, then this nation is going to suffer a very severe loss.</P>
    <P>We will have our demagogues in the Dáil, our cross-road orators in the Dáil; we will have the people with the glib tongues and elastic consciences in the Dáil.  But it is not the possessor of the glib tongue or of the elastic conscience who makes the best head of a Department.  If a person wishes to become a doctor he has to go through a course of specialised training for a long period of years.  If a person wishes to become a lawyer he has to go through a course of specialised training for, perhaps, not quite so long a period of years but, nevertheless, he has to undertake a very long and wearisome task making his way in that profession.  A business man has to start on the lowest rung of the ladder and he has to learn every department <Col N="1771" /> of the business.  A tradesman has to become an apprentice.  But because God endows you with a glib tongue and a cross-roads manner, that is to be the qualification for the head of a Department; that is to be the qualification for a person who is to become one of the rulers of this country, one of the effective rulers of this country, because the Executive Council, under our Constitution, are the effective rulers of this country.  They are to be the people from whom our political theories are to be derived, from whom our economic policies are to be evolved, and on whom we are to depend for our living and for our liberties.  That is what is going to be the result of the theory of Government on which this Bill is based and which, apparently, the President has hugged to his bosom as the most democratic of all theories of Government.  It is going to lead, in my view&mdash;and I have expressed the view on more than one occasion in this House&mdash;to the end of democracy in this country.  It is going to lead to a reaction, and a fierce reaction, against democracy, if that sort of thing is allowed to go on, and go on it will, in this country where we are, politically, not even half-educated, unless there is some safeguard, unless the unfettered power and the unfettered will of a chance Executive is not checked, even though they have that God-given authority&mdash;or what the President, at all events, regards as God-given&mdash;the fact that they won a general election.</P>
    <P>This Bill, as I say, for the reasons I have given and for other reasons that I could give, is a bad Bill.  It is a Bill that is going to deprive this country of the services of good men.  We have in the Seanad at the present moment men who, in every respect, conform to the descriptions and, I was going to say, the specifications set forth in Article 30 of the Constitution. Not for one moment do I suggest that every member of the Seanad conforms to those specifications but we have in the Seanad men who have unselfishly placed their experience and their knowledge at the services of successive Governments in this country. They have placed them, and are willing <Col N="1772" /> to place them, at the service of the present Government just as they placed them at the service of the previous Government.  It is not because the Seanad was in danger of developing into a home of rest for decayed politicians that we should depart from the principle of a bicameral legislature in this country, or, at least, that we should depart from it as hurriedly as we have departed from it in this case, without seriously considering the reactions that are going to take place. Since this Bill was introduced the reactions that were going to take place as a result of this Bill if it were passed into law have become more and more apparent.  I think that even the President would admit, if he were seized with a fit of unusual candour, that he did not consider when he introduced this Bill what the real effects of it would or might be.</P>
    <P>When this Bill becomes law we are going to have no guarantee for freedom of conscience.  We are going to have no guarantee for the right of free speech.  We are going to have no guarantee for the right of free assembly.  We are going to have no guarantee for trial by jury.  We are going to have no guarantee that we will have any Constitution in this State.  That is not a thing that is going to fulfil any useful purpose in this country in existing circumstances. From time to time I have pointed out that this hurried constitutional and other legislation that is being introduced has a violent reaction on the economic situation in this country. We are not going to have industries started here, no matter how good your economic policy may be&mdash;it is not going to be a success, it is not even going to have a chance of success, as long as there is uncertainty or as long as there is the feeling that nobody knows where they are going to be to-morrow or that an Act of Parliament has no more sanctity and that a constitutional right, supposed to be guaranteed in the Constitution, is of no more effect than the writing on a piece of ordinary scribbling pad.</P>

      <P>Deputy Costello, in starting his statement with regard to this Bill, said that he opposed the Bill <Col N="1773" /> because it was a useless Bill and because it was a bad Bill.  I can give other grounds for opposition to the Bill, because no argument has been advanced in support of it.  The absence of argument or of any one to make a defence of the Bill probably is accounted for by the absence of Deputy Corry from the Dáil.  The silence of the Front Bench has become one of their main characteristics, particularly when they are doing a thing which they know in their hearts is unfair to the people and should not be done, and which is untrue to the mandate they got from the people. This Bill, in its previous stages, as far as any justification at all was advanced for it, was justified by the argument: &ldquo;We are the majority and therefore we have the right to do this.&rdquo;  I should like to see some thought and consideration given over there to the difference between having the right to do a thing and being right in exercising that right.  In particular, I should like the President to devote some attention to the vast difference which exists between the two.  The various coercion measures and all the other things that were practised on the Opposition and on those who differ from them politically were all justified one after another by the glib defence: &ldquo;We have the right, and because we have the right, therefore it is right to exercise that right.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had an attempt being made to justify the annihilation of the Seanad and the destruction of the Oireachtas as it did exist.  We had an attempt to justify that act by talk about a mandate from the people.  A little consideration of what you did submit to the people, and of the mandate, if such exists, which you actually got from the people, is worth while considering at this stage.  Amongst a multiplicity of other things you did hold out before the people a promise to abolish the Seanad as at present constituted, and thereby directly implied that the abolition of the Seanad, or a Bill to abolish the Seanad, carried with it some constructive proposal for something to replace that Seanad.  That particular promise was submerged by hundreds of other promises, and if you <Col N="1774" /> got a mandate to abolish the Seanad as it then existed, you got a much clearer mandate to rule this country without coercion Acts and without resort to the Public Safety Act; you got a mandate to open the prison gates and to have no political opponents inside prison bars.  We have this Bill to abolish the Seanad because the Seanad acted more gamely to that mandate than the Government did, and because the Seanad, in fact, held up a Bill to raise blisters on the backs of your political opponents.  Because the Seanad held up one of your petty Coercion Acts the Seanad has got to go.  If we are to judge as to whether the Government or the Seanad stands most strongly by the mass of promises which the Government submitted to the electorate, any impartially-minded person will agree that it is the Seanad.</P>
    <P>This talk about mandates is a bit overdone.  When you threw out a multiplicity of promises and got returned because one section likes this and another section likes that, to claim then a sacred mandate for the carrying out of any particular promise and the divine right to ignore other promises made is playing ducks and drakes with any idea of real democracy in the country.  The President's political line of thought and his political activity remind me of the deep sea fishermen who throw long lines with a great number of bait on the end, and, when they haul in the catch, they are cynically indifferent as to what particular bait hooked the cod. That is a fair illustration of the Presidential procedure in politics in this country and it is a very fair picture of the Presidential respect for democracy in this country.  As long as the cod is landed, the bait does not matter; we have landed the catch.</P>
    <P>We have this Bill introduced to abolish the Seanad with pious expressions of opinion as to what would best replace the Seanad, but with no proposal before this House as to anything, good, bad or indifferent, to replace that Seanad, except a political junta with a temporary majority of the country behind them.  Long after that so-called mandate to abolish the Seanad was <Col N="1775" /> secured from the people, how was that mandate interpreted, before the Blueshirt Bill?  It was incorporated in a Bill introduced by the President himself to restrict and reduce the Seanad's power of delay.  Was that an abuse of the mandate or was it an honest interpretation of the mandate which the Government got, and if it was an honest interpretation of the mandate which the Government secured from the people, why is it being trampled on by this Bill?  What exactly occurred since?  Was there any new mandate secured?  The only thing that occurred since, the only thing that transpired since, is that the Seanad held up a harsh, coercive measure aimed at the political Opposition, and, in fact, the only thing that happened since was that the Seanad forced the Government back on their mandate to rule in this country without injustice to their political opponents and without recourse to coercive measures.</P>
    <P>We might follow Deputy MacDermot into by-paths and discuss what type of Seanad would be better than the other and, if we did that, we would be interpreting the mandate which the President sought and obtained.  We would be sitting down here to do practical business, to discuss what type of institution would best replace the present Seanad, but we are here, true to our records&mdash;destruction; no construction; every effort to destroy and no thought or effort to build up; destroy the Seanad and replace it by one man.  That is supposed to be democracy; and when the Seanad is gone in this country and when we have nothing but the Government opposite, knowing that that Government can be boiled down to one man, will we have any departure from the old dogma that the majority in this country has no right to do wrong and that the sole judge in this country as to whether the majority is right or wrong is one man?  Let us have a recantation of that before we appoint that one individual as the sole power in this country.</P>
    <P>We have this Bill introduced in a spirit of pique and malice, forced through this House by a mixture of <Col N="1776" /> discipline and ignorance, with equal parts of each, and nobody up, but the one absentee, to make any case for it, and the chief justification for removing powers of delay to the legislation of any political junta is the one of democracy. Whatever other honest case may be made, giving unfettered power to individuals is certainly not democracy. It is not what the people of this country understand as democracy; it is not what they understood in the past and it is not what they would stand for at present.  One-man rule was always hateful in this country, and when the Seanad goes we have Government rule, and Government rule with a Party machine, in nine cases out of ten, is one-man rule.  We hear about the Seanad's veto.  The Seanad has merely powers of delay, and you got over that before.  Your previous Bill, I consider, was a more honest Bill, because it was not introduced out of pique and it was not introduced because of a reverse but after giving serious consideration to the programme which you had recently placed before the people.  That Bill was merely to curtail, to reduce the time or period for which the Seanad could hold up a Bill.</P>
    <P>We heard, in the course of the discussion on this Bill, no explanation as to why that policy was departed from and no justification as to why it was embarked upon, if it was a violation of the mandate received from the people.  Are there always to be two heads on the penny the President tosses with?  Are we to lose, whichever side turns up?  Is he to be an honest interpreter of public opinion when he goes one way and an equally honest interpreter of public opinion when he goes the other way?  That is what he has consistently claimed in public life in this country, and that is one of the reasons why every sane man in this country sees a left-handed bid at a dictatorship in this Bill.  If a dictatorship is wanted, go boldly for it, but this circuitous line of approach is one of the most disgusting things about it.  We will have it, in fact, if the Seanad goes; we will have it without any powers of delay; and we will have it without any check or brake. <Col N="1777" /> You have the machined majority here and you have a rank and file obedient, as Deputy Donnelly told us before, and who will follow in any direction&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As on other occasions, I have a particular delight in following in debate Deputy Dr. O'Higgins. I must compliment him on the fact that in his speech this afternoon there were far less adjectives than in previous speeches which I listened to.  I should like to call attention to one particular phrase in his latest diatribe. He talked at considerable length about the mandate we received at the last general election.  Undoubtedly that is a sore point.  It must always remain a sore point, not only with Deputy Dr. O'Higgins, but with every Deputy of the Opposition in this House.  It must always remain that, taking into consideration the great attempts which they themselves made to secure a mandate as against us, even down to the very eve of the last general election.  Of all the blandishments that were held out, of all the offers and counter-offers that were made, not one succeeded.  The ordinary people of the country believed and accepted our policy. They sent us and sent President de Valera back here with a mandate to abolish the Seanad, and we are going <Col N="1778" /> to abolish it.  That Seanad walks the plank.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. O'Higgins seemed to stress the sentence &ldquo;We propose to abolish the Seanad as at present constituted.&rdquo; Then he stopped.  There is a copy of the manifesto that was issued before the last general election, and it is upon this document that the people voted.  The next time the Deputy refers to this particular paragraph dealing with the Seanad I would ask him to read the entire paragraph for this House.  Just let us have it now:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We propose to abolish the Seanad as at present constituted, and if it be decided to retain a Second Legislative Chamber it is our intention to reduce considerably the number of its members.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Who is to make the decision?  Where is it to be decided that a Second Chamber is necessary?  Who is to make the decision?  Is not this Assembly and this House the sovereign authority in the country?  Is it not this House that legislates for the country?  Deputy Dr. O'Higgins, when he was making a point of the necessity for having a Second Chamber at all, seemed to think it was necessary merely as a check upon what was done by way of legislation in this Assembly.  I deny that entirely.  Let us look at it from the ordinary plain <Col N="1779" /> man's standpoint&mdash;the standpoint of the man in the street.  There is the offer that is made to the voters; there is the policy that is put before the electorate.  The electorate accept that policy, and they give the man who is responsible for the carrying into effect of that policy a majority in this House. In my opinion he has a right to act upon the mandate which he received. Deputy Dr. O'Higgins went a little bit further.  I do not like to harp on this thing too much, but he was just as little complimentary to the voters this evening as he has sometimes been to Deputies in the Dáil, and more particularly to members of the Executive Council.  Fianna Fáil threw out a bait; they were fishermen; they collected a number of fish; the bait was thrown out to the fish, and they were caught!  That is a pretty inference. That is what the voters were&mdash;the 750,000 people who came to the polls and voted for Fianna Fáil.  At least 300,000 of this particular type of fish voted for Cumann na nGaedheal when it was the Government.  We got our majority from the very same people&mdash; we could not get it from anybody else&mdash; that the Opposition got their majority from when they were the Government.</P>

All the arguments in support of this Bill were given in the country.  The people believed them, and that is why this majority is here.  I now come to what is evidently always going to be the peroration to Deputy Dr. O'Higgins' speeches in this House&mdash;the machine majority, the rank and file, who vote as they are directed, and blindly follow one man.  Of course we follow him.  Of course we will follow him.  As I said before, we followed him during the years he was in the wilderness.  We followed him when he was behind prison bars.

The Government opposite went out and said that it was scandalous that anybody should have more than £1,000 a year.  They published lists of the high salaries given in this State.  They appealed to the meanness, the cupidity and the envy in the popular mind.  Having said that no man had a right to have more than £1,000 a year, they got a mandate, and President de Valera got his £1,500, with a free motor car and all the rest of it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only replying with regard to the mandate.  One of the arguments in favour of the Bill is that the Government got a mandate. I invite any intelligent person to read this paragraph.  It is the second or third paragraph in the Fianna Fáil manifesto at the last election.  At the time of that election the Government had been in power about a year.  I think it was the Minister for Local Government who remarked a short time ago here, in arguing about the Constituencies Bill, that there had been a Bill ready drafted to reduce the number of Deputies in this House to 120.  The paragraph to which I referred was, as I said, designed to appeal to the cupidity of the people.  Their propaganda appealed to the meanness of the people: &ldquo;We are going to economise.&rdquo; They said to the people that they were going to economise by reducing the size of the Dáil.  They knew at the time that there was a Bill ready before we went out of office to reduce the Dáil to 120 members.  When they came in, in fulfilment of that mandate to economise by reducing the Dáil, they brought in a Bill which set out about in a most elaborate way to keep <Col N="1782" /> within the terms of the Constitution and have the Dáil as large as it possibly could be.  The proposed abolition of the Seanad in its present form was put to the people merely as a means of economy.  They said that, if it was decided to retain it, it would be much smaller, thereby making economies.</P>
      <P>Their talk about a mandate, first of all, is a humbug, because the whole idea of mandates is a humbug. Secondly, the suggestion that the Government had a mandate for what they are doing now is complete humbug. They went to the people and said: &ldquo;Vote for us and we will reduce taxation; one of the ways of doing it is to reduce the size of the Dáil and to change the present form of the Seanad and make it something cheaper.&rdquo;  Now they come along and say that they have a mandate for abolishing it. What do they take out of the mandate? The President gets up and, so far as he uses the mandate argument, says: &ldquo;I got a mandate to set myself up as a dictator.&rdquo;  If he did get that mandate, which is the way he is using the mandate, why last year was he getting up and denouncing General O'Duffy and the Blueshirt movement as standing for a dictatorship when he knew well, presumably, as he wanted to get a mandate, and as he says he has got it, that his intention was to set himself up as a dictator?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have discussed this Bill on Second Reading, on the Committee Stage and also on the Fourth Stage. The President talked on all of these stages.  His line was that it was our business as an Opposition to make a case against the Bill.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce got up and made his usual appeal to ignorant passion, as he has done all over the country, and which was largely instrumental in getting this wonderful mandate and the majority that Deputy Donnelly talks about.  He talked about the Jamesons and the Granards in the Seanad, suggesting that such people were automatically enemies of the country and, therefore, it was a good thing to abolish them from any position of any power, no matter how limited. It was put up to us to make a case against the Bill.  What could we do? <Col N="1783" /> Deputy O'Sullivan talked about other countries and two Houses and so on, but the truth is that all human experience has itself been the argument against the Bill.  All we could do in the way of putting an argument against it was to choose one or two specific things as showing the weakness of the situation.</P>
    <P>The President in a fit of temper said he was going to abolish the Seanad and brought in a Bill to do it <i>simpliciter.</i>  We pointed out that what he was actually doing was taking power to himself to abolish any judge who did not give a finding in the court that suited him.  We pointed out that he was taking power to himself to get rid of the Comptroller and Auditor-General if he should make things awkward financially.  All his argument for the Bill was to get up and try to sell the cow again as to the number required to get rid of a judge or the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  On the Fourth Reading, when we had put up the argument that the Constitution protects certain fundamental rights of the people against the Government and that he was, as a Government, taking complete mastery over all these rights, it looked to me as though he was going to bring in one of his usual sort of proposals to meet that.  He has not done it, however.  I suppose, whatever it is, he will bring it forward at the end of this discussion in the hope, as there is no one to speak after him, that there will not be an opportunity to point out the humbug in it.</P>
    <P>Why are we against it?  I am against the abolition of the Seanad particularly in relation to the exact position in this country.  In most countries, as has been pointed out, there is a Constitution and there are two Chambers.  There is also usually another member of the Legislature, either a King or a President, who is distinct from Parliament. The Constitution in these countries is not changeable by ordinary law because of the fact that the human person, in view of the end for which he was created, is superior to the State and that, in many ways, it is necessary to give him complete protection against the Government.  That is the reason why Constitutions exist and why they <Col N="1784" /> are not easily changed in most countries, because, although a Government is necessary to provide for the general well-being, at the same time the human person, being what a human person is, must be protected against arbitrary power of the Government. The President brought in this Bill and put the human person in this country completely at his mercy.  That is the effect of the Bill.  The President has brought in a Bill to make himself absolute master of every thought and every act of the people of this country. He will get up and say that he is going to do something later, but in this Bill he is demanding of the Dáil that it shall put the people of the country completely at his mercy, and if, God between us and all harm, he should go out of his mind to-morrow and become a lunatic, and is able to conceal it from the members of his Party, he is going to have the people completely at his mercy.</P>
    <P>So far as the Seanad was concerned it had power to delay.  The Government brought in certain Bills and the Seanad exercised its power in delaying them.  Deputy MacDermot referred to what they were&mdash;the Blueshirt Bill and so on.  The Government was elected in 1932 in the month of February, I think.  In 1927, in the month of September, we had a majority.  Sometime between September, 1927, and February, 1932, there was a movement of the people from support of us to support of Fianna Fáil.  That did not happen the week after we were elected.  It did not happen all at once.  I do not know, but I should imagine that it was slow at the beginning, but getting rather quicker towards the end.  That means that if, as a mere accident, the election had not been held in September, 1927, as it need not have been until one and a half years later, it is probable that Fianna Fáil would not have been the Government; that somebody else would have been; or, if we had postponed the election until September, 1932, which we easily might have done, Fianna Fáil would not have come into power.</P>
    <P>The power the Seanad had was to delay for one and a half years.  What <Col N="1785" /> great harm would that do?  I am not going to say that the Seanad should be maintained merely because it is not doing any harm.  But, what was the reason for the President rushing in with this Bill merely because certain things were being delayed for one and a half years?  One of them was the Blueshirt Bill.  One argument about that was that the Seanad, when we were in power, passed the drastic Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution and that when they brought in the Blueshirt Bill the Seanad refused it; and that that presumably indicated that the Seanad was merely part of our Party machine.  When we brought in the Seventeenth Amendment there was a situation in this country, as the Government knows, of murders.  Quite a number of murders were committed within the previous months.  It is a well-known fact that a jury which found according to evidence, if it was a case against a member of a criminal organisation, took every chance of being murdered.  People who came to give evidence against criminals of that organisation stood every chance of being shot.  For a large part of the ten years we were in office that organisation in its career of crime was supported by the members of the present Government.  It was only after ten years of trying various expedients that we brought in that drastic Bill and the Seanad passed it.  When Fianna Fáil came in the Blueshirt organisation gradually came into existence and Fianna Fáil revived the Bill, a Bill which had only been justified, and only received the sanction of the Seanad because murder made it necessary; because the whole basis of law was collapsing; because jurymen had to choose between committing perjury and being murdered; because witnesses had to choose between committing perjury and being murdered.  In these circumstances, the Seanad passed the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution.</P>
    <P>This Government again wanted power in that amendment of the Constitution not to put down murder, not to put down terrorisation of jurymen and witnesses, but merely to put down a political opposition.  When it had <Col N="1786" /> that power and had it operating it still was not satisfied.  It wanted the Blueshirt Bill, the anti-Uniforms Bill, in addition to the Seventeenth Amendment of the Constitution.  The Government says that because the Seanad agreed to pass an amendment of the Constitution in order to put down murder and organised crime, it must have been acting as a Party organisation, because that same Seanad would not give powers over and above those contained in the Seventeenth Amendment of the Constitution to put down the political opponents of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>As I said in the beginning, the argument against this Bill is human experience.  In practically every civilised country, first of all, a very specific limitation is put upon the Government, that limitation taking the form of the Constitution which protects the rights, the inherited and inalienable rights, of the person against arbitrary action by the Government.  Secondly, in nearly every country which has not moved on to a dictatorship there is a Second House with some powers, very often with powers of delay, as was the case here, and over and above that there is a monarch or a president who has a veto over legislation.  Here we are going to have a State in which the Government is going to have the whole of the people at its mercy.  There will be no Second Chamber, no monarch or president who can in any way veto action of the Government, whether it be good or bad.  That is the position for which we are now asked to vote, a position for which the Government has not made any case.  They whined or complained that the Seanad was an anti-Fianna Fáil Seanad, that they, as a popularly elected Government, should not be hindered in any way in their policy.  Of course they should be hindered, and every person in this country ought on all occasions to hinder a Government to prevent their doing anything which he thinks is against the well-being of this country.</P>
    <P>In this country, as in every country, the Government operates enormously in the economic sphere.  This Government, <Col N="1787" /> for political purposes, created an economic situation in this country which is bringing to ruin the largest section of the community, the agricultural community.  The members of the Government which is doing that are constantly, at the same time, getting up and saying that nobody must obstruct them, that there must be no curb or restraint upon their power, that no bar should be imposed upon anything that in their whim or in their wisdom they desire to get done.  We are asked to come here now and give them that power.  The President, on the Fourth Reading, seemed to be moving on to indicate what he was going to do.  What it was I do not know, because when he got so far he said that what he had to say would be more appropriate to the Fifth Stage. It did seem to me, however, that what he was going to say was this: &ldquo;I admit that with this Bill I am going to have a power greater than any dictator in any country that was ever known in the world's history.  I admit that I am getting a power which it is absolutely indefensible that any one person should possess, but I, Eamon de Valera, President of the Executive Council, ask you to give me that power, which no man should have or exercise, and then, before the Bill becomes law, I will go into the matter of the Constitution and see if some step cannot be taken to give more suitable expression to these beautiful democratic principles which are enshrined in it.&rdquo;  Fancy any leader coming to a Parliament which exists to protect the people and depriving that Parliament of the power.  What would any of these people think of giving such arbitrary power to one man as we are asked to give here?</P>

I admit that, to the Fianna Fáil Party, it may seem a fairly sound proposition. This is the Fifth Reading and Deputy Briscoe is butting in here.  If he thinks that any case has been made for this Bill by the President, any member of the Executive Council, or anybody on his side I should like him to get up and give us a <i>résume</i> of it.  The facts of the Bill cannot be refuted.  The President had to admit that.  He brought in two amendments, one requiring a little more than the ordinary majority for the removal of a judge, and another with regard to the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  Before he put down these amendments, he was apparently convinced by Deputy Donnelly that no matter when an election is held, he is bound to get a majority.  But he had brought in a Bill which would mean that, if the Fianna Fáil deductions from the last election are correct, the present Government, in the event of an election, would not only have the majority necessary to put the judges and the Comptroller and Auditor-General at their mercy but that they would have that and plenty of votes to spare thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to urge that the President should now give us an undertaking that, instead of forcing this Bill through on its last stage here, he should hold it up until some substitute has been created for the Seanad.  It was popular for the Fianna Fáil Party, which usually does not exhaust itself by thinking, when it was talking against the Seanad, to assume that it was merely a declaratory body and that it had no useful function whatever. After the President had the Bill drafted and brought in here he had to face up to the fact that the abolition of the Seanad created a very peculiar situation here with regard to the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  The <Col N="1789" /> Seanad has been a protection to the people of this country, and the people need it more than the people in any other country need a Second Chamber, because there is no other country that I know of where a Party in a single House has full power to abolish or to alter in any way it may think fit any part of the Constitution.  I know of no other country where that can occur. Mind you, I am not sure that the Bill we are asked to pass is not actually <i>ultra vires.</i>  In that case it would be a very futile thing for the Dáil solemnly to pass this Bill and have it proved afterwards that the Government had in fact no power to pass the Bill, and that, though they thought they were changing the law, the law remained exactly as it was before.  I want the Government in this country to be so limited in its scope that there will be certain aspects of the people's lives with which the Government cannot interfere. Secondly, I do not mind what the machinery is if the Government can legitimately act in that way and change the law.  There will be some power which will not be identical with the Government, which will have been elected at some other time, and will draw authority from some other section, that will be able to restrain the Government, either by way of veto or delay.  The President refuses any limit whatsoever.  No one recognises the authority of the Government more than I do.  But I also recognise that there are distinct limitations, and that there are laws that this Government can bring in which I, personally, have no intention whatever of submitting to. It is quite conceivable that that may happen, because the Government has complete power to bring in any law it likes, regardless of justice, equity, right or wrong or anything else.  There must be in this country, if there is to be any stability, limitation to the scope of the Government's power.  Within its proper scope there must be some power of delay, or some possibility of restraint on Government action, so that there will no be precipitate action to plunge the people into a very disastrous condition.  That is what we must have.</P>
    <P>What has the Government done? <Col N="1790" /> The President has consistently tried to keep this country in an unstable condition.  He talked about having clear foundations.  This State came into existence in 1922.  The President knows perfectly well that the State that came into existence then was capable of development in any direction and in any form that the well-being of its people might require.  He knows perfectly well that in any situation that might arise anybody who came forward and pointed out that by taking certain action the condition of the people would be improved the Government had full power.  Any such action could have been taken. The Constitution could have been changed from time to time, certainly within the first eight years, and possibly within the first 16 years. What were we told?  We were told somehow or other that we were not quite free, that we are moving in the right direction now, but that the great goal has not been attained yet.  What is the great goal?  It is supposed to be the Republic.  Absolute humbug! The President has said that until this great goal, this Republic&mdash;a word shouted by people unable to say what they mean by it&mdash;is reached we cannot have stability.  I do not know what form the Republic is going to take.  It may take a form to which I will not be able to give allegiance, and I shall have an equal right&mdash;and I think more right than those howling against the Free State&mdash;to shout against the proposed Republic.  Who is there to say that those who shout are the turbulent element until the Republic is reached? Why have not other people the right to say as well that they intend to be the turbulent element until this Bill is got rid of?  That is the President's argument.  He has got this country into a state of instability and he wants to keep it that way.  We are told that we are moving towards the goal; that we are moving towards freedom. People thought that in the past. What greater freedom can we have than we have now?  Can anyone explain how we are restrained?  It is true that although we are free the British can put tariffs on our exports, but we have power to put tariffs on British goods. <Col N="1791" /> Are we going to seek freedom which will enable us to dispose&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This Bill proposes to give to the Executive Council power to abolish the Constitution <i>in toto.</i>  Consequently we are giving to the Government, which has carefully kept this country in a state of instability, complete power to do what they like.  I maintain that the power this Bill proposes to give to the Government is a power which should not be given to any human person or to any institution.  I suggest that this Government, by its tyrannical action with regard to the Blueshirt organisation, its instructions to the Civic Guards as to breaches of the law with regard to the Blueshirts, the unjust action it has arbitrarily taken for political purposes, in order to save its face, and that has plunged the biggest section of the community into ruin; that for the Dáil to be invited to give that Government power that no Government possesses, and that should not be given to any person or institution, is absolute madness.  I suggest it is reasonable that I should make the proposal that the President should say whether or not he is going to go ahead with this Bill, that he will not insist upon its passing this stage until he has come to the Dáil with proposals for legislation which will adequately provide safeguards with regard to the rights of the people, with regard to the judges, and the rest.  It will be difficult, possibly, to provide all that protection, but until he has provided that adequate alternative to the <Col N="1792" /> present Seanad he should say that he does not propose to go ahead with this Bill.</P>

I think that burning and passionate loyalty that Deputy Donnelly asserts for President de Valera should lead him, not to put the President into the unfortunate position of having to take over responsibility that people should have for themselves.</P>

      <P>The rather pathetic appeal that Deputy MacDermot addressed to the Fianna Fáil Benches enkindled the small spark of the missionary spirit that remains in my breast.  I had an idea, some time ago, that I would be the means of converting <Col N="1793" /> the Centre Party, but as that Party committed suicide that hope is gone.  While I have great respect for Deputy MacDermot, I am afraid of his position.  I remember that a member of the Dublin Corporation made a speech on one occasion in which he said: &ldquo;We are standing on the edge of a precipice, and if we do not mind ourselves it will be round our necks in no time.&rdquo;  That is the position of Deputy MacDermot.  He is on the edge of a precipice, and it will be around his neck.  It will be like a Lord Mayor's chain&mdash;not the Lord Mayor's chain.  I cannot say how long I listened to the speeches of the Opposition. I have heard all the speeches on this Bill.  I have heard the wail over the awful position that the Comptroller and Auditor-General would be in, and the dreadful position the judges would be in.  I regard the judges as men learned in the law, and men ground in logic.  I also conclude that they are sensible, commonsense men.  That is a great attribute, both for Deputies and judges, and it would be a great attribute for those on the opposite benches. Would not the judges take this view of the position regarding the abolition of the Seanad&mdash;that the late Government, at one time, for the purpose of preserving public peace and order, introduced a Bill in a great hurry, that they said the Bill was necessary for the preservation of peace and order and that the Seanad worked overtime to pass the Bill.  They passed the Bill in three hours for the reasons given by the Government which, I suppose, were perfectly reasonable in the position at that time.  What did they do when this Government asked powers for the same reason?  We asked power because we believed that it was necessary for the preservation of public order and public peace.  What did the Seanad do?  They said: &ldquo;We will not give the powers to you.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am finished with the judges.  I have nothing more to say about them.  The position has not yet been argued from the opposite side. <Col N="1794" /> Most of the speeches of the Deputies opposite consisted of abuse of the President.  Abuse is no argument, as we have often heard.  The President is, in their mind, the incarnation of evil.  There is not a clean spot on him. I suggest that the Opposition&mdash; especially the front bench men&mdash;would have been better advised to vary their argument, if we can call criticism of the President an argument.  There is nothing like variation anywhere.  Once upon a time, I was a member of a flute and drum band.  I was a flute player and the teacher of the band regarded himself as a bit of a musician.  He said the band should have slow marches as well as quick marches, especially for State occasions.  The slow march he fixed on was the &ldquo;Last Rose of Summer,&rdquo; with variations.  I was one of the players of the variations.  The patron of the band came into the band room one night and our bandmaster got us to play one of the quick marches and the slow march which he had arranged for State occasions.  The patron of the band made a speech afterwards.  He said: &ldquo;I never heard the &lsquo;Last Rose of Summer&rsquo; played with such effect.&rdquo; He believed, because of that, that the last rose of summer would survive during the winter and spring and be in full bloom when summer came again. I submit that the Seanad is the last rose of the Cumann na nGaedheal winter or summer.  They might have made an effort to preserve it.  If I had been over there I should have acted differently.  I cannot get over there now, unless I send over my astral body. Suppose my astral body takes possession over there and I look at the opposite bench.  I make up my mind in this way: &ldquo;There is President de Valera and there are his merry men beside him.  I should rather they were not there.  I wish we had a general election and they were kicked out.  But they might not be kicked out.  There might be no general election.  And we want the Seanad to remain.&rdquo; Instead of pouring out abuse on the President's head, I should make suggestions for a new Seanad.  I should say: &ldquo;Mr. President, it is necessary for the proper conduct of public business here, for the safety of the people <Col N="1795" /> and because of this talk about keeping the Constitution intact, to have a Second Chamber.  You are going to do away with this one.  I suggest that we have a Seanad election right away. Let the people elect a new Seanad.  Or let the county councils nominate a new Seanad.  Let a new Seanad be selected from the various classes that comprise the people of this State, according to their numbers.  That would mean a Seanad ruled principally by members of the Labour Party and members of a small Farmers' Party and it might be a very wholesome Seanad.  Or let us have a Seanad composed of representatives of the various professions and trades, elected according to their numbers, if you like.  That would be a good Seanad.  Or let us have a Seanad elected by the women of the country. They would vote for the home makers and the home protectors and that would be a very wholesome Seanad.&rdquo;  There are five propositions put up by my astral body.  Would it not have been better to say that than to point to the President as the incarnation of evil, with the two lesser incarnations of evil beside him in the persons of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance.  Would not that have been better work for the country than has been done by Deputies opposite?  I think it would, but I had better withdraw my astral body because I heard a man who attended a seance telling a friend how his astral body got into a lady's boudoir.  There were roses on the mantelpiece and a mirror and the friend said to that man: &ldquo;Your astral body will get you into trouble if you don't control it.&rdquo;  If I placed my astral body over there, nobody could tell what position I might be in to-morrow.  I do not want to take up any more time.  I give myself credit for having done, in this speech, more for the Opposition than they have done for themselves on this Bill.  If they do not take my advice, if they are not guided by my astral body, all I say is that they may go where a certain soda water maker was told he might go.</P>

      <P>It is a rather curious commentary on the debating <Col N="1796" /> power of Fianna Fáil in this House and on the belief of the Fianna Fáil Party in the correctness and wisdom of this measure that the only defence of this proposal is contained in the extraordinarily grotesque speech we have just heard.  It is rather sad that in a matter of very grave importance&mdash;we are discussing now, possibly, the most important Bill that has come before the House since Fianna Fáil took office &mdash;we should be treated to the grotesque interlude of which we have just had experience.  It is very strange, indeed, that Fianna Fáil cannot put up, in defence of this measure, a Deputy capable of making anything like a reasoned case.  In the many unanswered speeches from this side of the House, one characteristic has been apparent.  That is, their extreme understatement.  It was pointed out, in many speeches from this side of the House, that this Bill was paving the road to a dictatorship.  In my judgment, and I have no hesitation in making this statement, it is not merely paving the road to a dictatorship but it is actually introducing a dictatorship. Nothing more is wanted to establish a dictatorship in this State than the passage of this Bill.  What is dictatorship?  A dictatorship is, as I understand it, the setting up of an individual, or a small number of individuals, with uncontrolled executive and uncontrolled legislative powers, in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this Bill becomes law I would like to know what control there will be upon the Executive as far as the execution of the laws of the State is concerned&mdash;that is, so far as the exercise of the executive powers are concerned. There will be no control.  As far as legislative power is concerned what control will there be of the Executive Council?  Absolutely none! Up to the present we know there was a Party system in this country, and Deputy Donnelly, who is one of the best authorities, says that the Party opposite is well drilled and will carry out, without hesitation, the decrees of the Executive Council.  The moment this Bill become law the Executive Council will be in the position of a dictatorship in this State.  They can <Col N="1797" /> pass any legislation they like, and do any executive act they like, be it as illegal or immoral or undesirable as it may; there is no power in the State to check them.  I am speaking upon one assumption, namely, that if this Bill passes the Oireachtas it will be valid in point of law.  I am not going into the argument as to whether that will be the case or not; as to whether this will be a binding piece of legislation or waste paper.  That is not a question I am going to argue now upon the Fifth Stage.  I stated my position on the Second Stage and I am not going to repeat that.</P>
    <P>Recently, upon as high legal authority as could be quoted in the State, the statement was made elsewhere that if this Bill was passed it would be inoperative.  I am arguing to-night upon the assumption that if the Bill passes the Oireachtas, it will be an operative measure, and that the Seanad, in fact, will be abolished and that this House will be the absolute holder of uncontrolled power.  Visualise what that means and what power is being handed to the Executive Council. We had an example very recently when the Executive rushed a Bill through this House in two days.  If this Bill passes, the Executive can rush any single measure it likes through the House in less than two days.  An Executive with a majority in this House, ready to carry out their wishes, can rush a Bill through the House in one day.  It can bring in a measure and pass it into law before the people of the State even know that it is the intention of the Executive Council to pass such a measure.  If there was a Second Chamber that could not be done.  It would take some time to reach the Second Chamber, and people would know that was being done.  But here, if the Executive Council think it is right, they can bring in any piece of legislation <i>in personam.</i>  If they dislike a single newspaper they can bring in a law crushing that newspaper. They can completely control the Press and pass any legislation abolishing the liberty of the subject.  But worse than that&mdash;and this is a point to which I want to draw the attention of the House and every single person who has <Col N="1798" /> any belief of any kind in the principle of democracy, of government by the people&mdash;they are taking away a great check which the Seanad put upon the Executive Council and upon legislation passed in this House.  They are, also, taking away the other, and greater check, which the people of this State themselves can be, and which the electors of this State can put upon the Executive, and upon the Dáil itself. You are now putting it in the power of the Executive Council to absolutely sweep away the control of the people. The people elect the Dáil, and the Dáil chooses its Executive Council; for how long?  For as long as the Executive likes if this Bill is passed.  At the present moment the law is that there must be an election every five years. What is to prevent the Executive Council, with the Dáil behind it, and no Second Chamber, from saying &ldquo;we will have an election not in five years but in 50 years?&rdquo;  There will be no power, and no control at all, to prevent that.</P>
    <P>The Dáil, if this Bill becomes law, can lengthen its own life to any time it wishes.  There is nothing to stop it, for it will have uncontrolled power of legislation.  The Government says the Seanad is no good.  Do they think that if this House passed a Bill to make it law that the life of the Dáil should be for ten or twenty years, or extending it beyond the five years period, that that Bill would get beyond the Seanad.  But now there is nothing to stop it.  The control of the Seanad and of the people is gone.  The moment the Dáil elects an Executive Council, after this Bill is passed, they put that Council in a position in which it is quite completely out of control, except such control as it may exercise over itself.  That will be the position if this Bill becomes law.  We hear something said about an alternative Seanad, but there is no alternative proposal put forward by the Government here.  In this Bill we are discussing one question only, and that is the question whether there is to be a Seanad&mdash;or no Seanad.  The question before the House is&mdash;Seanad or no Seanad&mdash;one-chamber Government and nothing else.  Anybody who votes for <Col N="1799" /> this measure votes for uncontrolled one-chamber Government.  If this Bill becomes law, not only can every single right of the citizens be swept away by any hasty legislation that this House likes, but also the power of the people and the rights of the people. But the right of the people is an inalienable right.  The right of the people to choose its own Government and rulers is a God-given right.  That right, I believe, can be destroyed by no Executive Council.  I am not now going to discuss, because it was fully debated on the Committee Stage, the fact that the judges can be dismissed at the whim of the Executive Council.</P>
    <P>It is said, of course, that there is a paper guarantee, but what is the use of a paper guarantee?  It can be swept away in five or six hours.  A special Bill can be run through this Dáil abolishing that guarantee so that the Comptroller and Auditor-General and the judges will be as much at the mercy of the Executive Council&mdash;this has been pointed out again and again by Deputies on this side&mdash;as if there was no such guarantee.  I would much rather see this Bill without that guarantee so that the people and this House itself even would thoroughly understand what is in it.  I would prefer that the people and this House should see it in all its nakedness than have it with this wretched illusory guarantee trying to blindfold the people and trying to hide from this House what is the true nature of this measure.</P>
    <P>Why is all this brought about? Because it has been said that the Executive Council have been checked in their legislative programme by what the Seanad has done.  Will any speaker from the opposite benches say what Government measure the Seanad has held up?  What single economic measure introduced by the Government did the Seanad hold up?  Not one.  It refused to agree to the Government's proposal to reduce the pay of the Guards, involving a comparatively small amount financially. But in what other respect did the Seanad prevent the carrying out of the Government's economic policy? <Col N="1800" /> The Seanad delayed the political policy of the Government, but surely that was right.  Political changes should be carefully thought out and considered, and surely it is right that, when vast political changes altering the whole nature of the Constitution are brought in and passed in this House, the Seanad should hold up those measures and give the Executive Council itself and the people of this country time to consider their advisability. That is what a Second Chamber is for.  So far as the Government's economic programme is concerned, there has been no hindrance to the carrying out of it, unsound as that programme is and unsound as I believe the majority of the Seanad consider it to be.  There has been no hindrance whatsoever placed on the Government in the way of carrying out this economic programme.</P>
    <P>What is the reason behind this measure which offends against natural justice.  As I pointed out before, a Bill was brought in by the Executive Council to prevent a perfectly lawful association of their political opponents who were keeping strictly within the law, and because the Government, in defiance of the principles of natural justice wished to ban that association, the Seanad refused to give them the power.  Then, in a sudden gust of passion, this Bill was introduced.  It was introduced, not as the result of long consideration, but hard upon the decision of the Seanad to hold up the Blueshirt Bill.  An Executive Council which is capable, in a sudden gust of passion, of introducing a Bill such as this is certainly one which should not be given the uncontrolled power that it is asking for under this Bill.  Under this Bill the Executive Council is making this request to the House: make us complete and absolute rulers of this State, with no control over us, no written Constitution that we cannot abolish, and with no control from the Seanad, because the Seanad will have gone, and with no control on the part of the people because we can lengthen out our life as long as we like.  That is the power the Executive Council is asking from the House under this Bill.  We are supposed to <Col N="1801" /> be a democratic country.  I suppose Deputies opposite will call themselves democrats even after they have voted for the passing of this measure which I say is the very negation of democracy.  This is a Bill giving a certain nominated set of individuals, possibly it may be one individual, absolutely supreme legislative and executive power in this State.</P>
    <P>Some of the Deputies opposite call themselves Republicans, some of them are pseudo-Republicans and some are semi-Republicans.  I do not care what they are, but I say this: that if a republic were established to-morrow, giving to any individual or set of individuals the power which the Executive Council is asking this House to confer upon it by this measure that republic would be a republic only in name.  It would be a dictatorship: an autocracy, at any rate.  That is a measure which the Fianna Fáil Party, and no doubt the Labour Party, will support on the Final Stage, as they have supported it up to this.  A Government which comes here and asks for these uncontrolled powers shows, in my judgment, and shows conclusively, that it is not a Government that ought to be in power in this State.  It is a Government that by the very introduction of this measure has shown its incapacity to govern. The Executive Council comes along and, through the President as its mouthpiece, asks for uncontrolled dictatorial terms.  This is not a State, I sincerely hope it never will be a State, which will permit any individual or group of individuals to exercise dictatorial powers, and if there is one single spark of democratic feeling left in the people of this State, if there is one single beat left in their hearts for liberty, they will not stand for this measure.  It is a negation of liberty. It is a seizure by the Executive Council of the liberties of the people.  It is a tearing up of every right which the Constitution has given to the people.  While I do not believe that the Deputies opposite will be moved by any argument, any consideration, or by any sense of what is right and just, of what is and what is not an infringement of the rights and liberties <Col N="1802" /> of the people, there is, I would remind them, a great public outside this House, the great Irish people, who see their liberties being filched away from them and I do believe that they will show their appreciation of the way in which this Executive Council is acting towards them and will show it before very long.</P>

      <P>The arguments put forward by the occupants of the Opposition Benches go to show that this Bill is going to take away from the people their democratic rights.  The last speaker said it is the very negation of democracy to get a Bill of this kind through the Dáil for the abolition of the Seanad.  I wonder what is the Deputy's idea of democracy?  I feel undoubtedly that it differs fundamentally from mine.  The Seanad is not representative of the people of this country. It has not been elected by the people of the country.  It has no interests in common with the people of the country. If we understand the principle on which the Seanad is elected we can then see whether it is a democratic institution or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first place, members of this House have the right to vote in the election of the Seanad.  In doing so they exercise authority and power derived from the people.  But in so doing they are exercising a second-hand authority.  That in itself is not democracy.  It is a denial of the democratic rights of the people.  But bad as that denial is, we find when the vacancies in the Seanad are being filled that the members of the Seanad have a right, and always exercised their right, to vote for the new members of that Seanad.  In doing so the members of the Seanad surely do not derive their authority from the people.  They derive that authority partly from this House which is a second-hand authority. The members of the Seanad, in exercising that authority, are only exercising a third-hand authority in the election to that Assembly.  That is not democracy, and that is not safeguarding democratic rights.  But bad as those two are the situation is even worse when we find that the third <Col N="1803" /> group who have power and authority in the election to the Seanad are the retiring members thereof.</P>
    <P>Periodically at settled intervals we have an election of 15 or 20 members to the Seanad.  Say that 20 members are retiring and that 20 vacancies have to be filled.  The members of this House and the members of the Seanad, even the outgoing members of the Seanad, have power to elect the new members.  Therefore, the Seanad is not democratic, and it is not a safeguard for the democratic rights of the people. It acts in an autocratic way, and it denies the democratic rights of the people of which the members of the Opposition have spoken.</P>

      <P>I have heard three powerful speeches in support of this measure.  Each gave a reason for voting for it.  The first was that a mandate had been secured at a general election.  No other reason than that. Portion of an election address was read out.  Large portions of that address have since been abandoned by the Government.  That is the mandate that we have been told the Government has got.  We had a speech from another occupant of those benches in which we were advised to put up a proposal for an alternative Seanad.  We had the last and I suppose the most brilliant contribution now towards the reasons why this Bill should pass into law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many reasons why this Bill should not pass into law.  The reason is that the people's rights and the liberties and privileges which they enjoy should not be at the mercy of any single majority vote in this House. Not without reason did the Seanad reject the measure which sought to restrict the liberties of the Irish people some short time ago.  One of the things which is enshrined in the Constitution is political liberty.  One of the things which animated this Government when it was in Opposition in going out to the general election was a criticism of the Administration then in office for having passed into law the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution. That Act was denounced as one of the most coercive <Col N="1804" /> measures that had ever been introduced into this country.  It was attacked here in this House and odium was poured upon it.  Every description that could possibly be thought of was applied to it in the most contemptuous tones.  We were told that it was an invasion of the people's rights and liberties and that there was no security for the people's rights and liberties once that Bill was passed into law.  But the very people who made those statements prostituted that Act in order to prove that what they said was true&mdash;that there were no rights on the part of the people&mdash;so long as they wished to take them from them.  Yet, in spite of that statement and other statements that were made by them that measure was vindicated and the courts snatched from this Administration a person they tried to keep in custody.</P>
    <P>That measure was vindicated by the action of the courts in restoring to a citizen of this country his liberty.  The Government found that that measure which they so strongly denounced was not strong enough for them to crush political opposition in this country and they introduced the Wearing of Uniform (Restriction) Bill which strikes at the very roots of one of the fundamental provisions of the Constitution. The Seanad would not stand for that Bill and now we are told by the Government, or their very lame apologists&mdash;and they have very few of them and their contributions are very miserable&mdash;that the Seanad which did what was asked for by the last Administration, refused this Administration the power which they extended to the other.</P>
    <P>What are the facts?  Before the Seventeenth Amendment was introduced and passed into law, life and liberty were not safe in this country.  The Government spoke of the Wearing of Uniform (Restriction) Bill as necessary for the preservation of law.  Is liberty less safe, is freedom less safe since the Seanad refused to pass that measure? The main argument we have against this measure to-night is the fact that we do not repose any confidence in this Administration.  In my own personal <Col N="1805" /> experience I have had three notable examples of this Administration.  I recited them before in this House.  At the last general election one of the Ministers sent down word that I was to be ambushed and it was thought proper that I was to have a procession from Cork to Dublin.  Now I cannot go to sleep at night until the Government take away their noisy cars from outside my gate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is perfectly germane. The power that this Government is going to have directly this Bill passes into law is a power which I say this House should not give them. When I exposed a certain matter here a short time ago the Government sent a high police officer to me.  He knew nothing whatever about the case and admitted to me he did not know anything about it.  These three personal experiences are quite sufficient to satisfy me that this Administration has not the confidence, would not have the confidence and should not have the confidence of the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here, during the course of this measure which was hastily introduced on the 22nd March&mdash;the previous Bill, the Uniform Bill, which gave rise to this measure, having been passed in this House on the 14th March&mdash;we did not hear one clear-cut argument in its favour advanced from the Government Benches.  What is it in reality? Only a simple litany of alterations and mutilations of the Constitution. It was pointed out in the course of this measure through the House that there were several defects.  Two of them have been partially remedied, but that is not enough.  The Bill should not pass, so defective is it in its construction.  I drew attention to the fact that any evening at 3 o'clock, once this Bill passes, a measure can be introduced which will alter the currency, which could reduce the value of Savings Certificates that the people have purchased at a good price and <Col N="1806" /> with good money from this Government. A measure could be passed which would leave the Government responsible, if they so desired, for only half of the Post Office Savings Bank deposits.  When I say that I am told I am damaging the credit of this country.</P>

      <P>That comes well from people who have done their damnedst during the five years they were in this House.  It comes well from them to make this charge.  I invited you to remedy that state of affairs, to make it impossible for any Parliament to do the like of that. Show us whether or not you are really concerned with the credit of this State. Why should it be left to a simple majority of the House to do the like of that?  If it is considered of sufficient importance to make even a day's delay over the dismissal of a judge why could you not do it for the currency, the credit of the State?  It comes well from people over there to say that I am damaging the credit of the State when, for five years, they did their worst in that connection, talking about bankruptcy and so on. In the same way, when it is indicated that within six hours they may enact legislation that may mean the tearing up of every Article of the Constitution which gives people liberty, they say, &ldquo;We are going to consider that; that is not of such importance as the judges.  We must make sure, at any rate, that this Bill, in so far as any imperfections in that respect are concerned, will not be subject to condemnation in the courts of law.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had experience of how this Administration regards the liberty of the people.  It is some satisfaction to us that we have a Constitution and that we have laws and that we have some authority in this State which could judge the actions of an Executive which sought to put a limit upon the people's liberty.  We have listened to members of the front bench taunting us about going into a room to make up what we are going to say. We know the type of mind there is <Col N="1807" /> behind the present Administration. There is no regimented representation here.  There is full liberty of speech, full liberty to anybody to make up his mind.  The regimentation is over there.  We got an admission of it from Deputy Donnelly to-night.  Loyalty, blind loyalty, a blind following of whatever headline is set up for them. May I submit this for the consideration of the House before it decides on this Bill?  Parliaments have been corrupt before this.  There might be two corrupt Parties which would conspire to give a lengthened life to Dáil representation and to keep a Government in power against the will of the people.  Where is the people's security in a case of that sort?  The people's security is the most important item in the whole of the Constitution.  The Government's interpretation of the Constitution is the power that Parliament gets, the power they can exercise. It would be, perhaps, much more correct to say the might that they can employ rather than the power or right that they can exercise.</P>
    <P>We are against following the example of people from the time of Cromwell down.  We are against all those examples on the Continent, where the road to the suppression of democratic liberty is through the Single Chamber.  It is not part of the business of the Opposition to give reasons why a Bill of this sort should not pass.  The onus is on the Government to prove that there is a case for it.  Let us understand this once and for all.  There are two considerations in connection with this measure and let them not be mixed.  There is one, the weak minded, miserable minded, pushing of the majority over there who single out the personnel of the Seanad as the reason for its abolition, and there is the bigger question, whether or not this country should have a single Parliament.  In my view, taken for what it is worth, the people of this country had the right to expect that the institutions of the State under our Constitution were their safeguards and their security. The so-called mandate that the <Col N="1808" /> Government has got has just as much chance of real success as their undertaking to put 84,000 people into employment or to reduce the taxation of this country by £2,000,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>No reason has emerged to-night for the passage of this measure.  Indeed, there is every reason why it should not pass.  If this measure passes it will be at any time within the power of a Government with a majority of one to take away the liberty of the people within a period of six hours.  The Government will have power to upset and interfere with the currency or the finances of the State.  It will be within the power of the Government to extend the life of a Parliament. Each and every one of these reasons is enough in itself, if there were no other, for the rejection of this measure, which was introduced without any consideration for the gap that was being left in the Constitution of this State and which was amended miserably.  Now I suppose we are going to get an apology of a Commission to examine the whole situation and devise some means for putting a face upon this mutilation of the people's rights.</P>

      <P>I do not know why people use fantastic exaggeration if they hope to carry any conviction with them.  I am sure that the people of the country who will bother about reading the speeches that we have heard from the Opposition will smile and think it a huge joke&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>They will smile when they hear the Seanad is the protector of their liberty.  Think of it! Everything is gone if the Seanad goes. All their rights are going to be swept away.  Deputy Cosgrave tells us what Deputy Hogan said before in other words, that no man with a sixpence in his pocket will henceforth be safe. Is not that the position?  Now the people of the country have a fair realisation of the extent to which their <Col N="1809" /> liberties are going to be, or would be, protected by the Seanad.  If Deputies on the opposite benches hoped to carry any conviction they would deal with this subject in quite a different way from the way in which they have dealt with it.</P>
      <P>When I introduced the Bill I said&mdash; and I repeat it&mdash;that the onus was on the Opposition to show why there should be a Second Chamber.  Why should we complicate legislative machinery unnecessarily?  There is nothing in reason in the nature of representative Government that would at all have suggested to anybody a check in a Second Chamber, such as the Seanad is.  There is nothing in the nature of representative Government that would have suggested that, and I said that it is for those who want to maintain such a check to show their reasons for it.  I think that was fair. To me, it was just as if I were to have to defend the removing of hobble skirts.  It is for those who say that hobble shirts, which restrict natural movement, should be worn to show why they should be worn&mdash;in other words, to show why these restrictions and this unnecessary complication in the legislative machinery should be there. Any piece of machinery that is unnecessarily complicated, to that extent offends one's sense of what is right and is, to the extent that it is unnecessary, usually inefficient as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I issued a challenge.  How has that challenge been met?  One argument has been relied upon, and that is that the common experience of mankind, if you please, points to the advisability of a Second Chamber. Our professors of history, when challenged to give us more than a mere statement of that, relied on the single case of the revolution in France.  I hope that the professor does not teach history as partially as he tried to teach the Dáil this evening and that he does not draw such partial conclusions from his history or ask the students to draw the conclusions that he asked the Dáil to draw.  I challenged him because I had not been able to find anywhere any justification for the conclusion, and I believe that it was a lazy expression of opinion taking something as an <Col N="1810" /> accepted fact from some conservative writer without any attempt whatever to examine it for himself.  I asked him to let us have these proofs which history was supposed to afford as to the value of Second Chambers and the dangers and difficulties that followed from the Single Chamber system.</P>
    <P>We were told that we had a Single Chamber legislative system at the beginning of the French Revolution. Everybody knows the conditions that obtained at that time and everybody knows that it would be very dangerous to draw any conclusions from that particular period.  If, however, we were going to draw conclusions from that period, did he not know that immediately the Consulate was established they had three Chambers, and did that protect the liberties of the French people?  He told us that the present French Republic had a Second Chamber and that it was instituted there as the result of French political thought.  Everybody knows that at that particular time it was opposed to the sentiment of Republican France and that the Republican leader at that time simply chose it because at the time he sensed a Royalist majority and it was used at that particular time simply as a means of getting the Republic through.  It has persisted, but what has been its history?  Its history has been that it has opposed every single progressive measure that has been brought forth.  That is the history of it.  I say, then, if we are going to use history as the background and as our teacher and educator in this particular matter, let us try honestly to draw conclusions from it and let us examine it so that we can draw conclusions from it.</P>
    <P>Take, for example, everything we have heard about dictatorship to-night. Take every single dictatorship&mdash; although perhaps it is an exaggeration to speak of a single dictatorship.  Take the case of Napoleon.  There was a Senate to stop him.  Did it stop him? Not a bit.  Victor Hugo, I think, in one of his writings said of them:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The poltroons!  They were bigger slaves than we wanted them to be.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The same author, speaking of the <Col N="1811" /> experiences of a Roman Emperor, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The wretches!  They were bigger slaves than we wanted them to be.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Take the case of Louis Napoleon.  Did the Senate stop him from his <i>coup d'êtat</i>?  Not a bit of it.  In all history we have proof that Second Chambers are no protection whatever for the liberties of the people.  It was Victor Hugo again, I think, who in the same chapter, pointed out the contempt which Charles X had for Senates when he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Send my boots to Stockholm to preside over the Senate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous for people to come along here and pretend that they can fool people, because that is what it is, by saying that the experience of history points to the value of Second Chambers as a protection against tyranny and as a protection against dictatorship.  History teaches no such lesson.  The lesson of history is this: that when dictators come along, backed by force, they tear up any constitution whether it be a Single Chamber or Double Chamber Legislative Assembly. That is the truth.</P>
    <P>As to this particular measure, the suggestion is that we brought it in here in a fit of pique.  We did nothing of the sort.  We went to the electorate a year ago and we said to the people that we proposed to abolish the Seanad as at present constituted, and we indicated quite clearly that the question of a Second Chamber was one for further consideration.  Showing that the question was open for decision, we indicated that if we were going to have a Second Chamber we would reduce the number of its members and consequently would reduce this expense to the country.  It was quite clear in our manifesto that the Senate, as at present constituted, was to go, and that the question of replacing it by a Second Chamber was one for consideration by the Government elected and by the new Parliament.  We brought in a Bill to limit its powers. It is suggested that that showed a different attitude from our attitude in bringing in this Bill.  To this extent only was it different, that when we <Col N="1812" /> brought in that Bill we said: &ldquo;We will still give further time for consideration as to whether we will get a Second Chamber or not, but in this thing we are doing by the Bill, of restricting its powers, we are going to make whatever decisions may be ultimately arrived at capable of being quickly put into law and not be held up by the period which the Constitution, as it stood before, and as it stands until that measure becomes law, would require,&rdquo; but there is no inconsistency. I even pointed out at the time, while we were giving the matter consideration, that the Seanad, as at present constituted, was to go and this Bill as it was introduced provided simply that this Second Chamber was to disappear. That was the first step and the main provision of the Bill as introduced was to effect that.  The other provisions were merely consequential.</P>
    <P>It is suggested that we did this without any thought as to the situation that would result when that Bill became law.  We did not do anything of the kind.  Although we shall be going to the Seanad in a very short time&mdash;Wednesday, perhaps&mdash;with this Bill, I do not expect that the Seanad are going to pass it.  They did not pass the Bill limiting their powers and I do not expect that they are going to pass this Bill abolishing themselves. We will, therefore, have a period of close on a year before this measure becomes law.  During that period of time, it is possible to do certain things and it was intended that certain things should be done.  I have myself despaired of being able to devise any type of Seanad that would be worth setting up.  We had Deputy MacDermot to-night going back to the old ideal&mdash;the sort of thing which has a certain glamour for us all in every country, but for the securing of which nobody yet has been able to succeed in getting a system.  As I said, I think in my Second Reading speech, we all have a picture of a venerable Seanad, composed of wise men, men who are not going to be affected by the ordinary political passions of the day, men who have rendered distinguished service to their country and all the rest of it.  That has always been the <Col N="1813" /> dream of a Seanad, but it has never once been even approximated to, except, perhaps, in ancient Rome.</P>
    <P>It has certainly never been approximated to in modern democratic times and you can easily satisfy yourselves that it cannot even be approximated to, because you can easily frame a list of the possible ways in which a Seanad could be constituted and you can go through them one by one and you will find that there is not a single way in which you can get the Seanad that you require.  If you allow a nominated Seanad perhaps you can, or if you get even a group of people who would come into existence for a time, nominating the best people on whom you could depend, but where are you going to get that group and are people in general going to accept the nomination of such a group?  There have been nominated Senates before and there is in Canada, as you know, a nominated Senate.  What has been the effect of it?  The Senate there was nominated by the political leader of the day and it became a political body. All this outcry which we have heard from the benches opposite has been raised because they regard the Second House here as their ally and it is because it is their political ally that its fate is being bemoaned.  In Canada the result of this nominated Senate has been to bring it into disrepute.</P>
    <P>In its origin, the Seanad here was largely a nominated Seanad.  Do you think the people were going to respect such a Seanad?  Did they not know full well that, the nominations being made by a political leader, these nominations would naturally be coloured by the political leader's outlook and that he would choose people, particularly if he was going to have any further administrative responsibility, who were going to support him and not hinder him?  You can have a nominated Seanad, as I say, but where does it lead to?  Nobody is going to accept it, though I believe it is the only way in which you can have any hope whatever of getting that ideal Seanad, composed of old people, people who had rendered service to <Col N="1814" /> their country, people who were not going to be affected by political passions but does anybody think that, if there was a nominated Chamber here and if the elected representatives of the people believed that a certain measure was necessary, they would tolerate being held up for any long time by such a Seanad?</P>
    <P>I say again that you can go through the ways in which a Seanad could be selected&mdash;it has to be elected directly or indirectly&mdash;and going through them all, you will find that there are faults in every one of them which would completely prevent the Seanad from being the Seanad to which we have an attachment because the Seanad we conjure up as an ideal is impossible of attainment or even approximate attainment. We have got from the other side no justification whatever for this Second Chamber.  What is the general idea about it?  The idea is a check but what you want is a check which will operate when it ought to operate and will not operate when it should not operate.  That is what you want.  You surely do not want to have the sort of check that Benjamin Franklin spoke of when he was mocking this idea of checks and when he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;What do you want?  Do you want to have a cart with one horse tied at one end and pulling one way and another horse tied at the other end pulling the other way?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Do you want to have a Parliament that is able to give effect and to put into law the measures that the people feel are necessary for their well-being or do you want to have continual frustration?</P>
    <P>When you put up these Senates as checks, what happens is that the Seanad is naturally a political body. They are not outside the body of the citizens; they have the same political feelings and, very often, the same type of political affiliations that other citizens of the country have and they are affected, if you like, by the same political passions and what happens is that if the majority of the Seanad are of the same political mind as the majority of the elected House, there is no check whereas if they are of the opposite mind, they behave exactly as an Opposition in a two-Party Parliament <Col N="1815" /> would behave.  We have seen an example of that behaviour here.  We have seen a Professor of History who refused to give us his special knowledge. If he were in the Seanad, do you think he would give that special knowledge to the benefit of the people? He refused to give it here.  We have a lawyer, and ex-Attorney-General, who wants to pull down his colleague because that colleague is not playing the political game well enough.  He reproves his colleague for pointing out a possible defect in legislation that is being proposed here.  Is that man doing his duty as a representative in withholding any special knowledge and playing the game?  He is not, in my opinion; and he is not a good representative of the people and he is not behaving as a representative of the people should.</P>
    <P>It is our duty as representatives not to play the political game, in the sense of keeping back information and knowledge, which ought to be used here in the Legislative Assembly for the general benefit, in the hope that some mistake will be made here by the Government of the day which might be exploited to the benefit of the <Col N="1816" /> Party in the Courts.  Is that professional expert, if he is put into the Seanad, going to act differently?  Not a bit of it.  The Professor of History or the lawyer, when he is operating in another Chamber, will operate with just the same political bias with which he operated when he was here.  You cannot get rid of it.  Therefore, let us get rid of this farce that there is any check like that.  Let us forget about it and let the people forget that it is a check and let the people and us here concentrate on making the direct representative Assembly the type of Assembly it should be.  The sooner the people realise that there is no effective check, the greater will be their care in the election of their representatives.  That is my opinion. I do not think you can have it both ways.  I think there must be authority somewhere and there must be the power of taking action somewhere. Let us get the best we can and let us not be fooling ourselves with the idea that, if we have a Second Chamber, we are going to be better off. I move the adjournment.</P>
    <P>The House adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m., Friday, 25th May, 1934.</P>
