      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that four young men from the Newtown (Kilmacthomas) district who were arrested on the last Tuesday in October and detained in the Gárda barracks at Barrack Street, Waterford, until about one o'clock on the following Thursday, which was a church holiday, were refused permission to attend Divine Service on the holiday; that during their detention they were housed under most unsatisfactory conditions; that generally the accommodation for prisoners at the Barrack Street barracks is unsuitable from a sanitary point of view, and if he will cause inquiries to be made with a view to having the causes of complaint remedied without delay.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will state if he is aware that Mr. Thomas Hudson of Newmarket, Knocktopher, County Kilkenny, was arrested on the 14th November, and brought to Waterford barracks at 1 a.m. and there interrogated for about an hour; that he was made remove his boots, and at 2 a.m. was removed in his stockinged feet to a cell in which there was no light, in which four or five panes of glass were broken, and the stone floor of which was in a filthy condition; that the only bedclothing provided was an old disused greatcoat belonging to a Gárda; <Col N="1078" /> that no notice was taken of Mr. Hudson's complaint regarding the filthy state of the cell, and its general condition, nor of his complaint of the inadequacy of the bedclothing; that he was kept in the cell without any boots until 4 o'clock next day, and if the Minister will state what is the reason for this treatment of Mr. Hudson; whether this treatment is the result of instructions issued by the Minister, or whether it is in accordance with general police regulations, and, if so, if he will state the particular regulation, or regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The person referred to in the question was detained at Waterford Barracks on suspicion of having committed certain offences, including the unlawful possession of ammunition, to which he, in fact, pleaded guilty before the Constitution (Special Powers) Tribunal on the 7th instant.  I am satisfied that, while so detained, he was subjected to no ill-treatment whatsoever and that every allegation contained in the question is without foundation.  In particular I might mention that the cell in which the prisoner was detained was not in a filthy condition and that he made no complaints whatever either as to the condition of the cell or as to his general treatment.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister deny that the prisoner's boots were removed; that he was kept in a cell, for the length of time stated in the question, without any boots; that the windows in the cell were broken, and that the only bed-clothing he was provided with was a Guard's disused overcoat?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>What happened was that this man when arrested was suspected of having ammunition.  Some ammunition was found on him, and he was wearing a pair of Army boots which were recently issued.  He had been discharged from the Army shortly before. Those boots were removed on the grounds that the Guards believed he was not in proper possession of them, but had got them by improper means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1079" /> He was given felt house shoes, which the Guards maintain were perfectly comfortable.  As regards the broken windows, in 1930 during the Deputy's régime, three panes were removed by order of the Board of Works for the purpose of ventilation.  It is assumed that those are the broken windows referred to.</P>

      <P>Are we to understand from the Minister that every man who has left the Army or the Army reserve with boots supplied to him while in the Army or the Army reserve, and left with him when leaving, is liable to be arrested by the Guards and have the boots taken off him on the grounds that he is not in lawful possession of them?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that a large number of prisoners brought to Waterford barracks recently have from time to time been released therefrom at very late hours of the night, or in the early morning, without any money, and without any previous notice; that they belonged to various parts of the County Kilkenny and were saved from the inconvenience and hardship of having to walk long distances home, or wait in the streets of Waterford until morning, only by disturbing and seeking the hospitality and assistance of persons in Waterford at a late hour of the night or early morning; and if he will state if this treatment is in accordance with instructions issued by the Minister or in accordance with police regulations, and, if so, if he will state what these regulations are, and what purpose they are intended to serve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that in a number of instances prisoners who had been detained in Waterford barracks <Col N="1080" /> have been released at night.  It has been the invariable practice of the Gárdaí, in the cases of persons discharged after the last train or bus had left for their particular district, to telephone&mdash;if the released parties so desired&mdash;the local Gárdaí to arrange for transport to bring them home, or alternatively they were offered the hospitality of the dayroom fire until such time as a means of transport to their homes was available.  I am satisfied that in no case were they turned out into the streets unless they themselves decided that they wanted to leave the barracks.</P>

Prior to the enactment of the measure in question no distinction was drawn between advances for the improvement of the Shannon navigation and other advances, and interest was accordingly claimed for this period, but in the claim for the half-year ended 31st December, 1929 (first half year after the coming into operation of the Electricity (Finance) Act, 1929), credit in respect of all interest previously paid on these advances was allowed and no interest thereon has since been claimed.</P>

There were no registered wheat growers prior to 1933.  The total amount paid to such growers in respect of wheat harvested in 1933 and sold by them to licensed millers or registered wheat dealers under the provisions of the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Act during the sale (wheat) season ended 15th December, 1933, was £137,276, of which sum £40,891 was bounty.  The total amount paid to registered wheat growers in respect of wheat of the 1933 crop sold during the two sale (wheat) seasons ended 15th April, 1934, and 31st July, 1934, was £12,386, of which sum £4,319 was bounty.  It is not possible to furnish, with any degree of accuracy, estimates in respect of wheat harvested in 1934, as registered wheat growers may sell such wheat during any of the three sale (wheat) seasons in the cereal year ending 31st July, 1935, and the ascertained average price of wheat sold during any such season cannot be determined until after the close of that season.  In this Department's Estimates for the current financial year a sum of £120,000 was inserted to meet payments in respect of wheat bounty.  Nearly all of this is estimated to be required in respect of wheat of the 1934 crop sold in the current sale (wheat) season.</P>

      <P>That as regards any Act of the present Session to provide for and regulate the acquisition by birth or otherwise of citizenship of Saorstát Eireann and the forfeiture or loss of such citizenship, and to provide for divers matters connected with the matters aforesaid, it is expedient to authorise the payment out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas of any expenses incurred in carrying such Act into effect being expenses which are required by the provisions of such Act to be defrayed out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the Minister in what he says about the expenditure under this Bill.  The expenses under this Bill will be considerable.  So far as I can make out, the expenditure under the Citizenship Bill in future years may amount to something like <Col N="1110" /> half a million a year, that is judging by the Government amendments down for the Committee Stage of the Bill.  These amendments show that it is the intention of the Government, as far as they can, to deprive the citizens of this State of the dual citizenship of the Commonwealth. Citizens of this State in future will be unable to call upon the consuls of the Commonwealth in different parts of the world for assistance.  Consequently it will be necessary for us to establish a very widespread consular service in order to deal with the requirements both in regard to this Bill and the ordinary routine functions of issuing visas and passports.  The result will be that a very heavy expenditure will be put upon the people of this State.  At the present time the citizens of this State all over the world, in view of the introduction of the Citizenship Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I mentioned that because I am aware that some countries like ours which maintain a consular service find that it costs about £500,000 to £750,000 a year to run that service. Because of the wide diffusion of our race, expenditure will probably be more considerable in our case than would be necessitated in the case of the independent consular services of such countries as Denmark, Sweden and Norway. I am only referring to what will be the indirect result of this Bill.  I am not referring to direct expenditure.</P>

Is it the intention of the Government to establish the office of High Commissioner in such countries as Canada and Australia, so that the Bill may be of universal application to countries in which there are large Irish populations who may wish to retain their Irish citizenship? At present, we have only one High Commissioner&mdash;that is, in the United Kingdom.  The bulk of the Irish population abroad, outside the United States and the United Kingdom, is in such countries as Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete sub-section (2) and substitute the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where</P>
      <P>(a) a person is born outside Saorstát Eireann on or after the date of the passing of this Act, and</P>
      <P>(b) such person's father is, on the day of such person's birth, a natural-born citizen of Saorstát Eireann born outside Saorstát Eireann, or a naturalised citizen of Saorstát Eireann, and</P>
      <P>(c)  such person's father is, on the day of such person's birth, not employed in the service of the Government of Saorstát Eireann,</P>
      <P>such person shall not be a natural-born citizen of Saorstát Eireann unless within one year or, where the Minister because of special circumstances so permits, within two years after the day of such person's birth the fact of such person's birth is registered&mdash;</P>
      <P>(d) if such person is born in a country in which there is, on the day of his birth, a Saorstát Eireann legation or consulate, in the foreign births entry book kept at such legation or consulate or in the foreign births register, or</P>

    <P>(e) if such person is born in a country in which there is, on the <Col N="1119" /> day of his birth, neither a Saorstát Eireann legation nor a Saorstát Eireann consulate, in the foreign births register.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to take away the implication that seems to be in sub-section (2) as it stands.  It would appear that the section as it stands suggests that a person would be a natural born citizen before the passage of this Bill.  As this Bill is creating natural born citizenship, for the first time, we have altered the section so as to agree with that fact.  It was easier to re-write the section as a whole than to put in any amendments that would be necessary.</P>

      <P>Is there not more than that in the alteration?  Does it not also substantially change the position of certain classes of children born since December, 1922, but before the passing of this Act?  That class of children mentioned in the section as it stands is not mentioned in the new section at all.  It would appear that there is no necessity for these children to be registered in the future.  I am speaking, as the section speaks, of children born outside Saorstát Eireann, and the children of an Irishman born outside Saorstát Eireann.</P>

      <P>There is a certain material change in the amendment as it stands, but I do not think that is the point raised by the Deputy.  There is a point which may have escaped the Deputy with regard to citizens and natural born citizens in the Bill in the form in which it stood originally.  It would appear that a natural born citizen was put in a worse position than that of a citizen under Article 3.  What we have done with the section is: We have put the naturalised citizen in a worse position, so to speak, than that of the natural born citizen or citizen under Article 3 in the new form.</P>

Will there have to be three types of citizenship-natural born citizens; those that have become citizens under Article 3 prior in time <Col N="1120" /> to any citizens born hereafter; and naturalised citizens, and will they be called so in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The three categories or classes will undoubtedly exist under the Bill, and they will all be referred to under the title of citizens.  Citizens of all classes will have the status as clearly shown before the law.  They will have the same status before the law.  It is a question of categories.  Undoubtedly we will have these three categories, and we can group them into these three groups.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have citizens under Article 3.  Some of them had nothing to do with the country except in their years of residence.  Some of these people were born in Ireland. Others had one or both parents born in Ireland.  Leaving out the small group not born in Ireland or born of one or other Irish parents, there is first your natural born citizens in the future. Yet they are degraded under this Bill. They will have to have a certificate of naturalisation, and if the person has children they are deemed to be natural born.  Why natural born?  Why make that distinction as to the children of somebody given a certificate of naturalisation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is in paragraphs (e) and (f) of Section 2.  I understand those, originally determined to be citizens under Article 3, were able to transmit citizenship to the first generation.  That is not so under the Bill as it stands.  I do not know whether that is deliberate.  If so we have made that distinction, and I want to know why?  There is another point. Is it intended under this Bill that a ship registered in Saorstát Eireann shall, for all practical purposes, count as part of the territory of Saorstát Eireann?  If that is the idea it is not carried out under this Bill.  There are times when these ships will be outside Ireland or outside the Free State. Does this include persons born on ships registered in the Free State? Most countries have ships registered and these ships count as part of the floating territory of the particular State, and any person born on such a ship is counted as a person born in the State.  Is that to be the case with regard to Saorstát ships?  And, last of all, in this section, I want to know what is Saorstát Eireann and where is Saorstát Eireann?  Is there any definition of it?  There is none here.  We have read definitions of citizens in the Moneylenders Act and in the Cereals Act and other Acts and we are all aware of a certain definition of Saorstát Eireann in the Interpretation Act of 1923.  What is the definition?  Section 3 says:</P>
      <P>The expression &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; ... when used for the purpose of defining the application of any law or the extent or incidence of any authority. or obligation or imposition shall mean the area for the time being within the jurisdiction of the Parliament and Government of Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1122" /> That definition was before the draftsman when the Moneylenders Act and the Cereals Act and the Control of Manufactures Act and other Acts came along, and yet it was decided having that definition of what Saorstát Eireann was not to define what comprised Saorstát Eireann here.  I suggest that it was done because there was a realisation that the phrase &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann,&rdquo; as there defined, does not meet this circumstance, because we are not defining this.  The phrase would operate if you were talking about something within the confines of Saorstát Eireann, but where you are passing beyond that, or founding your whole Bill&mdash;not defining it, but founding it&mdash; on the general question of citizenship, I doubt very much if that phrase embraces them.  I would not have thought of suggesting it only that I thought that the draftsman, in putting in, in several phrases, the phrase that was used and was to be operative, may not have realised that.  I suggest that it was unnecessary and that the draftsman put in a new phrase.  Why did he do that?  These new phrases are not put in merely for the sake of filling up space.  What is meant by the term &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann&rdquo;?  That is what the whole Bill turns upon.  Clearly, it is not defined in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point that I would like to have cleared up. Taking either these amendments or the original section, it seems to me to contravene what should be a guiding principle with us.  It seems to me that a position is created in which people will have a dual nationality.  If, by the mere fact of being born here; one is a citizen of Saorstát Eireann, we, surely, should recognise that another person, born in another State or in the area of that State's jurisdiction, is a citizen of that State.  On the other hand, if any person born here is an Irish citizen, then, any person, not born here, is not a citizen of this State.  If we were to follow that out to its logical conclusion, and if every other State did the same, it would be clearly impossible to carry out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we have two principles&mdash;that of <Col N="1123" /> geography and that of parentage.  We say, in effect, to anybody, that if your father was, say, a Russian, you are subject to its laws and, automatically, have the rights belonging to that nationality; but, at the same time, we say: if you were born in Russia, and your parents were Irish, we deny to the Russian Government&mdash;or the Italian, or any other Government&mdash;the right to make laws in your regard in this country; and we also say, in effect, that if your father or mother is Irish, you are an Irish citizen.  That seems to me to be a wrong principle.  We should define citizenship definitely in the way that seems to us to be right and proper, and I think that we should not assume a sort of arrogant nationality that anybody born here is Irish and that we have a sort of Irish imperialism over anybody born elsewhere, if their parents were Irish.  I think that is wrong.  If other countries were to do the same we would have an enormous number of people with different nationalities.  We should say that people born here are Irish and, if not born here, they are of a different nationality.  In other words, we should say that if a man is born here he is an Irish citizen, or, if it is going to be put on the question of parentage, no matter where he is born, he is going to be regarded as Irish.</P>
    <P>The different principles operating there must necessarily mean that people will, at the same time, be citizens of the Irish Free State because of their birth in the Irish Free State, and citizens of other countries because of their parentage in other countries.  In the same way, it can be said that people born in other countries, but whose parents were Irish can be claimed to be citizens of those other countries.  It will lead to trouble.  A person, born here and travelling with our passport, feeling that they have our Consular&mdash;or rather, perhaps I should say, the British Consular&mdash;offices, or their representatives, behind them, will feel that that is full security, but may find that in the other country to which they may travel they will be claimed by that other country <Col N="1124" /> as a citizen and subject to the regulations of that other country.  The whole principle is awkward and unsound, and I feel that you have to make up your mind to have one of two things.</P>

      <P>It seems to me either that there is a change of policy between the original proposals and the new suggestions, or else that an anomaly exists.  Supposing that I had been born in another country&mdash;which I was not-but supposing that I had been born in another country and had a son born abroad in 1930, under the clause, as it appears to me, it would be necessary for me to register that son in order that he should be an Irish citizen. Under the new, or amended, clause, it would not be necessary to register him if he was born in 1930, but it would be necessary if he were born in 1935.  Is that so intended?</P>

      <P>Several points have been raised.  Three points, I think, were raised by Deputies.  First of all, the point was mentioned about a ship. The intention is to follow out the general line that an Irish ship should be regarded, for that purpose, as Irish territory.  From that point of view, if we come to anything that seems to be contrary to that point of view, we can deal with it in another section.  The next point was in regard to the definition of Saorstát Eireann.  I do not know if it is necessary to define it.  I think that everybody knows what we mean by the phrase, and I suggest that if there is to be any modification of the interpretation given to it in the Act, it should be outside this Bill.  It is a matter which affects other Bills.  I quite agree with the Deputy that what we mean by the phrase is a very important matter, and I, for one, took it that it had been legally defined already. However, if necessary, we will look it up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could there be any better place to have it defined than in a Citizenship Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so, necessarily.  It is a matter of general application.  I do not suggest that this is not altogether an appropriate occasion, <Col N="1125" /> but I do not think it is the best occasion.  Then there is the question that has been raised by Deputy Fitzgerald. I do not know what the Deputy is after.  There are two well-known principles, but there are very few countries, for example, that carry out any one of them completely and absolutely. There is a mixture of both in all countries, and we are not doing anything new or novel in this Bill.  You will find that if you study the basis of the nationality laws of other countries. You will find, for instance, that the birth of the father of a citizen is the normal basis for citizenship in any country so that the question of dual nationality is well recognised.  The thing that it is almost impossible to avoid&mdash;and it is what we are attempting in this Bill as far as possible&mdash;is not to create multiple nationality.  In certain circumstances it is almost impossible to avoid it unless you are going to exclude from your citizens a class that, according to the laws of other countries, would be regarded in those countries as their citizens.</P>
      <P>I am afraid I have not yet got at Deputy MacDermot's point.  Probably there was a difficulty about the Bill as it stood originally.  The word &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; was in the section as it stood originally, and was in contradistinction to natural born citizen. The section that we amended had reference to natural born citizens, whereas in the other section you had &ldquo;citizen,&rdquo; and &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; there referred to an Article 3 citizen.  What we have done in the new section is to broaden it so that we have both natural-born an Article 3 citizens, if I may so put it, in the one category. We have naturalised citizens in another.  If this section is passed and the Bill becomes law the position will be this: In the case of children born outside this country&mdash;I think that is the class the Deputy is interested in-if their father was himself born in this country and was a natural born citizen or an Article 3 citizen, these children will not have to register.  That is definite.  The only ones who will have to register are the children of a naturalised father.</P>

      <P>If the President will look at sub-section (1) of Section 2 he will see that natural-born citizens are what are being dealt with. The words &ldquo;natural-born&rdquo; are there used.  The word &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; without any prefix in paragraph (e) certainly includes, on the other hand, the Article 3 citizen.  Most of us are Article 3 citizens.  My point is this: that, notwithstanding the fact that I am a citizen, if I had not been born in this country and if I had become a citizen by virtue of the fact that I was domiciled here at the time of the Treaty, and if I then had a child born abroad subsequent to the Treaty but before the passing of this Act, it would, under the clause as it originally stood, have been necessary to register.  Under the clause as it now is it would not be necessary to register unless he was born subsequent to the passing of this Act. What I am wondering is why a distinction should be made between a child born between 1922 and 1930 and a child born subsequent to 1930.</P>

      <P>Let me deal with that one question of the person born outside this country.  We have an amendment here which says: &ldquo;Where a person is born outside Saorstát Eireann on or after the date of the passing of this Act.&rdquo;  May I remark in passing that outside the Saorstát is obviously not meant to include &ldquo;on a Saorstát ship,&rdquo; but it does at the moment.  It is apparently meant to be only this: not born in the Saorstát or on a Saorstát registered ship.  The phrase used is &ldquo;outside Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;  We have no definition of Saorstát ships&mdash;Saorstát ships are considered to be inside&mdash;and until that is done, born outside the Saorstát will exclude born on Saorstát ships.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take it that it is meant those who are not born either in the Saorstát or on a Saorstát ship, what will the position be after the passing of the Act?  The first point that I have an objection to is that &ldquo;such person's father is, on the day of such person's birth&rdquo; something. Why not father or mother?  If you are giving to the progeny of an Article 3 citizen a status in this country, then that should be father or mother, but I am diverted from that objection because this amendment runs on to talk not about citizens at all but about &ldquo;natural born citizens&rdquo; or &ldquo;naturalised citizens,&rdquo; so that so far from putting the Article 3 citizen and the natural born citizen in the same category we are putting natural born citizen and naturalised citizen into the same category for this purpose. That leads me back to sub-section (1) of Section 2 and to paragraphs (e) and (f) of the section.  Paragraph (e) says that &ldquo;subject to the subsequent provisions of this section, every person who was born outside Saorstát Eireann on or after the 6th day of December, 1922, and before the date of the passing of this Act and whose father was, on the date of such person's birth, a citizen of Saorstát Eireann&rdquo;&mdash;not a natural born citizen but a citizen which <Col N="1128" /> is the Article 3 person.  Again, I ask why not father or mother if we are going to keep this as relating to citizens, and citizens, so far as we have gone without a definition, are Article 3 people.  At the moment when we talk of these we have natural born citizens and naturalised citizens afterwards arising.  Is all that intended?  I think it is quite clear that we have not put the Article 3 citizen and the natural born citizen into the same category. What we have done is, we have put the natural born citizen and the naturalised citizen into the same category for a limited purpose.  What we are doing in this very wide field it is hard to see.</P>

      <P>When Deputy McGilligan is speaking I sometimes wonder whether he has read the section carefully or not, and whether he understands it.  I think that we had better deal with this, section by section.  Section 2 (1) states the classes, who, in future, shall be natural born citizens.  Then you have six paragraphs there&mdash;(a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f).  They are divided into two groups, the first of which groups refers to those born before the passing of the Act, and the second to those after the date of the passing of the Act.  Paragraph (a) says that &ldquo;every person who was born in Saorstát Eireann after the 6th December, 1922, and before the date of the passing of the Act.&rdquo;  Then you have the case of the person who was born in Saorstát Eireann on or after the passing of the Act.  That is the first category.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I may take it then that we are satisfied on this, that every person who was born in Saorstát Eireann before the passing of the Act and after the date, 6th December, <Col N="1129" /> 1922, is a natural born citizen.  We then have the next category with regard to ships, that a person who was born in a ship registered in Saorstát Eireann, if he is born before or after the passing of the Act and after the 6th December, 1922, is a natural born citizen.  That is conceded.  There is no difficulty about that.  The difficulties, it appears, arise in regard to the next set.  The next paragraph states that, &ldquo;subject to the provisions of the next section&rdquo;&mdash;these are the ones which will be read now with the amendment&mdash;&ldquo;every person who was born outside Saorstát Eireann on or after 6th December, 1922, and before the date of the passing of the Act and whose father was, on the date of such person's birth, a citizen of Saorstát Eireann&mdash; such person when certain conditions, providing certain things in regard to the father, are fulfilled, is a citizen of Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;  We then come to the class of citizens who are natural born citizens and who are born outside Ireland of a father who was a citizen. Now we have certain exceptions or provisions with regard to the application of all that, and we read the rest of this section with special reference to (e) and (f).  What we say is this: where a person is born outside Saorstát Eireann on or after the date of the passing of the Act, and such person's father is, on the date of such person's birth, a natural born citizen of Saorstát Eireann, born outside Saorstát Eireann&mdash;or a naturalised citizen of Saorstát Eireann&mdash;and such person's father is at the date of such person's birth not employed in the service of the Government, such person shall not be a natural born citizen of Saorstát Eireann unless, within one year, such birth is registered.  What is the meaning of all that&mdash;&ldquo;where such person's father is on the day of such person's birth a natural born citizen of Saorstát Eireann born outside?&rdquo; The importance there is that if the father is himself born outside, then that child's birth has to be registered.  There are certain exceptions later with which we shall deal.  But according to that section, <Col N="1130" /> and the previous one, such person would not be a natural born citizen unless his birth was registered.</P>

      <P>No, none; these are only in different categories.  I put them in these groups.  It is just a matter of being clear about the meaning of it.  I do not see any fault in the draftsmanship.  Probably if you got another draftsman he might draft it in another manner.  Our draftsman, who has a good reputation from the point of view of the drafting of Bills, decided to draft it in this particular form and it carries the ideas we have in mind.  If any Deputy shows up anything hidden away which was not our intention, we would be glad to know of it.  As it is, we do not see anything in the drafting that is contrary to our intentions.  There are three classes of natural born citizens, as I see them. We have, first of all, those who were born in the country and, secondly, those who were born outside Saorstát <Col N="1133" /> Eireann of an Irish father who was himself born in Saorstát Eireann. Such are automatically to become natural born citizens.  Then we have the third group, those who were born outside the country of a father who was not himself born in the territory, and the children of such a father have to be registered.  That is the intention in these sections and I think the sections carry out the intention.</P>

      <P>But not if they were born between 1922 and the passing of this Act.  May I take a concrete case?  Let us take the case of Senator Johnson, an Irish citizen, not born in Ireland.  If Senator Johnson had a child born abroad in 1930, clause (e) of Section 2 (1) says that that child would be a natural born citizen, subject to certain subsequent provisions of the section.  Now, in the new sub-section there are no conditions relating to the child born in that particular period.  If, however, Senator Johnson has a child born after the passage of this Act and born elsewhere than in Ireland, it has to be registered.  The position of the child born after the passing of the Act is clear, but what is the position of the child born in 1930?  Is it left in the air, with no way of getting to be regarded as a citizen, or is it a natural born citizen automatically?</P>

For a person born outside the Saorstát on or after 6th December, 1922 and before the passing of the Act.  Then you take up the amendment, and the amendment starts with: &ldquo;Where&mdash;(a) a person is born outside Saorstát Eireann on or after the date of the passing of this Act,&rdquo; and there is no reference to people born outside the Saorstát between 6th December, 1922 and the date of the passing of the Act.</P>

      <P>I do not think the gap is there; as a matter of fact, I think it is not.  We have classed as citizens those who were born in Ireland and those who were born outside <Col N="1134" /> Ireland of fathers who were citizens. These are natural-born citizens.  As regards where a person is born outside Saorstát Eireann on or after the date of the passing of the Act, this exception applies only to a certain case.  It seems to me that a person born before the passage of the Act is, under sub-section (1), a citizen.</P>

      <P>I am endeavouring to make sure that the section does what it is intended to do.  We have here certain exceptions to what is generally dealt with in sub-section (1).  We have certain restrictions and, if we do not mention the restrictions, the sub-section would go in with all its generalities. We talk of certain exceptions and one of them is set out here:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) a person is born outside Saorstát Eireann on or after the date of the passing of this Act, and</P>
      <P>(b) such person's father is, on the day of such person's birth, a natural-born citizen of Saorstát Eireann born outside Saorstát Eireann, or a naturalised citizen of Saorstát Eireann ... such person shall not be a natural-born citizen....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, that is the list of exceptions on <Col N="1135" /> the general reading of Section 1 and clearly, if we do not mention the exception it holds in all its generality.

      <P>I think there is a substantial point involved.  That is one way of amending the measure&mdash;to take out the first line of (e); but if you do take out that first line, you only make all this exceptional provision apply to people who were born outside the Saorstát after the date of the passing of the Act.  Do you want to have that applied since 6th December, 1922, because if you do, you should keep in the first line of (e) and retain the first line of (f) while making the first line of (a) in the amendment</P>
      <P>Where a person is born outside Saorstát Eireann on or after 6th December, 1922 ....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>but they are two different things.  It depends on what you want to do.  If we are going to keep this reference to the exception, which has no relation to paragraph (e), let us be uniform and push this same awkward and unnecessary phrase into (a), (b), (c) and (d). We will then give more attention to the limitation on the generality of the provisions and we will send people searching in years to come to know what it means.  We refer a person to &ldquo;subject to a certain exception, every person born outside Saorstát Eireann on or after the date of the passing of this Act, shall be a natural born citizen...&rdquo; and you send every man who comes to construe that searching through the Act to see where the exception is&mdash;and there is no exception. If amendment (2), which we are supposed to be discussing, represents the <Col N="1136" /> mind of the Government in this matter, why not end it by taking out the first line of (2) (1) (c)?</P>

However, I am not going to find any fault on that head. With regard to the question as to whether we should have nationality descending both through the father and through the mother, we decided that it was a better principle to have nationality descending through the father.  The case of Article 3 is misunderstood by a number of people.  They talk about the principle of transmission of nationality through father and mother, according to Article 3, being adopted.  There was no transmission, and there was no provision for transmission of nationality at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Domiciled&rdquo; might be a difficult word to get a full definition of, but it is a legal term, the full significance of which is known.  The meaning of it relatively is &ldquo;ordinarily resident.&rdquo;  It would satisfy me for ordinary purposes, however.  I do not propose to give a strict legal definition of it, but what we have is that &ldquo;domiciled&rdquo;, roughly interpreted as meaning &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; on a certain date, was the basis of citizenship in Article 3.  Article 3 had no reference whatever to transmission of citizenship through either parent.  It was a question of determining what body of persons who were domiciled in Saorstát Eireann on 6th December, 1922, would be regarded as citizens.  There were mainly two classes &mdash;those people either of whose parents was Irish and those who were resident for a certain period in Saorstát Eireann.  What I say is wrong is to interpret Article 3 as suggesting that there was a provision for transmission of nationality through either parent. There was not.  It was a purely local citizenship, and the complications that would arise through transmission through the second parent did not arise.</P>
      <P>We have had some of the Deputies objecting to dual nationality.  It is quite clear that you are going to have still greater confusion if you have it through the two parents.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>So that, in considering this, we definitely decided that we would adopt the principle that nationality would descend through the <Col N="1138" /> father.  In various parts of the Bill, so far as was consistent with that principle, we have accepted the principle of equality of the sexes.  We have made provision for the working out of that, and, in this connection, it has been suggested, for example, that we should adopt the principle of the new law which was passed recently in the United States, the principle of which was adopted in a number of States in South America.  As a matter of fact, from the point of view of the protection which it is desired to afford to women in the matter, our laws are very much better, and it is much easier, as the House will see when we come to it, for a woman who wants her children to become Irish nationals to have that nationality conferred on them than it is under the American Act.  In the case of America, they require that a child born of an American parent abroad should be resident for five years before reaching the age of 18 before he or she could retain the citizenship which might be regarded as being nominally conferred at birth, so that from the point of view of protection of women and of giving them rights, our Bill is, in fact, more liberal than the American Bill.  However, the point is that we have definitely here adopted the principle of descent of nationality through the father.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that the remarks of the President have now cleared up a tremendous amount of confusion which existed in my mind after reading the Second Reading debate. First of all, the President has said, in a rather handing-off way, that he had waited for amendments.  I read the President as saying, on the Second Stage:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;This is, as you will see, a very important Bill.  We are anxious to have the fullest possible discussion upon it.  In Committee we shall, of course, have an opportunity of examining it section by section and line by line.  Any proposed amendments will be examined and given the fullest possible consideration.  I do not think that this ought to be a controversial Bill.  It certainly is not conceived, and, indeed, it would be <Col N="1139" /> altogether wrong to have a Bill of this sort conceived in any narrow or Party spirit.  We expect that every Deputy in the House will take the closest interest in it, and I feel certain that, when it passes, there will be no reason for dissatisfaction, but every reason for satisfaction that the Bill has become law.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I aimed at getting a discussion, and I sat down to consider this Bill.  I read the President's remarks, and it is only now I know why I had no key to the interpretation of those remarks.  He has a different view of domicile from what anybody else has.  The President has apparently in his mind aimed at an equation between domicile and residence.  He corrected himself after he said that, and stated that one of the marks of domicile would be residence.  It is not necessary to mark it domicile at all.  The very Article which he is criticising as providing locally limited citizenship makes a distinction between domicile and residence. The peculiar thing is that when the Article was originally introduced the phrase &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; did not occur in it.  &ldquo;So domiciled&rdquo; was the phrase in it, and the whole Article was founded upon domicile.  It was then pointed out that you had &ldquo;domicile&rdquo; used in the first clause, and that was the shroud of covering upon everything.  It was explained what that was; it was this intention of returning&mdash;the animus revertendi.  It was explained that you might have people out of the country for 50 or 60 years and, of course, you could have them regarded as domiciled here.  Even the people who passed this went on to make a distinction; taking everybody, for the purpose of this Article, before they could get towards citizenship in this country, it was necessary to have that intention&mdash; the domicile mind so to speak.  There were to be other conditions.  A person had to be born in Ireland; his parents had to be born in Ireland; or in the case of a person who might not have been born in Ireland, or none of whose parents was born in Ireland, if he was seven years ordinarily resident in the <Col N="1140" /> country he was to be a citizen.  I must say that when I read the Second Reading remarks of the President I decided that the best thing to do was to come here and try to get some explanation of the phrases.  It was impossible to follow the President's remarks.  It is now possible to follow them, although it would be wrong to follow them when we get his view that residence and domicile are to be equated.  There is no such question. While discussing this matter we might as well clear up what will arise in a later section.  There is a proposal to give naturalisation to people who can claim Article 3 citizenship.  The President says that this is a locally limited citizenship.  I wonder why? Is it because of the phrase &ldquo;shall within the limits of the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State&rdquo;?  When it is determined what that is, giving that any local or narrowing interpretation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not mean the globe by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>You certainly mean extra territoriality by it.  It is anything that has to do with the peace, order and good government of the country.  That is the phrase used in the Treaty; it is the phrase used in most Constitutions, and carries laws outside the confines or boundaries of the country.  If a law is required for the peace, order and good government of the country, if it has its effect outside, then that law is not limited within the territory.  There may be international complications in getting hold of the folk one wants to get hold of in order to apply the law, but the extent of the law is not limited.  Certainly in this clause the extent of the operation of our citizenship is not limited by that law.  However, that is another matter.  This whole question of domicile was discussed in September, 1922, when the amendment was proposed to put in the words &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; instead of the words &ldquo;so domiciled.&rdquo;  The words &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; which appear in Article 3 were not in the original.  The phrase substituted was &ldquo;so domiciled.&rdquo; The Deputy then speaking <Col N="1141" /> said that he did not suppose there was any word which had given rise to more law than the word &ldquo;domicile.&rdquo;  He goes on to say &ldquo;... a man may ascertain whether or not he is deemed domiciled here or in ordinary residence here, whichever term is adopted.  I do not know if members generally realise that if you adopt &ldquo;domicile&rdquo; as your test you are adopting a test which would allow people to become Irish citizens who have not been here, not only for the last seven years, but for 40 years&mdash;people who say they have the intention of returning some day; people who have gone away with the intention of coming back to die.&rdquo; Of course, that is clearly the meaning. Nobody is going to attempt here to say what are the limits of that word &ldquo;domicile,&rdquo; but there will be nobody who has read anything about law who will say that &ldquo;domicile&rdquo; and &ldquo;residence&rdquo; are to be equated.  To equate &ldquo;residence&rdquo; and &ldquo;domicile&rdquo; is a thing that nobody would do.  During the discussion in September, 1922, Deputy G. Fitzgibbon in supporting that amendment (vol. I., cols. 663-5) went on to say that &ldquo;domicile&rdquo; is a word which has given rise to a great deal of litigation, but he also made a distinction between &ldquo;domicile&rdquo; and &ldquo;residence.&rdquo;&ldquo;Domicile&rdquo; has definitely a wider meaning than residence.  We need not waste any time arguing the point.  I am going to say that Article 3 is not locally limited, and never was. As long as there is &ldquo;domicile,&rdquo; and that phrase is the intention to return, then if even now there is found a person who from this date has been seven years resident in the country, then that person is a citizen under Article 3 of the Constitution.  I want to make that point again, because I think it is believed that it is not so, and I should like to have it looked into.  &ldquo;Domicile&rdquo; is the intention to return.  If you have a person not born in Ireland, and neither of whose parents was born in Ireland, and if you now find that that person has been seven years resident in this country, he can claim citizenship under Article 3 and will continue from time to time hereafter to be able to claim citizenship under <Col N="1142" /> Article 3, because the seven years is not defined as being the seven years prior to the date of the coming into operation of the Constitution.  The &ldquo;domicile&rdquo; is dated and limited by the date of the operation of the Constitution. Granted that, the seven years' residence can occur at any time. We have then a certain crowd of citizens defined by this domiciliary intent, and being either seven years resident or being born in Ireland, or born so that either of the parents was Irish.  The President then in relation to those people said this: it may have been too wide a phrase, but the President did say with regard to those Article 3 citizens that &ldquo;being Irish citizens their children will in the first generation be automatically citizens.&rdquo; Does the President, at any rate before we start to argue the point, agree that that is not so under the Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  The President's phrase was too wide.  I understood that the situation we intended to bring about was that the children of any of the original stock of citizens, no matter where born as far as the first generation was concerned, would be citizens of this State.  I do not care whether they were to be called natural-born or simply citizens, but they were to be citizens. Having started with a person either of whose parents was born in Ireland, we now suddenly make a jump to those people and say: &ldquo;Remember, only the father in the case of that particular group can transmit citizenship in certain circumstances.&rdquo;  I object to that.  I think we should have it with regard to that particular group that as far as the first generation is concerned they should be citizens.  There <Col N="1143" /> should be none of this marking them out and putting terms and conditions on them as to what they ought to do. The child of a mother who was a citizen under Article 3, if born abroad, cannot become a citizen of this country except by a process of nationalisation; cannot become one by a process of registration. I think that is wrong.  Let me get to the original point at which the President started, in which he said that they wanted to put natural-born and Article 3 citizens in the same category. Does he still think he has attained that?  Look at the phraseology used in paragraph (b) of amendment 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Such person's father is, on the day of such person's birth, a natural-born citizen of Saorstát Eireann born outside Saorstát Eireann, or a naturalised citizen of Saorstát Eireann, ...</P>
      <P>Then certain registration and certain status follows.  Surely that is putting a naturalised citizen and a natural-born citizen in certain circumstances in the same category?  Where is the equivalent of the natural-born citizen to the Article 3 citizen?  The natural-born citizen can transmit nationality, but the Article 3 citizen cannot in the circumstances.  All Article 3 citizens cannot transmit a particular status.  I think there is considerable confusion in this, apart from what we have before us.  The clothing of these words will be a matter, thank goodness, that will not lie with this House.  It will be for someone else.  Let us get the intention clear and, if the president seeks to put the natural-born citizen and Article 3 citizen in the same category, I should like to be told where and why he made a distinction in certain circumstances; why he has made a naturalised person almost equal to the natural-born citizen and, in certain circumstances, superior to the Article 3 citizen in some respects; and why he has made children entered on the certificate of a naturalised person better off than children under Article 3?</P>

      <P>There is a further question I should like to ask the President. Is it really the deliberate intention of the Government that the children of foreigners, who happen to be in the Free State, should be natural-born citizens of the Free State?  Supposing they were people who came over for a short holiday, and that a child happened to be born when they were here, is it really the intention that that child should be a natural born citizen of the Free State?  If so, is not that going a great deal further in the way of giving citizenship than other countries?  So far as I see the only limitation is the one in sub-section (4), and that applies to diplomatic and consular representatives. They are the only people who are deprived of the right to have their children regarded as Irish citizens automatically, if such children happen to be born in the Free State.  I suggest to the President that he should consider whether it is really desirable to make our citizenship quite as cheap as it appears to be made as the Bill stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how far I would be able to get contact at all with Deputy McGilligan.  He has stressed a good deal the difference of interpretation of what I said on the Second Reading, and on the different interpretations of &ldquo;domicile.&rdquo;  I take domicile as roughly equalling ordinary residence.  The Deputy says it is not; that it has a wider meaning.  If you want to get a particular person to say whether that person was or was not domiciled, you are not going to have an easy job to prove that that person is not so domiciled. Consequently, on this Bill lawyers can argue if they wish about what Article 3 may mean, and what is the class of citizenship.  From the reading of the last part of the Article, particularly about future citizenship, it seems to me to be clear to be of a local character, and to deal with those residents before the passage of that particular Article, because the Article seems to suggest that there was to be further legislation.  We are several <Col N="1145" /> years late in carrying out that.  The main thing, when this Bill is passed, is that there should be no doubt as to who are citizens of Saorstát Eireann and who are not.  That is the main thing to be aimed at.  Wherever there are matters to be argued they might go to the courts for determination.  Our business should be to determine and to have clearly in our minds what are the classes of persons we had deemed to be citizens, and are citizens in fact, so as to avoid those differences of opinion and of interpretation which it is obvious we are going to have, because lawyers on different sides are apparently not agreed upon certain interpretations.  What is our intention? What classes of people are going to be citizens when this Bill is passed?  We have first those under Article 3.  We are not proposing to limit that group. Then we are having as citizens those born in this country and if there are objections to them, such as those raised by Deputy MacDermot, then our answer is that we would not be unique by any means, and that it is one of the most general provisions in Nationality and Citizenship Acts.  It is one of the principles of them.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to get a word in edgeways in this valley of tears.  My objections to the amended section are that coming generations in Northern Ireland, who wish to retain Irish citizenship, will have to register in London.  The President admitted that on the Second Reading.  He stated that it would not apply to the present generation, but to subsequent generations.  I see no reason why we should not make provision to avoid that.  I see no reason why we should not make provision so that people born in Northern Ireland should not have to go through any formality in order to enjoy the privilege of citizenship of this State.  It is true that that will create dual nationality but, as it is, most of the people in Northern Ireland to-day have double citizenship.  I do not think it is in any way impertinent to the President to suggest that we should do what Great Britain so kindly does for us; that is to say, to give them honorary citizenship of our State.  The President thinks that it is an impertinence on the part of the British Government, but I do not think so.  I do not think it would be an impertinence on our part with regard to Northern Ireland.  In that connection I would remind Deputy McGilligan that there is some black magic in the Interpretation Act.  If he looks it up he will find that, just <Col N="1147" /> as Lloyd George passed an Act which made Donegal part of Southern Ireland, so in the Interpretation Act Spike Island is made part of Northern Ireland.  I think he will find that is correct if he looks up the Act.  There is no necessity to mention Northern Ireland except that the amendment should be that this section should not apply to citizens born in Northern Ireland; and so they would not have to go through the grotesque formality of going to London to get registered as Irish citizens.</P>
      <P>The President said he hoped that by the time the coming generation had grown up the Boundary would have ceased to exist.  I am afraid it is generally thought that this Government is doing everything possible to make that Boundary not only fixed but eternal, and the prospect of its being swept away by that time is nothing but &ldquo;bolony.&rdquo;  There are some questions which could be asked and some amendments that could be inserted in this section.  For instance, there is nothing to say whether under sub-section (d) a ship would include aircraft.  Perhaps when one enters into that there are some questions which I do not think the President would answer.  For instance, if we provided that an aircraft came under the definition of a ship and a child of Bulgarian parents was born in an Irish-registered aircraft flying over Czechoslovakia from Italy to Lithuania, what nationality would the child be?  I doubt if the President could produce an answer to that.</P>
      <P>My main objection, at any rate, is that we are legislating to make provision for this ridiculous proposal that Irish citizens in Northern Ireland should have to register in London, and I see no reason why we should not bring in an amendment to eliminate that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if there is any good getting into it again. As far as policy is concerned, the policy and principles behind the Bill with regard to the classes of citizens are these.  We are not definitely accepting descent through the mother.  In <Col N="1148" /> other parts of the Bill we have tried to give equality to the sexes and in fact, we are making provision to avoid statelessness and some of the evils that follow any inequality with regard to the sexes.  We could not, however, accept the principle of nationality descending through either parent, because we believe that it would lead to confusion and that in fact there is no hardship, taking the Bill as a whole, with all the sections dealing with this matter read together, imposed by the method by which we are operating the Bill.  We are not accepting it as a principle.  By the operation of the law it would give nationality where it would not be desired.  That principle then is definite.  We are standing on that as a principle, and the Bill is intended to carry out that principle.</P>
      <P>The next thing is with regard to Article 3 citizens.  They are left in the Bill with all the rights that they had.  As far as their children are concerned, and descent through the father, they are not either naturalised or natural born.  Therefore, the child of an Article 3 father is not subject to the limitations in sub-section (3).  Therefore, for example, as regards those who are in the territory of Saorstát Eireann as originally determined on the 6th December, the child of any such father is automatically a natural-born citizen. It is only when you come to what I may call the next generation that the question of registration would arise.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of domicile, possibly there is a certain amount of overlapping in certain cases, where we have deliberately provided in other sections to make it easy for people born in this country before 6th December to be deemed to be citizens. The classes then are: Article 3 citizens; the children of citizens; the children of citizen fathers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>You cannot get rid of domicile, try how you will, in relation to Irish nationality.  If you do, you are amending Article 3.  Remember the Article 3 classes are not exhausted. They are not, even from the point of view of the growth of that class, exhausted.  There may be, within Article 3, citizens this year, next year or twenty years hence unless this Bill amends it.  I want to know does this Bill amend it.  Suppose we have somebody born after the passing of the Act, and suppose that person leaves the country and gets into a condition where he would be regarded as an alien here.  He would be regarded as a citizen by another country.  Suppose that person gets a house here. <Col N="1152" /> That is the point applied by the courts as a test of his intentions to return. Under this Bill such a person can be given a certificate of naturalisation. But suppose he does not want it. Unless that person wants to remain in a sort of Stateless condition for seven years, unless he can prove domicile residence, he can leave birth out of it.  Unless this Bill cuts across his progress in some way, that person could arrogate to himself Irish citizenship. The only phrase that is used is that the word &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; includes all those who were citizens by virtue of Article 3.  It includes a person who is a citizen and that is all carried forward year by year.  The President started an enumeration of the categories of persons who might be considered eligible for the privileges of citizenship of this sort but he stopped short in the enumeration.  First of all, we must recognise that in the main this Bill is founded not on descent but on locality.  The opening article to sub-section (1) of the Bill says every person who was born in Saorstát Eireann.  The question of parentage is completely wiped out.  It might be people of two different nationalities who got married and whose child is born here.  That is entirely irrespective of what their nationality is or what their domicile is.  The whole condition and test is upon locality.  The foundation on which we start is territory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then in regard to (e) and (f) of 2 (1) we impose certain conditions.  On that point the first divagation occurs. We have always the people born here. I do not know whether as to people born outside the country we allow them to become citizens here by regulations.  But these conditions may be repudiated by a minor, when he comes of age.  A child born here while his parents are on a holiday is stamped with our nationality.  The only way in which we can get rid of that is if we discover that he has taken on another citizenship.  When we come to this, moving away from locality, the person born outside the country, we have three divisions.  One is according to the previous category <Col N="1153" /> the parent, and then there is the question of time and the birth.  If that child is born outside the country, and if the father was a citizen then that child is automatically a natural-born citizen.  If the child is born outside the country and if the mother were an Article 3 citizen, then, under no condition except by a certificate of naturalisation, can it become a citizen and it can never become a natural-born citizen.  But that child can afterwards give natural-born citizenship to his child.  That is the amazing thing about it.  The child of a mother who is an Irish citizen cannot ever become a natural-born citizen.  But when he gets a certificate of naturalisation&mdash;speaking of male&mdash;on being married and becoming a father, by simply signing a certificate containing the names of his children, these children become natural-born citizens.  That is an amazing in-and-out performance.  I wonder what is behind it.  In the third group, we have people born outside the country.  If the father is either a natural-born or a naturalised person, then those children, on being registered according to certain conditions, become natural-born citizens and have all the rights and privileges of transmission. I do not know whether that was done with intention.  There could be any number of these categories, according to the angle from which you view the position.  I think that, with regard to the original stock, where a child is born outside the country, if either parent is a citizen under Article 3, that child should automatically become a natural-born citizen.  The President begs that argument and takes me as arguing, on that small point, for citizenship following either parent.  I do not argue that.  I am arguing only in regard to the small, particular class of Article 3 citizens.  The other argument may follow later.  At the moment I am not arguing that citizenship should follow the mother as well as the father.  That is not the foundation of this Bill.  It is not based on parentage, but on the place where born.  When, however, we do make a distinction and allow a child born outside the country of a father, who is an Article 3 citizen, <Col N="1154" /> automatically to become a natural-born citizen, why should we not say that, in relation to that small class, a child born outside the country, either of whose parents is an Article 3 citizen, should be automatically a natural-born citizen?  That is not enlarging the text of the measure so as to make nationality follow either parent; it is only suggested in regard to this limited group.</P>
    <P>I object to the provision whereby a man, getting a certificate of naturalisation, by merely writing down the names of his children should have them regarded as natural-born and not as naturalised citizens.  On coming of age, they can, of course, repudiate citizenship.  Those are my two main objections.  I do not think that what we are talking about is in the measure at all but these are the foundation ideas and I object to them specifically on these two points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">

      <P>When we begin to divagate and deal with people not born in the country, we make a distinction. We say that children born outside the country of a father who is an Article 3 citizen become automatically natural-born citizens.  But when we come to the case of children born outside the country of a mother who is an Article 3 citizen, these children do not become automatically natural-born citizens and cannot become, by registration, natural-born citizens. Then, we come to the people under Article 8.  If an alien gets a certificate of naturalisation and afterwards is married and has children, by merely writing down their names these children become natural born citizens, although we prevent children born outside the country of a mother who is an Article 3 citizen from ever becoming natural-born citizens.</P>

      <P>A further case might arise&mdash;the case of an Irish girl who married a Frenchman ten years ago. A son was born in France.  He was liable to military service.  The mother <Col N="1155" /> thought it would be better for her children to escape that.  She leaves for Ireland, and on the way, a second son is born.  This child is born in England. The next time she takes greater precautions and the child is born in Ireland.  She has three sons&mdash;one born in Ireland, one born in England, and one born in France.  These three children will have different nationalities, according to the President, Deputy McGilligan and Deputy MacDermot. The son born here has citizenship according to Section 2, sub-section (1). The other two sons cannot get it under any circumstances, so that we have a case of a cosmopolitan family.</P>

      <P>I do not think so.  I do not think that that is in the Bill.  It certainly was not the intention.  We did not propose to touch the Article 3 class.  They were already there under the Constitution.  In regard to them, the only question is that raised by Deputy McGilligan regarding domicile. Personally, I should require a great deal of proof before I would be satisfied in the case of a man who had gone away and had no connection with the country.  As to domicile, I think each particular case would have to be considered on its merits.  I do not know the law on the subject sufficiently, but I think you would get different legal opinions on the point.  There has been a great deal of litigation with regard to it.  If Deputy McGilligan's view was taken, it is possible that some person outside the country would be regarded as an Article 3 person who would not occur to me as being entitled to citizenship.  That is, if the Deputy's view was taken and it was proved to the satisfaction of a court that domicile was attached to a person who was permanently resident outside.  What I am anxious to get is agreement upon principles or, if we disagree, to know exactly where we disagree, so that the relative merits of the two principles, if they are principles, may be weighed. On the first point as to women citizens under Article 3, I admit that the Deputy has made a certain case.  I shall examine its implications.  I do not want to cut across the fundamental principle upon which we had decided&mdash; that there would be transmission of nationality only through the father.  I do not want to cut across that, but I shall consider the point favourably.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1157" /> Unless it leads to difficulty I will be prepared to try and get an amendment to cover the point.  With regard to the question by registration of naturalised citizens giving their children natural-born status, I do not think I am quite prepared to go as far as the Deputy in regard to that.  The Deputy does not wish to have these entered as natural-born citizens on registration, but we have not come to the section dealing with that yet.  When we do, we can go into it more fully.  Before we pass away from this section, I would like to say that I approached this Bill in a spirit that I stated on Second Reading.  I regard the Bill as a very important one.</P>
    <P>There is great complication in nationality laws, and the nationality of a person will be determined by the laws of the country with which he is associated.  Nationality will be determined according to our citizens by Irish laws.  There are other cases that come up for consideration.  There is the case of dual nationality.  It is difficult and complicated.  Take a person born here of foreign parents.  The same thing happens in the case of American parents whose children are born abroad.  The children pose at one time as American citizens and also as citizens of the country in which they were born. There is a certain clash and there is no principle that will uniquely determine for each his nationality.  Where there is a question of military service, where two countries are claiming a youth for military service, the principle acted upon is that he should go to the country with which he is most intimately associated.  That is a commonsense principle.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to come to an understanding of the categories of people who are our citizens; and if we differ I want to know where exactly we differ, so that if we go to a vote and there is a division we would divide on the actual merits of the case.  What we say is, and what we are trying to get is, that every person born here should be a natural-born citizen; that those born outside the country of an Irish father should be citizens by right of the <Col N="1158" /> father; that if the father was born here then citizenship was automatic; that if the father himself was not born here, the children should be registered.</P>
    <P>In the case of children of the mother, there is a section of tremendous importance dealing with that matter, namely, Section 6.  At the request of either parent, children become citizens, but not natural-born.  Natural-born citizens and naturalised citizens have the same rights and privileges.  There is no distinction except the mere nominal distinction as to the manner in which their nationality came to them. But under the law, as to privileges, rights and duties, there is no difference between naturalised citizens and natural-born citizens.</P>

      <P>I do not want to have natural born citizens in an inferior position to naturalised citizens, and that is what is intended in the change here.  I was wrong in saying that we equated Article 3, in every respect, as far as the powers of transmission go.  In fact, here an Article 3 citizen is in a superior position because the limitation that applies to a father who is a natural-born citizen, and one born outside the country, as regards transmission of nationality, does not apply to an Article 3 citizen, so an Article 3 citizen is in a superior position.  These are the classes provided for here.  We have to be careful that the things we have set down here do what we want.  That is a matter of interpretation and, I think, what we have set down here does what we want, and my advisers think so too.  If it can be pointed out that the section here does not carry out that intention, I would have it very carefully examined into.  As regards the <Col N="1159" /> question of women in regard to Article 3, I will have that matter very carefully considered.</P>

      <P>I would draw the President's attention to this particular situation. Here you have Article 3 which lays down certain conditions on which citizenship is passed on from parents to children.  You are now determining that you will only allow citizenship to be passed from the father to his progeny, and it will not pass from the mother to her progeny.  That is quite understandable under the terms of this Bill.  What I do not understand is this, that unless you purport to amend the Constitution in respect of Article 3 there is a body of Irish women under Article 3 who will hand down citizenship to their offspring at the present moment.  Is not that so?</P>

      <P>I was submitting it as my contention and if my contention is true, then there will be existing a fourth class of citizen which will come down from those women and be transmitted to their offspring, deriving their nationality from women who acquired their capacity to convey that nationality under Article 3.  I think that that is worth looking into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say one word with regard to this matter.  I do not think that the Deputy is right in his interpretation of Article 3.  If he would keep in mind some of the broad principles governing what constitutes nationality, I think it might be helpful.  In most countries, the broad principles laid down are, birth, descent, or what Deputy McGilligan describes as locality.  In other words, some nations lay down, as the broad basis upon which nationality is to be acquired, birth in the country. That is what obtains under the British law, for instance, and under the American law.  In Continental countries they give more place to the acquisition of nationality by descent.  I do not think that Article 3 is helpful in this connection at all.  If one considers the circumstances under which that Article was drafted, one can quite see why neither of those two questions follows from it.  It must be remembered that at that time you had a new State beginning and you had to define, for the purposes of the State, who were its citizens.  You took a body of people domiciled here at the time, and the draftsmen made those people the nucleus of the new State. That is why domicile was made the test at the time.  We are departing from that now and adopting a new <Col N="1161" /> method, for the reason that the original method was, necessarily, artificial and produced certain anomalies, as has been pointed out.</P>
      <P>We are starting with a new definition. The new definition is birth, or the place of birth or descent.  You will see, if you look at the first part of Article 3, that it embraces, first of all, every person, without distinction of sex, domiciled in the area of the jurisdiction&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must have looked up the definition of &ldquo;domicile,&rdquo; and I am sure he understands it.  I do not pretend to say what its definition is in reference to this Bill.  The question of domicile finds no place in this Bill.  The broad test of citizenship in this Bill is founded on birth, and is to be found in Section 2 of this Bill, and has no relation to domicile at all.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say is that my interpretation&mdash;and I think it is the general interpretation that has been connected with Article 3 since the date of the passing of the Constitution &mdash;is that Article 3 relates to the date on which it was passed.  The Article says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every person, without distinction of sex, domiciled in the area of the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) at the time of the coming into operation of this Constitution who was born in Ireland .....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>and then it goes on to add a further test, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... or either of whose parents was born in Ireland or who has been ordinarily resident in the area of the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State for not less than seven years.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that it is quite wrong to endeavour to argue from that that there <Col N="1162" /> is a principle underlying that argument that is being departed from here with regard to transmission.  I submit that it is an additional test.  Then the Article goes on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... provided that any such person being a citizen of another State may elect not to accept the citizenship hereby conferred; and the conditions governing the future acquisition and termination of citizenship in the Irish Free State shall be determined by law.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Originally, therefore, the principle involved was that of ordinary residence, and those were the necessarily artificial tests set up to deal with an entirely unusual situation on the basis of which citizenship was to be conferred at the coming into operation of the new State. In order to show that that was what was in the minds of the draftsmen in drawing up that section, I draw the Deputy's particular attention to the concluding words, which I have already quoted, and which were as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... and the conditions governing the future acquisition and termination of citizenship in the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) shall be determined by law.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And this is a law for the future acquisition of citizenship from the passing of that Act.  I think it is quite clear. That period was the start of it, and all citizens who answered to the test then imposed were to be included as citizens.  As from that date, however, it was necessary to introduce a nationality law.  That is being introduced now; particularly in view of certain things that existed on account of the gap that existed between that period and the present time, and also in view of the usual practice of the English common law of nationality as it is phrased in the King's Dominions. Then, the statute law has come in and extended that in some respects in bringing in nationality by descent. Similarly, you have here the underlying principle of nationality by birth, without regard to whether the parents were aliens or not.  Then you have these other added and restricting conditions as regards nationality by descent.  As <Col N="1163" /> the President has already dealt with all that matter, I do not think I need say any more.</P>

      <P>We agree that you cannot restrict domicile to residence, and it is notorious that on the day on which we first discussed this argument, two lawyers in the House&mdash;one of whom has since become a judge&mdash;discussed this matter and discussed it by positing that domicile was completely distinct from residence.  That being so, let me say, with regard to Article 3, that you have an argument on both sides, and, undoubtedly, the lay mind generally has taken Article 3 to be restricted to the moment of the passing of the Constitution and to take it as if the phrase, &ldquo;at the time of the coming into operation of this Constitution&rdquo;, governed not merely domicile but also residence.  I only say that the phrase is not there in relation to residence. The only time limitation is, as far as Article 3 is concerned, the question of domicile, and that is intentional. That is the <i>animus revertendi.</i> Let us assume that domicile is agreed upon and that no court could deny it.  Then you go on and it appears that any person who wants to claim citizenship at a particular time, and who can prove that he was born of an Article 3 mother, is a citizen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me turn to the argument against that construction.  It is not a natural construction.  The argument against that construction is the phrase that the Attorney-General has referred to: that we go on to talk about future acquisition and termination.  Supposing that the minds of the framers of the Constitution had been clear, that they wanted to give citizenship <Col N="1165" /> not merely to the classes found in certain conditions in the Free State at the time of the passing of the Constitution, but wanted to give it only in the continuing way that I have spoken of, they would still have to put in the phrase about future acquisition with regard, say, to aliens.  I think that is agreed, so that the phrase is not completely without force on the interpretation that I am suggesting, and I suggest that interpretation is there. That is why I had to ask at the beginning whether this Bill in any way repealed, amended or cut in on Article 3.  If it does not, some people had better begin to think about what Article 3 is, and whether they want to continue it in a doubtful way.  If they want to amend it, then to proceed to amend it by taking out a phrase that has no effect at all would certainly not be by way of limitation.  If it is thought that we should make it clear that it was related to a particular moment of time and has no effect beyond that, then it may have to be amended, retrospectively, deeming it always to have been that way.  But that does not occur in the Bill.  I suggest that it should not be tossed aside as a matter of mere wordy argument because, as Deputy Dillon has suggested, there is an interpretation of Article 3 despite all the force that has been laid on the phrase at the end about future acquisition of citizenship. There is an argument which might prevail and which might give, despite this Bill, citizenship to the child of an Article 3 mother, even although that child was born outside Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    <P>I understand that we are not allowing for that in this Bill and the President is disposed to prevent such acquisition of citizenship.  But it may be in Article 3, and I am simply putting it that it can be argued that it is.  Undoubtedly, there are grounds upon which it can be argued.  I have sometimes heard a judge, when asked to put a construction on this&mdash;to read this as if there was in the Article &ldquo;ordinarily resident in the area of the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State for <Col N="1166" /> not less than seven years&rdquo; at the time of the coming into operation of it&mdash;say &ldquo;that phrase is not there and I will not put it in for you.&rdquo;  It is possible that that Article has a continuing force and effect and that it will rule citizenship hereafter.  There may be a contrariety as between it and what we are now proposing.</P>
    <P>The President said that citizenship is a matter that ought to be defined accurately.  That is a vain hope.  When the President put it that way I think he ought to withdraw the measure until we know who are our citizens and who are not.  I do not think that we will ever know that until individual cases, as they arise, have been determined. We can lay down tests, but I do not think there is any necessity why we should bark up anyone else's tree or why they should bark up ours.  There is no reason why we should grab across the ocean at certain people in America under Article 3, if still continued in force, simply because we say that we consider that under a certain circumstance they are our citizens.  There is no reason why we should fall out with the people and Government of America or any other country because they also claim these people to be their citizens. There is no reason why we should make that claim entirely disregarding what other people say.  As a practical matter, do we want certain people of ours, if a test of nationality is applied in another country, to give up certain preferences or certain work which they have got because we consider it a degradation of our national status here, or because we consider that they are being saddled with something that we do not want them to have?  It would be a more dignified way to say that we mean this Bill to meet certain objections raised on the other side.</P>
    <P>On the details of this amendment I would like to make one or two concrete suggestions.  First of all, on Amendment No. 2 we have only discussed paragraphs (a) and (b).  I would ask the President to look at paragraph (d).  This is a very small matter that could be easily rectified. This paragraph provides:</P>
    <P>Where such person shall not be a <Col N="1167" /> natural-born citizen of Saorstát Eireann unless within one year or, where the Minister because of special circumstances so permits, within two years after the day of such person's birth the fact of such person's birth is registered&mdash;</P>
    <P>(d)  if such person is born in a country in which there is, on the day of his birth, a Saorstát Eireann legation or consulate, in the foreign births entry book kept at such legation or consulate or in the foreign births register.</P>
    <P>Supposing that there is a legation or consulate there on the day of his birth and it is withdrawn inside the yearly period, where is he to register?  The test is, if there is a consulate or legation in existence on the date of his birth, he is then given a year in which to register, but he has only one place in which to register.  There is no alternative.  But supposing that the legation or consulate is there at the time of his birth and then disappears, where is he to register?  Clearly, there must be some provision made to meet that.  It is only a minor matter, but I think it should be attended to.</P>
    <P>I suggest that if this matter of ships is to be determined probably the best thing would be to define in a definition section that a particular ship registered in Saorstát Eireann was, for the purpose of determining the place of birth, to be deemed to be Saorstát Eireann. Then Saorstát Eireann will afterwards, by whatever it is deemed to be, define the definition that will have to be given to that term.  I suggest, further, that unless there is some reason for it paragraphs (a) and (b) of Section 1, sub-section (2) ought to be collapsed into one.  Paragraphs (c) and (d), if my suggestion about definitions is adopted, will disappear.  There does not seem to be any reason why a distinction should be made between birth &ldquo;on or after the 6th day of December, 1922,&rdquo; and between &ldquo;on or after the date of the passing of this Act.&rdquo;  I think that paragraphs (a) and (b) might be collapsed into one special clause.</P>

      <P>Because it is a matter of surplus age to have them as they are if there is no real reason for it.  The courts hereafter may say that this was not put in for nothing, and may go around searching to get a reason for it.  Surely it is not a mere matter of convenience.  If there is no reason for it and if simply saying &ldquo;born after the 6th day of December, 1922,&rdquo; fills the bill for all practical purposes, why not leave it that way? Similarly, with regard to (c) and (d) I want to suggest another amendment.  I think the President has agreed that the first line in (e) 2 (1) should go out. At least that is to be considered, the evidence tending rather at the moment towards the desirability of removing that line as it means nothing.  I want to suggest also that the first line in (f) should go out.  We say: &ldquo;Subject to the subsequent provisions of this section.&rdquo;  That is what I called before a signpost to an exception and, as a signpost to an exception in the Bill, is logical on this very matter we are dealing with in (f).  Paragraph (f) deals with the person who is born outside and whose father was, on the day of such person's birth, a citizen of Saorstát Eireann, but there is no provision dealing with that case.  When you come to subsequent provisions, they deal only with the natural-born or a naturalised father.</P>

      <P>If you take &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; as inclusive of all classes&mdash;that is under Article 3 and so on&mdash;we will take the other as an exception in the case of a naturalised and natural-born father. Would there then not be a reason for the paragraph?  If the word &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; in (f) does not mean an Article 3 citizen, he is a natural-born or a naturalised citizen.  Then are there not exceptions?  You are giving a special privilege, so to speak.  You are not asking an Article 3 citizen to be subject to the conditions we had in sub-section (2) in regard to natural-born <Col N="1169" /> and naturalised citizens.  Is the paragraph not required when you are dealing with it in that form?</P>

      <P>At any rate, I am suggesting that since the line is going in (e) it should go out in (f), and that any exceptions that may be made should refer only to those natural-born citizens and naturalised citizens.  Again, Saorstát Eireann has been defined in the Interpretation Act.  This definition with regard to ordinary laws, fits because there is no doubt about the content of the definition.  It is the area for the time being within the jurisdiction of the Parliament and Government of Saorstát Eireann.  That still rules most of the laws that are passed, but this is a special and peculiar law.  It is a law in which the definition of &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; is the groundwork and the basis of the whole thing.  I suggest to the President that, first of all, there will have to be a determination as to whether that definition in the Interpretation Act does meet the situation.  If it is thought that it does, there will be <Col N="1170" /> no need for an amendment, but supposing it is agreed that that phrase in the restrictive Preamble does not meet the circumstances under this Bill, why not amend the definition of Saorstát Eireann under this Bill for the purposes of nationality and citizenship because if you go back to the Interpretation Act you may have to give this Bill a retrospective interpretation.</P>

We add the peculiar phrase at the end of the paragraph &ldquo;and in any case possesses the nationality of the country for which such mission was accredited.&rdquo;  Supposing there was a woman born here under conditions, which under the laws of her country, would mean that she had no nationality&mdash;she would be Stateless&mdash;does it mean that we give her Irish nationality?  In other words, why put in that additional qualification, because it is an additional qualification to everything that precedes it?  Why should we want, in other words, to take and stamp as Irish citizens people who might be born under circumstances here&mdash;that is to say the children of foreign representatives; it would be a very exceptional case&mdash;who would not have the nationality of their fathers?

      <P>There are two cases. I can see a case arising, for some reason or another, because of the laws of a foreign country.  Let us say a foreign representative here has married a person not of his own country.  Then, according to the foreign nationality laws of these countries, a person born here might not be a national of either of those two countries.  Supposing you had a Persian Envoy here and there was a typist in his office or somebody who was not of sufficient status to get diplomatic immunities.  Suppose that person was a woman and that person was married to a German and the child of that marriage, born here, under the German law became a German.  Then we make that person an Irish citizen because they have not the nationality of the country by which the man is accredited and I do not think we ever meant that.</P>

I can envisage circumstances in which a person who wants to become a citizen here, but has become a citizen elsewhere, will find it difficult to divest himself of the citizenship of another country, and there are cases in which he will not be able to do it for years. What is to happen to that person who decides to retain citizenship here and takes the preliminary steps to divest himself of the other citizenship?

      <P>It is clear that the intention here was that the obligation of registration was imposed so as to bring up some positive act to show there was a desire&mdash;and this is an act on the part of the child himself when he attains the majority&mdash;to be an Irish citizen.  If the father was not born here, and if the child was not born here the relationship in connection with this country might be rather remote, or is remote, and, consequently, it is desirable that there should be some positive act.  Number one is the positive act that is required as a declaration of retention of citizenship.  The other is that nobody should seek to acquire citizenship by a positive act when he or she was, in fact, a citizen of another country.  You have the operation of laws relating to dual citizenship.  If a person wants our nationality, desires it, the positive act indicating that desire ought to be accompanied by the relinquishing of the citizenship of another country.  It is a positive act, and I do not think, whilst you cannot help the automatic operation of laws in connection with dual citizenship, we ought to make it easy for people.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The wife and children of a citizen of Saorstát Eireann shall be citizens of Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rule at present in force here, that a wife takes the nationality or citizenship of her husband, simplifies all matters of nationality and prevents the introduction of barriers between the husband and wife.  In the case of marriages, where one of the persons is not a Saorstát citizen, the Bill, as it <Col N="1177" /> stands, will give the Minister, at his own discretion, power to separate husbands and wives at any time.  If a Saorstát citizen marries an alien wife, she would have to get the permission of the Minister to come into the country and obtain a certificate of naturalisation which could be revoked at any time at the Minister's absolute discretion.  This is an intolerable situation and should not be allowed to exist even under the excuse that such power would never be used by the Minister.  A wife should reside with her husband, and the Bill should not place obstacles in the way of a wife residing with her husband.  To introduce sex equality in this matter can only cause confusion between the nationalities of husband and wife, and their children, which is undesirable and quite unnecessary if this amendment is accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment.  It cuts across the general principles of the Bill.  The principle in the Bill here is that marriage of itself should not affect nationality.  There are hardships of a variety of kinds which follow from any such law as that which would be our law here if this amendment was accepted.  We make it easy for a husband or wife to acquire a common nationality.  If a foreign woman comes here and marries an Irishman, the Minister will naturally impose no obstacles that should not be imposed in the way of such marriage, but there are instances in which marriage like that is resorted to for special purposes, and I think it ought to be retained as a power of the State or the Executive to prevent that.  The conditions under which a woman coming in can acquire Irish nationality are set out in later sections, and I think that, when we come to them, we will find that they are not by any means onerous, and that it is very easy, by a positive act on the part of the person coming in, to acquire the nationality of the other spouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the same way, if an Irishwoman goes abroad and marries a foreigner, she will be deemed to have lost her nationality unless within a certain period she takes a positive act for the <Col N="1178" /> retention of her Irish nationality.  We are dealing with that in a later amendment. If an Irishwoman is abroad and if she becomes a widow, there are provisions by which she could resume her nationality on returning here and by a declaration, if she does not return, she will be Irish.  We have provided also that Statelessness which is one of the evils at the basis of the calling of the Hague Conference, will be avoided. The principle in the amendment is different from the principle we are adopting here and we are adopting this principle deliberately, believing that, on the whole, it is fairer to women. The only ground on which there could be objection taken to our principle is on the supposition that the Minister was going wilfully to do something which I do not think there would be any reason for doing.  He has certain powers to prevent, for instance, an immoral person coming in here and using marriage as a reason to reside here or something of that sort.  I do not think there is anything in the principle to which objection can be taken, except on the assumption that the Minister would act in a way in which there would, I think, be no inducement for him to act.  If the Deputy would suggest what motive a Minister could have in doing any of the things he has suggested might be done, I would certainly think the matter should be examined very carefully, but I have asked myself the question and can see no motive that there could be.  I think then I will have to refuse the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not touch that point.  On Deputy Good's amendment, surely, it deserves more consideration than has been given to it in the discussion so far.  Deputy Good wants to get back to what used to be the position generally in the world, whether it was so here or not, that matter depending on whether we carried over by Article 3 of the Constitution certain British Acts.  Certainly up to the outbreak of the war the guiding principle was that marriage did make a change, and that the wife took on the nationality of her husband.  Their citizenship status was determined by birth, and the whole thing was ruled by the nationality of the father.  Deputy Good asks whether there has been any difficulty about this matter.  There has been considerable difficulty lasting over about eight or nine years.  Not this exact phrase, but what is at the bottom of it was the question that was discussed at at least two, if not three, Imperial Conferences.  It was discussed at a special conference called at the Hague and was discussed twice, I think, at the League of Nations.  The point which the President might have informed us on was how many of the countries which previously had this view of the wife taking the nationality of the husband have decided to go back on that.  All of the conferences I have spoken of broke up in confusion on the main point.  They all agree that there were certain conditions in which either double nationality ensued, or Statelessness ensued.  There was agreement that those particular circumstances should be met; that one should obviate a Stateless period, and that equally one should obviate a period during which there was double nationality. There are some important countries which have accepted the view that marriage should not make any change. With us, of course, that matter is not of so much substance, because it should be remembered that in the future we are not dependent upon the nationality of the parents.  In the main we are dependent upon the place of birth. Whether both the parents are Irish, or one of them is Irish and the other not Irish, or both are aliens, does not <Col N="1181" /> matter.  The place of birth is the foundation upon which we rest our citizenship for the future.  &ldquo;Born in the Irish Free State&rdquo; is the ruling phrase.  We bring in the father, strangely enough, in Section 2, when we get to a person born outside the Free State, but we are certainly in another clause definitely turning our backs on the old view that was held throughout the world&mdash;that it was a desirable thing in any event that the husband, the wife and the family should all bear the same nationality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are going away from that.  We may not be breaking it up through the question on the matter of blood.  The question of the place of birth is going to come in at every point in this. Certainly, as far as a phrase can do it, we are saying that marriage shall make no change.  I had many examples brought before me of the confusion and even the hardship caused in time of war by the adoption of the principle that the husband and wife should be of the same nationality.  In fact, this question became a live one as a result of various things which happened during the war.  We had various people who had been married to Germans or Austrians.  Then the family was broken up because either the wife who had previously been an Austrian or a German, or the husband who had previously been an Austrian or a German, was taken away and landed in a detention camp of some sort, while the other partner to the marriage was left alone.  Even when those matters were put up as points of hardship the discussion did not go very far before it was realised that no matter what point of view you took on the case of a German marrying an Englishwoman, whether, in fact, they became Germans and lived in England, or whether they became English and remained in England, once we came to a person who was, in fact, an alien, he was going to be put in a concentration camp no matter what he called himself. The question of hardship always was there.  An equal number of cases of hardship will arise where you make marriage have no effect upon the <Col N="1182" /> question of nationality as where you made it, in the eyes of the law, have an effect by making a change.  For ordinary purposes, leaving those war circumstances out&mdash;and what did happen in the time of war is going to happen no matter what you call the family&mdash;I do still think there is a good deal to be said for the principle that the husband, wife and children should all have the same nationality, and that a great deal should be done to achieve that situation.  I would even go so far as, if necessary, to allow the wife's nationality to rule.  Make the husband change and take whatever is his wife's nationality.  I do not think men are so concerned about, so to speak, the dignity of sex rights in this matter as women are.  If it pleases those people who are concerned about this, and who are still sticking to the principle that the husband, wife and family should be of the same nationality, in any particular case where the woman on her marriage raises the point let it be decided in the event of disagreement that the husband will be deemed to be of the nationality of his wife.</P>
    <P>It is a radical change, possibly more than talked of here.  It is not going to happen in many cases, but by doing that you will preserve for ordinary purposes, in times of war and at other times, a sort of unity of the family in relation to citizenship and nationality. This is one point on which I thought the President would have decided to have let this Bill lie over for very much better consideration.  It is a rather audacious thing that we should be asked to change the old concept with regard to husband and wife from the angle of nationality when it is known that for about eight years this matter has been very seriously agitated, that as far as the Commonwealth of Nations is concerned, it was discussed twice and hinted at even on earlier occasions; that a special Conference to deal with nothing but primarily the nationality of married women was called at the Hague and that it broke up in confusion and issued a very long report and a very short report on the matters in which they were in agreement. Eventually, the women's organisations that were keen on this matter <Col N="1183" /> got it referred to the League of Nations.  Governments were asked for their observations on the matter, and it was discussed in the Assembly of the League in 1932.  Some 18 or 20 countries responded to the invitation with observations, and some others put in observations afterwards.  It was possibly the thing most lengthily debated at the first meeting of the League on that occasion, and although there was definite acceptance on the part of certain countries, others were vehemently opposed.  I doubt if any of those that declared their point of view on that occasion have since been converted.  It is worthy of observation in this House that quite a number of countries disagreed with the proposals on the ground that their Church had definitely recommended&mdash;I can go further and say authorised&mdash;them to vote against it, and demanded that they should vote against it.  I would have thought, as this is not a matter anyone can get very excited about, and seeing that it is a very radical change, the President would have thought fit to direct Deputies' attention to the fact that there was a fair amount of reading to be done, and that the reports would have been specially segregated and put apart in the Library for Deputies to see.  They could gauge only from that, that there was a very definite worldwide agitation and very definite divided opinion on the whole matter.  He might have seen that there were other possibilities, even if this was regarded as a serious matter; other ways than the phrase used in Section 13, that marriage shall have no effect upon citizenship.</P>
    <P>There is a very definite point in Deputy Good's amendment, one that I think should be debated at considerable length, that arguments for it, as seen by women's organisations, should be detailed at length.  We might have the observations of one or two great countries which cannot be regarded as illiberal in their legislation regarding women, and the arguments of these countries against, with a view to enlightening Deputies before they, in a rather soporific mood, pass what is going to effect a considerable change.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1184" /> There is not so much of importance here, but we get &ldquo;place of birth&rdquo; right through the Bill.  It will have effect otherwise by way of incidents, and, in the state of the nationality laws of the world, and of countries as a whole, we are really going to cause more confusion with Article 13, so far as it is going to have any effect.  On the other hand, it can be said that the tendency is towards adopting Article 13.  A number of countries are moving slowly towards it, but some are not going to adopt it in entirety.  To wipe out anomalies there is a good deal in Deputy Good's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexHaslett" hpid="Mr. Haslett Mr. Haslett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the President to examine the question further. I disagree with Deputy McGilligan on one point, that hardship would be caused only in a few cases.  Up to the present it only applies to people of other nationalities who come in, Germans and Persians, but, if we take what the President said a few moments ago, about his definition of Section 2 (3), that he would consider Great Britain a foreign country, I do not at all subscribe to his definition.  Supposing we take that definition for a moment there will be considerable hardships.  It will be more apparent, I suppose, to one who like myself comes from a border county.  If the President is right in his contention Northern Ireland will be a foreign country.  One can then visualise quite a number of things occurring.  I think that is a poor status to take up in this House, seeing that many Saorstát citizens are at present living in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland.  It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that they may wish to come home and settle in the Saorstát, and if the women were not Saorstát citizens what would happen? In the light of that position I should like the President to consider Deputy Good's amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>No hardship has been pointed out as a result of the principle we are adopting in this Bill.  As to a woman coming into the country, I think we are not asking any residence qualification if she is married to an Irish citizen.  In the case of a man we have <Col N="1185" /> the two years' qualification, in order that he may become an Irish citizen. We are only asking the positive act. We are not by arbitrary law compelling a person to surrender nationality; we are making it easy to acquire ours. There is no difficulty about it. We are not standing in the way of the unity of the family.  We are making it easy to have the unity of the family preserved.  We are meeting a view about which there has been considerable agitation, on the ground of the hardships imposed on women by the operation of the contrary principle. There has been considerable agitation about that, and it has become recognised. Deputy McGilligan spoke about a Convention breaking up in confusion. It did nothing of the sort.  If he means that they did not get a large number of States to agree with the Convention&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is not right to say that it broke up in confusion.  What happened was that agreement was not reached among a large number of States.  There was no means of compelling agreement.  If the Deputy means that we are not to adopt that principle, that States have not accepted it, he has not got more acceptance of one principle than the other.  The fact of the matter is that we are proposing to adopt one which we believe will lead to the avoidance of certain hardships, and that does not do anything positive to prevent the unity of a family as regards nationality. It is easy for the wife, as I say, coming in here, to secure Irish nationality immediately.  The husband, if he is a <Col N="1186" /> foreigner coming in here, can secure Irish nationality within a period of two years.</P>

      <P>In either case the difficulty arises.  Take Section 15, where the marriage has taken place before the passing of the Act.  The woman is called upon to make her application within 12 months after the passing of the Act.  As a matter of fact, the situation may not arise for several years after the passing of the Act, even though the marriage had taken place some time ago, so that the 12 months' provision will be no use to her.  I am only suggesting that the elimination of the time limit in these two sections might be advisable&mdash;that that would make it a great deal easier.</P>

I am sympathetic to the general principle that the Government have adopted and I, personally, think that the wife ought to be at liberty to maintain her original <Col N="1188" /> nationality if she wishes to do so.  On the other hand, I do not see why she should be called upon to decide quickly and make up her mind once and for all whether to accept her husband's nationality.

I have here a paper which gives some of the answers that were returned to Geneva when the small points upon which The Hague Conference, the relatively minor points, described as the absurdly minor points in the case of the women's organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I said at the beginning that there was agreement upon double nationality and Statelessness. In the eyes of the women's organisations, some of them regarded it as a hindrance to have an agreement on that, because they thought many Governments would go away congratulating themselves that they had done a great day's work for the women, whereas they felt they did nothing. Their idea was that it would be far better to have had complete disagreement than agreement on these relatively minor points.  The Hague Conference did agree on certain relatively minor points, but they were in utter confusion on the main matter&mdash;the matter mainly pressed by the women and which the women were really interested in, and that was that marriage should effect no change.  At any rate, what had been agreed upon at The Hague was finally sent around to the Governments of the world so far as they were associated with the League of Nations and these Governments were asked to reply as to whether they thought there ought to <Col N="1189" /> be any advance upon this.  They were asked would they agree to this and would they go so far as to agree that marriage should have no effect upon nationality.</P>
      <P>South Africa, in fact, said they were against any further advance.  Germany said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the traditional idea of the civil unity of the family derived from the nature of the marriage union and the unity of the family and also founded on religious principles, is still irreconcilably opposed to the idea of self-determination for women based on the principles of individualism.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Having said that, they also said they would be prepared to engage in a study.  The President knows enough of the language of Geneva to know that that means you want to postpone it for ten years.  Australia said they were agreeable to accept the principle that woman on marriage shall not lose her nationality provided the rest of the Dominions agree; in principle, they accepted it.</P>
      <P>The Belgians said they would be prepared to adopt a provision under which women might at the time of marriage opt for one nationality or the other. That is not what I would call a halfway house, but almost going the whole way with the women's organisations, but avoiding certain difficulties that might arise.</P>
      <P>If you lay down that marriage will not affect any change, you can easily make that have the full effect that the women's organisations wanted and yet allow a woman to take the nationality of her husband immediately upon marriage without any other thing binding, if she so desired; in other words, unless she declared against, she would have her husband's nationality. The Belgians, I think, went on to say that they would be prepared to have some study on it, but they were even weaker in their enthusiasm than the Germans.  Brazil said that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;A Brazilian woman who marries a foreigner does not lose her nationality.  On the contrary, her marriage facilitates the voluntary acquisition of Brazilian nationality by <Col N="1190" /> her husband, if the latter resides in Brazil and possesses immovable property there.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think the Swedes are very much the same.  The State of Columbia was in favour of the proposal.  Egypt was definitely and dead against it.  The United States of America, the law of which was, I think, the one upon which the women's organisation mainly founded, replied in this way:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The discussion concerning the nationality of married women, which was held at The Hague Conference and the subsequent development show that this subject was highly controversial.  Which fact is also shown by the statement of the Women's Consultative Committee on Nationality.  While it appears that a number of States have in recent years adopted statutes in which the nationality of married women is wholly or largely independent of that of their husbands, it remains true that the majority of States still have laws in which the nationality of married women is wholly or largely dependent upon that of their husbands.  Moreover, no solution generally acceptable has yet been reached with regard to the problem of the acquisition of citizenship <i>jure sanguinis</i> in cases of children born to parents having different nationalities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That indicated another point of objection, but the English reply was that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Articles 8 to 11 of The Hague Convention appear to represent the greatest measure of agreement that is likely to be reached for the present in regard to the nationality of married women, and constitute an advance on the present situation. Whether his Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom will be able to go further in the direction of giving effect to the principle of equality between men and women must depend upon the extent to which that principle received the support of the Governments of other countries and especially those of the other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1191" /> They said we are not in favour of it at the moment, but we will look into it if there is a disposition on the part of other countries to reopen the matter.</P>
    <P>Hungary was definitely against it and that objection was founded upon what were called Catholic principles.</P>
    <P>Japan said that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Since the principle of the equality of men and women as regards nationality is contrary to that family unit which forms the basis of the Japanese social system and since it creates many difficulties, the Japanese Government regrets that it cannot support the adoption of this principle.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Norway has a peculiar reply, because it said that they thought that The Hague Conference report was as far as they could go and they apologised for not having been able even to sign that, but they said they would be able to give sympathetic consideration to any proposal which may be submitted at the next assembly of the League.  The Netherlands said that it</P>
    <P>&ldquo;desires to maintain the principle which is the basis of the existing Netherlands law&mdash;namely, the unity of nationality in marriage&mdash;a principle under which the status of the husband governs that of the wife.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Hague Conference, representing as it did the greatest measure of agreement, could not agree with the principle of absolute equality of men and women.</P>
    <P>Sweden have a peculiar law apparently and they are prepared to go to the point that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the woman would not acquire the status of Swedish nationality by marriage with a Swede unless she is domiciled in Sweden at the moment of marriage or establishes her domicile there during the marriage.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These were the prevailing observations, and the majority of them were against, because of what they thought was the family unit.  There is a case against that and the case which they stated here might get approval.  But the case has not been stated, it is simply a case of having a Bill brought <Col N="1192" /> in and we are asked to pass that without any comment.</P>

The way I look at the matter is this: there is no reason at all why we should have a law automatically operating in the way suggested.  We are not by law affecting in any way the unity of the family because in the case of an Irish national marrying a person from outside, we make it easy for the second party to become an Irish citizen and in that way to preserve the unity of the family.  In the case of a person going outside, we declare that the Irish woman going abroad will lose her nationality if she marries a foreign husband unless she takes a positive step to indicate that she wants to retain her nationality.  For that reason it is beside the question to raise the point as to the unity of the family.  In this Bill we are trying to deal with what, by the automatic operation of the law, has been known to create a hardship.  There is no hardship created under our Bill.  There is a demand which has been supported by a large section of Catholic opinion, as well as by opinion of another sort, in favour of giving relief&mdash;not imposing those hardships upon women which fall from the automatic operation of the law.  The only reason why a long explanation would be necessary here is because the principle which the larger number of States adopt is not being adopted by us.  We could not get agreement on this matter here amongst ourselves.  In this case where different conditions, traditions and opinions are operating we want to get the consent of other nations.  The nationality of the individual will be determined by our laws here, as we claim them to be citizens.  Consequently, it is not necessary at all to go any further than simply to state that nobody has shown that the operation of the law, as we propose it, would impose any hardship beyond that which from time to time may arise because of the husband and wife being of different nationalities.</P>

      <P>Yes, and if a war broke out she would still be seized and put into a concentration camp.  In the hectic circumstances of a war breaking out, what is the position of aliens married to citizens in your country? Let me point again to this supreme illogicality.  An Irishwoman marries some foreigner.  He is resident here. She does not become an alien.  She does not take on his nationality.  She preserves her Irish citizenship.  She goes abroad with her husband and a child is born to them.  That child can never become a citizen except by naturalisation.  I am now talking of the child and not of the mother.  We are making a difference between the father and the mother.  When it comes to the question of being born outside this country we say: &ldquo;If your father was a citizen, you are automatically a citizen provided you comply with this formality about registration.  If your mother was a citizen there is a different set of circumstances.&rdquo;  It is illogical if you are in favour of what the women's organisations want. What argument have we been given that will appeal to anybody's reason to make them vote for Section 13, which has been put up as a proposal by the Government?  When I spoke about the women's organisations wanting something, <Col N="1194" /> the President said: &ldquo;We will not give them everything.&rdquo;</P>

I am sure that that is not intended.  Again, with regard to the people referred to in sub-section 4 of Section 4, surely these are Article 3 citizens.  Article 3 covers a person born in Ireland before the 6th December, 1922.  On that date, the Irish Free State and Ireland were the same area.  Up to some time after 6th December, 1922, Ireland and the Irish Free State continued to be the same area.  Would not a person born in Ireland before the 6th December, 1922, fit in immediately under Article 3, the question of domicile being outstanding?</P>

      <P>I said &ldquo;that being outstanding.&rdquo;  Immediately, you come to the point as to the likelihood of a person born in Ireland prior to 6th December, 1922, being deemed to be domiciled in this country.  <i>Prima facie</i>, the case is there almost at once &mdash;birth in the country.  There is a tendency, I think, in the courts to presume that a person will fly back to his native country.  That presumption holds until it is dislodged.  Birth in the country before 6th December, 1922, raises a presumption with regard to this mental condition on which domicile is based and, if it does draw down the question of domicile, then there has been birth in the country and Article 3 immediately comes into operation.  If there is going to be discrimination, would it not be better to have some phrase brought in which will specially distinguish these people from Article 3 citizens and say that where a person is not domiciled and had been born here prior to that date, application can be made for facilities.  Why have that overlapping which may, by reaction, cast doubts on Article 3?</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan has pointed out that the class of persons who were domiciled here at the time of the Treaty is much larger than the Attorney-General or the President seems to have supposed because everybody starts with a domicile of origin which he retains until it can be shown that he has acquired a domicile of choice.  That is not so easy to show. If a man goes over to England and becomes a member of the English Bar, you would probably say he would acquire a domicile of choice in England. Supposing, however, that, for any reason, he left England and went elsewhere to pursue some other avocation, he would have lost that domicile of <Col N="1198" /> choice altogether and he would have reverted automatically to his domicile of origin until he acquired a domicile of choice somewhere else.  Now the consequence of all that is this.  That the class of people whom the Attorney-General is designing to benefit by this provision is a smaller and less deserving class than he supposes.</P>

      <P>It does enter into it to the extent that to understand what class of persons benefit under this section, we must understand what domicile means.  And that brings me to the Government's amendments. I confess I do not like them.  I think that sub-section (4) of Section 4 is sufficiently generous as it stands.  I do not think the Government were asking too much in making residence of one year a condition before giving a certificate of naturalisation to some one not domiciled here at the time of the Treaty.  But it seems a good deal more generous to hand over a certificate of naturalisation, that required no qualification period of residence, to a person who has nothing else to qualify himself except that his parents were born in Ireland.  The parents, in this instance, may have lived their whole lives in America, and the person himself may have lived in America, and be an American citizen, and have no interest in this country.  I do not think it should be made so easy for such persons.  Certainly, a period of residence of one year could be very reasonably required.  I am at a loss to know why the Government brought in these amendments adding greatly to the facilities they have already provided.</P>

      <P>As pointed out already, these provisions are intended to make it easy for people born in this country to return.  The position of our people here, in the past, was so different from that of the people of a normal country.  Numbers of our people were driven out against their will and numbers of them may desire to come back.  In the peculiar circumstances, in regard to our people, I thought it right that we should afford facilities of that kind.  On that account, mainly, we provided for those people and give them the opportunity of becoming Irish citizens without any qualification of residence, We did, as the Bill was originally drafted, require a certain length of time, a year or some short period of residence, but judging from the feeling expressed at the time of the Second Reading, I think I indicated at that time, that I was prepared to waive that period of one year of residence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the President that that period should not be waived in the case of those not born in Ireland, but merely children of parents who were born in Ireland.  I think it should be clearly indicated that there should be a period of one year's residence in the former case.  I do not think it is a hardship or a handicap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of making it easy for those people to acquire their citizenship again.  That is the reason that I welcome bringing this clause into line with Article 3.  At first such a person should prove that he himself was born in Ireland.  Now it is very much extended.  Either he himself or one or other of his parents if born in Ireland would do.  That is getting back closer to the days of Article 3.  I have no objection at all to wiping out this insistence on compliance with a period of qualification by way of residence, except that I am somewhat doubtful of allowing this application to be made and tried and decided upon, for or against, by a Minister without any indication given to the person who applied as to why the certificate was refused; or without <Col N="1200" /> any indication being given to the House as to the number of such certificates that are being applied for and what is happening to them.  However, that could be discussed more properly on the section itself.</P>
      <P>On this amendment I want to go back to that other point about Article 3. There is still overlapping.  I put it no further than that; there may be overlapping, but that could be completely obviated by putting into this phrase something about people being domiciled in the area of the Free State at the time of the coming into operation of the Constitution; that though they had all the other tests they lacked that one which is essential for Article 3 citizenship.  I still think that is worth considering.  If, in the end, it is found to be a very difficult matter to draft and that the draft might by some peculiar action exclude some persons who should get their citizenship, rather than do that I would be prepared to leave it as it is.  But to my mind there is a fairly clear case there for the consideration of an amendment which might be easily drafted I think by an expert draftsman.</P>

I can imagine a case where the widow would be ordinarily resident outside the jurisdiction, but this, to my mind, is an amendment tending towards a somewhat greater exclusion, and because we add in that, we then take away this necessity for compliance.  That is one point.  The other point that I wish to call attention to is the conditions as set forth in paragraph (d) of sub-section (5).

      <P>On the section, as amended, Sir, I wonder would the President state what is the intention with regard to these applications? There may be a period of, say, five or ten years provided, after the provisions of this Act, in which to get the information to our people abroad, and a number of applications may be made under this section or under a later section.  Is it desired to have these applications, when made, adjudged upon entirely by a Minister?  For instance, one of the tests proposed is that the person should be a person of good character.  That is rather an elastic term and possibly one that should be a matter for judicial inquiry. I can imagine a test being laid down, such, for instance, as is laid down later, with regard to the revocation of a certificate of a person being fined not less than £100, and so on.  That can operate as a bar against a person, evidently.  But a Minister is given power, it seems to me under this, to define generally whether or not a person is of good character and, apparently, there is no redress or appeal against his decision; nor is there any way, so far as I can see, for Deputies to get information with regard to this.  Is it intended to publish, from time to time, a statement as to the number of applications received and the number refused; and would it be possible for some means to be devised&mdash;without necessarily having it laid on the Table of the House and made available for publication in the newspapers, which, I can quite see, might be undesirable &mdash; whereby Deputies of this House could procure such information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>If any applications were refused the Deputy would hardly be unaware of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be certain cases.  The Minister may, by reason of something said or put up to him or even alleged to be documented, refuse, and the person concerned may not bother any more about it.  I do not say that there will be very many cases.  There will be a period, after this Bill becomes law, in which there will be quite a number of applications <Col N="1206" /> from people to get certificates to remove doubts and about other things. Under the Bill, as it stands, the whole thing is thrown over on the Minister although there is an amount of almost judicial functions connected with it. There are no terms of reference given to him and no one has any entry in the matter.  It is a rather large power to give to a Minister without giving him any terms of reference on which to decide.  The phrase &ldquo;good character&rdquo; is very loose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>We will see how this should be operated, whether as in the Bill, at the discretion of the Minister, or in some other way.  I think that in the United States of America there is a judicial proceeding, and that in other countries the matter lies more or less with the Executive.  With regard to the two methods, we do not see why these applications should not be dealt with on their merits and why the Minister should not set up, if he wanted to, machinery by which they would be carefully examined.  When we were drawing up the Bill we did not see that there was any need for having a tribunal of any kind.  I imagine that if the Minister had a very large number of applications he might find it necessary to set up some body that would examine the applications and report to him.  I think, however, that we would unduly complicate and delay the proceedings unnecessarily if we embodied all that in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the President that the United States example is the one to follow.  There is a previous clause which says that &ldquo;a certificate of naturalisation shall not be issued to a person of unsound mind.&rdquo;  Is that person of unsound mind found by a court to be in such a condition, or is it somebody else who decides that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am suggesting is that the Minister may say that the person is of unsound mind although possibly that person may have been brought before the court in certain proceedings and not found as such.  I suggest that in this matter it would be desirable to consider consultation with some of the judges to see if some arrangement could not be come to. There need not be much publicity. Could not some arrangement be made whereby, when a definite application was made to the Minister, it would be referred by him to some judge accustomed to dealing with these matters and deciding evidence on particular points?  Judges have from time to time to determine such questions as good character.  The matter could proceed through the Minister, and let him have a reference made for a determination by a judge.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that the President may take the view that that was the purpose in mind when the section was drafted.  I ask Deputies to observe that the sub-section says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister may at his absolute discretion, but subject to the limitations imposed by this section.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Does that not reinstate the power of the courts to issue a mandatory injunction compelling the Minister to issue a certificate of naturalisation under the conditions set out in the section?  If it did, a great deal of my objection to the principle which appears to underlie the section would disappear.  If we reinstate the courts and give the right to an individual to apply to the courts for his certificate of naturalisation, if he can prove that he has complied with the conditions, then I shall be satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the section has the effect of giving the Minister an exclusive jurisdiction to decide this, and that it would not be open to the court to issue a mandamus to him to issue a certificate in a particular case.  If the Minister acted wrongly or outside his jurisdiction or failed to enter upon an inquiry as to whether a man should get a certificate or not that would be another question. I think in that case that a mandamus could be given to hear and determine the application.  There is the classic case on the question of jurisdiction which arose in England where this very point turned up and where the Home Secretary has the same jurisdiction that is given here with respect to naturalised citizens. The Home Secretary there refused to give a certificate.  The man who made the application went to the courts for an order to compel the Home Secretary to grant a certificate, and it was declined on the grounds that under the English Act exclusive jurisdiction was given to the Home Secretary.  I think the same reason would apply here, so that I think the Deputy may take it that the effect of the section is to exclude the courts.</P>

Section 4, which is the implementing section for the purpose of naturalisation, leaves the whole question at the discretion of the individual who happens to be the Minister for Justice at a given time. Surely we ought to do something whereby we can make this statute, as it will be the overriding authority, such that the will of Dáil Eireann can be invoked as against the personal inclination of any individual Minister at any time.  There ought to be safeguards, if we commit the execution of the statute to a Minister, by way of giving the right to an individual to apply to the courts for an injunction to compel the Minister to do what Dáil Eireann intended him to do.</P>

      <P>It is not quite a right of appeal, but I am trying to eliminate from the Bill this element that is introduced by the words &ldquo;The Minister may at his absolute discretion&rdquo; do certain things.  It is relevant at this juncture to observe that under sub-section (1) of Section 9, this discretionary power is made much more extensive. because under that sub-section the Minister may at any time, on his own motion and at his absolute discretion, by order, revoke any certificate of naturalisation issued under this Act.  The section then goes on to say that under certain conditions he shall revoke, but under that sub-section he may, at his absolute discretion, revoke apparently without <Col N="1210" /> assigning any reason at all.  Now, of course, that opens a wider field, but in the narrower field of Section 4, I should like to see the right conferred on every applicant for a certificate of naturalisation to go to the courts, where he believed the Minister had not carried out the intention of Oireachtas Eireann, and to ask the judges for the necessary injunction to compel the Minister to do what the Oireachtas intended he should do.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>I am all in favour of giving as much work to the courts as possible.  At the same time I do not think that it would be really necessary.  After all, you have seven or eight years of the Minister dealing with aliens.  If it transpires after a few years that the Minister is perpetrating the iniquities Deputy Dillon foresees, I dare say the Oireachtas will very quickly bring him to book and provide some way by which these cases may be reinvestigated, but it is asking us to assume a lot in suggesting that the Minister would not give a proper and conscientious decision as to whether the applicant is a person of good character.  It is asking the courts to try out the issue as to whether a man is or is not of good <Col N="1211" /> character.  That is rather unnecessary. If it turns out that there are any evils arising from the operation of the Act, and that persons who are of good character are refused certificates, I think the Dáil will have no hesitation in amending the legislation and giving such an applicant a way of going to the courts.  I do not think, however, there is any danger of such a situation arising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I put a case to the President?  A person applies for a certificate and the Minister has confidential sources of information, through the Department of External Affairs or the Ministry of Justice, and he makes up his mind that the person is not of good character and he deems it his duty to reject the application. The matter is raised in this House and the Minister says that after considerable investigation he has found that the applicant is not a person of good character.  The moment he says that, he has perpetrated perhaps the gravest possible slander he could on anybody and the applicant has no remedy.  The Minister may say: &ldquo;I am not free to reveal the facts in this particular case; I have confidential sources of information.&rdquo; I suggest that unless some recourse to the law courts is open to the applicant, the Minister's lips may be sealed.  He has certain sources of information and he is in the impossible position of defending what may be a very grave and injurious slander against some apparently inoffensive man.  He is almost unable to explain why he makes the charge, whereas if my recourse is open to the applicant he can say to the public: &ldquo;I regard this man as a man who should not have applied for a certificate and whose character is such that I cannot issue a certificate.  If he thinks I have misjudged him or that I have listened to unreliable sources of information, he has his remedy of going to court.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Minister could not produce the evidence for the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know.  It would be an invitation to the Minister <Col N="1212" /> to reveal such information as had reached him.  Mind you, if the President laughs because he thinks that a situation might arise where he would get information which would justify him in refusing a certificate of naturalisation, and in which he would then feel it incumbent on him not to reveal anything and would consider that a sufficient defence, he is creating an extraordinary situation because at any time any Minister who likes could get up and blast a man's character and say: &ldquo;I cannot reveal my sources of information.&rdquo; I warn you that that situation may arise.  I put it to the President that such a situation is highly undesirable, would be open to the gravest possible abuse and might become a very great evil in the State, whereas if resort to the courts is there continually, no question of that kind could ever arise because the applicant has a remedy at all times.  There can be no objection to giving that remedy because I suppose in a decade or 20 years a dozen such cases would not or could not arise.</P>
      <P>I put it to the President that it is the kind of safeguard that should be readily afforded in order to prevent the growth of an evil and in order to preserve the principle that this House will be extremely reluctant to set aside the courts or to deprive the courts of the country of their right to intervene as between a Minister of the State and a citizen of the State.  There is a great deal of that going on in the legislation in this House and elsewhere and the less there is the better it will be for the body politic.  I put it to the President that here is a case where the intervention of the courts could do no harm if it is invoked.  They might well be the instrument of justice in certain cases. Here is an opportunity of vindicating a great principle, that wherever possible the sovereignty of the courts will be preserved and that their intervention will be protected.  I think no more suitable instance for the vindication of that principle could arise and on such grounds I appeal to the President to make such verbal alteration in the section as would restore that right to anybody who is obliged to avail of it.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that this is a question of giving a certificate of naturalisation and it is desirable that, in matters of this sort, the executive authority and the Minister should be able to use any sources of information which they may have in determining whether a person is or is not a fit person to get a certificate of naturalisation.  The Attorney-General said that he was in favour of giving the courts plenty of work to do.  My motto is the opposite.  I want to give them as little work as possible and I think we should do our best to avoid giving them unnecessary work.  Two principles are in operation.  It has been suggested that both work.  They do work, apparently, and it is a question of choice as between the two.  I am sure that we could argue until tomorrow morning and finally we might not be able to come to a decision after summing up all the pros and cons.  At any rate we have adopted the principle that the Minister shall decide in his absolute discretion.  We think it advisable that the sources of information which he may have, and which it may not be in the public interest to reveal, shall be available for him in determining whether a certificate of naturalisation should issue.</P>

He said that because of the phrase used, &ldquo;the Minister, in his absolute discretion may do certain things,&rdquo; no court could intervene on it.  Let me take what would be in practical life an absurd example. Supposing the Minister granted a certificate to a person under 21 and granted it under conditions that are not sanctioned by a later section.

There may be attempts through the courts to get after a Minister's decision unless he <Col N="1214" /> safeguards himself.  The Attorney-General made reference to the Aliens Act.  I think that was a frightfully bad example.  When I was in certain difficulties at the time the Shannon Scheme was in operation I thought the strongest power I had with respect to getting people out of the country was because they were aliens.  Then I discovered that the powers were of a police type, on the ground of bad character and so on, and I was forced to come to the conclusion that if a man disobeyed orders that I thought were properly given to him on the Shannon scheme, he should be regarded as a bad character and he was pushed out of the country.</P>

      <P>It was certainly straining the law.  I know that became the practice and I am sure it is the practice at the moment that people are being dislodged from this country when they should only be so dislodged for police reasons, because they might be regarded as a danger to the community.  I am sure there are many people being dislodged because they are occupying jobs that other people wish to get and not because they are a danger to the community.  That is a matter that would not stand a moment's consideration in court.  There is, I suggest, a good case possible, not so much under this section but under other sections where this power to the Minister is a much more abominable thing than here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President says that the Minister ought to be able to use any information available to him, no matter from what source it comes.  Certainly, let him have that information.  I am not concerned with the Minister using all the information he can get.  All I am concerned with is that when a judgment has been passed, it will be a judgment which cannot be criticised as a judgment by somebody influenced by politics, the basis of whose whole life is politics.  That is not so with judges.  I think it is quite right to give the Minister power to deal with these provisions with regard to <Col N="1215" /> residence, as in sub-sections (4) and (5), or even with regard to (6) to say that the period of employment shall count.  An application is made to the Minister and the Minister decides with regard to whether a residence qualification should be demanded or whether a period of work in the employment of the Government outside the Saorstát should be deemed to be residence in the Saorstát.  Let him determine these things by all means and then let it be passed on to someone clean away from the whole political arena, someone who would decide with regard to good character or unsound mind.  These are the two points he should get outside assistance on.  If that were to be done, there is no necessity to give any statement to the Dáil about the number of applications made and refused.</P>
    <P>Let there be an application via the Minister and a reference by him to some judge.  I do not think it should be counted as court work.  The judge <Col N="1216" /> may require further information from the Minister, but I do not think it should be regarded as a matter where there would be someone appearing for the applicant and someone appearing against for the Attorney-General. There should be, in my opinion, a quiet reference to a judge sitting in chambers, with all the information made available to that judge.  All we want is the satisfaction of having someone removed from the political arena.  We want to know that someone who is used to dealing with lunatics and not politicians will be in a position to say that such a man is or is not a lunatic.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 5 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The Executive Council may, if and whenever they so think proper, cause a certificate of naturalisation to be issued under this Act to any person or to a child or grandchild of any person who, in the opinion of the Executive Council, has done signal honour or rendered distinguished service to the Irish nation.</P>
      <P>(2)  The Executive Council may authorise the Minister to dispense, in relation to the issue of a certificate of naturalisation under this section, with compliance by the person to whom such certificate is issued with all or such one or more as the Executive Council shall think proper of the conditions which are by virtue of this Act conditions precedent to the grant of a certificate of naturalisation.</P>
      <P>I think the purpose of this amendment is clear from its terms.  It is to provide for the issue of a certificate of naturalisation in special cases of persons or their children or grandchildren who may have rendered distinguished service to the country and who might not otherwise come in under the Bill.  In other words, we feel that it is desirable that in cases that might not come under the Bill, or as a special mark of appreciation of their national services, it should be available for the State to give its citizenship to people who had rendered signal service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an amazing proposal brought in by way of amendment. If it was thought that there was something in this as a reward for merit, surely, it must have been before the minds of the Executive Council before the Bill was drafted?  Is this only something that occurred in the interim between the Second Stage and Committee Stage?  I object to it on a variety of grounds.  First of all, I think that if we want to do some honour to somebody who has done signal service to this country, there are other ways of doing it than this.  This is an absurd business.  It seems to me that if the conferring of our citizenship was to be regarded as an honour in return for signal or distinguished services to the Irish nation, a case made on that basis should go through the formal stages of the present procedure, which allows for the acquisition or conferring of citizenship by Private Bill legislation.  In a case in which you can get all Parties in the two Houses to agree that for <Col N="1219" /> services which could be stated, a person deserves to have done to him the honour of admitting him amongst the ranks of our citizens, surely that is a better procedure than that the Executive Council, in a hole and corner way and for reasons which they will not reveal, should hand over some sort of certificate of nationality, there being no publicity as to what are the services, no statements to the House, or no statements about it in any way.  It is a ludicrous proposal, and surely one that is apt to bring indignity upon persons who might be sufficiently dignified to have nationality conferred upon them in the other way.  This is really reducing the citizenship of the country to the position of the old-time J.P.&mdash; something to be given out for services, and God knows what the services are going to be determined to be.</P>

      <P>As has been pointed out, it might be the services of your grandmother.  Has the Executive Council any people in mind, and have they even a sufficiently clear idea of their terms of reference to tell us&mdash;even if they have got individuals&mdash; on what grounds they would, in the abstract, consider a person worthy of this honour when this procedure would be brought into play?  I protest against the whole thing.  There is a method already, by Private Bill legislation, of conferring citizenship.  There you can test a man's services.  The person's services can be put forward and argued about, and if they are sufficiently good to merit recognition from the State, then it will be something worth having after it is passed in the ordinary way.  This, as a sort of substitute for the type of order of merit that other countries have, is not befitting any sort of proper circumstances. It is very likely to be abused, and will of course always be suspect of abuse if it is to be done by the Executive Council without saying why.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know whether this is even strictly comparable <Col N="1220" /> to an order of merit.  Is the kind of citizenship which it is proposed to give the Executive Council power to confer, a citizenship that can be held concurrently with citizenship of another country, or must the person who is being complimented surrender any other citizenship in order to take this citizenship?  In any case I thoroughly agree with Deputy McGilligan that this is a most unsuitable power to give the Executive Council, and a most unsuitable form of honour to pay to a distinguished person of another country.  I specially object to its being in the power of the Executive Council to give our citizenship to someone who may not be in the least distinguished, or may not have deserved well of this country, just because an ancestor of his had, in their opinion, deserved well of this country.  I am really astonished that the Government should introduce this new section, and I hope that, on reflection, they will withdraw it.</P>

      <P>This is not an unusual power for an Executive to have.  In the case of our country in particular it is a power which I think might very well be retained by the Executive.  There is no doubt whatever that the Executive Council would be held responsible to the Dáil and to the country for any certificates of citizenship given under this section. I see nothing objectionable in it at all, and I think it is a power which the Executive should have.  I do not agree with the points which have been made by the members on the opposite side, because it is clear that in the exercise of power like that the Executive would have to stand up to public opinion.</P>

      <P>Just imagine what the position would be if the Government in power decides to honour some person, or the child of that person or the grandchild of that person&mdash;the grandchild might possibly be 50 or 60 years of age&mdash;and that is to be the subject of public discussion and comment throughout the country.  Surely the Minister has not made up his mind definitely on this subject, according to that particular presentation of the case?  If there is one body of persons more than another that is responsible for a matter of this sort being received with suspicion it is the Executive Council.  They were particularly anxious, during the time they were in opposition here, to take away from the Executive Council, which was then in office, any respect that there might be throughout the country for the persons in that particular Assembly.  They now expect that they themselves should get the respect which they denied to others, and should get a matter of this sort considered as if there were no such thing in this country as a division of opinion.  In the first place, what we would have expected to have heard in connection with a proposal of this sort, is that there were persons actually in mind to whom an honour of this sort should be given. If there be an honour, is this the best thing to do in the circumstances?  It is a very nice commentary coming from this Executive Council that we should have an order of descent for the reception of merit.  One would have thought they were so democratic that they could not possibly stand that sort of thing.  The Executive Council had better make up its mind that if there are honours to be given this is not the method of doing it, and that public discussion of those honours is not an accompaniment which can be thought of in connection with the presentation of them.  If there are honours to be given by the State they must not be the subject of public discussion, or they ought not to be. The very mention of that shows that there is, in the minds of the Ministry, <Col N="1222" /> a suspicion that there would be.  This is not the time nor is this the place to insert an amendment such as that.</P>

      <P>The speech to which we have just listened is a most extraordinary one.  As if there will not be public discussion of every act of an Executive Council! There is bound to be discussion.  What I have said is that any action taken under this Bill is bound to be discussed by the people, and that the Executive Council, if they take a certain action, will have to satisfy themselves that it is an action which is likely to be commended by the people.  That is sufficient safeguard. It was not I who introduced the element of suspicion; it was the members on the opposite benches, who suggested that this might be operated in an improper manner.  I say that, as against any likelihood of that, the Executive Council will have to stand up to public opinion.  They will have to face public opinion on it, and that is sufficient safeguard.  I think it is very advisable that it should be in the power of the Executive Council to give this special distinction to a person whose services have merited that he should be one of our community.</P>

      <P>It happens that I have a long memory about certain matters and one of the subjects upon which I read some comments from members of the Front Bench opposite in one of their publications 12 years ago was the personnel of the first Seanad of this State.  It so happened that they said there was one person alone in that Seanad who was worthy of the honour that was then conferred upon him. They themselves have since elected two of the persons who were in that Seanad, and those two do not comprise the one whom they then mentioned. That is my opinion of their judgement in connection with those matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We must go deeper into this.  The Executive Council are going to issue certificates of naturalisation and they will have their views on what is signal honour and need not tell anyone what they are.  The only information the public may get is after the event, when there is some publication of the name of the person with such other particulars as the Minister for Justice may decide to reveal.  According to other sections in this Bill, which will operate in the ordinary way, if a grandchild of someone who had done distinguished service to the country was a married man with children, if he enters their names on a sheet of paper they become immediately natural-born citizens of the country, and that is an acknowledgement that the Executive Council has given this man signal honour.  After a lapse a new Minister for Justice may revoke the certificate, and then there will be a wait of five, ten or 15 years, until the tide flows again the other way, when, if he lives so long, he may be reinstated once more, so that there will be as much controversy about putting on and taking off names from the register of citizens as there used to be about removing the Nelson Pillar.  That is the position you are going to reduce that person to.  The President indicates, to my mind, that that is the sort of move that is going to be made when he talks of standing up to public opinion in the matter.  Standing up to public opinion is a phrase which means that this particular certificate will be given to persons who will commend themselves to public opinion.  Here it is to be rather an attitude of mind which is going to be open to public criticism.  That is what I take to be standing up to public opinion.</P>

A far better situation would arise if a man's name and qualifications, and what the <Col N="1224" /> Ministry think about him, were promulgated.  There should be the ordinary proposal to confer citizenship upon him by Private Bill legislation.  Surely, in the end, there is something much better worth having, if the person gets such citizenship conferred after the two Houses have acquiesced in the statement as to his qualifications and distinguished services, and the signal honour, rather than if it were done in a hole and corner way by the Executive Council.</P>

      <P>A man who is told by the Government that they consider he should have citizenship conferred upon him, knows that with Government assistance at his back, and possibly opposition backing in the two Houses, he will have nearly everyone in his favour when it goes to a special committee for consideration.  Is that the ordinary method of a man who wanted to get in for some purpose or wanted to escape the citizenship of some other country?  Is it not better to have it done in an open way, in the case of a man who would not go forward unless he felt the honour he had done this country was going to ensure him a good reception?  That is better than to have people sitting around a council table and deciding on merit than merely issuing a statement in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> that So-and-so had got a certificate of naturalisation, from which the public would not know whether the man had applied for it in the ordinary way or as a pure alien looking for entry into this country, as a person whose citizenship was in doubt and who was looking for a certificate to remove the doubt, or whether he was one who was being <Col N="1225" /> honoured because of his signal services to the country.  Which is the better situation?</P>
      <P>Would Deputy Moore like to have some other country's citizenship decided in that hole-and-corner way or would he consider it the bigger honour to be asked by the Government of the State to have his name put forward on the ground that he had done honour to the country?  Which would he think the better, a thing handed down with a simple statement in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, containing merely his name and the date, or a thing that could be promulgated publicly, and that Deputy Moore felt he could rely upon to carry him through in other States?  Surely there is a big difference.  The Deputy would not feel that he got much in the second way if there was a likelihood, by a change of Government, that the certificate of naturalisation could be revoked. There is less publicity, less honour, less security and less dignity between one proposal and the other.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the Government must have overlooked some of the consequences that would flow from this amendment.  As Deputy McGilligan has just mentioned, it is not merely that any Minister has power to revoke a certificate of naturalisation that has been granted, but that there is an absolute obligation on the Minister to revoke a certificate of naturalisation, if the person who received that certificate is fined £100 within five years of receiving it, for any reason, in any country, or, if he goes away from Ireland for a continuous period of seven years without maintaining substantial connection which, I suppose, means some sort of business connection with this country.  The Minister is not given any choice.  He has to revoke the certificate of naturalisation.  I think that this is symptomatic of the fact that a naturalisation certificate whether granted by the act of the Executive Council alone or by the whole House is not an appropriate form of honour to some one whom the country desires to honour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the talk about &ldquo;appropriate form of honour&rdquo;<Col N="1226" /> and all the rest is a misunderstanding of the whole situation.  We have got a number of things here by which we can naturalise people who want to become citizens of our country.  Assume that a person seeks a naturalisation certificate: If the person in question, or his son or grandson, has rendered signal services to the country the Minister can dispense&mdash;and that is all that counts&mdash;as a mark of appreciation of these services, with compliance with the conditions necessary in other cases. It is on that basis we should consider this question.  In cases where an applicant for naturalisation is himself a person who has rendered, in the opinion of the Executive Council, signal services to the country or, if a son or a grandson of such a person applies for naturalisation, is it not right that the Executive Council&mdash;it is not merely the Minister in this case&mdash; should be in a position to grant that naturalisation without insisting on the conditions imposed elsewhere?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is really what the section means. It is not as if we were conferring some special title or making an order of merit.  It simply gives discretion to the Executive Council, in cases where an applicant for naturalisation is a person that, in their opinion, has rendered signal service, or is the child or grandchild of a person who has rendered such service, to dispense with the residence qualification, which is really the qualification in question.  That does not run counter to the idea of the revocation of a certificate of naturalisation if the conditions which were necessary for its retention are not fulfilled.  It simply means that we are making a special class and making it possible for the Executive Council to dispense, in a special case, with the residence qualification.  That is all it amounts to.  It is putting it on a wrong basis altogether to speak of it as it has been spoken of from the Opposition Benches.  If there were any suspicion that in cases of this sort the Executive Council did not perform their duty by asking themselves whether, in fact, such service had been rendered to the country as would justify this special dispensation, they would be in such cases amenable to public <Col N="1227" /> opinion in the sense that they would have to stand over their actions as they have to do over other actions.</P>

      <P>We have listened to a most extraordinary speech from Deputy McGilligan on this section.  He has told us that there is not very much honour in a citizenship which is conferred in a hole-and-corner way, the announcement of which takes the form of a bald statement in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>; that because of the statement and the form of the certificate, which the Deputy assumed will be of the same nature as that which would confer citizenship in the ordinary process, no person would regard a citizenship conferred in the manner indicated in the section as a special privilege.  The Deputy is sitting beside the former Attorney-General and if Deputy McGilligan, who has possibly less experience in these matters than his colleague, had taken the trouble to consult Deputy Costello, he would probably have learned from him that the Executive Council should not act in the way contemplated in the section without citing its authority; and that authority would be conveyed and would appear on the face of the certificate and in the notice which would appear in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> in the terms of this section embodying the phrase: &ldquo;Has done signal honour or rendered distinguished service to the Irish nation&rdquo; which would appear on the face of the certificate and in the official announcement in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i></P>

There are other people who, not having engaged in the hurly-burly of politics with Deputy McGilligan over a period of years, and, possibly, more sensitive in matters of this kind than those who have listened to him in this House and can gauge what he says at its true worth, would hesitate to accept the right of citizenship if, as I said, they had to undergo such a process of martyrdom as Deputy McGilligan has outlined for them.  We are told by Deputy Cosgrave that under the old régime the Executive Council was deserving of a certain amount of public honour and public esteem.  Now, we are told by his colleague that it acts in a hole-and-corner way&mdash;that possibly one of the disadvantages in a process of this sort would be that the public would only hear of the honour after it had been conferred on the recipient.  I can recall an occasion upon which the former Executive Council conferred a very high honour upon certain Irishmen&mdash;the honour of martyrdom&mdash;and the public did not know of it until after the honour had been conferred.</P>

It is only a gang of conspirators that would do this in a hole-and-corner way. This will be done in all solemnity. Possibly it may never be done by us; it may be done by our successors.  I am certain that those who are members of the Executive Council, when they come to consider a case like this, will bear everything in mind.  While it is not possible to guarantee that everything they do will meet with unanimous approval, nevertheless, there was a time when the Dáil did things almost unanimously and the great majority of the people condemned them.  The process which Deputy McGilligan has outlined as an alternative to that which is provided for in the section, would not, any more than what it is proposed to do under the Bill, obviate the necessity for an amount of public inspection and public scrutiny.  There is one thing at any rate&mdash;it would not remove the possibility of there being a grave division of opinion in the country about the matter.</P>

      <P>When Deputy MacDermot was speaking on this Motion condemning the Government for its neglect to secure a quota for the export of cattle to Great Britain adequate to the needs of our agricultural industry, he said that he was convinced that the only reason we did not get a bigger quota was because of the sham republicanism of the Government.  Now Deputy MacDermot said that with verve and indicated that he was convinced the thing must be right.  He made a suppositious speech about the opinions of a suppositious British statesman.  He gave us no facts to show why the Government could get a bigger quota.  But he said he was convinced that the only reason was the sham Republicanism of the Government.  That was enough.  Now Deputy MacDermot is convinced at the present time according to his speeches that General O'Duffy is a foolish man and that he has been flirting with Fascism; that he would become a Mussolini or a Hitler, if he could.  But it is only a couple of months ago that he was convinced in his own words taken from the <i>Irish Times</i> that General O'Duffy was a decent, God-fearing, straightforward Irish gentleman. He commended him as being a man who always ran true to form and the brains of the Fine Gael Ard Fheis, according to the <i>Irish Times</i>, applauded.</P>

I want to warn him that he is liable to be convinced very easily, and that in future, in regard to Irish political affairs and Anglo-Irish relations, he should be somewhat careful when making up his mind.  Sham Republicanism, so far as I can see, has nothing whatever to do with the trade relations of England and Ireland.  Neither has real Republicanism. It has no more to do with them than the anti-God policy of the Russians had to do with the recent reciprocal trade treaty which the Russians made with the British.  We have been quotaed going into the British market.  So have Australia, New Zealand and all the other countries.</P>

      <P>New Zealand is being kept to the 1933 figures.  Australia is not being allowed to send in any meat products in the month of December or next month.  Is it because of their sham Republicanism that Australia and New <Col N="1234" /> Zealand are restricted?  Take up the British Trade and Navigation Statistics, published in October, and look at the figures representing the meat imports into England.  In chilled meat products England imported from the Argentine for the ten months ended 1st October £9,690,000 worth, and from other British countries they only imported £270,000 worth&mdash;or about 1/28th. If you combine all the meat products, you will find that, from countries outside the British Empire, England imports 83 per cent. of her total requirements. Is it because of the &ldquo;sham Republicanism&rdquo; of the Dominions of the British Empire that England takes only 17 per cent. of her meat products from them and that she takes 83 per cent. from the other free countries outside the British Empire?  I should like Deputy MacDermot to address himself to that question.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with every essential point that Deputy MacDermot made.  If, when I shall have finished, I have not dealt with any point made by him, he can put me leading questions and I shall deal with them. I want to show Deputy MacDermot that the statement he has made here, a statement made by every Fine Gael speaker throughout the country, following his example&mdash;that the reason we are quotaed is because of sham Republicanism, or Republicanism&mdash;is absolutely false and without foundation. Nobody could be convinced about it except persons like Deputy MacDermot and his friends, who know nothing about the matter.  Deputy MacDermot gave us what he wanted us to believe was a typical statement of British statesmen in dealing with this question.  He did not give us an actual quotation from British statesmen on the matter.  The reason, Deputy MacDermot said, we were quotaed was because of our sham <Col N="1235" /> Republicanism.  What reason did British statesmen put forward for the quotas?  I shall give a few quotations. I cannot find anywhere in the speeches of Mr. Walter Elliot that it is because of our sham Republicanism he has put on the quotas.  But he puts forward a very good reason for the British point of view.  On February 16th, 1934, he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If the Government had not restricted the Free State exports in December, it was absolutely certain that there would have been a catastrophic decline in the price of British home-produced live stock. The Government were accused of endangering the relations between Britain and the Free State.  The measure was not dictated by any desires of political expediency but by the stern facts of economic necessity.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is no talk there about our &ldquo;sham republicanism,&rdquo; but there is a reference &ldquo;to the stern facts of economic necessity.&rdquo;  That was what Mr. Elliot, the British Minister of Agriculture, said was the reason for the quotas.  If Deputy MacDermot would get that into his head and not be imagining reasons why British Ministers put on the quotas, it would do us all good.  The sooner we have an end of this &ldquo;blath-fum&rdquo; and face the facts of the position the better for everybody.  Mr. Walter Elliot, again, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;What is the justification for the admittedly drastic steps we are taking?  The justification is the supply position and the supply position alone.  Let me repeat that there is not in these proposals any hostile or penal action towards any part of the world and, certainly, not to any part of the British Empire.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is what another British Minister, Mr. Ormsby Gore, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Without tariffs, regulations and quotas, he did not think there was any branch of British agriculture which could survive.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>From a speech by Mr. Ormsby-Gore on April 10th.  I have dozens of quotations from the speeches of British Ministers on much the same lines.  They say that the reason for the quota restrictions is &ldquo;the stern facts of economic necessity and that, without them, they did not think that there was any branch of British agriculture which could survive.&rdquo;  I am quite prepared to admit that you cannot rely on what the British themselves say.  All we have got to do is to examine the situation for ourselves and ascertain if it is &ldquo;the stern facts of the economic situation&rdquo; in England and the desire to safeguard British agriculture which are at the bottom of the quota restrictions.  When I was dealing with this point the last night, some Deputy said that we were in a much better position, for strategic reasons, to bargain with Britain for a bigger quota than Australia or New Zealand was.  I quite admit that, for purely strategic reasons, the British should, in the first place, grow everything they can and then import from countries close to them, from which they could get supplies in time of war.  From the purely strategic point of view, that would be the proper course.  There are, however, three reasons which, in my opinion, actuate the British in dealing with imports. There are, first, the strategic reasons. Quite a number of influential men in England put forward the case that, from the point of view of British security in time of war, they should produce all the essentials of life which they can on British soil.  Another set of men in England are principally actuated by the motive of selling as much as they can of their own produce abroad in order to make a profit. A third set of men want to import goods from countries in which they have investments.  A Government in England is representative of all three classes.  In my opinion, the people who are dominant in England and have been dominant, except at times of very severe national crises, are those who are principally interested in foreign trade.  They want to get a return on their investments.  I do not say that without having something to <Col N="1237" /> go upon.  If there was ever an urgent case, from the strategic point of view, for cutting off supplies from the enemy, it was during 1914, when the British sent out a very small and comparatively unorganised force to stop the German advance.  What happened then?  Those who were interested in the export of coal, in order to make a profit, actually continued for a year after the war commenced exporting coal to Holland, enabling the Dutch to sell coal to the Germans.  In that year of crisis, the British coal interests were actually enabling the Germans to get coal from Holland.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I say as against the people who want to develop their strategic point of view, those who have trade interests are usually dominant except in cases of very grave crises.  But the people who have investments abroad are still more dominant than even the trade interests.  Let me give an instance. Quite recently the British coal people were complaining that, notwithstanding the fact that the Argentine had a favourable trade balance to the extent of £9,000,000, they were importing coal from Germany. Hundreds of thousands of British miners were idle, capital was lying idle and the Argentine people refused to take their coal from England and were importing 100,000 tons from Germany.  And the reason is that that £9,000,000 of favourable trade on the side of the Argentine represents British interest on investments in the Argentine.  Notwithstanding the fact that Australia and New Zealand are trying all they can, and making play with the fact of their loyalty, in order to get a favourable trade agreement with the British, the British last year took £9,000,000 worth of meat from the Argentine and the Argentine people had a favourable balance of £9,000,000.</P>

    <P>These are things that Deputy MacDermot will have to take into consideration. When he examines these facts he will have to show what sham Republicanism has to do with all that. New Zealand has neither sham Republicanism nor real Republicanism.  They announce their loyalty to the British. They are even as loyal as Deputy <Col N="1238" /> MacDermot, yet the British calmly go on restricting New Zealand in their imports of meat into England, and continue to take meat from the Argentine. Australians are as loyal to the British almost as Deputy MacDermot, yet their loyalty does not compel the British to give them free import for their meat into England.  The British still continue to buy from the Argentine. So I must say that even if Deputy MacDermot is convinced that our sham Republicanism is responsible for the quota restrictions imposed upon us, I am not convinced, and I am not convinced because, first of all, what British Ministers say does not tally with what Deputy MacDermot thinks they should say, and their acts do not tally with what he thinks they should do. They are quite hard-boiled about it. Deputy MacDermot may be as sentimental as he likes about the British and their relations, but they are not as sentimental as Deputy MacDermot. They are hard-boiled and would drive a bargain with the devil.</P>
    <P>If it was in the British interests to make a trade agreement with us in the morning, and to enlarge our quota they would do it.  If it was in their interests to restrict our quota they would do it, but they will not be motivated by sentiment in trade matters. I hope Deputy MacDermot, the next time he talks down the country, will drop this cant about our sham Republicanism having anything whatever to do with trade restrictions.  But he has got to show me before I believe him that it has something to do with it. He has to show me that the British are restricting Australia and New Zealand because of their Republicanism while they are importing millions of pounds' worth of meat from the Argentine.  He has to show me the reason why the British, importing 83 per cent. of their meat products from outside the Empire, are motived because of the sham Republicanism of these other people.</P>

      <P>I listened with amazement to the speech delivered by the Minister for Defence.  I listened with equal amazement to his speech upon this particular motion last week. If the farmers of Ireland could listen here to a Minister of an Irish Government, standing up in an Irish Parliament and making an elaborate and vehement defence of British policy in destroying Irish agriculture, I wonder what they would think of their representatives? The Minister's speech, from beginning to end, was a defence of John Bull's stranglehold upon this country.  It was a justification of the British efforts to ruin, financially and otherwise, the people of this country, and it was a speech that would be more fitting and more in place if made by a British Minister in the British House of Commons.  I think, no matter what Parties people in this Assembly belong to, that it is rather humiliating, when there is all this hardship and unjust quotas imposed by a foreign country upon the people of this land, that we can throw up nothing better, in the shape of a Minister, than a man who sets up as a shambling apologist for the people who are exterminating the farmers in this country.  We had the whole wail and tale of last week repeated practically verbatim this evening, in a long laboured effort to justify the British quota system as applied against the Irish people.  Can anyone visualise the position of a Minister in any other country, suffering under the British quota system, standing up in the Parliament of that country to justify that quota system?  Can anyone picture a Minister in the position of the Minister for Agriculture, who should be the champion of the farmers of this country, doing such a thing?  Yet we have had the Minister for Defence pointing out the fact that the Minister <Col N="1240" /> for Agriculture in the present Government considers that the British quota as applied against the Irish farmers is not only reasonable but fair.</P>
      <P>What hope is there of relieving the Irish farmer, or increasing the quota and increasing the volume of trade from this country to England, if the people who should argue against the British case and who should fight against the British action can do no better for the farmers than the people over there?  What hope is there of relief when they can do nothing better than to get up and defend British action and justify it, and not only remove the Irish case in their time but remove the case that might be made by their successors for getting more favourable treatment in that market?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had one Minister talking about the reduction in the amount of cattle in this country, and we had his colleague getting up in the same evening to tell us that we were actually slaughtering more cattle this year than ever before, and that if the free beef scheme succeeded we would have to slaughter 220,000 additional cattle next year. That particular speech, delivered by the Minister for Agriculture, was just what we have become accustomed to &mdash;a statement made by a Ministerial Front Bencher to serve a temporary purpose, to get over an awkward corner in a debate, without official knowledge behind it.  We had the Minister for Agriculture telling us that if the free beef scheme developed according to expectations we would actually be using in the coming year 150 per cent. more beef than we consumed in 1931; that 2½ lbs. of beef would be eaten to every lb. of beef that was eaten in 1931.  That was to happen if the free beef scheme developed according to their expectations&mdash;free beef issued to the unemployed and to those in receipt of home help and to nobody else.  If that scheme develops according to the expectations of the Minister, we will be consuming two-and-a-half times more beef than last year; in other words, one-and-a-half as many recipients of beef as there were beef-eaters last year; that the number of unemployed in Dublin City, if the Minister's expectations are <Col N="1241" /> borne out, will use&mdash;one-and-a-half times the amount consumed by beef-eaters in Dublin last year.</P>
    <P>That particular section of his speech goes on to indicate that we will require 220,000 more cattle for slaughter at home next year than last year, and that the British quota only restricts our cattle by 120,000.  That is either a correct statement or an incorrect statement.  Either it is a genuine, honest and sincere Ministerial pronouncement, or it is merely a reckless statement made in order to get round an awkward corner.  Let us assume that it is a sincere and honest statement that in spite of the British quota we will require 200,000 more cattle for consumption at home or abroad than we required last year.  Does not that mean that we will require more cattle? And how can that be made compatible with all the other statements about the necessity to reduce the cattle population of the country?  How can it be reconciled with the Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Bill, or with the statements of the Minister's colleagues to the effect that we will have to get out of cattle and get into wheat?  If it is true, it means that we must carry more cattle in this country than ever before.  If it is not true&mdash;if it is not a sincere and honest expression of what the future holds for us&mdash;then it should never be made from a Government Front Bench.</P>
    <P>All that I want to know is: which is Government policy?  Which is the estimate of the Minister&mdash;either that we will want more cattle or less cattle?  He states that we will want more.  Why, then, all the efforts to reduce the cattle population, and why, later on, in the same speech, when he has forgotten that portion of his speech that the encouragement for the slaughter of calves may have been insufficient and that he hopes that in the future it will be carried out on a greater scale than in the past, do we have his statement that it is his policy, and the policy of the Government, that we should continue to carry as many cattle as heretofore?  Is it a strange thing that nobody outside or inside this House, listening to those statements, knows what the policy of the <Col N="1242" /> Government is in relation to the farmers?  We have that elaborate and humiliating defence of British policy, as far as it hits, and hits hard, at us, made by one Minister.  I wonder was there any Deputy over there listening to that speech that did not feel sadder than ever he thought he would feel when he heard one of his own Front Bench men get up to defend the British quota system as against the Irish people and Irish farmers.  Even if it were an honest case, and even if it were the fairest thing that could be done in the circumstances, it would be the duty of an Irish Minister to fight it to the last ditch and to oppose it as long as there was one hope in a million, either in his time or that of his successors, of remitting that injustice.</P>
    <P>I wish again to make the point&mdash;not merely for the immediate effect or for the cheap glory of answering a Deputy opposite or scoring a cheap point&mdash; that there is a responsibility on Government Front benchers to think of how their words will be used.  Suppose that any Front Bench men&mdash; Fianna Fáil or others&mdash;go over in the future to argue with British Ministers against British quotas; neither British officials nor Ministers need labour to make up a case to meet our case, nor need they waste any time to meet and answer allegations.  They have only to turn up the debates of Dáil Eireann and those allegations will be met and beaten by the speech made last week by the Minister for Defence. I do not consider that that kind of thing is fair play.  I believe that it is in a reckless and irresponsible spirit that that type of speech is made.  I believe that if he had considered the effect of that speech on the country's prospects, or if he had considered the weapon it was putting into the hands of those with whom we are supposed to be fighting an economic war, he would never have made that particular type of speech.</P>
    <P>I believe with the Minister for Industry and Commerce that if the British market is restricted or removed it will be something like a national calamity for the people of this country. I believe with him that it is not only <Col N="1243" /> the best market, but that it is our natural market, and I believe also with him that any statesman worth his salt has got to make it his prime object not only to hold but to develop that market.  I will quote the Minister for Industry and Commerce so as to show that, in spite of the speeches made by the Minister for Defence and by the Minister for Agriculture, there is at least one Minister on the opposite side who at all events held the view that this country any more than any other could not live without trade.  Mr. Lemass, speaking at Navan on the 13th December, 1931, is quoted in the <i>Meath Chronicle</i> as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There could be no doubt that for a very long time to come trade with Great Britain would be of enormous importance to this country.  At present 80 per cent. of the goods we export go to the British market.  No matter how we may seek to revise the economic system in operation here, British trade will always play an important part in it, and it will be a serious thing for the people of this country if whatever advantages can be secured there are lost to us.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would call the attention of the economic war lords to that particular statement made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Fianna Fáil had no intention of interfering with that or any other market.  They would develop to the fullest extent that market, which was their natural market, too.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Speaking at Carrickmacross, the Minister for Industry and Commerce is reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> as saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Trade with Britain must always be of prime importance to this country.  They were entitled to demand and to get facilities in the British market.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And again, at Rathangan, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The policy of Fianna Fáil involves the getting of a preference in the English market in return for the huge volume of British goods bought by Ireland every year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, what is the policy at the moment?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1244" /> Does the Minister for Industry and Commerce speak for the present Government?  Is he an Imperialist or a West Briton?  Is he an enemy of the Irish people because he pins his faith to the necessity of the Irish people having an outlet for their goods?  Is he a traitor or a knave because he stands up on a public platform and tells the people that the British market is of prime importance?  Is he a knave or a traitor when he lays it down as a fundamental matter of policy that a preference must be got in that market: that the position that was there when he was speaking was not just good enough, and that we had to get further preferences in that market?  Is that the policy of the Government or does the Minister for Defence, in his new rôle of champion of John Bull and defender of all their pronouncements and actions, particularly against their own people, represent the policy of Fianna Fáil? Is the Minister for Agriculture stating the agricultural policy of the Government when he says that we must maintain our cattle population, or is he stating the agricultural policy of the Government when he urges that we must reduce the number of cattle in this country, that we are not doing it sufficiently rapidly, and that we must provide other and extra inducements to the people to reduce the cattle population? Which of all these statements represents Government policy?  Which of the three Front Bench members is speaking for the Party or the Government?</P>
    <P>Personally, I line myself up beside the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I hope that the influence that he has in the counsels of his Party and of the Government will extend and grow.  I hold with him that that market is of prime importance, and that it would be a national disaster if we lose our grip in it.  The quota system has been applied against us, cutting down our exports into that market, which is of prime importance, by 50 per cent.  I ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce and anyone in the Party who believes with him to realise that our farmers cannot exist without an outlet for their goods, and that if the farmers go under then sooner or later we all go <Col N="1245" /> under together.  I would ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce and those who believe with him to go into the Lobby in support of this motion.</P>

      <P>It always seems to me rather a pity that Deputies opposite do not put their speeches on gramophone records.  It would save them an enormous amount of trouble having to repeat the same stuff and the reporters having to take it down at considerable expense. Deputy O'Higgins has delivered his usual speech.  He has started in the way in which he always starts.  I ask the House to go back and look up a few of his speeches.  &ldquo;Of all the speeches that have ever been delivered in this House the worst, the most disgraceful is the speech to which he has just listened.&rdquo;  Now that is invariable with him, and it does not matter who delivers them.  In every case his soul is torn with sorrow and horror at the level to which humanity can possibly sink as expressed by the last speech, whatever it is, of his opponents.  Now, it does get annoying when you see a man getting up and when you know exactly what he is going to say and the way he is going to say it.  There was a man once who had this habit, when he came home at night to the little hotel in which he lived, especially if he looked on the wine when it was red. When going to bed he used to take off his boots and slam them on the floor. Bump! bump! This began to get annoying, because he looked on the wine when it was red fairly often.  They used to be waiting downstairs for the bumps.  One night the proprietor remonstrated with him.  The man said he was very sorry and that, of course, he would not do a thing like that if he thought about it and that he would not do it any more.  For a few nights he did not do it, but then again he came home in the usual condition.  He took off one boot and bumped it on the floor.  Then he remembered.  He got into bed and a few minutes afterwards there was a knock at the door. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo; what is it?&rdquo; A little voice outside answered, &ldquo;Father <Col N="1246" /> says will you for God's sake please throw down the other boot, the suspense is awful.&rdquo;  That is exactly the attitude and atmosphere of mind in which we wait to hear Deputy Dr. O'Higgins say that the last speech he has just heard &ldquo;is the most disgraceful speech he has ever heard in his life.&rdquo;  Perhaps he will get a new opening for his speech on the next occasion. There has been an idea among&mdash;I forget what is the name this week&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Oh, United Ireland.  There used to be an idea among the A.B.C., B.A.D., U.I.P., or whatever it is, when the quotas came on that they were a continuance of the economic war.  They said: &ldquo;Look at what you have brought to us now; first a 20 per cent. tariff, then a 30 per cent. tariff, then a 40 per cent. tariff and now the quota.&rdquo; That used to be the doctrine preached all over the country but gradually, apparently, the statements of British Ministers, men of unquestionable rectitude, men whose identity with truth will not be questioned on the other side, have permeated apparently into the consciousness of the people opposite.  Or perhaps it is that they have decided that there are certain tactical advantages in changing their faces.  The quota is no longer regarded as part of the economic war.  It is now supposed to be something separate and distinct, something that we can deal with without dealing with the economic war, something that we can deal with apparently without dealing with the causes of the economic war.  That is, I think, a purely tactical development and it has a result to-night in the new formula.  I want to give you the new formula.  The solution is to seek a trade agreement with Great Britain even if you cannot get the economic war settled.</P>

      <P>Full wisdom was born and will die with him.  I want the Deputy to move on from column 490 to column 491.  Now we get one of the real marvels.  Deputy Triumvir Plenipotentiary Dillon talks about the surplus, a surplus which, if properly used, could be made the foundation upon which prosperity could be built up in this country, which would provide enough for everybody, a surplus in virtue of which, human nature being as it is, any man will go into a market and effectively buy the goods as cheaply as possible.</P>
      <P>Now we move on to column 506.  I do think that this volume will be valuable later to the historian.  It is still Deputy Triumvir Plenipotentiary Negotiator Dillon: &ldquo;... the fundamental wealth of this country&mdash;the agricultural surplus ...&rdquo;  Now the Deputy may understand why I quote.  In virtue of there being an agricultural surplus, in virtue of the fact that we go into a market to sell a perishable product which is surplus to our requirements, human nature being as it is, that will be sold at the cheapest possible price.</P>

I remember that very eminent people, when they were quoted in the newspapers making speeches got <i>oratio recta</i>, and perfectly ordinary people got <i>oratio obliqua.</i>  Deputy Dillon, in his humility, is always <i>oratio recta.</i>  He says: &ldquo;I would set before me,&rdquo;&ldquo;I would think,&rdquo;&ldquo;I would convict any politician,&rdquo;&ldquo;I say it is nothing short of,&rdquo;&ldquo;I would like to make available,&rdquo;&ldquo;I would like to leave it to every citizen,&rdquo;&ldquo;I would recognise,&rdquo;&ldquo;I would hasten to augment,&rdquo;&ldquo;I would turn my mind to,&rdquo;&ldquo;I would like&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree.  I am trying to get through all this mass of egotistical stuff from Deputy Dillon to the Motion.  As a matter of fact, they seem to have run out of I's and possibly they will have to put crosses for them instead when quoting the speech of the Deputy.  What I am getting at is this.  Deputy Dillon, when he tells us about the negotiations which <Col N="1251" /> are going to take place, not merely envisages himself, as he says: &ldquo;If I were in the President's shoes&rdquo;&mdash;he not merely envisages that possibility, but he starts by putting himself in the President's shoes and he tells us exactly what he is going to say.  So, with all these &ldquo;I woulds&rdquo; and &ldquo;I wills&rdquo; and &ldquo;I would leave alones,&rdquo; I will come down to refer to the actual negotiations which, in spirit and imagination, Deputy Dillon is actually engaged in at the present moment.</P>
      <P>We will cut out most of the preliminaries and we will get down to the stage where he says: &ldquo;I would go and make the case with them that we ought to put an end to whatever financial difficulty separates us.&rdquo;  That is very easy&mdash;it means just a wave of the hand.  They would all understand one another.  Deputy Curran and myself would walk down these alleyways together.  Deputy Dillon and Mr. James Thomas would walk along arm in arm and Deputy Dillon says: &ldquo;I would go and make the case that we ought to put an end to whatever financial difficulty separates us and so let us get rid of it.&rdquo;  Having got into the President's shoes, he would do all that.  In so far as the land annuities are concerned, the Deputy says: &ldquo;If I were in the President's shoes, I would say perfectly squarely to them that without yielding my position I would not ask them to yield theirs.&rdquo; Are you coming with me, Deputy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a nice example of a debate in Dáil Eireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Thus is Deputy Dillon going to negotiate and he first of all says to Mr. Thomas: &ldquo;Let us get rid of all the financial difficulties that separate us.&rdquo;  Now, listen to this. Imagine him saying perfectly squarely: &ldquo;Without yielding my position I would not ask them to yield theirs.&rdquo; Now, what the devil is going to happen?  You may think, and Deputy Curran, I suppose at the moment does think, that we are up against an <i>impasse</i>, that we are up against the irresistible force, Deputy Dillon, and <Col N="1252" /> the immovable object, Mr. Thomas. You may think that is the position, but it is not.  Here is what Deputy Dillon is going to say to him: &ldquo;You are just as much entitled to feel strongly that these moneys are due as President de Valera is to take the other view that they are not due.&rdquo; You know, we are getting on.  Do you not think so, Deputy O'Neill?  It is just like one of these things when you ask: &ldquo;Under which thimble is the pea?&rdquo; I mean that it is there and the only man who knows where it is is Deputy Dillon.</P>
      <P>Listen to where it is.  This is what Deputy Dillon is going to say to Mr. Thomas.  I want you now to strain your imaginations to find the last thing which it is possible for him to say.  I will give you two or three minutes to think it out.  Now that you have thought it out, listen to what he is going to say.  This is what Deputy Dillon is going to say to Deputy Thomas: &ldquo;Surely the matter could be argued before a court of international justice.&rdquo;  Can you beat it?  Deputy Dillon, having said perfectly squarely and standing in the President's shoes, to Mr. Thomas that he would not ask him to yield up his position says: &ldquo;Surely this thing can be settled in an international court of justice?&rdquo; What is the contest to-day between the Free State Government and the British Government? It is whether or not this thing shall be argued in a court of international justice.  Is there anybody denying that?  That is the issue.  Deputy Plenipotentiary Triumvir Joker Dillon goes over and, after two years of contest on that precise issue, says to Mr. Thomas: &ldquo;Surely the matter could be argued before a court of international justice.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, we know, of course, that Deputy Thomas has been well brought up.  He does not lapse, as Deputy Dillon does, into the vernacular, as he calls it, but I do think that he would be tempted to say: &ldquo;Stop that damn fool blatherskite.&rdquo;  He would say: &ldquo;What have we been arguing about all this time?  What is the difference between the Opposition and the Government in all this period in Ireland? <Col N="1253" /> What have the Fianna Fáil Government been doing wrong all this time?  What has been the cause, in the declarations of the Opposition, of the whole of the economic war?&rdquo; It is because we contend, as Deputy Dillon now says, that this matter could and should be settled in a court of International Justice.  That is your negotiator.  Now, you know how far you have got, Deputy Curran.  Deputy Curran knows the door is open, and the door is open by the magic key of kicking Jimmy Thomas through it. That is what Deputy Dillon says.  It is not a question of &ldquo;Could we not come together on some compromise?&rdquo; or something like that.  Not a bit.  He says: &ldquo;Surely you will get out of this. Surely you will admit that you are wrong.  Surely you will admit that everything you have done&mdash;all the tariffs you have put on, all the quotas you have put on, all the economic dislocation you have caused, all the political trouble that has been caused by your refusal to accept the verdict of an International Court&mdash;was wrong and, surely, Mr. Thomas, you will give way.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We will move on now.  We will move back to that again.  I would not lose it for worlds.  I think that quotation ought to be put up in letters of gold, but I am not quite sure over which political headquarters.  You have seen Deputy Dillon negotiating on the financial side.  Now I want you to see him negotiating on the economic side.  His talents are so extraordinarily wonderful that I do not know why there should be any other member in that Party at all&mdash;I think he could do it all himself.  Deputy Dillon, in column 506, says: &ldquo;I would go into that market suffering under no inferiority complex.&rdquo;  Deputy MacDermot used to say: &ldquo;Let us use some commonsense,&rdquo; and that solved it for nearly three months for Deputy MacDermot. Deputy Dillon is going, remember, into a market to make a negotiation.  He is not going to have any inferiority complex, and what is he going to bring with him into that market?  We go back to Deputy Curran.  He has gone into the market without any inferiority complex, carrying with him an exportable <Col N="1254" /> surplus, a surplus in virtue of which he must take the lowest price possible in that market&mdash;and he is going into that market with no inferiority complex.  All I can say is that he is a fool.  The man who goes into a market with a surplus of which he cannot dispose otherwise, and does not know that he is in an inferior position, is a fool.</P>

What happens if that only one possible customer refuses, not even permanently, but upon any particular day for any particular week, to buy that product?  Would Deputy Curran feel that he had an inferiority complex if he went into a market with a whole lot more stuff than the market could absorb and he could not hold the stuff?  I want this doctrine to get home on the new Cumann na nGaedheal&mdash; U.I.P.-A.C.A.-Young Ireland-League of Youth members who, for a brief period, are here until the dispensations of Providence and a general election remove them to another sphere.

      <P>Yes.  I want you to imagine the greatest Minister for Agriculture in Europe and the <i>Irish Times</i>&mdash;Deputy Hogan of Galway.  Deputy Hogan, among the other things he decided to reform, decided to reform the butter trade of Ireland.  He found it, as he thought, disorganised and disjointed, sending no doubt to a single market goods of an inferior and perishable character.  They were getting in that market a low price relative to the price for the butter of other countries.  Deputy Hogan, who at that time had not come to a full understanding of the beauties of economic philosophy&mdash;he had to be taught by two general elections and one county council election&mdash;thought that that was due to the variability, the poor quality and the poor presentation of the goods.  Now, I am not saying this as in any sense derogatory to Deputy Hogan.</P>

      <P>Queen Anne had a kitten named Mary.  That has got exactly as much to do with the debate as the Deputy's interruption.  I am going to praise a great man.  I am going to put his achievements on record. I am going to give him every credit which he deserves, and he does deserve credit for what he did in the matter.  He took the mixed creamery and farmers' butter trade of Ireland and he recoganised it.  He provided a uniform, clean and unimpeachable packet.  He provided a uniform, clean and practically flavourless butter product of a high quality.  He provided the British market with exactly what it wanted, exactly in the form it wanted it, and of the highest possible quality that could be obtained by organisation.  That is some tribute to pay to a political opponent, and I mean it.  He destroyed the farmers' butter trade; he destroyed the old farmers' butter as we used to know it and loved to eat it.  He provided a neutral butter paste of uniform quality, <Col N="1258" /> upon which British proprietary butters could be uniformly blended as they now are, just as vaseline is used in chemists' shops for blending ointments. He provided them with uniform goods of exactly the quality and of exactly the texture they required.  What happened? Did the price of Irish butter rise?  There were quite a number of buyers in that single market.  He had given them a better product.  He had given it to them a better condition. He had presented it better.  He had given them the quantities they wanted at the times they wanted them.  Did the price of Irish butter rise?  It did not.  The price of Irish butter fell, and fell from the day on which Deputy Hogan had brought that system into operation.</P>
