      <P>asked the President if he received a deputation of native Irish speakers from the Irish-speaking districts in Galway in the end of March; and whether they made to him a statement of things which required to be done to improve the economic conditions in the Gaeltacht; and if so, whether he will state what recommendations were made to him by the deputation and what steps he proposes to take to have any of these recommendations carried out.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  The views put forward by the deputation and my reply were indicated in a statement issued from my Department and published in the daily newspapers on 2nd April, 1934. No doubt the Deputy will be able to look that up.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will cause an enumeration to be made in June this year similar to that made in June, 1931, for the purpose of reviewing the extent to which Irish is used as the family language in the districts called the Irish-speaking districts and the partly Irish-speaking districts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The enumeration made in June, 1931, to which the Deputy refers was made at the same time as the collection of the Annual Agricultural Statistics that year and the information obtained was recorded in the Agricultural Statistics Enumeration Books.  The inquiry was made primarily for the purpose of testing the reliability of the replies given on the Census (1926) Schedules to the question concerning knowledge of the Irish language.  The forms for the Agricultural Statistics this year are now being printed and it is not feasible to include reference to the use of the Irish language on the forms.</P>

      <P>In view of the importance of the position of the use of Irish as the home language in the Irish-speaking districts and in view of the very serious situation disclosed in the enumeration made in June, 1931, is it not a matter of the greatest possible importance that that situation would be kept under almost continual review in order to see to what extent the tendency is towards worsening or growing better?</P>

      <P>In estimating the means of farmers who apply for the old age pension, the pension officer is guided by the facts of each case as ascertained by him after a visit to the claimant at his home. This system has been followed since the inception of the old age pension <Col N="1718" /> scheme, and does not invlove the issue of instructions consequent on variations in the value of farm products.  It is not the fact that pension officers continue to estimate farmers' means at as high a figure as formerly.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Defence was speaking when the debate on this Estimate was adjourned last evening.  I wanted to ask him one brief question and it might suit his convenience if I put this question to him before he resumes, so that he need not rise a second time.  When <Col N="1721" /> the Minister adumbrated his scheme for the creation of a new Army he represented to the House that the prime purpose of that scheme was to provide a common platform in which men who had been operating in the civil war might be able to come together again.  The developments which have taken place since that speech was made have resulted in some of us taking our own view about the validity of that justification for starting the new Army.  However, we can leave that on one side.  Assuming that the Minister is <i>bona fide</i> in giving that reason, I want to put it to him that the men who are so unhappily divided because of the civil war were at least 20 years of age in 1922, because all of them had served throughout the Black and Tan period and we may assume that they were at least 17 or 18 years of age when they engaged in active service in 1919.</P>
      <P>If the Minister really feels that the only way to bring these men together again is by putting arms in their hands and inviting them to carry arms together again, I submit to him that he should confine his activities to men who are now between 32 and 40 years of age, because no one who is younger than 32 now can have experienced the division to which the Minister referred.  If he does confine his attention to recruiting into the Volunteers men over 32 years of age, he will fulfil his purpose of bringing these men together on a common platform under arms for the purpose of obliterating unhappy memories.  I venture to suggest to him that if he wishes to enrol young members of the community in this Volunteer force, for the present, at least, they should be enrolled in an unarmed body, the principal purpose of which would be the promotion of physical culture and sports and such other useful activities as may occur to him, but not for the purpose of carrying arms or training in the use of arms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said here last night that the greatest safeguard against war is to be ready for war.  There is not a single State in Europe, in which the armament manufacturers have got control, in which that argument is <Col N="1722" /> not being used.  It is the very selfsame argument that brought down the World War upon the world.  Everyone got ready for war and somebody got ready before his neighbour and made up his mind, seeing that it was his neighbour's intention to be ready sooner or later, that it would be better to strike him before he had completed his preparations.  In the abstract, therefore, I challenge all the validity of that argument.  In practice, I draw the Minister's attention to what is perfectly manifest, and that is that our country has a population and an area of such a kind as would make it absolutely unthinkable that we could defend this country in arms against invasion by any great Power. In so far as our territorial integrity is concerned, our only hope is the development of the League of Nations' spirit and our cordial co-operation in the activities of the League of Nations, not excluding their disarmament activities. I believe it would be a very valuable contribution towards that end if the Minister deliberately set up his Volunteer force on an unarmed basis.  It would greatly relieve the anxiety of many people in this country who deplore the prospective training of our young people in the use of arms. It would set an example to the world of the sincerity of our belief in disarmament, and it would deliver the Minister for Defence of Saorstát Eireann from the hopeless fallacy that the best way to avoid war is to be ready for it.</P>
    <P>I am concerned principally, however, to hear the Minister on the point I raised in connection with his allegation that the purpose of this force is to provide a common platform for men, who were parted in the civil war, to meet again, and I would be interested to hear from him how he would justify by that argument putting arms in the hands of young persons between the ages of 18 and 25 who were almost in the cradle, and certainly in the lower classes of the schools where they were educated, when the civil war took place.  I think it is worthy of careful consideration and I do not despair that the Minister will yet do material good to the whole <Col N="1723" /> situation by announcing his intention of not making training in the use of arms part of the training of these young men, whatever he may consider necessary for their seniors.</P>

      <P>I was speaking last night on a reference which Deputy Fitzgerald made to the sluagh committees. Deputy Fitzgerald said that the sluagh committees should be abolished after the recruiting had been finished&mdash;that they would tend to become a nuisance. I do not agree with him on that at all. The instructions which were given to the Army with regard to the sluagh committees were that every effort should be made to a get a representative sluagh committee going&mdash;a committee that would be representative of all Parties&mdash;and from the reports I have no reason to think that they are not representative.  The sluagh committees, in the last analysis, are approved by me.  I have to sign my agreement to them before they become operative.  Already there have been 151 committees formed and 24 are in course of formation.  In practically every one of the 151 committees there are representatives of all the different Parties in the State.  There are some areas where that is not the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in certain areas in my constituency &mdash;I am speaking from knowledge&mdash;the method of forming these committees is to invite to some centre the chairman and secretary of the surrounding Fianna Fáil clubs and nobody else?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Deputy to support that statement with evidence to me, if he has such evidence, <Col N="1724" /> because I am interested in getting it. The instructions definitely were that representatives of all Parties were to be invited.  I, myself, invited representatives of all the Parties here to co-operate with me in this matter.  I saw the Chairman of the Labour Party and asked him to get his people to co-operate with us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true, and if the Deputy will give me particulars of what he has alleged, I shall be glad to enquire into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I invite the Minister to find out how many representatives of Labour in my constituency are on the committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should send those particulars along to me and I shall inquire into them.  As I was about to say, there were some areas in which we could not get representatives of the old Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  They definitely refused to co-operate, and that was as a direct result, I take it, of the lead which was given by the United Ireland Party here.  However, we have succeeded in getting representatives of the different Parties in practically all the committees I have seen.  That was our intention, and I would not feel that we had succeeded in any area&mdash;succeeded in the way that I would like to see the Volunteers succeeding&mdash;if, in every area, we had not representatives of all Parties on the committees.  I would count it a failure in that district if we did not have representatives of all Parties.  We cannot do that, however, if a certain political Party definitely tells its members not to join. How can we do it?  We cannot conscript them on to the committees, and if one or two Parties are not going to co-operate with us, we are not going to wait for their co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The person responsible would be the area administrative <Col N="1725" /> officer.  I suggest that Deputy Davin ought to see the area administrative officer about the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>But it is the duty of the area administrative officer to get representatives of all Parties on the committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, as far as he can. The sluagh committees, in my opinion, have a very valuable function even after the Volunteers are formed.  In every country where there is a territorial army, such as England and other places, you have similar bodies to look after the welfare of the Volunteers, to encourage recruits to join, and to make arrangements with the employers and the parents of the Volunteers to let them off for training. Sluagh committees which we have formed will carry out exactly similar functions.  There are some cases in which there is difficulty in getting employers to let off their men, and the members of the sluagh committees will approach an employer and ask him to arrange that the Volunteer gets off and that his work is there for him when he comes back.  They have also the function of arranging for sports and inter-sluagh competitions.</P>
      <P>The sluagh committees that are working already have done very valuable work.  We only opened recruiting a few weeks ago and already over 10,000 men have applied to join the Volunteers.  The exact number given in the last report was 10,185.  Only a number of committees are working in full going order up to now.  We will have a difficulty in a few weeks of having to sort out the applicants and having to refuse a number of men coming forward and put them on a waiting list.  The sluagh committees have worked hard and I believe they will continue to take an active interest in the Volunteers in the different sluagh areas and that they will be very valuable guardians for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon made the point that if we wanted to reunite the men who were parted in the civil war we should restrict recruiting and not go below the age of 32 years.  We have made arrangements to recruit three lines of Volunteers.  The first line will be <Col N="1726" /> for young men between 18 and 25; the second line for men up to 35, and the third line for men between 35 and 45. If there are any men beyond that age who were in the civil war they can become associate members of the sluagh without any liability for service. I think that is catering sufficiently for the older men who fought in 1916, during the Black-and-Tan war or on different sides in the civil war.</P>
    <P>It is not true to represent, as Deputy Dillon has done here to-day and as he seems to think, that the only object in organising the Volunteers is to reunite the men who were parted in the civil war.  That is not the only object.  That is what I hope will be one of the happy results, but the primary object of organising the Volunteers is to provide this country with a cheap, effective and efficient defence force.  Notwithstanding what Deputy Dillon says about our weakness in self-defence, I believe we can organise here at a cost that the country can afford a defence force which will protect our country from invasion in time of war.  We have the standing Army, the Reserve, and the Volunteers, and I am perfectly certain that we can make it not worth while for other countries to incur our enmity.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon's argument that the last war was caused by armament firms and that the next one was going to be caused by the same people is simply ridiculous.  The reason for the last war was trade jealousy and that England wanted to squash a trade rival, and the next war will probably be caused through the same reason.</P>

They would not have the cheek to do it; they get somebody as foolish or as impudent as Deputy MacDermot to do it.</P>

      <P>There were only a few minor points raised on the Estimate last night.  Deputy Fitzgerald said all the medical officers brought in since 1922 were appointed after the professors in the different universities were consulted.  He said that a few were brought in in that manner in 1924.  I have had an examination carried out, and I find that that is not a fact&mdash;that there were no medical officers taken in in 1924, and never at any time were professors in the universities consulted as to the doctors who should be appointed as medical officers in the Army.  During the last two years two doctors have been commissioned and, following the ordinary procedure, they were appointed directly by the Executive Council.  They were men in every way well qualified by experience for their particular job.  That was certified by the university professors who examined and passed them, and gave them their degrees.</P>
      <P>The point was made last night by Deputy Fitzgerald and others that in taking in 20 additional officers and commissioning them as captains, we were doing something that affected adversely the chances of promotion of junior officers.  That is not so.  The Army has been increased by the addition of 24,000 Volunteers.  As a matter of fact, as a result of the organising of the Volunteers, a number of officers, who in ordinary circumstances would have no chance of promotion, will be promoted. Deputy Cosgrave asked last night whether the general headquarters staff was consulted about the organising of the Volunteers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I pointed out in reply to that that while Deputy Cosgrave was President an effort was made to organise volunteers, and that there were only 358 appointed.  At that time the organisation of the Volunteers had the approval of the Military Staff, and our present effort to organise the Volunteers has also the approval of the Military Staff.  As a matter of fact, they have put very earnest and enthusiastic work into it.  The officers throughout the whole of the Army who are associated with this particular work are night and day engaged in organising and doing everything to make it a success.  You have very hard work performed even by the non-commissioned officers of the regular Army here, in training the Volunteers.  It throws additional work on to them, but they all realise the national and military importance of making the Volunteers an efficient part of the defence forces.  All the officers and non-commissioned officers of the regular Army who are associated with the work are doing their utmost to make it a success.</P>

      <P>I introduced a Supplementary Estimate here some time in February last, and estimated that we would have 10,000 recruited before the beginning of this financial year.  In this particular Estimate we are discussing here to-day there is provision for a further 14,000, that is 24,000 all told, between the first and second lines. Deputy O'Sullivan said last night something to the effect that the officers whom we brought in for this work were coming in at the 11th hour. I want to say that the officers recruited <Col N="1729" /> for this purpose have been in the game since 1914.  The majority of them have been fighting, as they thought best for the national cause, since they were youngsters.  Deputy O'Sullivan also said that the size of the President's meetings had something to do with the Volunteer halls.  That is a fantastic excuse to explain away the popularity of the President.  I think I have replied to all the points that call for reply, but I want to say in conclusion that I am satisfied that the country is getting full value for every penny of money we are asking for in this Estimate.  I am satisfied also that the country cannot afford not to spend it.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister a question with regard to the matter raised by Deputy Davin, that is, the representation on the sluagh committees.  Deputy Davin, I think, very farily asked that the House be informed as to what instructions were issued to the officers with regard to procedure in those cases.  I should be very anxious to know if their instructions contained something like this&mdash;that they were first to go down to the districts and they were for a day or two to consult all the Fianna Fáil people and go around with them; after that happening for about a week they were to call on a few United Ireland Party people?  That is what happened in my district.  I know some members of my county council were called on, but only people who were Fianna Fáil. I did not happen to be called upon myself, but I did not mind that.  I also know, and I should like to know if the Minister is aware, that some people whose names are included in the sluagh committees definitely refused to go on those committees, being opposed to the militarisation of young men.  In that connection I could give him one name in my own district.  That is one of the committees, I assume, which the Minister has included in the number on which all Parties are represented. That gentleman did not agree to go on the committee, but still his name is included publicly.  I should like to know if the Minister is aware of that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">

      <P>In the same connection I should like to ask the Minister if he <Col N="1730" /> thinks it would be necessary to take steps to prevent people being intimidated from acting on those sluagh committees.  He has probably been informed of a case of this kind, where a bank manager in a particular town was approached to go on a sluagh committee, and agreed to do so.  A particular customer of that bank, having heard about it, promptly intimated to the bank that unless the manager withdrew from the sluagh committee he would withdraw his account.  That bank manager has since been transferred to a very distant part of the country.  Obviously, no Government could allow intimidation of that kind, and I should like to ask the Minister if he thinks it necessary to take any steps against it.</P>

I wanted to know if it were considered by expert military officers and recommended by them, or if it was recommended by the Minister, and if he had got the assistance of the officers in carrying it out.  In other words, is it a civilian proposition or is it a military <Col N="1731" /> proposition?  That is what I wanted to know from the Minister.  I wanted to know if it was decided by the Minister that it should be done, or was it the military themselves suggested that this was the best way of forming a Volunteer force?</P>

      <P>I think something should be done in that connection. <Col N="1734" /> Many ex-members of the National Army write to me pointing out that after long service they are being pushed out or being demobilised, and that they find it difficult to get employment. After serving so long in the Army it is not so easy to get into civilian employment.  Surely whatever differences of opinion there are politically the Ministry should not pursue them in that connection.  Something should be done for these men.  They should not be put on the scrap heap after years of good service in the Army.</P>

      <P>For the last ten years hundreds of thousands of men have passed through the Army, having been in it for two or three years, or for three months.  We all know what a problem it is for ex-soldiers, after serving for a number of years, to get work.  At least the men who are going out to-day are better off in this way, that if they are unemployed when they leave the Army they get unemployment assistance.  That is what we have done, not alone for the ex-soldiers but for every unemployed person.  Up to the present month there was nothing facing ex-soldiers for the past ten years except charity, when they could not get employment.</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £185,976 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1935, for Wound and Disability Pensions, Further Pensions, and Married Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 26 of 1923, No. 12 <Col N="1736" /> of 1927, and No. 24 of 1932), and for sundry contributions and expenses in respect thereof and for Military Service Pensions (No. 48 of 1924), etc.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in this Estimate for the payment of pensions and allowances under the Army Pensions (Would and Disease) Acts, 1923 to 1932 and the Military Service Pensions Act, 1924.  The total amount estimated for is £288,476.</P>
    <P>The amount of the Vote (including Supplementary Vote of £32,000) for the year 1933-34 was £268,184.  There is, therefore, an increase of £20,292 on the previous year's Estimate.  The increase is principally under the head of wound and disability pensions and gratuities, and is due to the provision for further pensions under the Act of 1932, which it is anticipated will be awarded in the current financial year.  These pensions date from 1st April, 1932, so that it will be seen that each new pension awarded this year involves payment of two years' arrears as well as payment for the current year.</P>
    <P>Over 6,000 applications on the prescribed form under the 1932 Act have been received.  A considerable number of these are cases which have been adjudicated upon under the Army Pensions Acts, 1923 and 1927.  Upwards of 4,000 applications, after preliminary examination, have been referred to the Military Service Registration Board for investigation and report.  This Board has reported in about 1,100 cases. These have been referred to the Army Pensions Board, which has disposed of about 900 cases, following which awards of pensions, allowances and gratuities have been made in over 400 cases. Awards have been refused in upwards of 400 cases, following investigation thereof.  The remaining 100 cases, which have been reported on by the Army Pensions Board, are still under consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to refer to the case of an officer named Hiney, who was tried by court-martial as far back as December.  I understand that he was dismissed by court-martial decision at the end of February for <Col N="1738" /> conduct unbecoming an officer and for behaving in a discreditable manner, or something of that sort.  Two months is a long time for a court-martial to make up its mind on a question of that kind.  I understand that notice of the withdrawal of the pension to which he was entitled has been served on this officer.  I do not know how many cases of withdrawal of pensions have come before the Executive Council. If my recollection is correct, withdrawals of pensions should follow a conviction in which some sentence of imprisonment or punishment of that sort was imposed or it should be the consequence of some offence which would indicate that the person was engaged in anti-State activities.  I do not know whether there is an alteration in connection with the consideration of these matters.  It is a very serious and heavy penalty to deprive of his pension an officer who has been found guilty by court-martial but who has not been sentenced to any term of imprisonment.  I think that the Executive Council would be well advised in cases of that sort to weigh all the circumstances carefully and to consider whether the punishment fits the crime. The case was published at great length in the Press.  It was not a very serious case, if the whole of the evidence was published.  If this man's pension amounted to £50 a year, at 20 years' purchase that would amount to a fine of £1,000, which is a very heavy penalty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be indignation at the action that the officer took.  I presume the Minister has considered all the circumstances.  It must have been on his recommendation that the pension was withdrawn.  The allowance, as was indicated at the time of the introduction of the Military Service Pensions Bill, is not a pension in the ordinary acceptation of the term.  It is a sort of compensation for the interruption of young men's lives.  They were taken away either from their university or school or from their profession or calling in life at the most critical stage in their career.  In 1924, the State gave them that compensation for the services they had rendered or the years they had sacrificed in the public <Col N="1739" /> interest.  The withdrawal or suspension of a pension of that sort is very serious for young men.</P>
    <P>Let us not get into the position where we shall have one Minister taking away pensions and another Minister coming along and giving them back.  Let whatever administrative act is performed be one that will not require review.  If, in the judgement of the Executive Council, a case is established for withdrawal, let it be done without political partiality.  The Executive Council would be well advised in those cases to let some period elapse between the time at which the charge is made and the consideration of the withdrawal or interruption of the pension.  A short time ago, I had occasion to speak of the withholding for 12 months of a pension awarded to another officer by an Act passed through the Oireachtas.  I understand that that pension has been paid since. I regret to have to introduce this matter but I do not regard the Military Service Pensions Act of 1924 as being really a Pensions Act.  It provides rather for compensation.  It is a debt the State owes rather than an ex gratia allowance.  I know that these men did not enter into the service of the State or take part in public activities with the intention of obtaining future reward.  In some cases these payments by no means provide adequate compensation.  In other cases they may exceed any losses sustained. In any event, they were intended as compensation and they ought not to be withdrawn without very sound reason.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Cosgrave that the withdrawal of the pension in ex-Lieutenant Hiney's case constitutes very severe punishment.  As the Deputy surmised, it was on my recommendation the pension was withdrawn. I made the recommendation, because the offence of which he was found guilty by a court of Army officers was a desperately serious one&mdash; an offence which no Government and no Minister for Defence could over look. If Deputy Cosgrave means that we, in charge of the Army, when dealing with <Col N="1740" /> a man who has been found guilty of an offence similar to that committed by Lieutenant Hiney, should not take drastic action against that officer for that offence, I think he is mistaken. Lieutenant Hiney was found guilty of having tried to extract nine hand grenades from military custody and also some rounds of ammunition.  If that offence were committed by an ordinary private soldier, who tried to keep back hand grenades and took them out of barracks, one might say the case would be severely dealt with if he got one month in prison.  If the offence was committed by an officer, a man responsible for giving good example to the men, it would deserve very much more severe punishment.  I grant that the removal of a man's pension is a very severe punishment, amounting to more than 12 months in jail, but the offence was a very great one.  It would be a great one at any time, but, particularly, in the present circumstances, the Government had to take a grave view of the matter, and that was the reason for the refusal to withdraw the punishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that if this were a private soldier the sentence would be one month's imprisonment.  Would that sentence of one month's imprisonment disqualify a soldier from getting his pension?  If the offence were as serious as the Minister said, and that one month's imprisonment followed, that, to my mind, would look like the equivalent of a fine of £5.  The Minister for Justice will correct me, if I am wrong, but I think in the police courts a fine of £2 would be equivalent to one month's imprisonment.  If, as the Minister says, this offence was committed by a private soldier, and that he was sentenced to one month's imprisonment, the equivalent of £2 or £5, there is a very great difference between either of those figures and £1,000.  I do not know what pension this man had.  I do not know the man at all. I may have met him once.  Whatever sentence might be passed on a private soldier, whether it was a sentence of one month's imprisonment or a fine, the fine in this particular case is <Col N="1741" /> entirely too heavy.  I take the Minister's statement that he was found guilty of abstracting nine hand grenades.  What a man like that would want nine hand grenades for I do not know from Adam.  There is no person of authority in association with this lieutenant, in the Blue Shirts, who would tolerate anything of that sort&mdash; nobody.  The Blue Shirts are a long time in existence.  Have they committed any overt act against anybody? I advise the Minister to reconsider this case.  He should have allowed some time to elapse between the court-martial and his decision.  I speak advisedly on that matter.  If the Minister looks up the files he will see I am not addressing myself to this matter lightly.  Once before this kind of case occurred, and it took months to vindicate the men who were condemned, when a hasty decision was arrived at and these men were deprived of their pensions.  They were then after further investigation restored.  If the Minister would read some books on naval courtsmartial he would find one naval officer, at least, said he would never try a man except after a certain time, because otherwise his mind would tend towards a partial decision.  In six months' time, if the Minister would reconsider the case he would arrive at a different conclusion.  I have experience of that, as I have said, and that is the reason that I press this matter here to-day.</P>

The latest commercial accounts are for the year 1932-1933, and I will refer to them.  These accounts, which are subject to audit, deal separately with the three main services covered in the Vote, viz: postal, telegraph and telephone.  In the postal services the total income was £1,519,122 against an expenditure of £1,424,524 leaving a surplus of £94,598; telegraph services &mdash;income, £182,260, expenditure, £301,114, deficit, £118,854; telephone services, total income, £427,239; expenditure, £385,626; surplus, £41,613.</P>
      <P>The postal and telephone services, therefore, show a gross surplus of £136,211 against a deficit in the telegraphs of £118,854, leaving a profit on the combined services of £17,357 as compared with £66,947 in the previous year.</P>
      <P>In the year under review there was a shrinkage of postal revenue and a further decline in telegraph traffic, but telephone revenue still showed an upward trend.  The amount of the surplus was adversely affected to the extent of £28,000 owing to extra expenditure and loss to revenue consequent on damage to telegraph and telephone lines during the severe snowstorm in February of last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to mail services the Department has constantly under <Col N="1743" /> review the question of extending or improving postal facilities.  The gradual replacement of horse vehicles by motors for mail services by road continued during the year.  About 75 per cent. of such services are now being performed by the speedier mode of transport.  Cobh and Galway continue to be utilized in the greatest possible measure for the exchange of mails between this country and America.  Nearly 22,000 sacks of mails were despatched and over 25,000 received through these ports last year. The further trial given to the provision of posting boxes affixed to omnibuses coming to Dublin from the provinces has shown disappointing results notwithstanding the clear benefit of the facility and the publicity given to it.  Correspondence posted for conveyance by the various International air services during the year 1933 was more than double that posted in the preceding year.  Over 30 per cent. of the traffic was conveyed by the London-India service and 15 per cent. by the London-Capetown route.</P>
    <P>Telegrams are still losing to the telephone, which is an expanding branch of business and which is finding increasing favour with the public.  But as compared with other countries we do not occupy a high place as telephone users.  Special measures are being taken in the Department to develop the telephone side to the fullest extent and to induce new business. During the year automatic exchange lines in Dublin were increased by 143. Several new rural exchanges and call offices were opened.  Many extensions of the telephone trunk system were provided and further extensions are in process of construction.  It is proposed to erect about 50 telephone kiosks in Dublin and the provinces during the year.  The number of miles of working wire for telephones is now over 120,000 and represents an increase of 47 per cent. over the mileage of five years ago.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive building programme will be undertaken in the course of the year.  The principal work will be that of the erection of the new central sorting office in Dublin.  This work has suffered delay through unforeseen <Col N="1744" /> causes but a commencement has now been made and the work will be pushed forward as rapidly as possible.  It is expected that the new building to provide a telephone exchange and district postmen's office at Rathmines will be completed about October next.  A new letter and parcel sorting office will be provided in Cork and it is hoped to commence the work within the next few months.  It is proposed to erect a new post office in Athlone and to improve the existing accommodation at several other centres.</P>
    <P>It has been decided to issue a special postage stamp to commemorate the Golden Jubilee of the Gaelic Athletic Association.  The stamp will be of the 2d. denomination and will, it is expected, be on sale in June next.  The commercial accounts of the Department for the year just completed will not of course be available for some months, but so far as I am able to judge from the information now available the final returns will show that the Department will at least maintain a self-supporting position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a few points on this Estimate.  After all, the Department for Posts and Telegraphs ought to be looked upon as a big business concern and ought, as far as possible, be run in the interests of the State and the community generally.  At the same time, I am afraid that the tendency of all Government Departments is to become impatient of criticism and not really, in some cases, to cater for the best interests of the people they are serving.  Two years ago, on this Estimate I raised a few points and I should like to raise them again in the hope that these points will, at any rate, get some consideration from the Minister.  The first matter I wish to raise has reference to the long-distance cross-Channel telephone.  I do not care whether you look upon the cross-Channel telephone through London as a means of communication with the Continent, whether you look upon London as an international market or look upon the cross-Channel service merely as a channel for doing business in England but certainly, even at the present time, there is a very large <Col N="1745" /> volume of international business that has to be transacted through the cross-Channel telephone.  Yet the delays are very considerable, not due to any lack of efficiency in working the telephone but simply to the inadequacy of the trunk lines.  At some periods of the day you could not get on under an hour at least and possibly, considerably longer.  It is no uncommon experience for a wire to be received making a telephone appointment and I submit to the Minister that at the present time, when we are considering the spending of considerable sums of money in the relief of unemployment, money expended on the improvement of these services would give profitable employment and would at the same time relieve the difficulties of doing business on this side of the water.</P>
      <P>I think that the Minister ought seriously to consider increasing the cross-Channel telephone lines.  Possibly the Minister for Industry and Commerce would bear me out in the statement that everybody in this country is more or less in competition with somebody somewhere else and the greater the facilities afforded people here and the greater the ease with which they can do their business, the better service they will give to their customers.  I should like to approve of the matter mentioned by the Minister in regard to overhead wires.  I take it, it is the policy of the telephone service to do away with overhead wires and substitute underground lines as far as possible.  There is no doubt that these overhead wires are very liable to damage by storm.  I should like also to say that in the main the telephone branch is conducted with the idea of giving the most efficient service.  Of course, there are complaints from time to time.  I suppose human nature being what it is, the human factor will from time to time make itself felt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to make a few remarks in regard to the Post Office Savings Bank.  The Minister did not quote exact figures for the Savings Bank but I take it there is a loss on that service.  I should like to ask the Minister what is the idea of the principle on which the Savings Bank is run?  Is it that it is a bank in which <Col N="1746" /> people can put their money in competition with the existing banking institutions of the country, or in what direction are the authorities working? If they wish to give efficient service I think that they ought to give the same services as an ordinary bank.  If they cannot do that, they ought to consider whether they could not make economies in keeping the present Savings Bank open.  We hear from time to time criticisms of the existing banks, but what criticism would we hear if an individual had to give three days' notice before he could get a cheque for 25/- cashed?  I should like the Minister seriously to consider that.  I suppose that if I said the Government was not good for 25/- I would be accused of trying to depreciate my own country, but surely times have changed since the present system was instituted under which the withdrawal of any sum over £I requires three days' notice or the spending of 4/- on a prepaid wire to the Postmaster-General, before one can get one's own money out.  Surely if the Minister reviews the banking facilities that are available at present in other directions he will come to the conclusion that he should either modernise the Post Office Savings Bank system or make some economies in connection with it.</P>
    <P>Now the next item that I wish to mention in connection with this Vote is the erection of a post office which, I understand, is being undertaken on the site at the corner of Trinity Street and St. Andrew Street in this city.  As Deputies know, that is a very congested area and it is no uncommon thing to see a very considerable block of traffic there.  Some people in the neighbourhood were a bit nervous that if owing to the present traffic difficulties post office vans were left outside the site in that congested area, it would mean practically closing up a very important sub-traffic artery.  I notice that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, speaking in the Seanad yesterday on the Town Planning Bill, stated: &ldquo;That whatever could be done to encourage and induce local authorities to use the powers of the Bill to the full for town planning and for improving <Col N="1747" /> their localties would be done.&rdquo;  In another part of his speech on the same occasion, the Minister said that &ldquo;the traffic problem in their larger cities was due to the uncontrolled growth of these areas in the past.  The need for proper planning was apparent on all sides, and local authorities would be well advised to have a plan prepared in their areas.&rdquo; Now I heartily agree with every word the Minister said, and I would like some Government departments to practice what the Vice-President preaches.  Now, apparently, Government buildings are exempt from control by the Corporation.  The City Manager was written to in the following terms:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;My Committee have had under consideration the post office which, it is understood, is about to be erected in St. Andrew Street, and are of opinion that if two or three post office vans are to be always in front of the building it will completely block the thoroughfare.  My Committee would be glad to see the ground plan of the building to ascertain if adequate provision has been made on the roadway for the accommodation of vehicles.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The reply to that was:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Your letter of the 29th has been forwarded by me to the City Manager.  In reply, I have to state that an extensive site in St. Andrew Street has been leased from the Corporation by the Agricultural Credit Corporation, but no plans for the new building have yet been lodged.  It is rumoured that the Post Office proposes taking portion of this site from the Agricultural Credit Corporation, but there is no civic control over what the Post Office may do.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now I suppose the reason for that is that the Post Office on town planning would be like Caesar's wife, above suspicion, and I suppose the Jost Office realise that putting up a very fine building in narrow, mean streets detracts from the building.  The Post Office authorities were written to in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;My Committee have had under <Col N="1748" /> consideration the proposed erection of a post office in St. Andrew Street, and would be glad to know if provision has been made to load and unload all vehicles inside the building, and if it will be possible for the ordinary public to stop a vehicle outside without completely blocking the thoroughfare.  It is only the extreme urgency of the traffic problem in this portion of the city that prompts my Committee to write to you in order that the post office may not exacerbate the existing congestion.  Could my Committee examine the plans?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, what did the Post Office say in reply to that?</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Adverting to your letter of the 29th ult., I am directed by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to inform you that the reconstruction of Nos. 19 and 24 St. Andrew Street, to which, no doubt, your Committee refers, is being carried out by the Agricultural Credit Corporation and not by this Department.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, one has to assume from that that the Agricultural Credit Corporation are putting up a building, and that the Post Office are merely going to blow into it when it is finished, and without any regard to whether it suits their requirements or not.  I should like to appeal to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to put his own house in order and to consider the provisions of the Town Planning Bill.  He is rebuilding, or becoming a tenant of a building in St. Andrew Street, in which he must have some considerable say, and there ought to be some provision made for the exigencies of the traffic that it will be required to bear.  Now, on the other side of the street is St. Andrew's Church.  I hope that when we appeal to the Minister and point out to him that there is not any room between the church and the post office, he will not tell the citizens that they had better take down the church.  I have brought this matter forward and dealt with it at some length, because I think that if Government departments are not going to set a headline in their regard for town planning and for the existing congestion in the centre of the city, we really have only wasted our time in passing this Town Planning Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1749" /> Passing from that, I should like to refer to another matter.  On the 13th March I addressed a question to the Minister about charges on German parcels posted to the Free State.  I will quote from the official records:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Mr. Dockrell asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (1) whether he is aware that parcels posted in Germany addressed to Irish Free State firms are subjected to London customs clearance charges made by a British firm acting as agents for the German parcel post; and (2) if he can make arrangements with the German Post Office authorities that only German and Irish transport and customs clearance charges shall be payable on parcels consigned to the Irish Free State.</P>
    <P>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Boland): Parcels posted in Germany can be forwarded either by the official Post Office service or by a semi-official service run conjointly by the German Post Office and certain private transport agencies in London.  Parcels forwarded by the official service are examined and charged at the Dublin customs centre only, but when the semi-official service is utilised the parcels are subject to customs examination and clearance charges both in London and Dublin.</P>
    <P>The service used is decided by the senders and is not a matter in which this Administration can interfere.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dockrell: Arising out of the answer, am I to understand that parcels forwarded by the official German Post Office are not subject to any forwarding charge in London?</P>
    <P>Mr. Boland: That is so, if sent through the Post Office and not through a private agency; they are not subject to any charge in London. It is a matter for the senders themselves which route they use.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister and I trotted back to my informant who had made the complaint to me, and I said to him: &ldquo;You are entirely wrong; the people you are getting your goods from are sending them by some semi-official agency.&rdquo;  The Minister courteously sent me a list of the charges made by <Col N="1750" /> both official and semi-official agencies. That was all right until, a few days ago, the party came in to me again and said: &ldquo;One story is very good till you hear another.  Here are all the documents that you require; here is a charge from the London, Midland and Scottish Company, and there is no doubt about that.&rdquo;  The next is a letter to a German firm:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dear Sirs,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With reference to your invoice of 27th February, the parcel has now been delivered.  Would you kindly let us know by what route you forwarded it.  We are charged 11 marks 40 for postage.  Was it sent by the official German parcel post?  If so, ought it to be delivered free, or should we have to pay anything on delivery?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here is the letter from the German firm:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have just received your letter of the 14th, contents of which I have duly noted.  The parcel, as per my invoice of February 27th, has been forwarded by the official German parcel post and ought to be delivered free.  I should be astonished if you had to pay anything on delivery, and, if so, you should request recompensation from your post office.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, I request recompensation.  I would ask the Minister to look into that matter, because he was most emphatic the last time in stating that that could not occur.  Will somebody have to go to London and watch the parcels post to see who is surreptitiously removing them from the official wagons?  I hope the Minister will deal with those few points when he is replying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of his statement, the Minister surveyed to some extent the business or commercial ramifications of the Post Office, and I want to say a word on behalf of the human material who make this service possible, and who render such comprehensive services to the community as a whole.  The Minister dealt with very few staff matters: in fact, I do not think he dealt with any real staff matter during the course of his statement, <Col N="1751" /> and I would suggest to him that, in future, when these statements are being compiled by the Minister, he ought to try to get into them for dissemination in this House some expression of opinion as to the conditions under which his staff work.  He might usefully tell the House some of the things he proposes to do for the human material who make this service possible rather than to content himself with these mere mechanical things which some people think are the beginning and end of the whole Post Office service.</P>
      <P>I thought, for instance, that we would have heard the Minister say something on the question of this scandal of part-time labour in the Post Office.  I raised this matter last year on this Estimate, and told the Minister of the fact that his Department employs 2,500 people who work on an average not more than 30 hours per week, and I told the Minister that his Department employs another 1,100 persons who work in the Post Office for not more than 18 hours per week, and I suggested to the Minister then that it ought not to be beyond human ingenuity to devise a scheme by which it would be possible to organise the Post Office service on the basis of full time employment for all employees, instead of condemning 3,600 people to work at rates of wages which I am sure the Minister will be compelled to admit are absolutely scandalously low.  That problem still remains.  The Minister last year expressed sympathy with the object which I sought to achieve by raising the matter on the Estimate, but, in the meantime, very little has been done by the Minister's Department to grapple with that serious problem, and to end what the Minister must admit is a very serious blot on the whole Post Office administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here, in Dublin, the position is absolutely deplorable in that respect. The Department in Dublin takes on people for three hours per day.  They are recruited through the labour exchanges and for these three hours' work per day, the Department pays these people the magnificent sum of 14/8 per week.  What is the 14/8 <Col N="1752" /> intended to cover for that person?  The Minister knows perfectly well that it is hard for a person who is available to give service at all hours of the day and night to obtain employment, and much more difficult for a person employed part-time to obtain any other outside employment to supplement his earnings.  As proof of the fact that he cannot obtain that outside employment, I think the Minister will find, if he questions the people who are employed by his Department on the basis of three hours per day, that none of them has any outside employment whatever, the result being that the Post Office Department, a State Department, pays these people the magnificent sum of 14/8 per week, and many of them have got to keep themselves, their wives and children, and pay fancy rents in the City of Dublin on that miserably low wage.  That rate of wages cannot be justified, and it strikes me as something amazing that in a Department whose financial ramifications can be indicated by the fact that this Estimate is for £2,100,217, cannot organise these services in such a way as to extend the hours of employment of these people in Dublin and throughout the country so as to give them full employment at decent rates of wages, instead of compelling them to work for the miserable rate of wages they are receiving to-day.</P>
    <P>The policy of the Minister's Department is shown in rather a curious light when it is remembered that if these people were in receipt of unemployment assistance, under the new Unemployment Assistance Act, they would be able to obtain in Dublin a maximum of £1 per week.  The Minister, however, employs them, and pays them 14/8 per week and thus, as can be seen, while the Department of Industry and Commerce would cause them to be paid £1 per week if they were unemployed, when they are employed for 18 hours per week the Minister's Department gives them only 14/8 per week, and prevents them from getting the £1 they would ordinarily get if they were not employed at these miserable rates by the Minister's Department.  I am sure the Minister is personally sympathetic in this matter.  But it ought to be <Col N="1753" /> dealt with speedily, because the whole thing is a scandal.  It would be bad enough if a private employer were exploiting people on this basis; but it is a million times worse when the State employs men and pays them 14/8 a week and expects them to lead a Christian existence in a civilised country on such a miserably low rate of wages.  The Minister indicated that the work on the new sorting office in Dublin had commenced.  I wonder what commenced means.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There was an employee in the Minister's Department who was frequently late, and when he was asked for an explanation he said his wife was ill and the alarm clock in the bedroom kept her from sleeping and consequently he had to put it down at the bottom of the stairs.  He was asked what steps he proposed to take to prevent a recurrence of his late attendances and he explained that he proposed to move the clock up one step. I wonder is this the way the sorting office is going to be built?  Are the Department really determined to erect a central sorting office in the shortest possible space of time?  The disused distillery that they are using in Pearse Street is absolutely unsuitable and is an insanitary building.  It has done service for the last 12 years.  I think the Minister has been in the building and I am sure he will have no hesitation in admitting that the worst workhouse in the country is a palace when compared with the place that is now used as a central sorting office.  The roof leaks; it is impossible to clean the walls because of the manner in which the place was constructed, and the whole building is a receptacle for dust and dirt.  Consequently, it is very unhealthy for the staff who have to work there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may say the Post Office Department does not build and that this is purely a matter for the Board of Works.  Of course, that is true, but I think the Minister has a perfectly good case for urging the Board of Works to erect this office in the shortest possible time.  If he will only <Col N="1754" /> do that I am certain he will feel satisfied that he is providing a better place as a central sorting office, that he is making it possible for the staff to perform their work more efficiently and more expeditiously and that at the same time he is contributing some solution to the unemployment problem in the city.  There is another matter which concerns the staff of the Waterford Post Office.  For the past quarter of a century the Waterford Post Office staff have suffered the gravest injustice by reason of the grading of the office.  The Minister is probably familiar with the fact that the outdoor staff in Waterford is graded the same as, for instance, the staff in Belmullet or in Binghamstown, outside Belmullet.  A postman in the Waterford district is, so to speak, in the same grade as a postman in the Aran Islands.  The Waterford Post Office is graded in the lowest postal classification and I think the Minister will agree that that is an evil which ought to be immediately removed.  For the bulk of the time the British administration were responsible.  They pleaded the war as an excuse and gave that as the reason why the adjustment of the claim made by the Waterford staff should be further delayed.  Then the last Government put the matter on the long finger.  Prominent members of the Minister's Party were, at that time, crying out loudly against the injustice of the absurdly low classification given to the Waterford Post Office.</P>
    <P>This Government has been in office for two years and nobody can be accused of fussiness if the Minister is now asked to do for the Waterford Post Office what prominent members of his own Party urged should be done by the last Government.  I think the Minister is already familiar with the matter and I can hardly imagine he is unsympathetic with the claim of the staff down there.  The Waterford staff, having waited two years under this Government and 23 years under other Governments, cannot now be accused of any impetuosity if they ask to be properly graded and have their post office, raised to a level comparable with the importance of the City of Waterford <Col N="1755" /> in the domestic and national life of the South of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Two years ago on the Post Office Estimate I raised the question of the continuance by the Post Office of the mediaeval practice of delivering postcards on Christmas Day, bringing the staff on duty at an early hour and keeping them until late at night delivering Christmas postcards which, if the Post Office so desired, could be delivered long before Christmas.  Senator Connolly, when he was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, expressed himself as sympathetic with the claim then put forward, and I think he indicated that he would do his best to restrict, if not completely abolish, postal services on Christmas Day, so as to enable the staff to spend that day with their families.  That was two years ago, but nothing has since been done.  Possibly the Minister will tell us that the Post Office authorities are keen on maintaining the old-time sentiment of delivering Christmas cards on Christmas Day.  I wonder what kind of thrill the Minister would get if he were to leave a post office at 7 o'clock on a snowy Christmas morning, take out a bicycle long past its period of service, and cycle 28 miles.  I imagine if he did that there would be very little sentiment left in him after his 28 miles spin, particularly if he had to cycle over hilly, mountainous country, or along the western seaboard, as many of these men have to do, delivering postcards on Christmas Day.</P>
    <P>As I have stated, this work could be done earlier and, indeed, it would not matter much if those cards were not delivered until afterwards.  There are some persons in the secretary's office who, no doubt, are opposed to delaying the Christmas Day deliveries, but if they had to do the work themselves I venture to say there would be less enthusiasm over this sentimental idea of delivering on Christmas Day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to know from the Minister what he intends to do.  I suppose the hoary old argument advanced for the last 50 or 100 years will be trotted out on this occasion also.  The Minister will probably tell us that the Post Office cannot induce the public to post early and to post in time so as to avoid the necessity of delivering letters on Christmas Day. That excuse has done service for a long time, but I do not believe that excuse.  I believe if the public are told to post letters in time that the public will quickly adjust themselves to the changed service.  At one time the Post Office used to say that it was absolutely necessary to have letters delivered on Sunday.  The public wanted Sunday deliveries, and how dare anybody curtail the right of the public to have letters delivered to them on Sunday?  But, during the war, the British found it highly desirable, in the interests of prosecuting the war, to abolish deliveries on Sunday.  The abolition of Sunday deliveries took place and there has been no chaos so far as the Post Office is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been no national disorder because of the abolition of deliveries on Sunday, and there has not been the slightest difference so far as the Post Office is concerned except giving the staff the benefit of being off duty on that day.  At one time the Post Office had seven deliveries a day in Dublin; now there are three deliveries a day, and I do not notice that the citizens of Dublin are any worse off now than they were then.  They adjusted themselves to the change once the Department made up its mind to make the change. At one time the Post Office used to send out people delivering letters at 10 o'clock at night in Dublin, now the latest delivery is 3.30 o'clock.  At that time if you suggested to the Post Office that there was no need for deliveries after 6 o'clock or after 10 o'clock at <Col N="1757" /> night they would tell you that you were becoming very revolutionary in your ideas.  There is a lot of nonsense talked by the Post Office administration in urging that the public would not adjust themselves to the change once the changes were made.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy consults the public he will find that the deliveries have nothing to do with the question of the telephone service.  The defence of the Minister is that he cannot induce the public to post early. What real effort has been made to induce the public to post early?  He <Col N="1758" /> says to the public: &ldquo;In order to ensure delivery in time for Christmas Day you must post at such and such a time,&rdquo; and while he blazoned that forth in notices on the pillar boxes at the same time his Department indicates by its actions that it does not matter whether the public posts early or not, that the Post Office will make sure that these letters will be delivered whether posted early or late.  Supposing the Great Southern Railway put up a notice to-morrow and announced that the 9.30 train would leave at 8.30 o'clock and that at the same time they whispered to all potential passengers &ldquo;do not bother about that train leaving at 8.30; it will not leave until 9.30&rdquo;, is it not obvious that the bulk of the passengers would be there at 9.25 because there would be no penalty for turning up at 9.25 and they knew that it was quite all right to get there at that time?  If the Minister can only make up his mind to urge the public to post early and at the same time to indicate that this is being done so as to enable the Post Office staff to spend Christmas Day with their families&mdash;and they are entitled to spend Christmas Day with their families&mdash;then I venture to say that the public will accommodate themselves to the necessity of making that beneficial change on Christmas Day.</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister recently for some information as to the number of unestablished skilled workmen employed in the engineering section of his Department and received some information which discloses that there were close on 200 acting as unestablished skilled workmen in the engineering section of the Post Office. A very large number of these people should long since have been promoted to established posts.  The Minister is keeping them in their present position, paying them low rates of wages and depriving them of the privileges and rights to which they would be entitled if they were established officers, Nothing has been done except perhaps in a very small way by the Minister's Department to promote these people to the established status.  Many of <Col N="1759" /> them were entitled to be promoted years ago.  I would like to hear from the Minister what he proposes to do in the way of conferring established status upon these 200 officers and thus enable them to enjoy the rights which are overdue to them&mdash;rights to which they are entitled if the normal method of promoting these people still continues. Various efforts have been made to secure an adjustment of that matter.  I hope the Minister, when he is replying, will indicate that he will take a personal interest in these cases with a view to making sure that the matter is put right at the earliest opportunity.  That part of the staff has suffered very long and endured much hardship because of the failure to adjust this matter.  I hope the Minister will see justice done without further delay.</P>
      <P>There is another matter which I want to raise on behalf of the staff employed in the Stores Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  In that Department there are large numbers of manipulative employees who work longer hours than the staff in the rest of the Post Office service.  A claim for a reduction in their hours of service was made to the Minister over 12 months ago.  So far it has not been possible to get a favourable decision from the Minister.  I would like if the Minister for Industry and Commerce would just whisper a few words into the ears of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs on that subject.  I say that because I observed recently that the Minister for Industry and Commerce went to Trinity College&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and spoke to the Wolfe Tone Cumann of the Fianna Fáil Party there.  He quite rightly, and in a most enlightened way, told the members of the Cumann that we would probably have to reduce working hours in this country in order to grapple with those problems which other administrations had found could only be grappled with effectively by a reduction in working hours.  I am just an humble follower of the Minister in that respect.  I suggest to the Minister that that is one <Col N="1760" /> remedy that should be employed in dealing with the staff in the Stores Department of the Post Office.  All I am asking the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to do is to take the advice on that matter of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and to reduce the hours of the staff in the Stores Department to the normal level which obtains in other sections of the Post Office.  At present the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs employs a number of girls in the Stores Department, and they work from eight in the morning until a quarter to six in the evening.  Many of these girls leave home at seven o'clock in the morning in order to get there, and they cannot have a meal until one o'clock in the day.  Many of them fast from seven in the morning until one o'clock.  I suggest to the Minister that that is a state of affairs that should not be allowed to continue, and that some effort ought to be made to have that matter decided, and decided favourably, at the earliest possible opportunity. These are some of the matters which I desired to raise on behalf of the staff, and I hope the Minister, when replying, will indicate that he is going to give favourable consideration to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a nice, mild speech from Deputy Norton.  Since he wrapped the green flag round him recently and started on the <i>turus</i> to the Republic, I suppose he has to be very respectful when speaking to members of the Republican Government, or they might pull the green flag off him. As usual, it was a long discussion of the conditions under which the employees of the Post Office were working, and, of course, there is no one more competent to discuss that matter than the Deputy.  There seemed to be very few suggestions, however, for any improvement in the service.  I am particularly concerned with the postal service from the point of view of the rural dweller. I understand that it is the policy of the Post Office to promote the use of telephones in all areas.  The present situation is that the charges for trunk calls in rural areas are anachronistic and, in many cases, excessive.  I want to urge on the Minister the desirability of establishing some uniform system of <Col N="1761" /> rates in the country and of materially reducing them.  I know that, at first, that would result in a shrinkage of revenue, but I have not the slightest doubt that in time it would result in a permanent and very substantial increase of revenue.  My suggestion is this, that some system should be evolved whereby a rural subscriber could make a call within the county where he was resident for, say, 3d., and that he could make a call within the province where he was resident for, say, 6d., and a trunk call to any part of the country for 1/-.  It is true that there would be some discontent immediately where that meant an increase in the existing rates for a few subscribers. No matter what you do by way of reform, it will be impossible to please everybody, but I have not the slightest doubt that it would enormously stimulate the use of telephones if people knew that they could ring up, say, anybody in the County Roscommon for 3d., and that they had not to inquire as to whether it cost 5d. or 6d. or 7¼d. to call up Strokestown or Elphin, or wherever the place might be.  In addition to that, people would use the telephone for trunk calls more generally if they knew that the maximum charge was 1/-.</P>
      <P>It is not the expense of connecting up the individual call that justifies the charges that are made.  It is the maintenance of the system to accommodate such calls when they come along that justifies the heavy charge, or that has been used to justify it, over a long distance. It would be much more advantageous to the Post Office if they could get a dozen calls linked up from Donegal town to Cork, at 1/- apiece, in a day than it would be to have one call at 3/9.  I recognise that if the demand for this accommodation was sufficiently stimulated it might become necessary to provide additional lines, and that would involve additional capital expenditure, but there is a long way to go before the existing accommodation is taxed, and it is not being taxed because the charges are too high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that it is also the Department's policy to supplant the telegraph system with the telephone. They are rather anxious to see the telegraph system dwindle away and die. <Col N="1762" /> There can be little doubt that they are right about that, but the sooner it dwindles out the better.  At present it represents a very considerable annual liability.  It would help to do away with the telegraph if the use of the telephone were promoted along the lines I suggest.  There is one danger to be avoided, however, and that is, reducing the telephone rates by 5 or 6 per cent., because that will only lose you revenue and will not increase custom in the very least degree.  Unless there are uniform rates to attract customers, unless there are cheap rates to make the telephone an economic competitor with letters and with the telegraph, and unless there is a brisk advertising campaign to draw the attention of the public to the new advantages that are being offered by the telephone system, the objects I have in mind will not be achieved.  So that the situation with regard to the telephone, I submit to the Minister, is one for drastic action or <i>laissez faire.</i> There is no use taking halfpence and pence off rates, because that will attract nobody.</P>
    <P>There is another detail to which I want to refer in the event of the Minister lacking the courage to adopt the telephone policy I have suggested to him, and that is the very onerous charges imposed on people living in rural areas to whom telegrams are addressed.  In the vast majority of cases, telegrams are addressed to residents in rural areas only in cases of emergency, and it is not uncommon to have a 1/- telegram surcharged 1/6, and frequently even more, for delivery to the addressee.</P>
    <P>That is a very great hardship.  In districts where the post office would be five or six miles from the address the delivery charge might rise to as high as 2/6.  If it is the intention of the Minister to adopt a bold policy in the matter of telephones, I do not think the point about delivery charges for telegrams is one of great importance. If it is not the intention of the Minister to adopt a bold line with regard to telephones, then the matter of delivery charges for telegrams is of great importance and should be looked to without delay.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1763" /> There is another detail of rural postal facilities to which the Minister's attention may not have been drawn. I do not know if he is aware at the present time a great deal of newspaper distribution in this country is done by the rural postmen, and I believe it is an irregular activity.  Postmen in consideration of an annual tip&mdash;which, by the way, Deputy Norton should remember they frequently get on Christmas Day when they are making this slavish delivery to which he referred&mdash;carry newspapers out along their run and drop them at the gates or doors of the people who ask them to oblige them in that way.  There is a great deal of talk in this country, and indeed in every country, about making the country more attractive for people and dissuading rural dwellers from coming to live in the cities.  One of the best ways to do that is to provide them with as many urban amenities as you can.  Now, the daily paper is an urban amenity to which country people attach very great importance.</P>
    <P>Can the Post Office not devise a scheme to regularise this system of newspaper distribution?  It is not reasonable to ask country people to pay one penny on every copy of a newspaper they get.  Would it not be possible to make some arrangements whereby the rural postmen might be allowed for a consideration to distribute newspapers along their own lines of communication?  Deputy Norton often protests against the very low scales of wages paid to rural postmen. I sympathise with him in that.  I think the scale of wages paid to rural post office employees, in almost every branch of the service, are frightfully low.  Could not the temporary postmen be allowed to supplement their earnings by delivering newspapers, either as the servants of the Post Office or as independent contractors? The Minister will perhaps tell us whether the Post Office authorities would have any objection to a postman taking a consideration for acting as a distributor of newspapers while distribution letters on his rounds.  If any such objection exists, I think it ought to be removed and the practice ought <Col N="1764" /> to be regularised and recognised by the Post Office.  I can see no objection to it, and I think it might provide a very slight additional source of revenue for temporary postmen.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in connection with temporary postmen that I want to raise.  I think the present system of appointing temporary postmen is very bad, and probably, if the truth were told, the Minister also thinks it is.  The existing system is that the Minister has to appoint every temporary postman in this country himself.  At first, I have no doubt, it looked a very attractive proposition.</P>

This deplorable consequence has flown from the system also, that where you had 12 clamorous Fianna Fáil postulants the unfortunate United Ireland Party candidate had no chance at all.</P>

I do think, however, that as between the clamorous Fianna Fáil horde who come shouting for every temporary postmanship that becomes vacant there ought to be a preference shown to married men.  I think it is wrong, where you have eligible candidates, who have family responsibilities, and to whom the salary of a temporary postman would be of material assistance, to give the job to a young man, who has no responsibilities of a family character, simply because he is an active supporter of the Party.  I am sufficiently solicitous for the married dupes of the Fianna Fáil Party to suggest to the Minister that the consequences of their folly should be tempered by his benevolence, and that where he has to choose between an unmarried and a married dupe he should choose the married dupe whenever possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a sub-head in these Estimates which is engaging the attention of all patriotic Gaels in Ireland, the vindication of the justice of the appellation &ldquo;Perfidious Albion.&rdquo; England has actually defaulted on something that she owes the Minister and, to the horror and dismay of the Minister, the Irish taxpayer is going to be called upon to put his hand in his pocket and foot the bill.  Under sub-head P. the Minister is going to extort £49,583 from the Irish taxpayer to finance the consequences of the British Government's default.  Why can we not start another economic war about it?  Is there no front upon which the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs can strike a blow?  Why not announce that in future we will send no letters through Great Britain at all and conduct all our future correspondence with the world at large through America or Estoril or Calais?  I really think that this offers a very special <Col N="1766" /> occasion, and it offers a very commodious platform on which Deputy Norton would be only too glad to lend a hand.  He came out last week and said that at last he was going to declare his position and that the Irish Labour Party were marching with their heads erect straight towards a Republic.

      <P>I should like to commend the Minister on the short speech he made in introducing this Estimate, but I am afraid that he carried his desire <Col N="1768" /> for brevity a little too far.  I should have liked a little more information. For years we have been clamouring for reduction in the telephone trunk rates. Like Deputy Dillon, I feel that if we could get the relative rates within a more reasonable figure we would have the trunk lines more largely used than they are at the present time.  The Minister has spoken about the extension of the telephone&mdash;his predecessors in office referred to the same matter in previous years&mdash;but he has not told us the number of additional exchanges that were opened during the last 12 months or, say, during the last two years, particularly in some of the rural areas, where the telephones are scanty at the moment.  We suffer in my constituency not alone from the paucity of the exchanges, but also from the narrow limit of those exchanges.  It will be remembered that in Rathmines and Terenure there were a large number of applicants for telephones a couple of years ago, and five, six, or even nine months elapsed in many cases before those applicants could get the advantage of the telephone.  I should like to know how many of those are still unsatisfied in those particular areas.  There is a further question I should like to ask, and that is whether the trunk lines have been extended in any case.  We were told in the past that those extensions would be made. Deputy Dockrell has referred to the delays that occurred in connections on the trunk lines.  I know some of them on which there have been delays of four or five hours.  What has been done towards extending those trunk lines or multiplying them?  Those are questions on which we should like some information. If we turn to another part of the service, and deal with the postal aspect, we should be glad to know whether the profit on that portion of the service has been increased during the last twelve months, or whether the profit has fallen off.</P>

The profits from the postal service should not be taken to bolster up the telegraphic service, nor, on the other hand, should the profits from the telephone service be taken to meet the deficit on the telegraphic service.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Then we cannot urge the argument with the same force.  There is an important detail, although a small one, to which I should like to refer. The installation charges for telephones seem to be standardised.  Even if there is only a transfer made in the instrument it seems to be a standard thing to charge something like £3 for the installation. That is a matter, I think, that might have the attention of the Minister, and if he has to charge £3 it should be represented by some work. Another matter to which I should like to draw the attention of the Minister is the telephone charges as a whole.  If he could see his way to effect a reduction in those charges I think it would mean a large increase in the number <Col N="1770" /> of telephone subscribers.  I have urged that view for two or three years past, but on account of the difficulty with exchanges and other matters of that kind the Minister was unable to see his way to adopt it.  I should like him to consider now whether he can see his way to do something in that direction in the future.  Those are matters which I should like the Minister to attend to in his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few matters which I should like to mention. Like Deputy Dillon, I want to draw the attention of the Minister to the rural dwellers, and to the services they are having from the Post Office.  Personally, I regard the Post Office in all its services as something which ought to give uniform service to all citizens, and I do not agree with Deputy Good's point of view that if there is a loss upon one service it ought not to be borne by the other.  I do not see why it should not, as far as letters, telegrams and telephones are concerned.  I called attention previously to the delivery of telegrams in rural districts.  It is manifestly unfair that people in these districts should be charged for the delivery of telegrams.  I have no doubt, as far as the delivery of letters is concerned, that if that service was taken by itself it would be found there was a loss in these districts.  Yet, letters are delivered free, just as in the towns. When it comes to the delivery of telegrams we are charged at the rate of 6d. per mile beyond a certain distance. People living four miles from the office have to pay 2/-.  That is unfair, seeing that telegrams are sent to them by other people, perhaps on urgent business. Every time I receive a telegram it costs me 1/6, and I get quite a number of them.  We should have equality of service in that respect.  There is no reason why the loss sustained on the telegraphic service generally should be shifted on to those in the rural districts, any more than the loss sustained, in some form, by the delivery of letters in these districts should be placed on them.  I thought when the Minister, who is a colleague of mine in my constituency, was appointed we would have some change in the arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On looking through the Estimates I <Col N="1771" /> find that the rural districts are going to be hit.  While expenditure at headquarters and in metropolitan offices is increased by £2,296, there is a decrease of £11,150 in the amount for provincial offices.  I have not gone through the Estimates fully, but I think there is a big reduction in the amount provided for the conveyance of mails by road.  Apparently the Minister hopes that the contractors in rural districts will be paid less for that work in future.  There is also a big reduction for uniforms as it applies to inspectors, postmen, cleaners and messengers.  In provincial districts there are 5,079 of these officials, as against 1,128 in metropolitan offices.  In that way it appears the Minister is going to inflict a certain amount of hardship on those in the provinces.  If there is any justification for that I would like to hear the Minister say in what way he expects to make these savings.  The Minister told us that there was a profit of a certain amount on the Post Office generally, but that it was something less than last year.  I am interested to know if the Minister has in contemplation a development of the telephone services, to which Deputy Dillon referred, or if the telegraph service, particularly in rural districts, is to be maintained, or to be supplanted by something else.  I do not see how the telephone service can be extended with any satisfaction in the rural districts. If it cannot be done there should be, at any rate, some levelling up of the charges.  I do not regard this Estimate as satisfactory, seeing that whatever cuts are to be made are to apply largely in provincial areas, while there is to be increased expenditure in the metropolitan area.  I ask the Minister to consider the position of rural dwellers, especially in regard to telegrams and telephones.  I am sure the Minister, seeing that he represents a rural constituency, is interested in the people of these districts, and that whatever difficulties there are in his way will be found not to be insurmountable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the difficulty the Minister and the <Col N="1772" /> Government are placed in in the matter of the post, telegraph and telephone services.  The question worrying governments in every country, since they took over responsibility for these services, is whether they should or should not be dealt with as social services, as necessary to the citizens as education and other services.  While avoiding expressing an opinion on the matter, I would like to join issue with Deputy Brennan in the matter of having equal services for everybody. Are these services to be social services, given more or less freely, or are they to be paid for?  Deputy Brennan on his way home travels a certain distance from the central telegraph office, and I am sure he has to pay a certain rate per mile for a motor car. That is one way of facing this problem. On the other side, where you have towns or cities, my contention is that they make most of the payments for all the services provided.  I do not want to discuss now whether each service should stand on its own legs or whether the State should take full responsibility for the services generally. I would like to impress on the Minister the necessity for pressing forward with an extension of the telephone services in the metropolitan area, especially in the suburbs.  Deputy Good and myself raise a hardy annual on this Vote dealing with Rathmines post office and telephone exchange, to ascertain when it will be available for the public.  We have nearly always got the same answer, that the work is on hands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that we were told that by the Party of which I am a member, when it formed the Government. I am very glad that we have now definite information as to when the extended service will be available. Another matter to which I wish to refer is of some importance and it abuts somewhat on Deputy Norton's speech. It is not a question of the delivery of letters on Christmas Day but it is a question as to service by the Post Office.  I think that the Minister should consider the desirability of <Col N="1773" /> having available for country towns a later telephone service than 7 o'clock or 8 o'clock in the evening, and that he should also consider the desirability of extending the facilities for telephonic communication with these towns on Sundays.  I am sure that even Deputy Norton would not object to a telephone operator having to work a few extra hours on Sunday if that operator were sufficiently remunerated for his services.  Communication by telephone and even by telegraph with the country on week evenings and on Sundays could be very much improved. I do not suggest that the Minister should incur the enormous expenditure which must have been incurred in the days when these services were a twenty-four-hour-day and seven-day-a-week services, but the Department would be well advised to extend, even for two hours, the time during which one can communicate with the country towns in the evening and on Sundays. The question referred to by Deputy Norton as to whether letters should or should not be delivered on Christmas Day is merely one of colouring.  The joke about the 9.30 train leaving at 8.30 is only a little attempt at colouring which Deputy Norton wants to put over his new republican flag.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasKelly" hpid="Mr. T. Kelly Mr. T. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is to be congratulated on his statement concerning the working of the great Department of which he is the head. I think that he has sufficiently vindicated his character as a good administrator. The only criticism I have heard this evening worthy of answer was that by Deputy Norton regarding the smallness of the wage earned by temporary postmen.  The matter to which I propose to refer is not one for which the Minister is responsible, nor do I believe that any of his predecessors were responsible for it.  It is a question as to the erection on the streets of Dublin of telephone boxes. It might be said that that is not a matter on which the time of the House should be wasted.  I would not take up the time of the House if I could have got satisfaction elsewhere.  It would be natural to assume that those in charge of the streets of Dublin would be the Municipal Corporation. <Col N="1774" /> But that is not so.  I raised a question there as to who was responsible for these constructions.  The City Manager told me that long ago, when the Commissioners were in charge, a great confab took place with certain officers of the postal department as to the erection of these boxes.  That was during the Commissioner's reign.  The location of these boxes was settled and the City Manager was not responsible, nor could he give me any information as to who was responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first of these structures I saw raising itself was at the end of O'Connell Street, quite close to the Rotunda.  On its first appearance, I could not understand what it was for. Eventually it developed into the structure we all know now and some of us even admire.  At first I thought that it was a receptacle for the tools of workmen when going home from work. Eventually, it developed into a telephone box.  I was told that great care was taken that the material used in these structures should be of Irish manufacture but I find that they are made of concrete.  I presume that cement was not specially made in this country for them, because there has been no cement made here for the last ten years.  If that is the best that Ireland can do in the way of telephone boxes, then Ireland ought to give it up. So far as I can judge, these are now to be permanent structures.  The Minister has stated that he has arranged for 50 more of them to be placed in Dublin and elsewhere.  The paths in the City of Dublin belong to the citizens and the comfort and convenience of pedestrians should be consulted. If structures are to be placed on the street, they ought not to be eyesores. These telephone boxes are part of a commercial enterprise.  I tried to get some information as to their usefulness in connection with fire calls or calls for the ambulance service.  No record could be traced in the fire brigade station of any calls received from these boxes.  Therefore, we must assume that they are intended for public utility and commercial purposes. I have looked into them frequently to see if anybody was inside.  When I found any of them occupied it was generally by a young lady who was <Col N="1775" /> probably arranging a &ldquo;date.&rdquo;  I am told that, during the racing season, at about five minutes to three o'clock, they are much in evidence for men who want to get on what is known as &ldquo;S.P.&rdquo;  They can arrange for &ldquo;S.P.&rdquo; at three or four minutes to three o'clock and the race is at three o'clock.  They are paid the starting price at three minutes after three, so that it is a very quick result.  When I was approached by citizens some time ago, I suggested that probably the usefulness of these boxes might be extended.  So very few men are now found on the streets of Dublin in an inebriated state late at night that, instead of the policeman taking them home to their wives and having the trouble of finding where they live, he should have them locked up in these boxes.</P>
    <P>That is all very fine but this is the capital city of Ireland, and no order, or anything else, can interfere with that.  I submit that any construction placed on the streets here ought to be one that would not prove to be an eyesore.  Of course this question would not be brought up here at all if the members of the Municipal Council had any power in their own city; but they have not.  It is strange that although we have had the Corporation restored in the last few years, and that men take the trouble of getting elected to that body by the citizens, from time to time, we have no power.  The fact that these buildings can be set up by the Government or the Electricity Supply Board, or by other people, without any reference to the Municipal Council, or any authority from them, is a grievance that ought to be ventilated here because the Government should be at least concerned with the dignity and the prestige of this city. It is not too much to ask that the Municipality ought to have power to deal with these matters.  They ought to have a voice in connection with such things erected in the streets of Dublin. Some of these erections were painted blue, but that colour seems to have faded off them.  Others are painted green; the green holds a little better. <Col N="1776" /> One of these erections at the corner of York Street is painted yellow.  How far that will stand I do not know. Compare with these things the very beautiful interior of the Post Office in O'Connell Street; it is a magnificent interior and does credit to the brain and the ability of whoever, in the postal service, planned it.  When we take the other specimens of workmanship and design, how can one conceive the same minds concerned with the erection of such things in our streets?</P>
    <P>O'Connell Street is justly regarded by Irishmen as the principal street in this country.  I was in O'Connell Street on St. Patrick's Day.  It was not a very pleasant day.  There were cold, heavy showers, and the atmosphere was gloomy.  The tramway poles were not painted, I suppose, for the last twelve months, and then we had these new erections in the street, some painted and some not, and they did not enhance its appearance.  There was a football match on, and crowds came up from Cork.  Some of them were wearing green and white ribbons and tall hats, and they were singing as they moved along the street &ldquo;Marching through Georgia.&rdquo;  I wonder how many of these visitors went back, and how many remained and are now installed in jobs?  It is well known to every Deputy here that some years ago there was a Deputy representing Cork in this Assembly who proved to be another Moses to his people, because he led them up here to the promised land, and here they remained.  Few have returned to Cork since.  The provincial mind operates very greatly in this city, and even a Dublin man has not much chance in this Assembly.  I do not think there is more than half-a-dozen of us here so far as I know.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is a Dublin man, but he represents a country constituency, and I do not think he can serve two masters well in that respect.  The question is, which is his real love&mdash;Roscommon or Dublin?  If Dublin is his real love, he will remove these boxes that I am complaining about; if it is Roscommon he will let them remain.  They have one merit, and it is this.  As they are going to remain they might be made unique <Col N="1777" /> in this way: The tops are flat, and we might try the experiment of having busts made in plaster&mdash;they need not be in marble&mdash;of some well-known people placed on them.  Possibly you might try my effigy on one of them. You would get it made for £1 or 25/-, and it could be put on top of one of these erections in O'Connell Street.  If it remained there and received civil treatment and no observations were written under it after it was there for a long time, you might extend that operation.  Then there might be some justification for these boxes.  It would be an unique exhibition in that it would show representations of living men, instead of waiting until a man was dead to exhibit his bust.  Then, you would be able to point out to tourists busts of living men that were erected out of the bounty of the citizens.  I recommend that to the Minister, though I do not think he will adopt it.  I was struck by Deputy Dockrell's remarks concerning St. Andrew Street and Trinity Street and the new post office.  He talked about having the post office vans there, but at present it is used as a public parking station.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not; I have no motor car, and never had.  I am sure the same space would only be occupied by these post office vans which are so tormenting to the Deputy.  There is no necessity to insist upon that point.  The street will be wide enough.  The Corporation made efforts, from time to time, to try to bring about some arrangement of street planning that we hear so much about.  They made an effort to widen the corner of St. Andrew Street and Trinity Street, but they failed, because the men who owned the property there wanted too much money.  How that difficulty will ever be got over in connection with street planning I do not know.  For two years negotiations were carried on in order to have that corner widened.  And if that street is now in the position that traffic gets more or less congested, there is another reason for that. Trinity Street is a small street with an incline in it.  It used to be paved with ordinary sets, and these were very useful, <Col N="1778" /> because of the constant and continued horse traffic there.  Now horse traffic has not ceased in Dublin, nor is there much sign of its ceasing.  On the contrary, it is increasing, so far as I can judge.  Horses, especially on a frosty day or a day when the roads are slippery, if the lorries or drays are heavily loaded, have a hard job to get up that incline, and they frequently fall.  If the Commissioners had left the sets there instead of plastering the road over with concrete, the difficulties of congestion would not have arisen.  I have nothing further to say.  Probably I have said too much, but, having delivered myself of the grievance I feel as a Dublinman, I hope that the Minister will take cognisance of what I have said.  If his future fifty erections are going to be like what he has already erected, I beg him not to put them there.</P>

      <P>I am only interested on this Vote in the manner in which the appointments of rural postmen are made.  I have a certain amount of sympathy with the Minister, seeing the number of applicants there are for these vacancies.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce stated here some time ago that it was on merit these men were appointed, but I do not agree at all with that.  Perhaps I would put it in another way by saying that I would like to know what the Minister for Industry and Commerce means by merit.  Is the man to be appointed a man who has made the greatest number of attempts at breaking up Fine Gael meetings?  Is that one of the qualifications, or is that the merit of which the Minister speaks?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe myself that it is one of them.  The Minister has, however, rid himself of a great deal of that.  I have seen down the country an instance which suggests that probably in order to avoid the big number of applicants amongst loyal Fianna Fáil supporters, or in order to please all or please none, the appointee must be a man who is a relation or a cousin of a Fianna Fáil Deputy.  I raised here on 22nd March the question of the appointment of a postman in <Col N="1779" /> County Galway.  I did not intend to raise the matter again, were it not for the fact that I was not satisfied at all with the answer given to me.  I raised the question of the appointment of a postman in the Kilsallagh postal district, County Galway.  There were eight applicants for the position.  One of these applicants was a part-time official who had 15 years' service, and was 32 years of age.  He had been a part-time official for 15 years at a very small salary, as the Labour Deputies know.  He was the sole support of a widowed mother, and until four years ago the valuation of his holding was 1/-.  His valuation now is £3 14s.  He was a fluent Irish speaker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in answer to one of my supplementary questions, said that Irish was not necessary for this particular position, and that he was not aware that Kilsallagh was in the Gaeltacht.  There is one thing, however, of which I am sure, and that is that for housing purposes, Kilsallagh is in the Gaeltacht area.  I am also aware that there is a great number of fluent Irish speakers in that particular district.  There was another applicant who was, I believe, a great supporter of the Fianna Fáil Party, and who had eight or ten years' service.  His father resigned from the position previously. That man was also ruled out as not being fit to take up this particular position.  The man who got the position was a man with 24 or 25 acres of land, having a valuation of £14, and he never carried a postbag in his life.  I ask the Minister if that state of affairs is going to continue, what will the service come to?  What are the temporary postmen, who are paid from 8/- to 10/- a week, to look forward to? These men are certainly looking forward to promotion some day or another.  Will you have a good service while you have men like these turned down&mdash;one with 15 years' service and a valuation of £3 14s., the sole support of his mother, and another who had given ten years' service, while his father had given his life to it?  Will you get good service if men like these who have splendid characters in the postal service, not a black mark <Col N="1780" /> against them during their service, are turned down?  I am speaking on behalf of the two of them.  If that state of affairs is going to continue, can you expect good service?  I say it is not fair.  You cannot expect good service where, after turning down such applicants you appoint a man with a large holding of land and a valuation of £14.  That man came in and got the position, although he never carried a postbag in his life.</P>
    <P>The only reason that has been given for that man's appointment is that he is the cousin of a Fianna Fáil Deputy in Galway.  I would ask the Minister to look the matter up, and if the facts are as I have stated, I think that something should be done to remedy that state of affairs, and that at least, when the next vacancies arise, those men who have given long and faithful service should be considered.  I would also suggest, no matter in what part of County Galway a vacancy arises, that the question of Irish as a qualification should be considered.  I have made inquiries in that particular area since I asked the question, and I find that Irish is spoken there by a great number of people.  The Fianna Fáil Party always say that they are out to preserve the Irish language and to push it ahead.  I heard them speak in that way even here in the Dáil yesterday, but it is men who hold little positions of this kind in the country who can help the language most, in the ordinary course of their duty going through the country.  They would certainly be as effective in some cases as the teachers in the schools, because they are continually moving amongst the people of the country.  I firmly believe that a man who is able to speak the language should get a preference. If no preference is given in that way to Irish speakers, no matter what you may do, or no matter what amount of money you may expend on the promotion of the Irish language, it is going to be a failure.</P>
    <P>I say that in any part of County Galway where a vacancy of this kind arises, if an applicant is fit to fill the position, and if he has a knowledge of Irish, he should get credit for it.  I would also urge that men who have <Col N="1781" /> service should be given credit for it. One of these men had 15 years' service. He entered the service at an early age, and at the present time his age is 32. Another man with ten years' service is aged 34.  The man with 25 acres of land who got the position is 40 years of age.  I would like to know whether there is any age limit for applicants for such an appointment.  I would certainly urge very strongly that men who have already given a great portion of their lives to the service at a very small wage of 6/- or 7/- a week, and who have tried to rear their families on that wage should get consideration in these appointments.</P>

I hear he has done it, but I have personally seen no evidence of it at all and I trust that he will take this opportunity to tell us in what that publicity campaign consisted and the results, if any, which it has yielded.  I would, as well, press on him, as I did last year, that we should not be behindhand in this country in the development of the telephone and that really a little should be attempted in the way of high-pressure salesmanship, to bring home to people the value of the telephone, its multifarious uses, and to popularise it.  If that were done it would be of very great advantage to the country as a whole and a step forward in civilisation.</P>

      <P>With regard to Deputy MacDermot's point about publicity there has been no Press publicity but canvassing has been going on.  It was going on at the time that I spoke last year.  This year we are sending out a folder to people who might be expected to become users of the telephone. There is a reason why we cannot <Col N="1782" /> broadcast advertisements, and it is that in certain areas in the country saturation point has been reached. From the telephone point of view there are certain areas which may be described as congested at the moment, and the reason why we cannot invite new subscribers is because it will take some time before the new cables can be laid down in them.  As Deputy MacDermot ought to know, there is another reason.  We cannot compare this country, with its scattered population, with countries like England and France.  Here we have very few large centres of population.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>From the point of view of telephone facilities I cannot say at the moment how it compares with the countries Deputy MacDermot has just spoken of.  The Deputy may know a lot about those countries as he travels a lot.  Development of that kind resolves itself into a question of cost. The capital cost of putting down poles and wires and maintaining them has to be considered.  As Deputy Brennan said, I, like him, represent an agritural constituency, and naturally I would be most anxious, if it were at all possible, to extend telephone facilities into every part of the country. But, unfortunately, the question of cost arises.  It has to be got over.  If my Department were free to spend as much money as it wished, then of course we could provide all those facilities.  Deputy O'Sullivan asked whether the Post Office was altogether a social service or whether the idea was to run it on commercial lines. Well, of course, that is a question which has worried more Governments than this.  I think I may say that it is partly both.  We must have some regard to the needs of the community and at the same time to the cost of the service&mdash;what the country can afford to spend on it.  We claim that so far as it is possible for the Post Office, within the means at its disposal, to meet the requirements <Col N="1783" /> of the rural areas, we have done that.  Where circumstances warrant an improvement in the service, it will be found, I think, that the Post Office has always been willing and anxious to give that improvement. But, as I have already indicated, we are bound by financial considerations which we cannot get over.  Deputy Brodrick made a very severe charge against me.  He said that I appointed a man to a position because he was a Deputy's brother.</P>

      <P>Well, that he was a relation of a Fianna Fáil Deputy.  I can assure the Deputy that I had no knowledge whatever of that.  The information that I had about the man who was appointed does not agree with the statement the Deputy made. Deputy Brodrick said that this man's valuation was £14, and that he had 25 acres of land.  My information was that he was a joint occupier, with an invalid brother, of a farm, and that he had a wife and four children.  I am giving the Deputy the information that I had when the appointment was made: that this man, with a wife and four children, was part owner of a farm with an invalid brother.  I also had the information that this man was very badly situated financially; that from the point of view of dependency his position was as bad as that of any of the other candidates.  I again assure the Deputy that at the time the appointment was made I had no information about his relations.</P>

      <P>With regard to the question that was raised by Deputy Kelly about the kiosks, I am afraid the Deputy will have to refer that to the Corporation.  I am not sure whether the new Corporation or the Commissioners were in office at the time it was decided to erect these kiosks, but the fact, at any rate, is that both their design and their location were agreed upon by my Department and the Corporation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

      <P>My information is that the officers of the Corporation concerned were in consultation with my Department on the matter, and that an agreement, both as to the sites and the design, was arrived at.  Therefore, I think I must refer Deputy Kelly to the Corporation on that matter.  So far as the erection of kiosks in the future is concerned, I will see that my Department will consult with the Corporation and come to an agreement as to design, provided, of course, that it is not sought to insist on fantastic designs. We will try to meet the Corporation within reason.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan referred to the new post office at Rathmines. On the last occasion I spoke on this I said that we expected to have the new office working in October.  The new office there will, we hope, be finished this year, but the new telephone <Col N="1785" /> service at Rathmines will not be available for a considerable time longer.  Its installation is a lengthy process.  First of all, the building has to be dried out before the new apparatus is put in.  I can assure the Deputy that we are doing our best to get ahead with it as quickly as possible. The Deputy also urged an extension of the telephone service in country districts after 7 o'clock in the evening and on Sundays.  This has been tried in a few areas, and experience has shown that there has been very little demand for it.  I can promise the Deputy that if any special case is made for such an extension it will be sympathetically considered, but experience has shown that an extension in country areas after 7 o'clock in the evening and on Sundays has not been very largely availed of. In fact, there has been scarcely any demand for it.  Deputy Brennan made the usual complaint that people in the rural areas, as compared with those in the metropolitan areas, were not being treated fairly.  I do not see what we can do.  The question of cost comes in there again.  The Deputy said he believed there was a loss in connection with postal deliveries in some of the metropolitan areas and that the Post Office was bearing that loss.  He urged that it should do the same with regard to the delivery of telegrams in the rural areas.  The loss on the telegraph service has been an increasing one, while the postal service has been showing a profit.  I do not think it would be possible for us to add to the loss we are already meeting on the telegraph service, much as I should like to facilitate the country districts.  It is simply a question of finance.  Deputy Good asked for figures as to the present position of the postal side of the service. The estimated profit on the postal side this year is £80,000.  On the telegraph service the estimated loss is £126,800, and on the telephone service an estimated profit of £45,000.  In 1931-32 we had a profit of £116,735 on the postal side, and in 1932-33 a profit of £94,599. We estimate a profit this year of £80,000, so that the profit is decreasing slightly each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the standard charge, that matter is being constantly watched <Col N="1786" /> and the Department is always open to receive any suggestions that people may have to make with regard to it. I understand, however, that all that it is possible to do, in the way of lessening the charges of installation, is being done and the whole question is constantly under review by the engineering section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there not a uniform charge for installation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In the metropolitan area there is, but the position is that it may cost far more than that in one case and far less in another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>But in some cases, one has only to switch over from one to another.  Why charge £3 in that case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There are cases in which the cost might be £10.  There is a sort of average.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it should not be uniform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon made the case that we should have uniform charges.  We find in this case that, on the balance, that is the fairer way. Different areas cost more than other areas, and the Post Office has found the standard charge a much more satisfactory arrangement in certain cases.  On the one hand, the individual may be benefited in certain cases but on the other hand, others are benefited in other cases in which the cost would be far more than the standard charge. That is always the case when there is a uniform rate&mdash;some people benefit and others do not.  The Deputy commented on the brevity of my opening speech but I do not think it advisable &mdash;at least, I never approved of it&mdash;to do what was done formerly, the reading out of a very long statement very fast which nobody could hear.  I think it is much better to sit here and to let people ask questions and then try to get the information they require.  If I adopted the other course, I might be reading out something in which Deputies might not be at all interested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is none on the waiting list.  Deputy Good also asked for the number of rural exchanges and call offices that had been opened.  In the last 12 months, we have opened five rural exchanges and eight rural call offices.  That means that practically the whole country is served by telephones now, with the exception of parts of Donegal and Mayo, where economic considerations prevent extension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister tell us, over a period of, say, the last three years, what have been the figures?  How many telephones are there to-day in the Free State and how many were there a year ago and the year before?  Is the number steadily increasing or not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is steadily increasing. I have not got the actual figures but I will supply them to the Deputy.  We have a profit every year and there is an increasing number of telephones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon started off with his usual remarks about wrapping the green flag round us.  I expect that he intended to give us one of his &ldquo;Wont-stand-up-for-the-Soldiers' <Col N="1788" /> Song&rdquo; sort of speeches but seeing that he had Deputy O'Sullivan on his benches, who does not approve of that style of thing, he changed his tune and went on the green flag business and tried to have a cheap sneer at the Republican movement. I think he would be doing far more good to himself, to the House and to the country generally, if, on a debate like this, he would confine himself to matters connected with the Post Office and not to speak of matters about which he ought to hold his tongue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I know he does but I am sure that he sometimes feels uneasy. Deputy Dillon made a concrete suggestion and if it were possible, I should like to see it carried out.  As a matter of fact, I am surprised that Deputy Dillon should have made a concrete suggestion.  He suggested that we should have something like a flat rate of 3d for any call within a county, 6d for a call within a province and 1/- maximum for any trunk call to any part of the country.  He believes that that, although there might be a loss immediately, would eventually mean a gain.  I will have that point examined and see what can be done.  I hope he is right and I hope it will be possible to do it but I am afraid it is going to be too big a strain on the resources of the State.  I would like to know that people could telephone from any part of the country to another for a maximum rate of 1/-, but I am afraid it will not be possible to get the Finance Department to accept it.  I will, however, have it examined and see what can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Norton's <Col N="1789" /> remarks, I missed one item from his speech which formed a part of his remarks on this Estimate over the last few years&mdash;the question of the redundant Post Office officials.  He did not even say that he was glad to see that that little grievance had been removed.  I have to remind him that there is something missing from the song this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That was secured during the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Deputy forgot to tell us about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got the bouquets made up yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I might as well remind the Deputy of it.  I, too, am very much upset by this part-time postman question.  I think it very hard that people have to do part-time work for 14/8 per week, when people can get unemployment assistance at the rate of £1 a week.  The whole part-time system seems to be associated with the Post Office since it was instituted, and I must say that I do not like it.  So far as Dublin is concerned, we are making every effort, as Deputy Norton knows, to make full-time posts of the part-time posts, and I hope that, in a short time, we shall have that fixed up, or, at least, that we will be able considerably to increase the number of hours of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows that representations in the matter have been made to him by the Post Office Workers' Union.  Will he undertake that these will receive early consideration, and that there will be a speedy decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>These representations have been made and they are being considered.  I hope a speedy and satisfactory decision will be reached.  There will be at least a considerable increase in the number of hours of work.  There may be some rearrangement of the postal services in the city, but in the country areas it will be, I think, practically impossible.  There are some areas where we can amalgamate posts, but we cannot be expected to worsen <Col N="1790" /> services to any extent.  I know that where it is possible it has been done&mdash; it has happened in a few cases already. This year, in several instances, when vacancies occurred, we always endeavoured to see if it was possible to amalgamate the vacant posts, one with the other.  It must be recognised, however, that we must have regard to the needs of the people of the district.</P>
      <P>As regards the sorting office, a start has been made with the building of a central sorting office in Pearse Street. Last year I mentioned that it was hoped we would be able to start in September; but there were legal difficulties about the acquisition of sites, and there were measurements, and so on, and it was impossible to have those things completed until very recently. Work has begun on the taking down of some old sheds.  I can promise Deputy Norton that every effort will be made to expedite the work.  I was in the sorting office, and I admit that it is not a proper place for people to work in at all.  It is a converted distillery, and it did not impress me. Anything I can do to have the erection of the new building speeded up, will be done.</P>
      <P>With regard to Waterford Post Office, that matter is still under consideration. Investigations have been going on with reference to the units of work and the hours for different offices in the country.  Certain figures have to be compiled and comparisons made, and the examination is not quite finished yet.  I will try to speed that matter up.  I do not know what the result will be.  I know the subject is being investigated, but I am not in a position to say when we will be able to report on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to the Christmas Day deliveries, Deputy Norton rather anticipated what I was going to say&mdash; that the people will not post early, even if they are asked.  I believe that they will not do it; they will keep their cards and letters until the very last day.  The Post Office authorities feel that they are obliged to deliver letters and cards.  They are not to be expected to know whether or not there is an authentic message to be delivered.  All they know is that they <Col N="1791" /> get a letter to deliver and they deliver it.  As Deputies are aware, at Christmas time there is a big rush of cards and letters.  The Department have gone into the matter very carefully and they have advised me that there would be a great congestion if deliveries were not made on Christmas Day.  It would throw them out of gear if they did what the Deputy has suggested, so I am afraid the matter does not look very hopeful from the Deputy's point of view.  However, I will get this thing further examined, and if it is possible to meet Deputy Norton in the matter, we will meet him.  I am not, however, promising that his suggestion will be carried out.  So far as the matter has been examined it is not likely that we will be able to avoid Christmas deliveries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister were prepared to give the suggestion a trial for one year, I believe a good many of the fears that have been expressed will be found to have no foundation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">

    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department have gone carefully into this matter and they think it is impracticable.  Anyway, we will submit it to further examination. The Deputy raised a question in reference to the unestablished workmen in the engineering section.  The position is that the Engineer-in-Chief is not quite certain as to what established staff he will require.  The Deputy knows that there was an extra staff employed in connection with telephonic development, and the position is that the Engineer-in-Chief is not sure what permanent staff of skilled workmen will be required. There will be an examination held very shortly for 30 of these people so <Col N="1792" /> as to put them on a permanent basis and within a year, if it is found necessary, that number may be added to from amongst the successful candidates at the examination.  At least a beginning is being made to deal with this question in connection with the engineering section.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to say what will be done as regards working hours in the Stores.  That matter is under examination.  I will try to have a decision hurried up.  I do not know whether Deputy Dockrell is satisfied with Deputy Kelly's settlement of the question of a post office in St. Andrew Street&mdash;the congested part of it.  The position is that there is nothing definitely settled yet; the matter is still under inquiry.  I am told that even if the Post Office do take the basement or the ground floor of that building there will not be any undue delay. The Post Office officials will simply go there and be away in a very short time; they will delay no longer than is necessary for cars to pull up and take deliveries.  They will be there at certain hours and they will be loaded very quickly.  It has not yet been decided whether they will take that particular building or not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  The point that Deputy Dockrell raised about the Savings Bank is in connection with the delay in withdrawing money.  I think that was the principal point. As regards the Savings Bank, it is necessary to verify the signature of the drawer so as to ensure that payment is being made to the proper person and that funds to the amount are available in the deposit account. The record as to the amount of funds on deposit is available only in the head office.  That is the reason for the delay.  When people go into a post office for the withdrawal of their money the position is not like it is in the case of a bank.  The records are kept in the head office.  That has always been the system and that explains the delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot decide that matter quite now.  I will inquire into it, but that is the reason for the delay &mdash;that we have to verify the signature and see that funds are there to meet the amount that the person is applying for.  At present that can only be done by reference to headquarters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  On the matter of long-distance telephones, I understand that there is not so much foundation for the complaint as Deputy Dockrell suggests.  There may be some delays on occasion but, generally speaking, I think there are no grounds for any great complaint.  There have been additional lines got through Belfast. The Post Office has not very many complaints about people having to wait a long time to put their calls <Col N="1796" /> through as the Deputy suggests they have.  I am not denying that there may be instances where there may be some delay, but as a general rule we find that there are no complaints of delays.  Any complaints that may arise will be immediately investigated.</P>

      <P>The amount of the Estimate for the broadcasting service for the year 1934-35 is £38,796 as compared with £43,530 for 1933-34.  That is a decrease of £4,734, due mainly to the cost of erection of the high-power station having been cleared last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The revenue from wirless receiving licences last year amounted to approximately £26,000, and from fees for advertisments and miscellaneous receipts about £22,000.  The direct expenditure on the broadcasting service out of all votes last year amounted to about £53,230, including £4,000 for the completion of the high-power station.  The number of wireless receiving licences issued last year was 50,500 representing an increase of 17,071 over the previous year.  Special inspectors have been employed for some time in rounding up licence defaulters throughout the country, and there were 350 prosecutions of defaulters during the year.  The revenue from licence fees in the year <Col N="1797" /> 1934-35 is estimated at £30,000, representing approximately 60,000 licences. The growth of licences is likely to continue for several years before saturation point is reached.</P>
    <P>As regards programmes six concerts were given by the Symphony Orchestra of the Dublin Station, all the concerts of the Dublin Philharmonic Society were broadcast and the Station Opera Company performed a number of operas.  A promising development has been in the increase of programmes relayed from provincial centres, including Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Sligo, etc. Also an interesting result of the extension of the use of wireless throughout the country districts during the past year has been a growing demand for more Irish music, particularly dance music, the ceilidhe music broadcast nightly being specially appreciated. The scope of the talks programme has been extended and particular attention has been given to talks on Irish history, Irish music and Irish literature.</P>
    <P>The broadcasting of running commentaries on sports events continues to be very popular with listeners, particularly the broadcasting of Gaelic football and hurling matches and an extension of such programmes is being planned for the coming season.  During the past year a trial has been given to sponsored advertising programmes and the question of future policy in regard to such programmes is at present being considered in the light of experience gained so far.</P>
    <P>As to the technical side of the broadcasting service a conference of European Governments was held at Lucerne last year for the purpose of allocating wave-lengths to broadcasting stations in Europe.  This Administration was represented at the conference and the wave-length allocated to the Athlone Station is regarded as satisfactory, having regard to the international difficulties involved in the problem of wave-length distribution.  The new wave-length has improved reception conditions somewhat throughout the Saorstát as a whole by reason of the fact that the non-fading range of the Athlone Station has been extended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one remark which I would like to make in connection with wireless broadcasting. The Minister for Industry and Commerce on a very recent occasion judged the prosperity of the country by the fact that there has been an increase in the sale of clocks, watches and wireless equipment.  Unfortunately, or otherwise if you like, some farmers happen to have wireless sets, and I want to draw particular attention to an incident that happened recently in connection with the President's broadcast, on St. Patrick's night.  On that occasion the President, in his broadcast, talked about the prosperity of the farmers and said that everything was lovely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very few farmers have got wireless sets, but I know of one particular farmer who has got one.  This farmer on hearing the President's speech got agitated and, as he could not interrupt, what he did was to kick the unfortunate wireless set around the room. He did not hear any more of what the President was saying about the prosperity of the farmers.  I would seriously suggest that, when the broadcasting authorities in future get anybody to broadcast in connection with the farmers' position in this country, they would drop the talk about prosperity altogether.  The farmers know their position very well, and if these talks are permitted, you will only find that they will be turning around and abusing the wireless sets.  I know <Col N="1799" /> there are very few farmers who have got one.  If such people hear any more talk about their prosperity they will only do what the farmer to whom I referred did&mdash;kick the set around the room.</P>

      <P>Deputy Curran has touched upon quite an important matter, and that is that the wireless is being used increasingly for political purposes in this country.  I understand that it is not supposed to be used for political purposes, but addresses are being broadcasted which are distinctly political in their tendency.  If that is going to be continued, I suggest that we ought to do the same here as in other countries where political addresses are permitted, and that is to see that all shades of opinion have an opportunity to express themselves over the radio, and that it should not be confined to one political party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not admit that there have been any political addresses at all.  There have been broadcasts by different Ministers on matters relating to their respective Departments, which concern the whole country.  The President simply broadcasted a message to America, and he did not say that the farmers were prosperous.  If that is the type of mind of Deputy Curran's informant, he must not be in a position to talk much here.  If that is the type of mind, Deputy Curran ought to be very slow to talk here.  I listened to that speech and I listened attentively, <Col N="1800" /> because I expected that I might have to answer here, and I say that there was nothing political, and that the President said nothing that he had not a right to say.  It has always been the custom to broadcast to America on such occasions.  I suggest to Deputy Curran that before he gets up to speak here he ought to get better information than from a man who kicks his wireless set around the room.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: That this Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of the Bill is to effect a number of miscellaneous amendments in the Road Transport Act of 1933.  It will facilitate Deputies, perhaps, if I explain briefly the nature of the amendments contemplated.  I should say that the Act of 1933 introduced for the first time statutory control and regulation of the carriage of merchandise by road.  That business was much less organised and much less definite in character than the passenger-carrying business that had been brought subject to regulation by the Act of 1932.  Many of the persons engaged in it were doing so in a very small way, although dependent upon it for a livelihood. It proved to be a very slow process to get them to realise what was required of them, and to become familiar with the nature of the legislation which had been enacted by the Oireachtas.  It would have been a cause of very great hardship upon these people to have disregarded the circumstances of their failure to comply with the statutory requirements. It was not intended that the Act should impose hardship upon these persons and, consequently, when it became clear that a large number of persons, who should have applied for existing carrier certificates under the Act of 1933, had failed to do so within the time laid down in that Act, an amending statute was passed through the Oireachtas extending the period within which such applications could be made for, roughly, six months from <Col N="1801" /> the original date.  Public notice of the nature of the legislation, and of the manner in which application for certificates should be made and the necessity for getting such certificates, was given in every way possible by advertisements in the Press, announcements from the Broadcasting Station, posters displayed outside Civic Guard stations and so forth.  Nevertheless, a large number of persons failed to realise what was required of them and to make application.  Under the terms of the statute these persons were debarred from securing these certificates, and if the Act had been operated without regard to the consequences affecting these persons, they would have been deprived entirely of the right to continue in the business on which their livelihoods depended.</P>
      <P>The number of applications for certificates made subsequent to the final date, that is the date as extended by the amending Act of 1933, is now 200.  If the number was much smaller one might be inclined to say that the persons concerned had only themselves to blame, having regard to the fact that we had extended the period by six months.  However, I think it would be undesirable that 200 persons should be debarred utterly and completely from securing these certificates because of their disregard of the requirements of the statute or because of their ignorance concerning it.  It is proposed, therefore, to deal with these late claims, but not to permit of any additional claims being made, either under this Bill or in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill proposes to extend, until 1st April, thé period in which applications for certificates can be made, and, consequently, the 200 persons whose applications were late under the existing law can be dealt with under the terms of this Bill when it is enacted.  The amendment of the law proposed in that respect necessitates the fixing of a later appointed day than that which has been fixed already for the operation of merchandise licences.  The 1st of February was appointed as the date upon which no person holding a certificate could continue to engage in the business of <Col N="1802" /> carrying merchandise by road for reward without a licence.  An existing carrier had, first, to get a certificate that he was, in fact, a carrier, and subsequently to obtain a licence to operate in the future.  The 1st of February was the date on which the portion of the Act requiring carriers to have licences came into operation. Now that we are extending the period within which carriers may apply for their certificates, as such, it is necessary also to cancel the order, already made, fixing the appointed day as 1st February, and to provide for the fixation of another date, which is being done by this Bill.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the 1933 Act restrict all existing carriers permanently to, roughly, the same carrying capacity as was available to them during the qualifying period, the carrying capacity being measured by the unladen weight of the vehicles or tractors available in connection with their service.  That provision, however, has involved hardship in certain cases, and, consequently, there are certain sections of this Bill designed to deal with these cases. Firstly, it appears that it is the practice to use passenger vehicles for the purpose of transporting newspapers in certain parts of the country. Most Deputies living in Dublin are familiar with the passenger car carrying newspapers round the city, on a Sunday morning particularly. In order to enable that practice to continue undisturbed, it is proposed to bring within the definition of lorry a vehicle constructed and designed for the carriage of passengers but which, for the time being, is being used for the carriage of newspapers.  Secondly, there have been a number of cases in which vehicles were substituted for those that were available during the qualifying period which were roughly of the same carrying capacity but the unladen weights of which were greater. Frequently, due to the fact that the new vehicle was constructed with an Irish-built body, instead of the foreign-built body of the older vehicle, the new vehicle may have been of a greater unladen weight.  Under the strict terms of the Act of 1933, where such a vehicle had been substituted <Col N="1803" /> for the vehicle available during the qualifying period and was of a greater weight, a licence could not be issued.  It is proposed to take power to deal with such cases by allowing a certain element of discretion where vehicles have been substituted in that particular way.</P>
    <P>There have been other cases in which persons engaged in the merchandise-carrying business had vehicles available for the purpose of that business but not licensed during the qualifying period.  It was stated that these vehicles were available for the business and could have been licensed at very short notice if required in connection with the business.  It is proposed, wherever a genuine claim of that kind appears to be sustainable, to enable these vehicles to be taken into regard in fixing the unladen lorry or tractor weight of the applicant for a licence. These are the main provisions of the Bill.  There are some other minor amendments which effect no change in the law, but are proposed mainly to clarify certain of the provisions of the Act of 1933.</P>
    <P>The Bill is one which has arisen entirely out of our experience of the operation of that Act.  I notice in the Press that certain associations and organisations associated with the railways have been protesting against the delay in bringing the Act of 1933 into full operation.  That delay was due entirely to the very great difficulty in bringing under the form of control contemplated by the Act all the business of carrying merchandise by road, a business as to the dimensions of which we had no information, and the scattered nature of which made it very difficult to regulate. The work which devolved upon my Department in connection with the administration of the Act was very heavy indeed and it is, of course, not yet completed, because with the introduction of this Bill the period within which the same class of work will continue is necessarily lengthened.  It is only when the Bill is through that the situation can be rounded off, by the issue of licences to those entitled to them and, consequently, the preparation of what I may call a picture of the <Col N="1804" /> road merchandise transport business as revealed in the list of licensees, the nature of the business in which they are engaged, the districts in which they are operating, and the unladen weight of the lorries and tractors used in connection with their business.</P>
    <P>The number of applications received for certificates as existing carriers under the Act of 1933 was no less than 2,043.  The number of certificates issued was 1,385.  There were 1,176 licences issued, but that number may be possibly increased in consequence of the enactment of this measure. These figures are sufficient to give Deputies an indication of the widespread nature of the business, and the very large number of very small firms engaged in it and, consequently, will enable them to understand the difficulty of securing in relation to the business the very precise and accurate degree of control or regulation which the Act of 1933 contemplated.  The difficulties which have arisen, however, will, I think, be removed by the Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there can be no possible objection to the Bill.  Even if some people may have neglected to apply in time, through carelessness or some other fault of their own, it is not desirable that they should be deprived of their means of livelihood. Seeing that the question of the necessity for applying for a licence will get considerable publicity by the passage of this Bill through the Dáil, in case there might be even half a dozen or ten or twelve still forgetful or ignorant of the duty imposed upon them, one wonders why the Minister did not allow the extension of time to last until the passing of this Bill. However, with regard to the main section, other than the extension which <Col N="1805" /> alters the appointed day&mdash;Section 10, as I read it, enables the Minister to double the standard weights to be allowed to any licensee.  What occurs to one on reading the very complicated section, is why the proposal could not be expressed in some simpler language. One has to read it again and again to find out that the power which is taken by this Section 10 is power to allow up to twice what a licensee would be entitled to under the original Act. Further, I suggest to the Minister that it would have been worth his while to deal with all vehicles under two tons in a general way by giving to anybody getting a licence at all, a licence for a vehicle up to two tons unladen weight.  I think it would have saved his office and himself a lot of worry, and there would have been no great injustice to anybody in such a provision.</P>
      <P>Again, this change has taken place even since the original Act was passed, that there are now practically no ton vehicles for sale, and very few, and only very expensive, one and a half ton vehicles.  The minimum vehicle, you may say, which is for sale for such purposes at present is a two-ton vehicle.  I do not pretend that technically the change has been so complex as that, but I think that for practical purpose the description I have given would be correct.  I suggest to the Minister that before the Bill finally passes he should consider whether he could not license the use of a vehicle of up to two tons, unladen weight, for anyone at all entitled to be a carrier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One further matter I should like to inquire about in connection with this Bill is with regard to the carriage of beet.  That is going to be a very big item in road traffic next Autumn, and I take it that if the Road Transport Act, as now amended, is fully in effect by that time, you will have the position, that so far as the road conveyance of beet is concerned it will be largely in the hands of the Great Southern Railways, accord-the Great Southern Railways.  Of course, ing to the original Act, will be bound by rates of charge which will be fixed by the Railway Tribunal, but in that <Col N="1806" /> connection I should like to have some indication from the Minister as to what he expects to be done with regard to the fixing of such rates.  Is it his expectation that those rates will be fixed for every little by-road, and will cover the cost of conveying the beet from the farmers' residence to the factory?  As I read the Bill, I interpreted that provision to mean that all that would be done would be the fixing of general charges on the main roads. I did not think it was possible&mdash;and I do not yet think so&mdash;for any Tribunal to successfully attempt to fix rates to apply to individual farmers.  If that is not the case I wonder what will be the position of farmers who want to have beet conveyed from their premises to the factory, if they have not the chance of a competitive transport. If they are entirely in the hands of the Great Southern Railways, and if the latter are bound only in so far as the main roads are concerned by the rates that may be fixed by the Tribunal, would there not be a chance there of such charges being levied as will make the cost to the farmer of conveying his beet a very serious and a very expensive business?  I know that there is considerable apprehension in the vicinity of one of the beet factories at all events with regard to that question, because it is expected that a good deal more than half the traffic will be conveyed by road.  I may say that in that district it is not expected that the carriers there&mdash;even if the Road Transport Act, 1933, does not come fully into effect, and those private carriers are still allowed to remain&mdash;will be able to deal with anything like a fair share of the traffic that will be offered to them.  Inevitably, then, the Great Southern Company will have the task of transporting that beet to the factories; and, therefore, to the beet growers and others concerned the question as to what control there will be over the charges which the Great Southern Company propose to make is a serious one.  In my opinion it would be impossible for any tribunal to fix charges that would apply to each farmer, and, if it were possible, I think they would have to allow&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When an amending Bill of this nature comes before the House, the Act which it purports to amend is not open for discussion, except in so far as it is affected by the amending Bill.  The Deputy has made his point, and I think he should be satisfied with that.</P>

      <P>With regard to the fixation of the 1st April as the final date for the making of applications for certificates as existing carriers, I do not think there is anything to be gained by further extending that date. The Deputy will remember that the original date was one month after the passage of the original Act, which was itself a long time going through the Dáil, and received a considerable amount of publicity.  That date was extended by another Bill to the 31st October of last year.  It is now being extended to the 1st of April, and I think it is reasonable to anticipate that all persons entitled to those certificates will, by this, have learned the nature of the legislation, and have taken the step of writing to the Department and applying for their certificate.  If there is any reason to believe that a considerable number of persons are still carrying on that business without knowing the legislation affecting it, the matter could be considered, but I think it is exceedingly unlikely, and it is obviously desirable that that particular stage of the scheme should be terminated as early as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The phraseology of Section 10, to which Deputy Moore objects, is, of course, that considered by the draftsman most suitable to give expression to the matter contained in it.  It is, I admit, rather a complicated form, but it is preferable to have an elaborate form of that kind to having any possibility of misunderstanding as to the nature of the section, or any interpretation which would defeat its purposes, put on it subsequently. Sub-sections (1) and (2) relate to subsection <Col N="1808" /> (7), and provide for the inclusion of lorries which comply with the appropriate conditions set out in subsection (7).  Sub-sections (4), (5) and (6) relate to the substitution for an old vehicle or an old tractor of a new one of somewhat greater unladen weight but of much the same carrying capacity.  It is not, therefore, correct to say that the section permits a person to get double what he was entitled to under the existing Act.  That might happen in exceptional cases, but they would certainly be very exceptional indeed.  With regard to the transportation of beet, it is not intended by the Great Southern Railways Company, as I am informed, to quote each farmer a separate rate for the carriage of his beet to the sugar factory.  The Railway Company have, I understand, quoted a scale of rates for the transport of beet, which the board of the sugar company consider satisfactory.  Those are the principal matters to which the Deputy referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a simple Bill, and the sections are self-explanatory.  Section 2 refers to the filling of causal vacancies.  As the Principal Act was drafted it was necessary for a person to have attended at least half the meetings held during the previous half year.  That meant when a casual vacancy occurred, if someone filled the position say for two or three months before the half year was out, he couldnot possibly have attended half the meetings.  This Bill provides that if a person attends half the meetings during the time he held office he will be entitled to expenses for attending meetings.  Section 3 amends the Principal Act in this respect, that at present county committees of agriculture deal with horticulture, bee keeping and poultry keeping. People in urban areas are inclined to seek the assistance of the officals of the county committees, although they have no right to their services, as no rates are struck for that purpose in urban areas.  It is only rural areas contribute to the upkeep of these officers apart from what was contributed from the Central Fund.  The section amends that position, and in future when schemes are drawn up by county committees they cannot be availed of by dwellers in urban areas unless special provision for that purpose is made.  It is intended to advise the county committees to charge dwellers in urban areas a small fee for such instruction.  Section 4 refers to the borough of Dun Laoghaire. In the original Act every county electoral area had at least one representative on the county committee of agriculture.  The county councils appointed the committees of agriculture and they were bound to appoint at least three representatives for each county electoral area, but not more than four, and at least one of them had to be actually resident in each county electoral area.  Under the Act the county committee in Dublin appointed someone from the county <Col N="1810" /> electoral area of Dun Laoghaire.  It was really an oversight in the Principal Act because Dun Laoghaire has absolutely nothing to do with the county committee's schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give any reason for the restriction in Section 3, seeing many persons in urban areas look for these advantages? Is it that they are so costly that they are a burden?  In my experience of public affairs the collection of small fees from people does not pay for the cost.  I presume the collection will not be done by officers of the county committees. How is it proposed to collect these fees, or what will be the nature of the charges in urban areas?  If this service was not abused it does not appear to be right to insert such a regulation, unless the Act has to be amended for some other reason.  The Minister gave reasons why this proposal was put into the Bill.  Is the cost so very great?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost in the way of time is considerable.  As the Deputy knows, the officials of the county committees usually work in outside areas. Their work is unlike that done under the vocational education system, where they work through classes.  If it was a case where urban dwellers went to winter classes I think there would be no objection, because a few more would not make any difference. But if a number of urban dwellers were to seek the services of the poultry instructress, or if people with gardens in towns sought instruction from the horticultural instructor, it was felt that some of the officers would be more inclined to attend to the urban dwellers, because the work would be more congenial.  Sometimes that was made an excuse for overwork and for not being able to attend to long-distance classes.  That is why some of the county committees objected to urban dwellers getting the benefits of their schemes.  The expense entailed is in the time of the officers.  A small fee might be sufficient to deter people in urban areas with poultry or with gardens from looking for the services of these officers too often.  I presume the fees <Col N="1811" /> would be collected not by the officers concerned but by the secretaries to the committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my point. There is a disposition on the part of officials of local authorities to have disputes between these authorities.  At one time I knew a local authority, the ratepayers of which contributed nine-thirteenths of the cost of an institution which was involved in litigation so as to keep within the strict letter of the law.  Similarly in this case if there is a departure such as this, it may be that the cost of the services may be much greater.  For example take the position of a horticulture instructor near a town.  Five minutes would take him into the urban area where he could give advice or instruction to a number of people.  That occurs at the present time.  The instructors will endeavour not to waste any time.  Territory should not be an obstacle to the dissemination of knowledge.  The idea of our legislation should be to spread knowledge as far as possible, so that all concerned would get the advantage.  What I am afraid of is that a good deal of extra expense will be incurred by this proposal without any corresponding benefit, as people are sometimes inclined to quarrel because an officer goes outside an area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are times when 20 minutes or half an hour would suffice for dealing with cases in an urban area.  If this proposal means that a record is to be made of the time of the officials, that bills have to be sent out, and trouble undertaken in connection with the collection of the moneys, the Minister knows quite well what elaborate administrative machinery is likely to cost.  Eventually it will be found that urban dwellers will not get the advantage of these services.  I am sure the Minister realises what an advantage it is generally to urban dwellers to get such advice.  The very fact that people are looking for advice shows the interest they take in these schemes.  I think the Minister should reconsider this matter, as it is more than likely that <Col N="1812" /> the cost will be so prohibitive that it will be no longer possible to give this service in urban districts.</P>
    <P>The Minister can realise that, if a fee is charged at all, it will be something in the nature of half-a-crown. To a poor urban dweller who wishes to avail of this advice or instruction, half-a-crown is a considerable impediment and may result in his not getting the instruction at all.  If these people are stopped or prevented from getting it, I am not so sure that they will come along again.  I think that the Minister ought to seek the counsel of the instructors as to whether or not any real advantage lies in this instruction. If a real advantage is derivable, it would be better if some extra sum were paid from headquarters, as otherwise, the cost to the individual will be so great that it will not be availed of and prove merely an interruption of the service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave raised a very interesting point.  The point that concerns me is really an elaboration of that.  The Minister says that the committees themselves will collect the fees.  I do not think that we are entitled to proceed on that assumption. That is easier said than done.  My own opinion is that the collection of the fees will probably depend on the particular instructor.  If so, it will create a position that will be altogether dangerous, because if there is any possibility of an instructor getting fees from urban dwellers, he might, if he were an avaricious gentleman, be more inclined to work for urban dwellers than he is now.  Even if he is not, and if the committee themselves collect the fees, there will be a tendency to extend the service further than it is at present availed of.  In the county which I represent, the services of the instructors are not availed of in the way the Minister thinks they are.  In the few cases there, I do not think that anybody grudges the poor people the services of the instructors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two points raised by Deputy Cosgrave are the two objections I myself should have to the Bill.  The fee would not prevent the instrctors attending to urban dwellers, but would <Col N="1813" /> rather increase their services to these particular people.  Even the collection of the fee would be rather difficult.  I do not know what machinery will be arranged in that regard, but there will have to be some sort of machinery set up if the money is to be collected by the committees.  It would be rather dangerous to have the collection made by individual instructors, even though they are a highly respectable body of men.  It would be rather throwing a hint to them, if they were human, that they were to pay more attention to the people who would be paying than to the people who would not be paying. On the whole, I think that the Minister should reconsider that part of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering the matter, will the Minister bear in mind the words of the Bill: &ldquo;No resident outside the functional area&rdquo;.  He should look into that to see whether or not a person having land in the functional area and having a residence outside the functional area is precluded from getting the assistance of the instructors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The last point raised by Deputy Cosgrave will certainly require consideration.  I may say that, at first sight, I did not like this idea.  I suppose I have a kindly mind, like the Deputy.  I thought that it was a pity to see these people deprived of the advantage of this instruction but I was assured that the poorer dwellers in the towns&mdash;the working people with gardens&mdash;never sought the advice of the instructors.  It was the well-to-do people in the towns who asked for the services of the horticultural instructors and also the services of the poultry instructresses. In a few cases, bee-keepers looked for advice but, in all cases, I was told, the people who sought advice were comparatively well off.  The objection raised was not so much that these people were getting free advice as that the poultry instructresses and horticultural instructors were inclined to pay more attention to the urban dwellers than to the rural dwellers. <Col N="1814" /> They preferred to have a few visits to make in the towns to going out into the rural areas and attending to the people it was primarily intended they should help.  These officers are required, as Deputies know, to keep diaries showing their work, so that it can be checked all right.  The trouble is not that they spend too long with any of the urban dwellers, or that they spend a whole day in one urban area attending to two or three persons; their diaries would disclose that and would show whether or not they had done an honest day's work. But some of them&mdash;I do not say all &mdash;were in the habit of paying many more visits in the year to the urban dwellers than they would pay to the rural dwellers who were asking for their advice.  For that reason, we were asked by some of the local authorities, secretaries of committees and county instructors, who now are in charge of the entire staff in a great many counties, to bring in this amendment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bennett may be under a misapprehension as to the fees.  There is no question of the instructor collecting the fee for himself.  The fee is to go into the funds of the county committee, but whether it will be collected by the secretary direct by post or whether he will go so far as to say that the fee will have to be lodged with him before the instructor will be sent, or whether the instructor will be asked to collect the fee when he calls, I cannot say. That will be a matter for regulation. If Deputies opposite had any particular desire in that respect, we should certainly fall in with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that it is the well-to-do dwellers who avail of these services.  That may be so, though I am not quite sure that it is. Granted that it is, a lot of urban dwellers who are fairly well-to-do do not avail of the services of these instructors because they do not want to be begging free service.  If they feel that they are entitled, under this Bill, to get for a small payment the services of an instructor, you will create a demand on their part for the services <Col N="1815" /> of these instructors.  If people understand that they are entitled to get this service for a small fee, there will be an extension of the service.</P>
