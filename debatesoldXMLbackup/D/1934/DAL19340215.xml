      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state whether his attention has been drawn to the proceedings of the Mayo Board of Health where allegations have been made as to the avoidable delay in proceeding with schemes for labourers' cottages and whether he will state what has been the cause of the delay if such has taken place.</P>

      <P>The commissioners' scheme for the erection of 170 cottages was only received in this Department on 29th ultimo and the sites are being inspected by one of the Department's engineering inspectors.  The commissioners' original proposals for the carrying out of the engineering work in relation to the scheme were unduly expensive, and after consultation with the Department on the 21st ultimo. the council have now put forward fresh proposals which will enable a considerable saving to be effected in the cost of these services. Approval has been given to the revised arrangements.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state if on the 5th December last he addressed a memorandum to the Civil Service Representative Council stating that it was of the utmost importance that the Gaelicisation of the Civil Service should be speeded up to the greatest possible extent consistent with efficiency and invited the views of <Col N="1510" /> the Representative Council on the matter; if he will state what is intended by the words &ldquo;Gaelicisation of the Civil Service&rdquo;; and if he has received a statement of the views of the Representative Council, and if so, whether he will cause a copy of the statement to be placed in the Library for the information of Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  The expression &ldquo;Gaelicisation of the Civil Service&rdquo; in the context in which it occurs in the memorandum has reference to the policy of the Government that the Irish language should be used to the fullest possible extent in the discharge of work of Government Departments. A statement of the views of the Civil Service Representative Council in the matter has been received, and I will arrange to supply a copy to the Deputy, and to any other Deputy who may wish to see the statement.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state with regard to the Fourth National Loan (a) if he is aware that the daily Press of December 5/13 published lists of applications for allotments to a total of over £2,112,000 out of the £2,912,000 said to be taken up by public subscription; (b) if he is aware that these lists revealed that, of tho former amount of approximately £2,112,000 over £1,750,000 was applied for by banking and insurance companies and non-trading corporations such as hospitals, religious and educational associations, trade unions, etc., and over £220,000 by firms engaged wholly or partly as brewers, distillers and malsters, and less than £100,000 by Saorstát industrial concerns and (c) if, considering that the lists referred to included subscriptions as low as £2,000 and in total accounted for all the subscribed portion of the loan except a sum of about £800,000, he will state in the public interest what proportion of the £800,000 was applied for by (1) individual investors and (2) Saorstát business and industrial concerns exclusive of those types of corporations mentioned in the first portion of (b) above.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the figures mentioned by the Deputy at (a) and (b) of his question.  In regard to (c), which raises another point similar to that raised by the Deputy in question put to me last week, I can only repeat what I then said, that I am unaware of any precedent for affording information of this kind and that I do not think it desirable to create one now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that if the £800,000 not accounted for was taken up by individual investors at the same rate as they took up the first portion, that the Government only received a testimonial amounting to 4d. in every £10 from the public?  Does the Minister want that to go abroad?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only to say that they floated three national loans and that these loans were subscribed for by the public and that that was a very good testimonial.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state with regard to the £3,087,000 of the Fourth National Loan not subscribed by the public (a) if any portion was taken up or covered by the Government, by Government funds, or by underwriters or funds associated with or under the control of the Government, and if so, to what amount and (b) what extra cost will fall upon the State by reason of the underwriters having to take up this amount of £3,087,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to (a) is in the affirmative, but I do not consider it to be in the public interest to disclose the details of underwriting arrangements made in connection with the loan.  As previously stated, there is no precedent for disclosing information of this kind.  I can, however, assure the Deputy as regards (b) in his question that no extra cost will fall upon the State by reason of its underwriting commitment in regard to the Fourth National Loan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my Budget statement last May, which dealt with the financing of the various commitments of the Exchequer in respect of capital expenditure to be defrayed by borrowing, the largest single item in which was a special provision of £1,600,000 for the Local Loans Fund, which amount was to be issued in the form of repayable advances to the local authorities for housing and other constructional activities, for example, public health works.  This programme has been carried out.  Since the date of the Budget the activities of Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann, Teoranta, and the Industrial Credit Company, Limited, have also been financed out of the proceeds of the Loan, which will be further utilised for the financing of other reproductive works, the details of which will be found in the Volume of Estimates for 1934-35 that is at the moment in course of preparation and will be presented to the Dáil as soon as possible. I regret I am unable to anticipate the information which will be disclosed on the presentation of the volume.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware (a) that <Col N="1514" /> according to figures officially given in the British Parliament on December 4th, 1933, the amount collected by means of penal duties on Saorstát produce up to November 25th, 1933, was £5,572,000; (b) that recent figures similarly given indicate that between November 25th, 1933, and the 13th January, 1934, the amount so collected had increased by £670,000 (approximately) bringing the total to nearly 6¼ million pounds; (c) that on the British contention a sum of £820,000 (approximately) remains to be collected between 13th January and the 31st March, 1934; and to ask what provision, if any, he has made to meet the situation which will arise when the duties yield more to the British than that portion of the money withheld from them for which they have assumed the responsibility of payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen reports of the Parliamentary Questions on which the figures mentioned in parts (a), (b) and (c) of the Deputy's question are based.  I cannot accept the inferences which the Deputy draws from them, because as I have already pointed out, in reply to a question by Deputy Dockrell last week, it is incorrect to assume that the burden represented by the sum of nearly 6¼ million pounds referred to fell completely on the shoulders of Free State citizens.  I am therefore not prepared to admit that the position which the Deputy forecasts in part (c) of this question can or will arise, but if it should, I have no doubt that the Government will be fully able to deal with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a question which vitality affects the finance of the State.  It is based upon the assertion made elsewhere that no more money would be extracted by duties on Irish produce than what had been withheld, and in view of the unsatisfactory nature of the reply, I intend to raise this matter on the adjournment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to part (a) is in the affirmative, and to part (b) in the negative.  As regards the other parts of the question, the remission was made in the usual way in the exercise of the prerogative of mercy, and took the form of remitting the term of imprisonment imposed, which was two months, on condition that the offender paid double the fine imposed, which was £5.  The district justice who imposed the penalties was consulted; the judges of the higher courts were not consulted as it was understood that the case came before them on a purely legal point without reference to the merits.  It is not the practice to publish the grounds on which the prerogative of mercy is exercised or the nature of the advice given by any judge or justice whom the Minister consults.  I may say however that in the present case the justice was obliged by the Statute to inflict a minimum sentence of two months' imprisonment, and that sentence cannot therefore be taken as necessarily representing the punishment which would in the justice's view have been proper, in all the circumstances of the case, if he had been allowed a discretion.</P>

      <P>On amendment No. 2 I would like to hear further from the Minister what his proposal is with regard to the appointment of an inspector and of instructors.  On the face of this Bill advantage can be taken of it by four county boroughs, <Col N="1531" /> five boroughs, 61 urban district councils and 24 town commissioners. The Minister said yesterday he did not anticipate that advantage would be taken of it by more than seven of the larger local bodies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to give to the House the names of those seven local bodies.  If only those seven local bodies take advantage of the measure, then I would like to hear him discuss the necessity for appointing instructors as well as an inspector.  He said yesterday that he might have to appoint three instructors for a certain number of weeks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated yesterday that the estimated expenditure in connection with this Bill is £6,500.  Under that estimate provision is made for one temporary inspector and three temporary instructors.  It is expected that an instructor would look after perhaps two centres.  There would not be more than six or seven centres in all.  Last year only two places &mdash; Dublin and Cootehill in the County Cavan &mdash; availed of the moneys given for this purpose out of the unemployment relief grants.  The instructors would be appointed for perhaps 11 or 12 weeks in the year.  The type of men that we would look for as temporary instructors would be men who had acted in a similar capacity under potato schemes or under schemes dealing with the reclamation of land in congested districts, men who had done one or two years' training in an agricultural college.  It is not estimated that more than three instructors will be necessary for the first year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not given any indication of the places where it is expected this work will be taken up.  Is Cootehill going to be one of them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first year the scheme may be taken up by the three cities of Dublin, Cork and Limerick, and also in Waterford, Letterkenny and Dundalk.  I presume Cootehill will <Col N="1532" /> come in again.  Cootehill was rather a unique case last year.  A sum of money was left to the local branch of the St. Vincent de Paul Society and it was devoted by that Society to the provision of allotments for the unemployed. That sum was supplemented out of the Relief Grant.  I do not know if Cootehill will come up this year again but it is likely it will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the scheme is going to be taken up in Letterkenny, does not the Minister consider that the officials acting under the County Committee of Agriculture of Donegal could very well look after the allotments there?  The same would apply to County Louth, so far as Dundalk is concerned.  Considering that the financial stringency is such that it is proposed to reduce the salaries paid to these officials, it seems absurd to appoint other instructors and pay them out of this small Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite possible that in an isolated place like Letterkenny what the Deputy suggests could be done.  I do not know if the Deputy is aware that there are difficulties under the Agriculture Act as regards using officials under county committees of agriculture even for the purposes of vocational education.  I am not quite sure how we stand in regard to this matter but we are prohibited from using these officials in urban areas. In the cities of Dublin, Cork and Limerick, it would be necessary to appoint instructors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the Minister aware that while officials of county committees of agriculture working in rural areas adjacent to cities cannot give the services they hitherto gave in the urban areas, yet provision is made whereby, by arrangement between the committee of agriculture and the vocational education authorities in an urban area, instructors can give their services in an urban area? That is subject to a financial adjustment which must be approved by the Departments concerned.  I have a recollection of an instruction coming from the Departments concerned to the Committee of Agriculture of <Col N="1533" /> County Dublin and to the Vocational Education Committee of the City of Dublin.  It is only fair to say that there is some crux in the matter and that the arrangement has not yet been carried out.  The matter is at present before the Departments concerned and the Departments and the two Committees are anxious to co-operate.  The creation of separate machinery for this purpose is hardly desirable as the machinery required would be so small that it would not be so efficient.  The enlargement of the existing machinery provided by the Committees of Agriculture, even though these bodies might have to invade the urban areas, would yield greater efficiency than would the appointment of an instructor who would be sent out on the loose, without any immediate supervision. Apart from the question of cost, I suggest that more efficiency would be obtained by utilising the existing machinery and, if necessary, extending it than by establishing a new machine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Belton has mentioned, a crux has arisen between the Vocational Education Committee and the Committee of Agriculture in certain counties and we may have to introduce legislation to make that right.  That could be got over but there remains the bigger point hinted at by Deputy Belton, that the officials under the County Committees have more work at present than they can do.  I agree with Deputy Belton that, in some cases, this little bit of additional work might be sufficient to get an extra man employed by the County Committee.  In a case like that, I should be glad to have the arrangement sanctioned.  There are cases, however, in the cities especially, where we may have to employ temporary instructors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Minister appreciate that better supervision in a matter like that of allotments would be got from a rural authority than from an urban authority?  There is established machinery in the rural areas.  The Corporation of Dublin can set up its own machinery to provide instruction in horticulture, poultry-keeping <Col N="1534" /> and so on for the added areas and semi-rural areas, or for the whole city for that matter, but that is deprecated &mdash; I think rightly so &mdash; by the Department.  The amount of work to be done would hardly justify the setting up of an independent authority. The same would apply in this case.  I am not speaking of the cost.  Even if the cost were to be a little more, I should favour the utilising of the existing machinery.  If necessary, an officer or two could be added &mdash; that is, if the existing officers were not able to cope with the additional work.  The Department of Agriculture has supervision over these officials and the machinery would be more efficient than new machinery would be.  The instructors would be under the immediate control of the Committee of Agriculture which, in turn, is under the control of the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the Deputy was here yesterday when we discussed this point.  I pointed out yesterday that this scheme was financed out of the Central Fund and that it is not usual to allow local authorities or their officials to supervise work financed out of it.  It is felt by the Departments here that they should have control of officials who are looking after the expenditure of State moneys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not a proportion of the funds of the Committee of Agriculture&mdash;half or a third&mdash;paid out of the Central Fund?  Does not a proportion of the secretary's salary come from the same source?  I do not think that that is an insuperable obstacle.  Even if that is the precedent, it would be no harm to break it down so as to get a good working machine.  If the Minister has not considered the possibility of this, I would urge on him to consider it before he sets up a person, say, on the outskirts of Dublin, who is really not amenable to any authority except himself or a Department in this city.  It does not make for good work and it is not good business.  I would urge on him to consider if there is any obstacle in the way of the immediate supervision by the Committee of <Col N="1535" /> Agriculture that is there already to supervise officials all over the country. In this way, a good deal of advice could be given to those plotholders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, a very important further reason why the suggestions I have made should be seriously considered and, if possible, applied by the Minister is that if the produce of these allotments, which will be subsidised, are going to be allowed to be marketed in free competition with people who <Col N="1536" /> are paying trades union wages, you are putting them into a market which is already saturated.  The result of that will be that this scheme, which is admirably intended, will only result in creating more unemployment. If you allow that produce to compete in a commercial way with the ordinary trade it is bound to result in men being thrown out of work.</P>

      <P>Maybe I am, and maybe I am not.  I feel myself in rather a difficult position because I do not like to go in opposition to the Minister and I do not like paying any more money into this Shannon scheme.  One hundred and fifty years ago or so there were three pirates hanged on the Muglins, and the judge was asked why he condemned the pirates to be hanged on the Muglins.  He said: &ldquo;I wish them to have a good view of the situation.&rdquo;  And you can have a good view of the situation from the Muglins, because, for the benefit of those whose geography may not be up-to-date, I may say that the Muglins are a collection of rocks in the Bay of Dublin, on the coast of Dalkey, beside Dalkey Island.  There you can see the Hill of Howth and Lambay Island and, if you stretch your neck, you can see Ireland's Eye.  You can see the coast all round Sandymount, Clontarf <Col N="1537" /> and the Pigeon House, and my view is on the Pigeon House in connection with this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is nearly 50 years ago &mdash; certainly 45 years&mdash;since I was attracted one fine evening, going down Nassau Street, to a group of men looking in through the college railings.  I went over to see what was happening and I saw in the distance an elderly man who, the group of men informed me, was a professor, and he was learning how to fly.  He had a pair of wings on his back and a rope round his chest, and the rope was held by a man some distance away from him.  The poor man made strenuous efforts to fly, but he failed.  An interesting question arose as to what would happen to the man at the end of the rope supposing the professor did mount into the air. Would he go along with him or would the professor let the rope go and fly away; or would he haul the man up and then let him fall and break his neck?  In those days, when working men gathered together, you would always find them in serious conversation, and, naturally, the conversation of this group of men turned on science. I then got the information from these men, who were the descendants of men &mdash; their grandfathers or great-grandfathers &mdash; who had acted on the engineering staff in the construction of the Grand Canal, that there was any amount of water in Ireland but no water power, and that the Irish rivers, generally, were lazy rivers, and the Shannon the laziest of them all. So, having got my science degree outside the walls of Trinity College, which I would never have got inside, I found myself some years afterwards a member of the Dublin Corporation and, in the very first year of this century, engaged in the very important task of bringing about a proper electrical supply for the citizens of Dublin.  There my information and my science degree were of great help because we got it into our heads that there was plenty of water in Ireland and no water power.  The City of Dublin electrical supply at that period was confined to a small station in Fleet Street.  That station still stands but it has been very much added to. I do not suppose that the radius of <Col N="1538" /> the streets supplied from that station at the time extended further than half a mile.  Anyway, it was necessary for the well-being of the citizens and the credit of the city that the electrical supply should be tremendously increased. Every care was taken by the Corporation to see that the job they were going to undertake was a good job.  Various syndicates arose to undertake the work, but the majority of the Corporation decided that the undertaking should be municipally controlled for the benefit of the citizens.  They succeeded in doing that.  In order to secure the best information available, a deputation was sent to Switzerland, which is a torrential country, to see the schemes that that Government had for generating electricity.</P>

I am rather concerned from the Dublin man's point of view about this Bill. More money is asked for.  Already £9,000 000 has gone into the enterprise so that, with an undertaking of that capacity, I am astonished Deputies did not take more interest in the proceedings. The Bill has nearly gone through all stages, and no one made any remarks.  Is it that everybody is satisfied the undertaking is going on all right?  I am not.</P>

      <P>We will go into that afterwards.  I am sorry I was interrupted when I was going into the question.  I cannot help that now.  It is my misfortune always to be interrupted and never let go on in my own way.  I was proceeding to relate the care and the pains that the Dublin Corporation took at the beginning to provide a supply of both light and power for the city.  The advice of the best engineers was obtained.  Vigorous opposition came against the undertaking remaining in the hands of the Corporation.  Various syndicates put up brass plates around Dublin, representing <Col N="1540" /> themselves as great engineers, and as having any amount of capital behind them.  An inspector of the Local Government spent 11 days dealing with the application of the Corporation for a first loan of £250,000 with which to start the undertaking. The Local Government Board eventually agreed to allow the Corporation to borrow the money and to proceed with the work.  The undertaking was a success.  For some time it had a struggle, but after seven or eight years working it became a substantial success.  The Dublin Corporation was suppressed in 1924 and its work was carried on by Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Shannon Electricity Supply Act was passed by the Dáil in 1927 empowering the Electricity Supply Board to take over the Corporation electricity undertaking.  Therefore the Board started well.  I have here a short statement of the immense assets that were handed over to the Electricity Supply Board, there being no Corporation at the time to make a protest.  I got the City Manager's Department to make out the statement, and I told the officials that probably some reference to the matter would be made here to-day.  The statement is not as complete as it could have been, because the books and everything else concerning the electricity undertaking have been taken over by the Electricity Supply Board and are not available to the citizens.  The total capital cost of the undertaking amounted to £1,959,935 at the date it was taken over in 1927.  Against that there was an outstanding loan of £500,000 so that the excess of assets over liabilities at that date amounted to £1,445,670.  That is the present the Electricity Supply Board got from the Dublin Corporation, including debts due by customers amounting to £144,000.  The net cash in bank at that date was £57,980.  The total surplus for the last year of the undertaking's working when it was controlled by the Commissioners was £87,024.  The revenue that year alone amounted to £320,000, the working expenses being £184,141 and the capital debt charges repaid £63,000, leaving a net surplus of £87,000 on that year's <Col N="1541" /> working.  With that gift alone, I think the Shannon scheme started well. Surely with £9,000,000 of the country's money, along with the Dublin undertaking, the enterprise should have shown better results than those indicated in the present year's statement of accounts, a surplus of just £5,000. We are told it is only in its infancy by some of its apologists.  That may be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>And that it is a white elephant by others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be.  I never said that it was a white elephant.  I hope it will not be.  I hope it will be a success.  Deputies may not think so from my remarks but I hope it will go ahead and that it will be a success. What I do object to is putting more and more money into it.  If it is only in its infancy, it is not showing very many signs of walking.  That is generally a very anxious time for the parents of an infant, when it is showing signs of walking.  A considerable sum of money has been put into it year after year.  I heard the Minister refer to all that had been put into it some years ago and he went on to recount the further sums that it would be necessary to put into it next year.  I think I heard him say that it would be necessary to put money into it up to 1975.  I believe that there is sufficient money in it already and that no more should be put into it until there is substantial evidence that it is going to pay its way.  I do not ask that it should make a profit, but I do ask that the supply should be made available for customers all over Ireland both for power and light at a reasonable price. I say that it should be an enterprise to be looked forward to by those who are responsible for the education of our youth, as well as the parents of our young people, as a place where honest and decent employment may be found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The omnipotence of this Board is complete.  Even the Minister, when he was speaking the other day, had to say that he did not know anything about certain questions that were asked, that he only knew what was in the report, that he has no control over <Col N="1542" /> the Board and he knows nothing of what is happening there.  He has to be satisfied, just as we have to be satisfied, with the statements of accounts submitted every year.  That is not right considering that this enterprise enters so much into the industrial life of the country.  Surely the Minister should have control.  Surely somebody should have control.  Somebody should be empowered to say: &ldquo;You may do this, or you may do that,&rdquo; or &ldquo;you may not do this or that.&rdquo;  What is the position?  Is the employment under this Board good employment? The Corporation of Dublin paid good wages to artisans, skilled and unskilled, and to its clerical officers. £60,000 a year was the wages pay-roll of the working men for the period I was there.  Nearly £30,000 was paid to the clerical officers.  That was almost £100,000 paid out when the Pigeon House was working and the Corporation had control of its own supply.  What are the wages paid now?  I asked that question the other day.  The Minister said he presumed that the wages paid were under the control of the trades unions.</P>
    <P>Here is a case that happened recently.  The son of a very good citizen, a man who gave good work to his country and to his city in his day, was employed by the Shannon Board. His wages were £1 5s. per week.  He was a fine presentable, well-educated lad.  He came into me some time ago and he asked me could I get him a position.  I asked him: &ldquo;Where were you working?&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;I was working on the Shannon Board.&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;Why did you not keep working there?&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;I could not.&rdquo;  I asked him why.  He said: &ldquo;They reduced my wages.&rdquo;  I asked: &ldquo;What wages had you?&rdquo;&ldquo;Twenty-five shillings a week,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;What did they reduce your wages for?&rdquo; I asked. He said: &ldquo;They brought in some new machine to do part of the work I was doing and they cut me 5/- per week. They reduced my wages to £1.  I could not stick it, and I would refuse to stick it for anybody.&rdquo;  If that is the type of wages that are paid there to operatives who are not in any trade union, I certainly commend the whole position to my neighbours here, the <Col N="1543" /> Labour Deputies, and ask them to look into it.  I shall quote another case to show the omnipotence of this Board. Three men came into me 12 or 18 months ago to know if I could get them on the Corporation Bureau for work.  They said they had been working at the Pigeon House and had been pensioned.  I asked: &ldquo;Have you got the pensions still?&rdquo;  They replied: &ldquo;No, we compounded for a certain sum with the Board.  The Board bought our pensions and we spent the money. We thought that if we got the money into our hands it would be better for us.  We have the money spent now and we are trying to get work again.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I did my best to get them on the Corporation Bureau for some work, but just imagine a great Board like this getting power to compound working men's pensions&mdash;peddling for them. Who supervises the Board?  The Minister ought to know.  There should be some steps taken to see that these omnipotent powers shall not remain with the Board.  Here is another example of what they can do.  Of course, they do it under their Act of Parliament, the Act of Parliament which puts them beyond even the control of this House.  They erect in many places great poles for their wires.  Some of these poles in the streets of Dublin are all right.  They are painted, silver painted, but in other places they put up railway sleepers, great black tarred things, as high as this ceiling, and they put them anywhere they like.  Several protests have been made by the Corporation against the erection of these poles, but to no avail.  A well-known law case occurred some years ago in which a lady, who lived out in Clonskea, I think, disputed their right to erect poles on her lawn.  She lost the case, and, I think, some of them told her that they could, if they wished, put poles in her drawing-room and right out through the roof of her house.  I might mention also that they exercised this power in an unfair way in an area on the south side, in which the Corporation are carrying out a big housing scheme, an area in which we are endeavouring to perpetuate the historical associations of the place.  Little <Col N="1544" /> garden plots are provided in front of each workman's house.  It will be scarcely believed that the Board have erected these railway-sleeper poles on some of these lawns.  All we could do was to protest against it.  If this happened in another place they would not be allowed to erect these poles or to have wires dangling out of them all over the country.  They would be made to put the wires under the ground. We had no power to compel them to do so or we might.  I forget really some of the matters to which I wished to refer owing to the interlude with the Chair.  The position is as I have described it, and I respectfully suggest to the Minister that he should get powers to enable him to be the man on top in these matters.</P>
    <P>I think no more money should be put into it until it shows real signs of being able to stand by itself.  The sum of £3,000,000 is wanted under this Bill.  Is that on top of the millions that they have already got?  I do not know that that is good enough at all.  I may be wrong.  I do not know very much about electricity, although I served fairly good term in the Corporation in connection with it.  In the first year of the war, 1914, the Corporation set up a special committee to make some important inquiries as to the working of their system, at that time, and as to its future prospects.  An expert named Dollan was brought over from England.  He was a very able and solid man.  I was chairman of that committee and acted upon the committee itself from its inception.  I had very extensive conversations with that man, and rather exhaustive meetings of the committee and I got to know a great deal about the system.  From the acquaintance I have had with the question, I think I am fairly entitled to speak.  From the reports that I have read recently, in connection with the Shannon scheme, I am satisfied that it is an enterprise in which no more money should be invested unless, and until, the Executive Council are fortified by the best opinions they can get as to the future of that enterprise. I think that is reasonable.  I do not think there is anything in that suggestion of mine to which any <Col N="1545" /> businessman could object.  I have taken my own view of the situation and worked out my view of things generally.  I finish up by emphasising the fact that some group should have powers over this Board, and that the ultimate control should rest with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and not with the Board.  The citizens will then be sure of having some say in the matter.  At the present time they have none and I do not think that that is a condition of affairs that ought to be allowed to exist in this year of civilisation, 1934.</P>

      <P>I agree, to a great extent, with what Deputy Kelly has said.  I think the Minister should have control over the Board.  Electricity consumers in Limerick have a particular grievance, even greater than the consumers in Dublin and in Cork. The consumers in Limerick pay a higher price for their electricity than the consumers elsewhere.  I cannot see why that should be so.  We, in Limerick, had a very complete system of our own until the Government swooped down and took control.  There were some men dismissed as a result of the E. S. B. taking control and I shall ask the Minister to look into the grievances of these men.  Men were dismissed from the Corbally Mills as a result of the E.S.B. taking over, and I think that some provision should be made for these unfortunate men as a result of losing their employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask a question about whatever amount of money is involved in this.  What amount of money does the Minister think it necessary to expend, say, in this calendar year and the next calendar year?  I want to ask if provision is being made for the supplying of that money out of whatever was got in the last National Loan.  And, if so, at what rate of interest will the Minister now provide that such money should be lent to the Board?  Is there to be a charge of 5 per cent. irrespective of whether money now-a-days can be borrowed at that rate or not?  If the Minister thinks the rate of interest that is going to be charged is oppressive, <Col N="1546" /> in consideration of the terms on which money can be borrowed, I would like to ask him if he would not contemplate giving the Board itself, under proper supervision and guidance, of course, power to make an issue of its own or to look for public subscriptions. It would possibly have to be guaranteed.  It is possible that for a specific purpose an issue at this moment, when there is abundant money lying around at a cheap rate, could be borrowed at a rate of interest that would be for the benefit, in the present instance, of the Board and the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were a certain number of other matters dragged into this debate. I do not intend to refer to them at any length here now because, in my opinion, this is not the proper occasion. The accounts were published.  It was a consideration accepted by everybody in the House that the return the Board had got to make for the big sums of money they had got, and the big advantage in credit they had got from the State, there should be, once a year, an opportunity given to members of the House if they wished to avail themselves of it, to discuss the affairs of the Board.  The accounts have been presented and I presume it is still the case that if a day were sought, or a period sought, to discuss these accounts it would be granted. Upon these accounts matters that have been referred to here could be most properly raised.  But since matters got started irrespective of what the case may be, may I say this:&mdash;The Board must show on the scheme of arrangements made with them that the payments that are due from them are likely to be made.  Deputy Kelly should pause and consider what the obligations imposed upon the Board are.  They have to repay the State all the outstanding moneys.  They do that by interest payments and by payments from the sinking fund and they have to do what no commercial concern does at the present time: they have to pile up a reserve with the result that if that scheme and that other scheme of payments works out, and is continued to the end of the sinking fund payment, the Shannon Board will find <Col N="1547" /> themselves in the position that they will have repaid the State and repaid the interest on the moneys which the State was then able to borrow and this would enable another Shannon scheme to be built if required.  I make the boast that the system is able to supply Dublin with electricity at a cheaper rate than ever it got it before.</P>

They can be got if the Deputy cares to look up the debates from the year 1925 to 1927.  I omit one or two places in the country where by a lucky chance bankrupt concerns were bought over by people in possession of them when the Shannon Board came in, and because they had no overhead charges to pay and because they got into their possession bankrupt concerns, they possibly supplied electricity cheaper than the Board is now supplying, but in the main electricity has been supplied everywhere for all purposes at a cheaper rate than ever before in the country.</P>

      <P>It is so.  Let me repeat again for all purposes.  A point can be made about it that in some places there is more charged for public lighting than previously, but the surplus gained by that is offset in other ways.  There are other cases in which public lighting has been given at much less than before, and the private consumer has to pay more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not Limerick. The accounts are before us, and we can have it discussed.  I should like to have a debate raised on figures, not on statements.  I am cutting out Killarney and other small places where, through accidental circumstances, there was a peculiarly cheap provision of electricity. With the exception of one or two places, I want to repeat that I believe there is no place in which there is not now less being paid for the total amount of electricity being consumed by all types of users than before.  If that is the case, and the Board repay the capital and meanwhile are paying interest on outstanding moneys, and if the Board is, in addition to that, at any rate in the way, because the time has not yet come, to pile up such resources that at the end of the sinking fund period there will be such an accumulated amount as will rebuild a second Shannon scheme without charge to anyone, it is a phenomenal achievement.  This is a matter that should be discussed when the accounts are before us and not at this tail-end of a Fifth Reading debate to get more money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it, as a matter of course, that when the Minister comes to the House and, without any explanation other than he gave, asks for more money for the Board, it means that he is satisfied with the progress that the Board has made.  I am satisfied of that from another circumstance, that as far as I read the accounts the Minister has made no change in the arrangement with regard to the repayment of interest charges, the general organisation,  <Col N="1549" /> in so far as he has control over it, and the arrangements that were there when he came in.  Consequently, I take it from that silence and tacit accord that he is pleased with what is happening.  If he requests this House to give him more money for embarkation on this scheme further, it means that he sees the Board has a future and that the Shannon electricity concern is on a sound footing and is likely to be the success that is claimed for it.</P>

      <P>This Bill provides a sum of £1,160,000 to the Electricity Supply Board to enable it to carry on all the functions entrusted to it by the electricity Supply Act &mdash; the function of distributing electricity, trading in electrical equipments, maintaining its works and undertaking various investigations in relation to the electricity supply.  No part of the money provided under the Bill will be expended upon generation.  That is not necessary at this stage, because last year we passed a Bill providing money to meet the cost of the additions at Ardnacrusha and certain extensions in the generating capacity at the Pigeon House.  Undoubtedly, some part of this expenditure on the Pigeon House water supply, arrangements for bringing in coal, and the expenditure at Ardnacrusha on the deepening of the Shannon, will increase the efficiency of the Board's plant, but that is necessary expenditure in any event. It arises out of the growth of the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That will lead to better generation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I explained that the main purpose for which the capital is required is to finance the natural growth of the system.  There is, year after year, an increase in the demand for electricity arising out of the more <Col N="1550" /> extended use of electricity in industry, the more extended use of electricity for household purposes, housing developments that are proceeding, and the change in the habits of the people. That increase is experienced in every country.  It is reckoned that we should have an increased growth equivalent to 14 per cent. per annum.  It has been found possible in other countries to secure an annual increase at the rate of 14 per cent. per annum.  We are not getting that here yet.  We are getting near it, but we have not yet succeeded in getting it.  It will be necessary for us to get a growth in consumption of about that dimension before we can be satisfied with the position of the scheme.  The scheme is working out, as Deputies are aware, despite the fact that it has met with difficulties.  The Board, from the day it was established and entrusted with the responsibility, has met with difficulties which were not foreseen before its establishment. These difficulties have had their effect upon its finances and the general development of the scheme.  But, despite these difficulties, progress is being made, progress which, in the circumstances, I think we can regard as satisfactory, although I do not think it will help the scheme or the Board to over-estimate what is being done.</P>
      <P>The accounts for 1932-3 are there. They show, on the face of them, a small surplus.  Deputies will have noted, however, that no provision is made for depreciation of the Board's plant. Depreciation, I think, is properly chargeable as a working expense, but no provision has yet been made for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any reserve being piled up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan referred to the obligations of the Board, its obligation to pay interest on the advances made under the previous Acts; its obligation to repay these advances, to provide a depreciation fund and to provide for a reserve fund capable of replacing the system at the end of a period of time.  The Board is meeting at present its interest charges.  It has not, however, commenced to repay, nor has it been asked to commence to repay, nor would <Col N="1551" /> it be able to commence repaying, the capital advanced.  It is not making provision for the depreciation of its plant and no reserve fund of the kind mentioned has been or is being built up as yet.  However, I do not want any false impression to arise out of what I have said, because the financial position of the Board is improving with each year that passes and in due course it will be possible to appoint a day on which the repayment of capital will commence and also to contemplate the provision of an adequate depreciation reserve.  It was originally contemplated that the appointed day would be in this year, but that, it appears, will not be possible.</P>
      <P>I cannot tell Deputy McGilligan whether the Minister for Finance will make the advances under this Bill out of the proceeds of the recent loan or from any other sources. The advances are made from the Exchequer.  The question of the rate of interest is one that is at present under consideration following representations from the Board.  The rate of interest was fixed by our predecessors and it has operated up to the present but, having regard to the lower rate at which the State is now able to borrow money, it is clear that the matter must come up for reconsideration.  The question of giving the Board power to raise its own capital is also one for consideration.  No decision has yet been made, nor has it been clearly established that it would be in the interests of the Board that that power should be given them.  It is unlikely any change in the law will be made during the course of the present year, whatever we may decide to do next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the matters raised by Deputy Kelly were, of course, fully discussed in the Dáil on many occasions in the past.  I think we should not confuse the Shannon scheme with the functions of the Electricity Supply Board.  The Electricity Supply Board is operating a national electricity supply.  It has control of the various generating units and is under obligation to supply electricity subject to certain limitations in relation to the price charged.  The <Col N="1552" /> institution of a national supply, publicly owned and controlled by a Board appointed by the Government was, I think, a very useful step, something which is bound to be conducive to industrial development and the public convenience.  It is not necessary to discuss now all the steps that were taken from the date upon which it was decided to initiate the Shannon scheme down to this year, or to consider whether they were wise or unwise.  The fact is that the Electricity Supply Board is in possession of the Shannon works, in possession of other generating equipment throughout the country, is controlling the transmission and distribution systems and is carrying out certain functions entrusted to it by law.  It is not possible to reverse that position.  We must give that Board whatever support it requires, we must provide it with the capital that will enable it to finance the growth of its system and, in other ways, help it to achieve its task.</P>
    <P>It may be that there is a case for exercising more control over it than was originally intended.  The initiators of the scheme decided on an amendment in 1931, when a section was introduced in the Act of that year limiting the power of the Board to secure capital advances from the Minister for Finance only when the Minister for Industry and Commerce had been satisfied that the moneys were properly and reasonably required. That limitation was considered necessary under the circumstances of that year.  It is now being considered whether that limitation can be removed or not.  It is possibly true that the Board have acted in a manner open to complaint in the placing of distribution poles and the like.  My experience has been that when representations were made to them, directly or through my Department, these representations always received fair consideration.  If they could be met without undue inconvenience they were met by the Board. I have no control over employment by the Board and, if Deputies desire to base complaints concerning either the rate of wages paid or the men employed on particular works, they have as much right to make those <Col N="1553" /> complaints direct to the members of the Electricity Supply Board as I would have.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to mention one matter in order to elucidate a certain statement.  The Minister said he could not be satisfied with the position until there was a 14 per cent. increase per annum in the consumption. Does that percentage apply apart from the new expenditure by way of development which is to take place under this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should have said a 14 per cent. increase per annum in revenue.  The Deputy will understand that expenditure has been continuously proceeding upon the improvement of the transmission system and <Col N="1554" /> the extension of the distribution system, upon bringing current to places where it is not supplied at the moment, bringing current to consumers. All that expenditure will involve in due course additional heavy expenditure upon generation, and in order to ensure that when that heavier expenditure has to take place the Board will have sufficient revenue to meet the capital charges thus arising, an annual increase of 14 per cent. per annum in revenue appears to be required.  The increase at present is 11 per cent. or 11½ per cent., but it is getting up to the point of 14 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>With that increase, if he attains it, does the Minister believe that the Board will be in the position to start building up the reserve fund about which Deputy McGilligan spoke?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is a 14 per cent. increase year by year for some years to come, the Board will then be in a position to meet all its interest charges, and make provision for repayments over the periods allotted to them for the various items on which expenditure was made long ago, and also to make provision for necessary reserves.  It does leave the Board in this position, that at the end of the 30 years, which is the sinking fund period for certain portions of the work, all the money will have been repaid and there will have been piled up such a sum as either, if saved, would rebuild that portion of the works or, if expended, would have kept that portion of the works in first-class condition.  That is the achievement.  I think the Minister might also say that, if one takes the percentage increase year by year on the previous year's revenue, as from the beginning of the scheme to date, there is more than 14 per cent. over the whole period.  Last year or the year before may not be quite as full as 14 per cent., but taking the whole period, there is more than 14 per cent. shown over a period of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, of course, there was a great increase as between the <Col N="1555" /> second and first.  The Board should be expected to meet all its working expenses, and I include in that depreciation. It is required also to repay the advances from the Minister for Finance, and in addition it should provide also a reserve capable of meeting all contingencies that are going to arise from time to time.  There was about this time last year a very severe snowstorm which did a good deal of damage through the transmission system and a very considerable amount was required to make good that damage.  Such expenditure should not have to be met by fresh capital advances.</P>

These were called the first and second Shannon development schemes.  Deputy Thrift's point is that the second stage, as understood, is not being now inaugurated and the Minister said &ldquo;No.&rdquo; These different developments are no longer now as clear cut as when expressed in the experts report.

      <P>An application was received for a trade loan guarantee in respect of a loan to be raised for the purpose of developing a certain building proposition in the State.  That was two years ago.  The question of the legality of such a guarantee was considered, and I was duly advised that there was full legal power to give the guarantee in respect of a loan for such purpose.  The question of policy was then considered, and it was decided that the Trade Loans Acts would be used for such purposes where <Col N="1557" /> large scale building operations were involved, either in the development of new areas or involving a very large number of houses.  The particular application upon which these questions arose was in itself not proceeded with. It was dropped after certain discussions had taken place, and last year another application of the same kind was received and was referred in the ordinary way to the Advisory Committee.  It was favourably reported on by the Advisory Committee and approved of by me and by the Minister for Finance.  In accordance with the usual practice a letter was sent to the applicants informing them of the Government's willingness to give the guarantee, and advising them to proceed with the negotiations for the loan.  The applicants acted upon that advice and entered into negotiations about the loan, and started the work.  When, however, the preparation of the Debenture deed was being undertaken, certain eminent lawyers were consulted. In the minds of some of them a doubt arose as to whether there was in fact legal power to guarantee a loan for this purpose.  Some of those concerned in the discussion held that there was adequate power under the existing law.  Some held there was not. Under these circumstances the Attorney-General advised that it was preferable to put the matter beyond all doubt by the introduction of a Bill of this kind.  This Bill is therefore to remove doubts.  If the Bill were not made retrospective and this is what the amendment proposes to do&mdash; the purpose of the Bill would be defeated and serious complications would arise.  The acceptance of this amendment and the others would nullify everything that was done already, and would necessitate the applicants proceeding with the fresh application which would have to be referred again to the Advisory Committee, and the normal procedure followed.  Having regard to the fact that the Government had intimated to the parties concerned, according to the regular procedure, their willingness to give a guarantee, and that action had been taken by them before the legal <Col N="1558" /> doubts arose, it would be unjust to have the amendment accepted.</P>
      <P>That view is strengthened by the fact that eminent counsel consulted and those who have advised me on the matter are of opinion that the Bill is not necessary, and that there is adequate power under the law at present. However, as the amount involved was the large sum of £50,000, it was felt that as there was some doubt it would be better to remove that doubt. Remember arrangements had been already made, and the applicants had entered into certain commitments on the strength of the letter sent them. There would be a substantial loss if the matter had to be gone over again. I gathered that the Bill had received general acceptance, judging from the fact that no discussion took place upon the Second Reading.  I believe that the submission of these three amendments on the Paper is due to a misunderstanding of the position.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) Each of the following persons shall for the purposes of this Act be a national of Saorstát Eireann, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a) a person born in Saorstát Eireann or the area now comprised in Saorstát Eireann; <Col N="1560" /> (b) a person who at the relevant time is and for not less than five consecutive years immediately preceeding that time has been ordinarily resident in Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    <P>As a preliminary point, I wish to raise a question about Government amendments. I think the Minister asked how did I conclude that there were to be any Government amendments.  I should like to quote from col. 1339, volume 50, of the Official Report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Mr. Lemass: I think they should have.  Deputy Dockrell referred to getting a definition of &ldquo;national.&rdquo; There is necessity for a definition and it will be inserted in the Bill. It was omitted through an oversight. The Unemployment Assistance Act has a definition, and I think it is the best of the various definitions that we have had from time to time.  It is also necessary to get a definition of the phrase &ldquo;manufactured in&rdquo; so as to define the percentage of value that must be added by a process of manufacture in any country to enable goods to be defined as manufactured in that country.  That will be dealt with on the Report Stage.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Minister has in mind.  Of course, if he is accepting those amendments I do not suppose there is any point in it, but perhaps he will tell us what the idea is of Deputies bringing forward amendments on Committee Stage and the Government bringing forward amendments on the Report Stage.  I suggest that the Government amendments ought to come forward on Committee Stage, and be debated side by side with those from Deputies.  I do not want in any way to suggest that the Government should be curtailed in bringing forward amendments on Report Stage, but I suggest that, on Report Stage, only amendments which arise out of the discussion in Committee should be brought forward.  I think the more nearly a Bill emerging from Committee Stage appears in its final form the better.  I should like to hear from the Minister what he thinks of my remarks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as the matter of getting a definition of &ldquo;national&rdquo; for the purpose of Section 6 is concerned, <Col N="1561" /> I decided I could not improve on the amendment put forward by the Deputy.  That relieves me from the obligation to produce an amendment on that point.  On the other point, I had certain amendments prepared but thought it desirable that we should have a discussion in Committee before submitting them, as some points might emerge in Committee that would involve a change in the form of the amendments.  There are, in fact, three or four drafting points in respect of which changes will have to be made in the Bill, but the amendments to effect those will be brought forward on the Report Stage.</P>

Surely the best place for points to emerge is precisely on the debate on the precise form of amendment which he is going to submit. After that, there should be an opportunity of amending that particular amendment which he brings forward. It is quite obvious that the reason which the Minister has given is not sound.  It looks more as if the Minister's mind is not quite clear, and <Col N="1562" /> he is rushing the Committee Stage before he has the amendment ready. It is a wrong procedure altogether.</P>

      <P>The Minister is not prepared to accept that.  Then there was a third point.  The Minister has said that he would like to have had the advantage of the discussion in Committee in bringing forward his amendment on the Report Stage.  What is sauce for the goose is surely sauce for the gander.  I know we would have liked to have seen what was in the mind of the Government on Committee procedure.  The Minister appears to have accepted our amendments, so that there is not very much in that, but as a question of principle it is much better if Government amendments come forward on Committee.  As I say, nobody would object to points arising on Committee being again brought forward on Report Stage, or amendments moved in accordance with them.  For instance, if in the course of this Bill any question arises that has not been foreseen, and the Minister has not yet brought forward <Col N="1563" /> amendments, it places us in a very false position.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>At the present time, goods manufactured in or produced in the Saorstát, exported from the Saorstát and reimported are not charged with the duty chargeable on imported goods of the same class.  That procedure has worked quite satisfactorily and there is no requirement as to the percentage of value that must be added to these goods by a process of manufacture here to bring them within the definition of goods manufactured here.  The procedure under this Bill will work in precisely the same <Col N="1564" /> way as in respect of customs duties at the present time and I consider that it would be undesirable to complicate that procedure by bringing in the question of the percentage of value, which would involve, in relation to these goods, fairly elaborate investigations by the Revenue Commissioners, or else, the submission by the importers of them of evidence in respect of their origin which it might be very difficult for them to obtain.  I think the sub-section might be improved by putting in the word &ldquo;produced&rdquo; as well as the word &ldquo;manufactured&rdquo; so that it will apply to articles which are manufactured or produced in Saorstát Eireann, because the term &ldquo;manufactured&rdquo; may have a narrower meaning than was originally contemplated.  It might, perhaps, exclude raw materials of some kind which did not undergo some industrial process.  If the phrase &ldquo;manufactured in or produced in&rdquo; is used in the Bill, I think there is less reason than ever for putting a percentage of value to bring articles within definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently, the Minister has something entirely different in his mind from what we contemplated in moving this amendment. The Minister seems to contemplate goods that are walked out of Ireland, manufactured and walked back again. I submit that they constitute a very small class compared with goods that would be taken from Ireland and worked up into a still further stage. That is what I had in mind and the Minister has not dealt with that point. Take, for the sake of argument, carrageen moss.  That might be brought across and manufactured into certain articles and then come back here representing 25 per cent. or so of the manufactured article.  I do not think that the Minister ought to shut out something which had a very substantial amount of goods of Irish origin in its composition.  That is the point I had in mind.  I quite appreciate the case the Minister has mentioned but it, as I have said, is merely a case of walking manufactured goods out of Ireland and marching them back again the variations that take place in which <Col N="1565" /> being a very small percentage or a very large percentage.  I admit that there is a certain line at which you might say: &ldquo;We ought to exclude goods that contain Irish manufacture below a certain percentage,&rdquo; but I suggest to the Minister that if he wants to encourage the export of Irish goods, he must be prepared to agree to reciprocity. I suggest that one of the best possible means of ensuring the export of Irish goods would be to say that certain advantages would accrue to manufactured articles coming into this country which contain 25 per cent. of Irish goods manufactured or produced in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear that this amendment does not achieve that. The sub-section is intended to deal with the case of goods exported and reimported in the same form&mdash;as might well happen if a firm were sending a consignment of goods to somebody, say, in Great Britain, which were returned on being found unsuitable on delivery-and it is to prevent inconvenience arising out of the fact that goods exported might be returned that the section is brought in.  In so far as there is a problem arising out of the fact that manufactured goods coming in may have Saorstát raw materials in them, there is the existing procedure which is working quite satisfactorily. The Deputy mentioned the case of carrageen moss.  Irish carrageen moss is used, I understand, in the production of varnish.  There is a duty on varnish, but the duty is on varnish, no matter what the materials of which it is manufactured are.  If carrageen moss were sent out and came back as carrageen moss, there would be no duty chargeable on it, but if it comes back as varnish there is a duty chargeable. You could not have any other procedure. The practice that would operate under this Bill is precisely the same as that now being operated by the Revenue Commissioners in respect of customs duties.  The section in the Finance Act which appears, in fact, in every Finance Resolution which is brought before the Dáil, is precisely what is there&mdash;that the duty chargeable under this Order shall not apply to <Col N="1566" /> goods manufactured in or exported from Saorstát Eireann on re-importation. There is no such provision as the Deputy suggests, because the Deputy's amendment, if inserted, would mean that the concession would be limited to goods which had been manufactured to the extent of 25 per cent. here before exportation.  Such goods might be re-imported outside of quota restrictions or customs duties.  The Deputy's aim is quite clearly a different one and it is not met by his amendment at all. It is that we might give a special concession to certain classes of goods if Irish raw materials were used in their production.  That is an entirely different matter, however, and not really related to this section, nor is it covered by the amendment.</P>

      <P>That is not by any means clear from what the Minister said, and there is no such provision in the Bill, I think, dealing with it. Take another case.  An article is sent out of this country to have certain finishing processes carried out upon it. Does that come within the quota system or not?  Would that be one of the cases in which an article would be exempt from the quota system, or <Col N="1567" /> would it be excluded?  There is no method of knowing so far as the Bill is concerned.  In the other case, it is a matter on which they may decide to charge a certain duty on it, but here it is a question of whether or not we will exclude it altogether.

At the present time there is a general provision in the finance law which enables us to permit into Saorstát Eireann free of any duty chargeable articles intended to undergo a further process of manufacture here and then to be exported.  That is the law at present.  In so far as this Bill is concerned, these articles could come in whether we had a quota order or not. If there was no quota order, then the position would be as it is at present. If there was a quota order in force they would be subject to the quota restrictions.  The particular point that Deputy Dockrell is trying to raise in relation to the Bill is the advisability of excluding from the scope of the quota order goods that might be otherwise subject to quota restrictions: goods which have in them a certain percentage of Saorstát raw materials.</P>

      <P>That is a separate question which is not really related to this Bill.  It is a question of general industrial policy which is not provided for by the Deputy's amendment.  The Deputy's amendment has the effect of confining the operation of the concession granted by sub-section (4) to articles which were manufactured in the Saorstát: to articles which have 25 per cent. of their value created by Saorstát manufacture.  The Bill, as it stands, relates only to articles manufactured here.  I propose to widen it to articles manufactured &ldquo;or produced&rdquo; here.  I think it is advisable <Col N="1568" /> that we should insert a section which will enable articles subject to a quota, imported under licence and subsequently re-exported, to be brought in again outside a quota order.  Cases of that kind are not likely to arise frequently.  One can imagine where they may arise, and I think an amendment to that effect will be necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to make provision in the Bill to extend the term &ldquo;manufactured or produced.&rdquo;  That will apply not only to this section, but throughout the whole Bill.

      <P>The Minister has not dealt with the point that I raised at all: the question of how far he is going to use these quota restrictions as a bargaining counter, and of saying that articles containing a certain quantity of goods produced or manufactured in this country are going to be outside the quota restrictions.  Now I quite realise that the adoption of my suggestion may complicate the procedure in connection with the quotas.  At the same time it is going to introduce a very desirable precedent from this country's point of view.  I suggest to the Minister that if he could ensure that everything coming into this country contained 25 per cent. of materials raised here or goods manufactured here, he would have made an exceedingly good bargain for this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That can be done under the Bill as it stands.  You define in your quota order the goods to which the quota restrictions apply.  In doing so you can exclude from that description the articles that you do not want to be subject to a quota restriction. If you want, for instance, to have a quota for varnish you can make an order applying it to varnish other than varnish in which Irish carrigeen had been used in the manufacture.  The same could be done in regard to <Col N="1569" /> woollen cloth, and quite a number of examples could be given.  The quota order only specifies the class of goods the importation of which is to be subject to quota restrictions.  To avoid misunderstanding let me say that the main purpose of the Bill is to provide additional powers to protect industrial development here.  Secondly, it gives us an opportunity of negotiating commercial agreements with other countries.  In so far as it is likely to be operated, the main idea behind it will be to promote industrial production at home.</P>

      <P>While I agree that provision can be made not to apply quota orders to goods, containing a certain percentage of Irish materials or manufactures, such a procedure, I suggest to the Minister, needlessly complicates the making of quota orders.  I would like to point out to him that when people in foreign countries are able to read the Bill as passed, they can see that they are exempt from certain provisions of it if my amendment is inserted.</P>

I suggest to the Minister that if he inserts my amendment in the Bill, and says boldly: &ldquo;We are prepared to exempt from the quota orders goods containing the following percentages of Irish materials or manufactures,&rdquo; you immediately open the door for outside people to consider how far they can utilise Irish goods in connection with their business.  I quite agree that you can do it either way, but clearly the method that I propose will give the Minister's Department less trouble if you set out boldly in the Bill that goods containing a certain percentage of Irish manufactures do not come under the quota order.</P>

      <P>I promised to mention the amendments that it will be necessary to make to the Bill.  Sub-section (3) of this section provides that where an order is revoked either by the Executive Council or by the failure of the Dáil to approve of it, the Executive Council cannot make another order of the same kind.  That appears to be a desirable safeguard.  Otherwise, the Executive Council could just proceed to make orders every six months, and thus defeat control by the Dáil.  There is, however, a class of case that is not provided for: that is where an order is revoked for some <i>bona fide</i> reason, and subsequently it is decided, perhaps a year hence, to revive it again.  As the sub-section is drafted it would be impossible to do that without fresh legislation.  It is proposed to insert some provision in the Bill, making it clear that where an order is revoked in that way, that is for some <i>bona fide</i> reason, it can be revived with the approval of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>It will, of course, be necessary to insert the amendment to which reference was made on the Second Reading: that is a definition of the term &ldquo;goods manufactured or produced in.&rdquo;  The omission of the sub-section arose out of the fact, as I have explained, that this Bill and the Preferential Rates Bill were prepared as one Bill, and subsequently had to be divided.  It will be necessary to insert a section which will define the percentage value that must be added in the country specified in order to make these goods entitled to the description of being &ldquo;manufactured&rdquo; in that country.  It will be precisely the same provision as exists under the customs law at the present time in relation to a preferential rate.  The preferential rate is applicable only if the goods have had 25 per cent. of their value added in the country entitled to the rate.  A country may be specified in a special quota order, and <Col N="1571" /> in respect of the goods produced in that country there will have to be a similar provision&mdash;that, in order to become entitled to inclusion in that special quota, a stated percentage of value will have had to be added there. It is also necessary, to avoid customs complications, to take power to make the order apply to goods &ldquo;manufactured in,&rdquo; or &ldquo;produced in.&rdquo; or &ldquo;consigned from,&rdquo; or goods both &ldquo;manufactured in&rdquo; and &ldquo;consigned from.&rdquo;  The necessity for that will appear on examination.  In the majority of cases in which goods arrived here, the only information available in relation to them is the country from which they are consigned. In the ordinary course, that is the same country as the country of origin, but it is not always so.  The wisest course is to take power to specify that the quota applies in any of the three cases&mdash; manufactured or produced in, or consigned from, or both conditions combined.</P>

      <P>I wonder if it is.  On the point which I raised on Second Reading, I am not quite satisfied with the Minister's answer.  I have in mind not the case of an importer in Dublin, but the case of an importer down the country who is accustomed to get in, say, £1,000 worth of goods.  The Government declare a quota in regard to that particular class of goods.  In future, therefore, he will be entitled to get only £800 worth of goods under that quota.  I gather that he may be compelled to get out four quota orders if you have quota agreements with a number of countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  The procedure envisaged by the Bill is: Where a special quota is made in favour of one country, both the special quota and the balance of the main quota are considered separate quotas. Let us take the case of a person who <Col N="1572" /> wants a thousand sacks of flour.  I mention flour because it is excluded from the Bill.  It belongs to a class of goods which could be easily contemplated as subject to a quota arrangement. Let us assume that there is a quota order made in respect of flour, with a 25 per cent. special quota in favour of France.  In respect of the 75 per cent. of the open quota, all importers who have got themselves registered and wish to apply, apply for whatever quantity they wish.  This man may apply for a thousand sacks under the open quota.  If, in the various circumstances set out in the Bill, it is possible to give him that amount, he gets it.  If not, a pro rata reduction is made in his application, in which case, if he wants to make up the balance of his thousand sacks, he must make application under the special quota.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely the case I made.  A man doing originally a thousand pounds worth of business may, under the general quota, be reduced to £800.  By the special quota arrangement, he may be reduced further.  Let us suppose that he will get more favourable terms under the open quota than under the special quota.  Therefore, everybody will apply to get as much as possible under the open quota.  In practice, the importer down the country will be compelled to have about three quota orders.  He may be compelled, further, to open business with countries with which he had never done business before and with which it is hardly worth his while to do business.  Under the general quota, he may be reduced from £1,000 to £800.  Then, there may be a further reduction of 20 per cent., so that he may be reduced practically to half the business he had been doing, though that was not the intention.  Otherwise, there would be unfair discrimination. It may not be worth while for small importers down the country to open up business with new countries and you may, therefore, benefit a couple of importing firms in Dublin at the expense of importers down the country. That is the case that I made and the Minister has not convinced me that, in a quota order of that kind, very great <Col N="1573" /> damage may not be imposed on a small trader down the country, while a big importer here in Dublin may find it easy to get into touch with other countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Judging by our own experience on the continent it is necessary, in every case, to deal with some individual importer.  The principal cases from which our experience arises are in connection with the operations of the Dairy Disposals Board, which is a semi-Government concern.  The experience derived in that respect may not be generally applicable, but in all cases in which butter, eggs or bacon were exported to any continental country, under a quota arrangement in existence in that country, they have had to designate a national there to act for them.  It is to him that licences to import are issued.  He receives these licences under contract between himself and the importer here.  He exercises those licences on behalf of importers here.  In the case of the operations of the Disposals Board, it has always been the practice to designate one man who will get the licences, bring in the goods and distribute them to the importers who require them.  In the majority of cases, the same practice will develop here if special quotas are made for a large number of goods.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I suggested, only in more exaggerated form.  The result is that importation will have to take place through a firm in Dublin, and the person now importing direct will not be able to import direct.  There will be a corresponding increase in the cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of flour, for instance, the practice was that a small number of firms dealt with the orders, but the flour went into every small port of the country direct to the wholesaler. He placed his order with one of a small number of firms, but he got his flour direct to wherever he wanted it.  The same procedure will obtain in this case. The issue of licences over a long period may be confined, in practice, to a small number, but the goods will come in direct to the person requiring them.</P>

      <P>They will have to be ordered through a person in Dublin.  That will impose extra cost on the person down the country.  I do not know what particular class of goods the Minister has in mind or to what particular class of goods he may apply this special quota.  Let us suppose that a quota is applied to the ordinary goods imported by a draper.  The circumstances may be such that the Minister will require a quota of that kind.  A number of these drapers are accustomed to import directly.  Now they will have to pay the expense of an agent here in addition to everything else.</P>

      <P>I know that the Minister is merely using it as an analogy. He spoke of a person who had applied for a thousand sacks of flour under the open quota.  Is the procedure going to be&mdash;because it is a very important point&mdash;that if they receive an application from &ldquo;A&rdquo; for 1,000 sacks of flour on the open quota and they find, for the sake of argument, that they can only allow him 750 sacks, are they going straight away to give him the 250 sacks on what you call the closed quota?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, then, there will have to be a fresh application.  When the pool is closed for the applications for the open quota and you find out what you have drawn, you would then have to make a fresh application on the limited quota.  Is that the position?</P>

You may find that the ship cannot be loaded, that it would have paid the importer to bring the goods into Dublin Bay and there to dump 25 per cent. of his cargo.  That position might easily arise where he had contracted for a certain amount of freight and was unable to fulfil it. When these negotiations are conducted by telegraph and telephone from foreign countries, it will be very difficult to tie that up and get variations from a Government Department. That is only one of the many difficulties that will present themselves in making these quota orders&mdash;to see that you do not upset a trade that is very delicately balanced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, of course, will appreciate that the only circumstances in which the imposition of a quota order with the intention of restricting quantity would be necessary is where home production in the particular commodity is already taking place.  In so far as certain steel and other constructional materials are concerned there would be no necessity for restricting quantity, although we might direct it to a certain channel.  But in such cases we would not wish to restrict quantity, but rather, the more that comes in the better we would like it.</P>

      <P>If you will apply the analogy of tariffs, as they operate at the present time, you will realise that a great many articles are being tariffed with the supposed effect of protecting manufacturers in this country, whereas they are really not being manufactured here at all.  With regard to what the Minister has said about diverting goods from one country to another, even where he says that you are only establishing quota orders where you have home manufacture, if you divert them from one country to another you may upset the balance in relation to shipping, etc.  For instance, you may be able to get 100 tons of steel from one particular country, whereas another country would laugh at an order for 1,000 tons of steel.</P>

    <P>Paragraph (b) of sub-section (2) reads: &ldquo;a partnership of which all the members are nationals of Saorstát Eireann and which has a place of business in Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;  That is entirely different to the Control of Manufactures Bill, and we want to exclude the words &ldquo;all the members are nationals of Saorstát Eireann,&rdquo; and substitute therefor &ldquo;more than half of the capital invested in the business is beneficially owned by an individual who is or two or more individuals each of whom is a national of Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;  It happens in the case of a great many firms, particularly of the older firms, in the city that they have in individual partnership, by reason of inheritance, persons who are related and who are resident outside Saorstát Eireann.  It would be most unfortunate to exclude those firms from the right of importing, which would mean practically putting them out of business.  I do not know whether the Minister intends that.  I am sure he does not, but I think that if he accepts the amendment, which is in the same form as the Control of Manufactures Bill, he will obviate that difficulty.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 7 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) For the purposes of this section goods which are imported into Saorstát Eireann and are cleared on or after the specified day shall be deemed to be in transit if the importer of such goods gives to the Minister reasonable proof that the despatch of such goods could not be prevented on account of the shortness of the period elapsing between the making of the order and the commencement of the preliminary period on the specified day.</P>
      <P>(2) Whenever the Executive Council has made a quota order the Minister shall issue to any person who applies in the prescribed manner therefor a licence expressed to authorise such person to import into Saorstát Eireann during the said preliminary period the specified quantity of goods to which the said quota order applies which were in transit on the specified day for his account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, a considerable time elapses in certain trades between the ordering and the delivery of goods.  Usually the manufacturers <Col N="1581" /> prepare their stock sheets and send them to customers in other countries. Protracted negotiations are then conducted in cases where there is difficulty in selling.  In other cases it may be that if a person has not sent a written order, he will not get the goods. Sometimes six months, and perhaps longer, might intervene between the ordering and delivery of goods.  Importers may not be able to tell to a month or two when goods will arrive. That is all the information they could give the Department.  The Minister will realise that there is a difference between ordering goods from a country where the ports are only open at certain times, and ordering from a neighbouring country.  A good deal of latitude would have to be allowed in cases where people <i>bona fide</i> ordered requirements a long time ahead.  I hope the Minister will take that position into account when making out the quota, because it will avoid a lot of agony amongst manufacturers who had raw materials ordered, if they knew definitely that they were protected so long as they could prove that the transaction was a <i>bona fide</i> one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Deputy's amendment is to secure that goods in transit can be imported any time after the making of a quota order; in other words, that they would not be subject to the quota order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>While in transit or where a definite order was given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has seen one side of the picture, but very clearly there is another side to it.  It may be precisely because goods are in transit, or have been ordered, that a quota order is made.  Perhaps the best way to illustrate that is to give a specific example.  Arrangements are being made for the establishment of a pottery works in the Saorstát.  A Press correspondent got hold of that information and it appeared in the newspapers. Within the course of a couple of weeks it was quite clear that a huge quantity of pottery was being brought to this country, in anticipation of a tariff being imposed, when the new works came into production.  Evidence was submitted to my Department that such <Col N="1582" /> transactions were taking place, with the result that we had to move quickly. We imposed upon all classes of pottery imported a duty of 100 per cent., with a licence provision under which we licensed the importation of the normal quantity of pottery goods until the home product was available.  If this Bill had been law at that date we would have acted under it in preference to an open licence clause, because one purpose of the Bill is to get rid of open licensing provisions and to substitute the more regular procedure under this Bill.  In that case a quota order would be made to effect the stoppage of goods in transit and ordered.  Power would have been required, because if we could not effectively stop these goods from coming into the country industrial damage would be definitely done, in so far as there would be sufficient to meet our requirements for a couple of years, and a project of considerable value would have been postponed until these stocks had been cleared.</P>
      <P>It is precisely because this Bill may be used for that purpose that a general section exempting from the scope of the quota order goods in transit or ordered could not be accepted.  There is a six weeks' period.  The Deputy will say, in relation to certain imports with which he is familiar, that the six weeks will not be sufficient.  Ordinarily it will be sufficient in respect of the greater number of goods in respect of which quota orders may be necessary, that is to say, six weeks will be more than sufficient to bring any goods in transit. It is intended that the more extensive powers possessed by the Minister to license imports during the first six weeks will be exercised to prevent hardship or difficulty arising because of sudden stoppage, in the case of goods in transit, or where orders may have to be filled or particular contracts carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as that six weeks is insufficient, the difficulties which the Deputy has in mind can only be met by the issue of licences under the quota. There is no reason to assume that that will not happen, particularly having regard to the fact that the classes of goods which are likely to <Col N="1583" /> require more than six weeks in order to clear themselves in transit, are not likely to be restricted in quantity under any quota.  The quantity is not likely to be limited, only the source. In so far as an order from one particular source is concerned, the quantity coming from that souce may be limited but it is only reasonable to assume that the powers in respect to the importation of articles of that kind will have to be exercised in such a manner that any difficulty could scarcely arise. The Deputy may reasonably assume that these powers will be exercised in a reasonable manner.  In fact, as the Deputy is aware, in respect to licensing powers that were acquired under an order, restricting for a period with a view to their ultimate prevention, the import of certain classes of goods, they were exercised in a manner designed to meet any general difficulties that might arise and even individual cases of difficulty, where the circumstances appeared to justify it.  They were exercised after the fullest possible consultation with the organisation speaking for the body of traders concerned in each case.  That is precisely what would happen here.</P>
    <P>The procedure that I contemplate would be: An order would be made; there would then be six weeks within which there would be a wide discretion as to the issue of licences to cover goods in transit, to keep up the ordinary supplies in the country or for any other reason.  During these six weeks, wherever consultations are necessary, will take place between the officers of the Department and the representatives of the trade likely to be affected.  Following these consultations, at the end of five weeks, the quota for the first period and the length of the period is announced.  In the meantime a register of importers has been prepared.  In every case that is likely to arise where goods of that class are involved, the first period and the quantity to be admitted during the first period will be probably fixed on a normal basis so as to ensure that no difficulty will arise.  It would be only when it comes to the operation of the <Col N="1584" /> second period that you might begin to restrict or to divert the imports in the manner decided upon originally.  It may not be possible to have that procedure in every case, but that will be the ordinary procedure.  I think the Deputy can be reasonably assured that these difficulties in so far as they arise can be met under the Bill, either during the six weeks' period or the first quota period.  There is no way of guaranteeing, by way of an amendment to the Bill, the admission outside the quota of goods in transit so as to meet the difficulty that the Deputy has in mind without at the same time defeating the main purpose of the Bill in every case which I have mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not deal with the question of an order being placed.  He limited himself to the question of the first six months. I am sure he realises that the six weeks' period does not dispose of the question of goods on order.  There is one peculiar phrase used by the Minister which I could not follow.  He said that in a large number of cases there was no restriction in quantity, but that there was in origin.  I do not see how you could have one without the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>When I said that there would be no restriction in quantity, I meant that there would be no attempt to reduce the quantity as against the other period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister talked of the case of a pottery manufacturer starting in this country and he said that that probably would be an instance of the principal justification for restricting imports.  I think everybody can see the justification for the Minister's saying, on the announcement that a new industry is going to be started which would involve some increase in the cost of the goods, that he is not going to allow three years' stock of these goods to be dumped into the country.  I think there would not be much argument about a case of that kind but you might have a person who, <i>bona fide</i>, in the ordinary way of trade, has placed a fairly large order for pottery, just before that announcement was made public.  I do not know how <Col N="1585" /> the Minister would deal with that matter.  He has suggested that really the only case where a restriction of that sort would come about would be where the Government were protecting native manufacturers.  I took quite a different reading from this Quota Bill, that it was to be used as a bargaining counter. That opens the door very much wider than merely considering the case of people who have, <i>bona fide</i>, started making goods in this country and who want protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister suggests that a manufacturer, contracting a long way ahead, need have no fear in contracting for his raw material but I should like to get an assurance from the Minister that that is not intended to interfere with contracts entered into by manufacturers with their sources of supply. Remember it is a terrible upset to a manufacturer to find, when certain classes of raw materials suit him and when he has been accustomed to deal with certain people, that he has to take up his roots, as it were, the minute a new quota order comes out and take his business to another country.  I should like to suggest to the Minister that there are certain cases where really 18 months' notice of a change would be required.  I can give him a case of, say, certain goods which embody design and where various catalogues have to be made up showing these designs.  The order is placed for a considerable supply of these goods four or five months before the goods arrive.  Then the merchant, manufacturer or distributor in this country is practically tied to trading in this class of goods for a whole year.  I should like to point out to the Minister that he may well destroy the livelihood of his own nationals if he is going to try to change a merchant or a manufacturer in this way during an intervening period.  I quite realise that there is something to be said for the manufacturer who is starting here but between his case and the quota system, or what appears to be contemplated under the quota system, there is a very wide gap.  Certainly, I am afraid that if the Minister cannot indicate what he means precisely, in a lot of cases people will be unable to embark on larger <Col N="1586" /> transactions with far distant countries, and will content themselves with merely ordering from hand to mouth from nearer neighbours.  In that way the country will inevitably pay more for the particular goods which are imported freely at the present time. I would like the Minister to consider that aspect of the question.  As I have said there are a number of businesses which would practically require about 18 months for the change.  When I say that I mean, 12 months' business to be done and a preparatory period in businesses of different sorts, for different trades.  I would like the Minister to consider that aspect of the case because it it is a very vital issue for the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>As to one point raised by Deputy Dockrell, I thought it would be clear from the start that this Bill is as much a protectionist Bill as it is a bargaining Bill.  In fact, it is an effort to complete legislation that we thought was complete two years ago when all these varieties were introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We were given that impression at the time.  Now by this Bill, notwithstanding the statement made by the Minister that there are not going to be restrictions on quantities, there are to be practical embargoes&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>You can do that under this Bill.  Deputies will bear in mind that this Bill contains no regular bargaining clause; that is to say, that no more than 10 per cent. can be taken from some countries, though it is positive that from some other countries we will take 25 per cent. or 30 per cent.  I think it will be apparent that this is much more of a protective measure, and in no sense can it be said that it is a bargaining measure when it comes to practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister assured us that really while he was in sympathy with the amendment it was not necessary. He told us it was in the interests of trade to do all we ask for.  But good Minister as he is, we cannot hope that he will last for all time.  Another Deputy may occupy his place and may take quite a different view.  Now I think it is necessary, and I think the Minister agrees, that these licences will have to be given, but it is necessary to embody them in the Bill.  The Minister asks that they be left to him, and that there will be no trouble.  That is not business.  We want some assurance that it will be done, and that is the object of the amendment that has been moved.  The Minister probably is aware of the serious situation that has arisen on the other side.  On the 12th January last the importation of oats and oat products was practically prohibited. What is the situation?  We have all the newspapers in England full of protest as to the situation that has arisen amongst the traders.  I will not bother the Minister to read all the lengthy letters I have here, but I shall read a few extracts, the first of which is from the Liverpool <i>Daily Post.</i>  It is from the issue of 8th February, 1934, and it says that: &ldquo;A Liverpool firm, when the additional duties were suddenly announced, on January 12th, had 111,900 cwts. of oats afloat and 28,660 cwts. contracted for, but not yet shipped.  It had also 4,280 cwts. of oat products afloat and 51,100 cwts. contracted for, but not shipped.  Here is a statement of a Liverpool firm: &lsquo;We have open contracts made prior to the 12th January for 120 tons of oat products on a basis of £4 10s. per ton, c.i.f. Liverpool, all of which are still <Col N="1588" /> unsold.  We are now called upon to pay £7 10s. per ton on this&mdash;a total of £900.  There is no possibility of our being able to recover more than 25/- per ton of this amount, as the price of those commodities has only been increased by that amount since the increase of the duties.  It is beyond all reason that we should be called upon to pay £7 10s. on an article costing only £4 10s.  Our loss on this comparatively small quantity would be something like £600.&rdquo;&rsquo;</P>
      <P>Another Liverpool firm has reported: &ldquo;From the date that the duty was imposed up to February 6th we have not been able to deliver any of our arrivals of oat products which are still lying on the quay, duty unpaid.... if no remission of duties made, the potential loss on our open contracts would be at least £3,750.&rdquo;  Another firm with a branch in Liverpool declared that it would have to pay a duty of about £3,000.</P>
      <P>In the <i>Times</i> newspaper of the 9th of February there is another letter upon the subject.  A merchant there writes: &ldquo;In anticipation of this seasonal trade we booked our requirements ahead and at the time the new order was put into operation we had 820 tons of oat goods on contract for shipment to the end of March, when the demand normally ceases ... We are bound to honour our contract with foreign shippers, and in doing so we shall be forced to pay a duty representing 150 per cent. of the c.i.f. value of the goods which in our case amounts to £6,150, an increase of £5,330 over the duty anticipated.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That only gives an illustration of the enormous injury done to trade owing to want of knowledge as to the nature of these imposts.  If licensing duties are not to apply to goods in transit, there is no possibility of the merchant getting paid for them.  Supposing goods are ordered from one particular country and the quota order says they should be obtained from another country, the merchant has to pay for the goods ordered from the first country, and he is not allowed to bring them in.  That is the situation in which trade becomes impossible.  The Minister's reply to that is that it will <Col N="1589" /> not arise, and that he will see that it will not arise.  But there should be some definite undertaking in the Bill that it will not arise, and that is what we are asking for in regard to these licences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no undertaking in the Bill, but there is power to deal with such a situation, should it arise. Deputy Good, having read these letters, should suggest to the British Government that they should copy the legislation introduced here, because if they took the same powers that we are taking, then they could avoid the danger of all hardship.</P>
      <P>In so far as goods in transit are concerned, the oats that were afloat or the other goods in ship to which the Deputy referred, there is a period of six weeks before the quota order becomes effective during which these goods can be imported into the country unless there is a clear case for stopping them, as in the case I mentioned where goods were being brought in for the purpose of stocking up here in anticipation of some development at home, and the order was made for the express purpose of excluding them.  In the other case, the case of a contract, there are two things I want to say.  One is that, so far as my limited knowledge of the law goes, it tells me that if the importation of the goods is prohibited by law, not prohibited by a customs duty which can be paid, even though very large &mdash; that it actually cannot be done &mdash; the contract cannot be held to be binding.  Secondly, there is the consideration that the fixation of the first quota period and the first quantity would take place after consultation with the interested parties, and having due regard to these considerations and for the purpose of meeting the representations that might be made to prevent any hardship arising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sole reason why an amendment of the kind which Deputies Dockrell and Good have suggested cannot be put in is because, while that amendment would undoubtedly cover certain cases they have in mind, it would defeat the whole purpose of the Bill in respect of other cases that might arise. I think, therefore, it is much better to <Col N="1590" /> leave the Bill as it stands, giving a sort of six weeks' period of grace in respect of all articles, and that will be more than sufficient for most, and relying upon the reasonable administration of the powers of the Bill during the first quota period to cover exceptional cases which might possibly arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all very well to say to business men that they may rest assured that this will be interpreted reasonably, but they want something more than that, and they are entitled to something more.  I am sure as regards the Minister that it will be worked equitably as far as possible, but there is no guarantee that that will be done in future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that the answer to that is that if my successor happens to be an unreasonable man and wants to act unreasonably and exercise powers for the purpose of destroying trading interests he will not be stopped by the absence of an Act of Parliament.  If he has a majority here which put him into office he will have a majority which will give him the powers he wants.  The fact is, therefore, that you cannot guarantee against some future Government acting in an irrational manner.  If that Government has a majority, it can get whatever power it wants, and you will not prevent it getting that power by putting in an amendment to existing legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with my undertaking to give an indication of amendments that may be introduced, I may say that one of the matters under consideration is the advisability of inserting a sub-section giving power to require that goods imported under licence shall come by a specified route. It is desirable for some reasons, and it is regarded from the point of view of administration as likely to facilitate the working of the Act.  The main purpose is to ensure that if a special quota order is made on behalf of, say, France, in respect of some class of goods, it will not mean that French goods lying in stock in some other country can be shipped in here under that order; in other words, to ensure that France will get the benefit of it.  A number of firms have made representations in favour of taking some power under the Bill which will end a rather peculiar position that certain continental firms will only sell here through agencies in Great Britain.  The fact that they will only adopt that procedure means an increased cost here, because those agents in Great Britain charge commissions on the sales.  I have not been able to devise any means by which this Bill could be used for the purpose of requiring those continental firms to establish direct agencies here, but if Deputies can make any suggestions on that point I shall be glad to consider them on Report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed Bill, as the title indicates, is intended to amend the law relating to the protection of infants, and for that <Col N="1593" /> purpose to improve the provisions of Part I of the Children Act, 1908.</P>
      <P>In this matter the Bill proposes to give effect to the recommendations of the Commission on the Relief of the Sick and Destitute Poor, including the Insane Poor.  In their report, dated August, 1927, the Commission pointed out that the death rate amongst illegitimate children was five times as great as in other cases.  While the provisions of Part I of the Act of 1908 to some extent brought baby farming under control, the Commission were of opinion that the Act did not go far enough, and as a protection to the children for whom the Act was intended the Commission recommended certain amendments.</P>
      <P>The first important provision of the Bill is that relating to the supervision of local authorities.  As the law stands at present, the Minister has no functions in relation to the administration of Part I of the Act, and he is unable to take any effective measures to ensure that local authorities exercise their powers.  Clause II of the Bill will provide that in the administration of the law and the performance of their functions, the local authorities will be subject to the general regulation and control of the Minister, and in such administration and in relation to such functions they will be required to comply with all general directions given by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions in the Act of 1908 requiring a person undertaking for reward the nursing and maintenance of an infant apart from its parents, or having no parents, to notify the local authority within 48 hours of the reception of the infant, does not give the local authority any opportunity to inspect the home beforehand, to see if it is suitable, or if the proposed foster parent is fit and proper to take charge of the infant.  If the home or the foster parent is unsuitable, the only remedy is to proceed under the Act to have the infant removed to a place of safety until it can be restored to its relatives or otherwise lawfully disposed of. There is a great likelihood that the child will then become a charge on the rates, and the persons who should be <Col N="1594" /> responsible for it will escape their liabilities.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to remedy this defect by providing that the notice to the local authority must be given at least 48 hours before the reception of the infant.  This notice should enable the local authority to satisfy themselves as to the suitability or otherwise of the home before the infant is actually placed in it.</P>
    <P>The provisions of Part I of the Act of 1908 cease to operate when a child to whom it applies reaches the age of seven years.  The protection of the local authority then ceases.  It is generally agreed that this is too early an age to release the child from the care of the local authority.  The Bill proposes to extend the age to nine years.</P>
    <P>As regards the institution of proceedings for offences under Section 1 of the Act, it has been held in the courts that the time for taking proceedings expires at the end of a period of six months from the commission of the offence.  This decision increases the difficulty of effectively administering the Act.  The local authority may not become aware of the offence until after the expiration of the six months' period.  If, for any reason, proceedings are not taken within that time, the offender escapes punishment.  Under the Bill, failure to give the requisite notice to the local authority is to be made an offence continuing so long as the infant remains in the care of the person by whom notice should have been given.</P>
    <P>It will be noticed that Part I of the Children Act, 1908, applies only where the nursing and maintenance of a child is undertaken for reward.  It is sometimes difficult to prove that there was a reward in such cases, and if this is not proved, proceedings under Section 1 of the Principal Act fail, and the offenders escape the penalties provided for in the Act.  To remedy this in the case of illegitimate children it is proposed to provide that an illegitimate child shall be deemed to have been accepted for reward until the contrary is proved.</P>
    <P>Under the Act of 1908 the local authority is empowered to appoint visitors <Col N="1595" /> to visit infants to whom the Act applies and the premises in which they are kept.  The Act also gives the local authority power to fix the number of infants who may be kept in any dwelling to which the Act applies.  The Bill proposes to give them power to impose such conditions as they may think proper in regard to the keeping of all or any of such infants.</P>
    <P>One reason to which the Poor Law Commission made specific reference was the intermediary who facilitates mothers in disposing of their children. Such persons often operate through the means of advertisements.  The Bill will make it an offence to publish such advertisements unless the name and residence of the person undertaking or arranging for the nursing and maintenance of the infants are correctly stated in the advertisement.</P>
    <P>Other proposed amendments which relate principally to improvements in the wording of the Act are intended to make provisions of the law more stringent and to enable local authorities more effectively to protect the health and interests of the children to whom the Act applies.</P>
    <P>The reforms proposed are supported by a wide circle of social welfare workers and societies operating particularly in the neighbourhood of Dublin.  Amongst the societies which have made representations to the Minister are the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, the Irish Women's Citizen's Association, the Catholic Protection and Rescue Society, the Nursing and Rescue and Protestant Children's Aid Society, Saint Patrick's Guild and the Sacred Heart Home.  Poor law authorities have also pressed the Minister in the matter, notably the Rathdown Board, whose area seems to be particularly exposed to the evils which the Bill is intended to remedy. I beg to move:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: That the Public Assistance (Acquisition of Land) Bill be read a Second Time.  This Bill proposes to give powers to local poor law authorities to acquire for the purposes of their powers and duties, either by agreement with the consent of the Minister, or compulsorily in accordance with provisions proposed to be enacted.</P>
      <P>The necessity for the measure at the present time arises in connection with proposals by the local authorities to acquire land for the purposes of sites for new hospitals.  There is, as Deputies are aware, great activity in this respect owing to the fact that moneys have become available from sweepstake sources.  Most of the local authorities have proposed to erect new hospital buildings.  In some places new county hospitals are contemplated; in others smaller district or cottage hospitals are to be erected.  Quite a number of county authorities have very ambitious schemes in view to provide their administrative areas with entirely new hospitals, not only hospitals for medical, surgical and maternity cases, but also isolation hospitals for infectious and contagious diseases.</P>
      <P>These schemes will involve the expenditure of a considerable amount of money.  If the sweepstakes continue, and the income from that source permits, the expenditure by local poor law authorities on hospital improvements will probably run into some millions.</P>
      <P>Where the spending of such large sums of money is involved it is highly desirable that it should be expended to the best advantage, and that the hospitals provided as a consequence of that expenditure should be in every way suitable for their purpose.  Different circumstances and factors contribute to the suitability and usefulness of a hospital, but not the least is the site. It will be generally agreed that a good site is essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the existing law the local poor law authorities do not possess any powers to acquire land compulsorily. They may purchase land by agreement. <Col N="1597" /> The usual procedure is to invite tenders for sites by advertisement.  A local authority may be fortunate to secure a site by these means, but the advertisement is not always successful.  In one case that has come to the knowledge of my Department the local authority have failed to secure any suitable site.</P>
    <P>Another disadvantage connected with purchase by agreement is that the powers of the local authority to ensure purchase at a reasonable price are limited.  A case occurred recently in the south of Ireland where the local authority proposed to replace an existing hospital by a new county hospital. The land in the possession of the local authority was not sufficient for a site for a county hospital, and it was necessary to acquire some additional strips adjoining.  One owner asked £175 for a little paddock containing 3 roods and having no road frontage, and after great pressure agreed to give the 3 roods for £110, as a benevolent contribution to the public good.  In the same area £250 was asked for 1a. 3r. 38p. on which there was a head rent of £4. This plot was eventually purchased for £180 plus £4 rent.  In another county the most suitable plot offered to the local authority was one containing 5a. 2r. 36p., held on lease the unexpired period of which was 61 years, at a rent of £45.  The price agreed on by the local authority, but not sanctioned by the Minister, was £1,600 for the tenant's interest.  It was calculated that when the landlord's interest would be purchased and other expenses defrayed, the land would cost about £500 per statute acre.</P>
    <P>These and similar experiences by the Department convince us that compulsory powers are essential, not only for the purpose of getting the best possible sites but also to ensure reasonable prices and to protect public funds. Local authorities have already got powers to enable them to acquire land compulsorily for housing and other purposes. There seems to be no good reason why they should not have similar powers for such an important service as hospitals.</P>
    <P>The procedure for compulsory acquisition contemplated in the Bill which has been introduced is similar to that <Col N="1598" /> provided in the Housing Acts.  A compulsory purchase order may be made by the local authority and if the owners, lessees or occupiers offer no objection the Minister may, as he thinks proper, either refuse to confirm the purchase order or confirm the order with or without modification.  The Minister may, if he thinks fit, hold a public local inquiry before dealing with an application for confirmation of any such order.</P>
    <P>If any objection is made to the compulsory acquisition order and not withdrawn, the Minister must cause a public local inquiry to be held, and after consideration if the objection is not withdrawn and after receiving the report of the person holding the inquiry, the Minister may, as he thinks proper, either refuse to confirm the compulsory acquisition order or confirm the order with or without modification. Provision is also made for confirmation of the order without a public inquiry if the Minister is satisfied that the grounds of an objection relate exclusively to matters which can be dealt with by the arbitrator by whom the compensation is to be assessed.</P>
    <P>The Bill will also provide for an appeal to the High Court by any person who is affected or whose property is affected by a compulsory acquisition order.  The High Court may annul the order in whole or in part if satisfied that the order was in excess of, or otherwise not authorised by, the powers conferred by the Act, or that the person appealing or any other person has been substantially prejudiced by failure to comply, in relation to such order, with the provisions of the Act.</P>
    <P>Other provisions of importance are those which will enable a local authority, with the consent of the Minister, to sell any land acquired under the Act which appears to be no longer required for the purpose for which it was acquired and to apply land vested in them to a purpose other than that for which it was acquired.</P>

      <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1934, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Department of the President of the Executive Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As is clear from the White Paper on the Estimate, this is to defray the expenses for a Bureau of Information. The function of the Bureau will be to collect and make available to the public information concerning the activities of Government Departments, and the national policy underlying those activities.  The electors of the Saorstát have adopted a policy which involves important changes in our economic structure and external relations.  The active and intelligent support of the people is necessary to the success of that policy.  To give that support the people must have full and accurate information of the aims of the Government, and the methods by which those aims are being realised.  It is important also that opinion abroad should be well informed regarding events here.  It is not, for example, sufficiently understood in other countries that the economic war which is being waged against us has been undertaken in an effort to compel us to pay money which we are convinced is not due; nor is it widely known that we have from the beginning been ready to submit the dispute to the arbitration of an <Col N="1600" /> impartial tribunal.  It is important for the national credit that these facts should be fully understood.  In the absence of any central office from which information could be readily obtained, many false and harmful reports have been published in the Press at home and abroad.  Quite recently an Irish paper published a report that the Government proposed to introduce war bread of a &ldquo;dark brown&rdquo; colour.  Other papers, in England and elsewhere have been ringing the changes on that report. Some have described the bread as &ldquo;black&rdquo;; others, more moderately disposed, have called it &ldquo;mottled.&rdquo;  The basis for the report was that the Government was considering a proposal for the inclusion of a small percentage of oaten flour with wheat for bread-making; but, however absurd it may be, many people believed the statement that the result would be a black or dark brown bread, and they felt that the Saorstát was reaching the end of its resources.</P>
    <P>The prestige and credit of the Saorstát have been injured by reports representing the country as being on the verge of a revolution.  On the other hand, while the hardships caused by the economic war are frequently stressed, comparatively little attention is given to the Government's efforts to relieve the sufferers, or to the work that is being done to provide employment for an increasing population, and to improve the social conditions of the people.  The root cause of these damaging reports is not, for the greater part, malice, but the fact that it is easy to develop the news value of a calamity or an incident of disorder, and that the investigation of constructive work and its results is a comparatively difficult task for which few journalists have time.  Constructive work, however, has its own interest and news value, and if the facts concerning it are made easily accessible I am confident that journalists generally will be glad to make use of them.  At all events, I think it is the duty of the Government in present circumstances to provide the facilities.  Until the Bureau has been some time in existence it will not be <Col N="1601" /> possible to say with certainty what staff will be required, or what its cost will be.  It is, however, intended to keep the expenditure to the minimum consistent with effective work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to urge that this Vote be not given.  Nominally we are asked to vote £10.  Actually we are asked to incur immediately an additional expenditure of £900 to £1,000 a year, and as the President has just said he cannot even tell us what additional staff and expenditure will be involved.  It seems to me that this proposal is either silly or corrupt &mdash;probably both.  It is a very good example of what the French call <i>Vidée fixé</i>, because this is merely to fulfil a desire which is dear to the President's heart, and which apparently has been a fixture for the last twelve years.  On 7th September, 1922, the President wrote: &ldquo;I would like to see S. O'Keeffe for a Press interview. If you get in touch with him I will see how it can be arranged. Ask him to send me along leading questions.&rdquo;  It looks as if the unfortunate people of this country are being asked now to give some unnamed amount&mdash;but more than £1,000 a year&mdash; to provide the President with somebody near by whom he can have to ask him leading questions all the time. A Department such as is proposed is not required in a country under normal conditions.  It is true that when a war is taking place, and censorship is operating, propaganda becomes one of the weapons in the armoury of warfare.  It is usually of course the most disgraceful weapon used in war.  The President read out a statement purporting to justify the establishment of this Department.  He says it is necessary that the activities of Government Departments be known. There is no need for the creation of this Department for that purpose. The activities of Government Departments become apparent to the people in the legislation produced in this House.  That legislation is often advocated on one side and deprecated on the other, and the ordinary administration of the country is made known to the people without any special machinery for it.  Apart from that, <Col N="1602" /> each Department has its activities, and journalists of this country who know their job will&mdash;if they think there is any portion of any Bill that they require elucidated&mdash;get on to the appropriate person in the Department concerned, who is clearly much better able to explain any intricacy or any dubious point than would be a man in a Department by himself.</P>
      <P>The President went further and said it was also necessary to make known the national policy underlying the activities of Government Departments, and he says that the active support of the people is necessary.  The people of this country have a perfect right to form any opinion that their judgment indicates to them of the action of the Government.  An attempt by a Government to use public moneys to bludgeon the minds of the people, and try to relieve the people of the duty and the opportunity to judge things for themselves by pouring out a mass of propaganda to mislead them, is both corrupt and silly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the President has always had in his mind the idea that somehow or another, by propaganda, you could melt December's snow by thinking of fantastic summer's heat.  I know he has always thought it possible by propaganda to make black look white; I know he has always thought it possible by propaganda to make crime look like heroism and national service; and thus to-day he seems incapable of adjusting himself and learning with the passage of time, because if anybody had an opportunity of learning that the people are not going to be misled by such talk he should have had such an opportunity.  He worries about opinion abroad.  Clearly when things are going on in an ordinary way under a good Government in this country, and there are ordered conditions, opinion abroad is not concerned about what happens here, but he indicated that he wants the public in this country to pay for the purpose of misrepresenting to the public the policy of the Government.  The people of this country have heard enough argument about the land annuities to form some idea as to what are the rights or wrongs of the situation.  The <Col N="1603" /> President wants a public department established for the purpose of putting the party policy of Fianna Fáil before the people.  He already owns a newspaper for doing that, a newspaper which, by the way, when it was looking for people to subscribe for its shares, assured everybody that it was not going to be a party organ&mdash;far from it.  People in America were assured that Mr. Cosgrave was most anxious that it should be started and everybody was assured&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am drawing it in only as an analogy.  We are now asked to vote money, as previously people were asked to give money for a purpose, the only justification of which would be, that it was for clearly public services, without relation to party, as the Government is supposed to have nothing whatever to do with party politics, and the departments of State are supposed to have nothing whatever to do with party politics.  Here we are asked to establish a department for the purpose of saving the pockets of the Fianna Fáil people and to impose on the public in this country a tax in order to propagand the tactics of this Party.  The President gives an instance of what this is to correct. There was a terrible national situation created by the fact that the bread proposed to be made not purely of wheaten flour was described as dark brown, as black and as mottled.  We talk of black grapes and white grapes, and <Col N="1604" /> I do not know whether, if the President were to send to a fruiterer's shop for white grapes, he would be indignant and say that he had been deceived when he found that the grapes, whatever colour they were, were not white, and that black grapes, instead of being black, were purple.  When we speak of white grapes, we do not mean grapes that are white, but we mean the type known as white grapes.  In most northern countries people eat rye bread or barley bread.  Neither rye bread nor barley bread is black, but they are both called black bread.  Black bread is the name given to any type of bread to distinguish it from bread made of wheaten flour.</P>
      <P>The President proposes that the Irish people, apparently, should not be allowed to have bread made of wheaten flour but a mixture, and then suggests that the world got the idea that we were on the verge of a breakdown because we were getting bread described as dark brown or black.  In most northern countries in Europe a certain section, at any rate, of the population eat bread which is not made of wheaten flour exclusively.  It is not black, but it is called black, just the same as we speak of white grapes. The President and the rest of us are called white men, but if any of us came in here with our faces the colour of this paper, which is white, people would think there was something wrong, but the President with his exact mind wants the newspapers to give the exact shade that describes the bread which it is proposed to foist on the Irish people, and in order that that may be done, we are asked to embark on an expenditure the extent of which we cannot be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President complains that people abroad thought that we were on the verge of a revolution.  What brought that about?  What was the party that insisted on saying that we were on the verge of a revolution?  Organisations were started here, declaring and living up to their declarations, that they stood entirely in favour of the maintenance of ordered conditions in this country, and that they did not propose to resort to methods of force in an attempt to change the Constitution or <Col N="1605" /> overthrow the Government by armed force, but Minister after Minister went around and talked about the approaching <i>coup d'état</i> the attempt to overthrow this State and all the rest of it, and then, having done that, come along here and ask that the Irish people shall be taxed in order to undo the antinational and dishonest propaganda which they carried on during that period and, even at this moment, are carrying on.  He complains that while attention has been called to the sufferings imposed by what is called the economic war, little attention had been given to the efforts of the Government to provide employment for the increasing population, and for the relief of the farmers.  Just a week or two ago, the Government, without this department at all, gathered together manufacturers and industrialists, as they were called, many of whom did not employ as many people as a single farmer's wife employs, and that meeting was paraded as though there were 9,000, 900 or 90 new industries in this country&mdash;and there was only one industry lost, agriculture.  If there is anything that requires establishment in this country it is the proper ratio between the piffling industries the Government is trying, by dint of imposing heavy taxes on the consumers of this country, to establish, and the one great industry in this country.</P>
    <P>We have to view this proposal in the light of our experience of the Government.  The Government has taken on itself exceptional powers, the justification of which would be that there was actually a dangerous situation in this country.  I am prepared to agree that there is a dangerous situation in this country.  There are illegal, unlawful associations in this country which do represent a very serious threat to the moral and material welfare of the people in this country but the special powers taken by the Government were not designed to deal with them.  Those powers were taken merely to deal with a perfectly lawful association and those powers were used merely to make membership of a lawful association carry with it all the penalties that should attach to membership of an unlawful association, <Col N="1606" /> and at the same time, the members of the unlawful associations are allowed to go perfectly free.  In order to support that situation the Government now indulges in a form of censorship.  I can quite understand that, irrespective of other matters, censorship might be exercised merely in the interests of truth, but in this case, we have censorship exercised for the suppression of truth.  I will give an instance.  <i>United Ireland</i> this week has a number of passages excised from it under the orders of the Government. One passage went this way:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The malice of this crime&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>that is, the crime committed in Dundalk</P>
    <P>&mdash;could not be excelled by people who were utterly blind to all moral law.  First of all, armed bullies not only denied the right of Irish citizens to differ from them in political opinions, but they implemented this denial by seizing citizens at the point of the gun, maltreating and robbing them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was permitted but then, the Government steps in to say that this must not be said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Thereafter, not satisfied with the privileged position our Government has given to their criminal organisation...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is excised.  Is what is contained there untrue&mdash;that the Government has given a privileged position to a criminal organisation?  Does anybody doubt that the I.R.A. and Cumann na mBan are criminal organisations?  If we examine the Act that the Government has in force, we find that Section 19 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Every association which does any of the following things shall be an unlawful association, that is to say, has amongst its professed objects or advocates or encourages or professes to encourage the overthrow by force of the Government of Saorstát Eireann or the alteration by force of this Constitution or the law.</P>
    <P>Is the President going to suggest that this organisation, the I.R.A., which he refuses to take action against, while he takes action against a perfectly lawful organisation, does not <Col N="1607" /> fulfil that first condition given there that makes an association unlawful?</P>
    <P>The law says that membership of an unlawful association shall be met with certain penalties.  The President refuses to apply that law to membership of that organisation, and he denies the right of any person to affirm what he himself knows is perfectly true with regard to his own acts and lack of acts.  Paragraph (b) provides that every organisation &ldquo;without lawful authority organises or maintains or endeavours or purports to organise or maintain an armed force&rdquo; shall be an unlawful association.  Would members of the I.R.A. assert that I was libelling them in saying that they fulfilled that condition: making them an unlawful association to the very uttermost part. Their whole purpose and method is to organise and maintain an armed force.  Paragraph (c) says: &ldquo;promotes or encourages the unlawful possession of firearms by its members.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does anyone deny that these organisations, protected by this Government that will not apply the existing law against them, &ldquo;promote and encourage the unlawful possession of firearms.&rdquo; Moreover, paragraph (d) provides: &ldquo;engages in, promotes, encourages, or advocates any act, enterprise, or course of action of a treasonable or seditious character, or promotes, encourages, or advocates the attainment of any objects of a treasonable or seditious character.&rdquo;  The whole purpose of these organisations is to promote and encourage the commission of offences, of obstruction and interference with the administration of justice and the enforcement of the law.</P>
    <P>The President knows&mdash;he referred to it in Tralee a month or so ago&mdash;that an organisation sent out, from its address in Dawson Street, to two jurors, a communication which was an implicit threat to those jurors that if they failed to commit perjury in the service of that organisation they would meet with a traitor's fate.  The President referred to that document in Tralee: that there was an organisation, to his knowledge, that aimed at the frustration of justice <Col N="1608" /> at the very fountain head in his country.</P>

      <P>I would like to hear how the Deputy can relate a discussion of the detailed activities of certain organisations to the Vote before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do so.  It is proposed to set up a bureau to deal with the Press.  At the present moment the Irish people are asked to be taxed in order that the Government may have this weapon for what the President would call, I presume, the dissemination of the truth.  We know that the policy of the Government at this moment is to suppress the truth in this country.  I am pointing out how they are acting in a tyrannical way in suppressing a mere statement of fact which is irrefutable.  I suggest that the possible purpose for which we are now asked to vote money is that the Government may have an efficient machine for the suppression of truth in this country; to prevent people knowing exactly the truth with regard to the Government and its policy.  I am pointing out how, even in anticipation of the establishment of this bureau, the Government is acting.  I am pointing out that here they have suppressed the words: &ldquo;Thereafter not satisfied with the privileged position our Government has given to their criminal organisation.&rdquo; An organisation which tries to promote perjury in this country and to defeat justice at the point of the gun is pre-eminently criminal.  The law is there for the purpose of dealing with the members of this organisation, but the Government refuse to deal with this organisation.  It puts the members of it in a privileged position where the penalties of the law will not be applied to them while, at the same time, the Government with its full knowledge, by making a false declaration, that, in their opinion, a certain organisation is unlawful, knows full well that it does not fulfil any of the conditions laid down for making an organisation unlawful by definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government distorts, frustrates and abuses the power of Government to get after certain people who are <Col N="1609" /> law-abiding while, in a most disgraceful way, it prostitutes government power by withholding the penal operation of the law against certain people who fulfil every condition that makes an organisation unlawful&mdash;whose activities include the blowing up of houses, the murdering of men by brutal beatings and an attempt to frustrate justice by promoting perjury amongst jurymen at the point of the gun.  Those who do these things are exempt.  The law provides that we are not allowed to have guns without permission and licence from the Civic Guard, while the President in this House got up and said that he had no intention of going out to get the guns possessed by the members of this organisation, whose methods are murder and the promotion of perjury in this country.  We are not allowed to say&mdash;it is sedition to tell the truth in this country&mdash;&ldquo;We are therefore not satisfied with the privileged position our Government has given to their criminal organisation.&rdquo; Is there any member of the I.R.A. or of Cumann na mBan who is not well aware that under this Government they have a privileged position: that they have rights that do not apply to the ordinary citizens of this country. But the ordinary citizens of this country are now being called upon to pay taxes to enable the Government to suppress the truth.  The article reads on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They demand that ordinary citizens should shelter their crimes by calling upon Eternal Truth to bear witness to a lie by committing perjury in the courts.  The punishment for refusing to commit perjury is, apparently, to be blown up in one's house.  And if an elderly woman and tender children should also be blown up it, apparently, means nothing to the degraded consciences of these criminals.  It is heartbreaking to think that such things can happen in our country&mdash; and how shameful it is that they are done in the name of Irish patriotism.</P>
    <P>The words which follow were suppressed. They are not allowed to go before the Irish public.  They read:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;And that the organisation that <Col N="1610" /> promotes such deeds is in the privileged position of having the law of the land made non-operative against them, while it is strained to breaking point against those who give heroic service to save the youth of Ireland from being led into similar paths of crime.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These words have not been allowed to go before the Irish public, but the Irish public knows perfectly well that every word there is true.  They know that the Government's dishonest suppression of that is guided not by zeal for the service of the State but by a foolish attempt to conceal from the Irish people the true acts or lack of acts of this Government.  We are not permitted to say that an organisation that promotes such deeds is in &ldquo;the privileged position of having the law of the land made non-operative against them.&rdquo;  The President himself got up and said that the law of the land did not permit of unlicensed and unpermitted arms to be held in this country, although responsible people in this country would not assert Government authority to get and seize arms that he himself at one time had arranged to put in dumps.  The article goes on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We pointed out only a week ago that unless the Government faces its responsibility and decides on the suppression of the I.R.A. the tide of outrage which has been flowing in the country for some time is bound to rise.  Last Sunday's events showed that we are not far from the point when the taking of human life will become almost as much a commonplace as the interruption of public meetings or the blocking of roads. The culpable responsibility of the Government for the evil developments that have been taking place is very great indeed.  The statements of many Ministers have been such as inevitably to incite to violence.  When Mr. de Valera said that he could not make individuals popular he ought to have known that he was telling the stone-throwers and other attackers of free speech to go on with their job. Even as recently as last Friday Mr. de Valera's organ, the <i>Irish Press</i>, wrote a villainous leading article in which it stated that the &lsquo;proceedings <Col N="1611" /> of the Ard-Fheis of Fine Gael were such as to give satisfaction in London.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That, of course, was a clear incitement to the blackguards to carry on their blackguarding.  The article in <i>United Ireland</i> continued; but this portion of it was suppressed:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It proceeded by inference further to attack the organisation and its leaders as pro-British and anti-Irish. Such articles lead as surely to violent attacks on the Constitutional Opposition as if that were their sole and deliberate purpose.  Fianna Fáil however, has sinned not merely by loose and mischievous talk but by cowardly inaction.  While perfectly law-abiding organisations have been banned, and while bank managers and other responsible citizens have been disarmed, the I.R.A., so often condemned by the Hierarchy, and admittedly engaged in subversive activity and Communist propaganda, has been left untouched, and its members have been assured that no search for their arms will be made by the authorities.  Until the Government withdraws the promise of immunity from the I.R.A., until it instructs the Civic Guard to get after them, matters are bound to continue to get worse.  The Dundalk outrage, one of the vilest since Seán McGarry's house was burned, ought to make even this Government think seriously of the position and prospects and of the duty it owes to the people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is there anything untruthful in that? Everybody knows that the Government is refusing to take even the same action against the I.R.A. that it has taken against the National Guard and the Army Comrades' Association, both of which were lawful associations and would, if they still existed, be lawful associations.</P>

      <P>The Government is exercising at this moment powers of censorship.  If these powers were justly and appropriately used, one might say that there was a case for establishing a special department and that the matter might properly be left in the hands of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is point in what both Deputies say but it is not in order to debate the desirability of suppressing one organisation, giving details of the activities of that organisation, and the undesirability of suppressing another organisation, with details of the activities of that organisation. It is not in order to go into these matters.  The Deputy has been allowed to speak at considerable length on that line and has said sufficient, I think, for the purpose of illustration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>My only point, in dealing with the matter was that the Government might argue that they suppressed the matters in this paper to which I have referred on the ground that they were misrepresenting the truth.  In order to bring out the fact, which hardly needs bringing out&mdash;it is patent to everybody&mdash;that every word contained in those articles was true. I had to refer to the two organisations and to the Government action in connection with them.  My sole purpose was to show that the Government is now using its arbitrary powers of censorship to conceal its own criminal acts, I might say, from the people and <Col N="1613" /> that it now wants us to vote money to give it an efficient machine that it may pursue this utterly unlawful and immoral campaign and finance it out of the public purse.  We are asked to vote the money to do that.  The President, I know, can always convince himself that anything he stands for, by virtue of the fact that he stands for it, is right and that anybody who is against it is wrong.  His own conscience, I am certain, is clear that everything that will tend to keep him at the head of affairs here is in the national interest and, therefore, that the unfortunate Irish people should be taxed that they may themselves be blinded as to the real facts.  I know the President is satisfied that the only destiny God ordained for this country is that it should be ruled by a man named Mr. de Valera.  Others may have other views.  We may think that to ask us to hand over to a Government that prostitutes its authority and uses its power to defend the evildoer and to punish the law-abiding a machine for misrepresenting the whole position of the people is to ask us to do something which can only be described as criminal.  It just happened that I was able to give an illustration in that respect.</P>
      <P>There has been a permanent scandal since this Government came into power.  We know that the President has an interest&mdash;I shall not say a financial interest&mdash;in a certain private organ. A regular feature of that organ is to come out with a heading about something or other and, next day, to say &ldquo;As was exclusively announced in yesterday's <i>Irish Press.</i>&rdquo;  These &ldquo;exclusives&rdquo; are always in the nature of departmental information.</P>

It may have been from a Minister or somebody acting in the name of a Minister.  That journalist had, in order to shelter that person, to break the law and suffer punishment. The law was broken and he suffered punishment in order that an official person should be sheltered.  Why was it necessary to shelter that official person?  Because that official person, whether he was a Minister or a civil servant, had used his position as public trustee to give a special favour to an organ in which the President is very interested.  In order that revelation should not be made as to where that information came from, that unfortunate man had to go to prison.  Now we are asked to vote a sum of money for the establishment of a bureau to be in the hands of a Government that, even without that bureau, has used its machine to favour one newspaper in which is has an interest.</P>

      <P>On the contrary, we are asked to vote money for a certain purpose, to be put into the hands of people who, in relation to that purpose, have already shown they cannot be trusted to use it properly. It was sworn in the courts that that information came from an official source, and, when information as to what was the official source was asked for, that information was not forthcoming. The reason that information was not forthcoming was that these official sources have been available to that paper for the last two years and were not available to others.  It was in order to shelter that relationship between official sources and that paper, and to continue the feeding of that newspaper with Departmental information that the unfortunate journalist was put in the position of having to break the law which the Government exists to see is not broken.  He suffered a penalty for his act, while the really responsible person stayed behind, and, mark this, that man was merely acting as an employee of an editor belonging to an organisation which has, if I remember <Col N="1617" /> aright, in its articles of agreement, that the whole policy of the paper was to be such as would be decided by Eamon de Valera.

Whatever be the cause, it does happen that the administration of the Government has been able to be worked in order to put a certain newspaper in a privileged position, through which it had certain channels of information, which then led to a situation in which a journalist was put in the position of having to break the law and suffer a penalty for doing so, in order to shelter a person, whether a Minister or otherwise, so that it would not be made public what his channel of information was, and in order to put that newspaper in a better position than its competitors.  Now we are asked to vote money to give the Government a machine to carry on a policy of misrepresentation of facts in this country, and a policy of arbitrary power to suppress the truth.  It is irrefutable that this Government, while invoking the law to operate against a perfectly lawful association, has ignored unlawful associations whose method is murder.</P>

      <P>I suggest, sir, that I should not be constantly interrupted by the Minister.  We are asked to vote this money.  As I have already said, I have noted that the President has always had it in his mind that a journalist can somehow or other make black appear white.  I know that for years he has had a constant feeling of that want, and that he wanted, as he wrote on the 7th September, 1922: &ldquo;Mr. S. O'Keeffe to be asking him leading questions.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I will try to keep off it, sir.  We are asked to embark on a new bureau.  What is in the future is unknown.  We can only argue from the known to the unknown.  This Department is going to be under the supreme control of President de Valera.  When you are going to ask the unfortunate people of this country to be taxed for such a purpose as this, ordinary wisdom and human prudence suggest that you can judge what you can anticipate from what you know has already been done.  We know that the Government has prostituted its authority in order to suppress the truth.  Just like the Minister for Finance last night, when he said that only for the Opposition the <Col N="1619" /> British would somehow or other have collapsed on the economic war long ago, but the President will get up probably and say that the loss of the British markets is a Godsend and they will say that if Fine Gael came into power we would not be able to get anywhere. Yet, the Minister for Finance last night assured us that the Opposition was injuring this country by encouraging the British, and that the British can only keep going by virtue of the encouragement they get from us.  We are now asked to provide out of public funds a special organ for putting across that kind of dope on the people of this country.  The people have been free only for about ten years.  We have not the long tradition of freedom behind us that other countries have.  It is important that our people should be encouraged to face up to political realities and that they should not be doped in this way.  We are asked now &mdash;the President not being satisfied with his other resources&mdash;to vote out of public funds special moneys to keep the people of this country in ignorance and to mislead them so that they may serve the interests of the Fianna Fáil Party to the detriment of their own interests and of the interests of their country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I only intend to speak a very few words on this Estimate, but I may say at once that I am entirely opposed to it.  My opposition to it is not based, in the main, on the very unfavourable view that we take on this side of the House with regard to the special qualities of the present Government.  This is an Estimate which I should oppose no matter how high my opinion were of the Government, because I think it is intolerable in principle that the Government of the day should be given public money to set up a party publicity agent, and I do not really see how anyone sitting on the benches opposite can honestly deny that that is what this gentleman is to be&mdash;a party publicity agent.  He is to receive a salary which, taking the President's ratio, is the equivalent of paying £59,400 a year in England, or, in a few <Col N="1620" /> years' time £66,000 a year.  He is to receive as much as one of His Majesty's Ministers sitting on the bench opposite, and the Irish people are to be asked to find that money for the purpose of adding to the resources of Fianna Fáil publicity.  I am at a loss to imagine on what reputable ground that action can be defended.  I may say, by the way, that this Estimate appears to be somewhat of an insult to Mrs. Sheehy-Skeffington, who informed the world a few days ago that she held the position of Irish national propagandist.  As that duty is already being performed free of charge, it seems rather unnecessary to pay a gentleman £1,000 a year to do the same thing, especially as there is to be a staff added later, which will greatly increase the expense.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald stated that in a time of war a propaganda bureau could be defended.  The President might argue that the situation between ourselves and Great Britain was analogous to war, but that is a plea that cannot be admitted, inasmuch as disputes of a financial character between nations occur quite frequently, and the whole world would be driven to an orgy of propaganda if it was to be understood that each time such a dispute arose the Government of the day was justified in creating a bureau to disseminate information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President gave as an example of the special need for creating this bureau, that the world in general did not understand that he was willing to submit his case in the financial dispute with England to an impartial tribunal. I do not feel able to let that statement go without challenge, because I do not believe he is willing to submit his case to an impartial tribunal, and I do not believe he has ever been willing to submit his case to an impartial tribunal.  If he was, I am quite convinced it could have been accomplished. He would never even go so far as to say that the Irish representatives on the arbitration tribunal would be Irish citizens, because if he had gone so far, the question would then be narrowed down to the selection of a chairman, and there is not a single person in this House so childish that he does not realise that an impartial <Col N="1621" /> chairman could be secured; that if one were simply to select a number of reputable and capable people, without considering whether they were inside or outside the Commonwealth, it would be perfectly easy to pick out an impartial chairman.  If necessary, we could draw a name out of a hat, without deciding beforehand whether he was a Commonwealth person or a non-Commonwealth person.  Moreover, some of the more recent utterances of the President, in which he stated firmly that under no circumstances were any payments ever going to be made to the British again, certainly seem to imply&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am personally quite convinced that he never for a moment contemplated accepting any tribunal, and if negotiations about arbitration had <Col N="1622" /> gone any further, they would have resulted in his proposing a class of person as Irish representative, and as chairman, who would have turned the arbitration more into a knock-about show than a serious arbitration. I am opposing this Vote.  I do not propose to say anything more, except to repeat that this Vote ought to be rejected in any right-thinking Parliament, on principle, quite apart from whether the Government of the day are an especially deserving Government or an especially undeserving Government.</P>

      <P>I want to make a few remarks with regard to this Vote.  I am opposing it for one or two reasons. Whilst it may be necessary that in this country we should have a Government information bureau I object to the method of the appointment.  Since this Government came into power there have been a series of what I can only term political appointments, given to persons of their own particular views in politics, without any examination, or other method of arriving at their fitness for such positions.  I object to the method of selection, because we find that in other Departments of State appointments akin to this were made by the Appointments Commissioners. Why was not that practice carried out in the case of this appointment?  Certainly there are very many capable journalists in this country, a very large number of whom are capable of undertaking the duties which appertain to this appointment.  I would like to know from the President if any of these journalists were interviewed, or if their credentials were examined, and by what method he arrived at the selection of one person amongst the whole journalistic profession. Was the appointment advertised in the ordinary way that Civil Service appointments are advertised?  If not, why was not the usual practice adhered to?  That practice was consistently followed by the Government that preceded the present Government, and, to a certain extent, it has been followed by the present Government within the past few years.  I want to know why that practice has been departed from now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night we spent our time, by contrast with this Vote, in debating the necessity for getting £1,000 from vocational education committees in this country, and we were discussing how we might get an odd £10 or £15 from medical officers of health, and from poor law dispensary officers.  The only argument put up in relation to their &ldquo;cuts&rdquo; was that it would be unfair to leave these people untouched when everyone else was getting a whack.  Here is one man who is not getting a whack.  Here is one man who can stand up with a clear conscience and say: &ldquo;I have gained.&rdquo; Someone is going to get £900 yearly, rising by £25 to £1,000, for giving out Government dope.  What is the dope to be about?  Look at the enticing list the President gave.  The populace and the world must be told the truth about black bread; the populace and the world must be told the truth about the annuities, and the National policy in the matter of arbitration in regard to them.</P>
      <P>The world outside, and I suppose the people at home, must be told about revolution and whether we are on the verge of it, a job that would require a man at even more than £900.  He has got to show again what is being done in the way of providing employment for our young people.  I should like to say a word on some of these items. Black bread!  The adjective annoys the President.  Supposing he calls it black and tan bread&mdash;would it be anything better?  Supposing he puts it this way: white bread gone dirty through the Fianna Fáil administration&mdash;is it any better?  Supposing he calls it white flour blackened by Fianna Fáil handling, will it please any more, or yellow bread for conscripts?</P>

      <P>Or &ldquo;cods.&rdquo;  Or he may say: &ldquo;Let us call it mourning bread&rdquo;&mdash;we are in the season of Lent &mdash;ashen grey for penance, the penance brought on us by the policy of the Party opposite, for their sins.  We have had one good year already.  Whether it be black bread or whatever colour be decided upon, I suppose it will be <Col N="1624" /> an offence to allude to it by any, other name.  Perhaps we shall be told that this bread will be the most nutritious and the most wholesome for our people.  It will be what the people were sighing for, nourishment from God.  It will be something at least as desirable as the loss of the British markets, something possibly for which the President in his exalted moments when he has nothing else to do, after a few prefactory &ldquo;damns,&rdquo; will thank God.  That is a good preamble for the institution of the new Department. We have got to get this bread over.  The idea that it is lowering the standard of living for the people has got to be abolished and something put in its place.  We will get the same change, perhaps as the President made in the famous interview published in the <i>Manchester Guardian.</i> Possibly there will not be a lower standard but a &ldquo;changed standard.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am glad to see that the new Department is going to deal with the question of the annuities and the payments to Britain.  I tried to get the Minister for Finance this morning to deal with this matter and he refused.  Will the new Department be called upon to deal with that matter or with the statement made in the British House of Commons recently, that in fact, in so far as certain duties were concerned, which were imposed 21 months ago, and as far as other duties were concerned which were imposed 18 months ago, they have been enabled to extract from the produce of this country and the people of this country, two years defaulting moneys?  The man who explains that is worth £900.  The Minister who is getting more than £900 could not explain it to-day.  He has got to go on to explain further how are we retaining in this country the land annuity moneys if in fact, the British can either in 21 months or 17 months extract the full total from us by duties imposed upon our produce.  Will the Information Bureau explain this: what is the justice of asking farmers who used only to pay that portion of the withheld moneys which is represented by annuities, to pay now not merely the annuities, but the R.I.C. pensions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1625" /> When the Bureau has answered all these questions will it give us any reason for this further matter?  If the loss of the British market is inconsiderable why is it that we send, or what madness is it to send, so much stuff from the Free State into that undesirable market when we are paying more than the land annuities to send that stuff in?  Will anybody have the temerity to suggest in view of all that has been collected in duties that we have retained the land annuities in this country?  What happens if the British do go back on their own promise and extract more from us than the moneys held by us? Supposing they do collect more than this £800,000, which is to be extracted in a short period, seeing that they have in a shorter period almost by 50 per cent., extracted £660,000, we are in a bad way.  Supposing they stop short at the amount we have withheld, what happens the amount which should be devoted to sinking fund purposes?  The British say that they are not bound to pay into the sinking fund and they are not paying into it. It was provided under the sinking fund arrangement that the annuities would be terminable at some future date, but no provision is now being made for the sinking fund, so that the annuities will be paid in perpetuity and that is what is called saving the country money.  I asked the Minister for Finance a question in regard to these two items to-day.  I asked him, if the position which I think might occur, should arise, and if as a result of that position the British really extracted from us more than we withheld, what provision he had made to meet the situation.  The Minister said he was not prepared to admit that such a situation could arise and added: &ldquo;If it should, no doubt the Government will be fully able to deal with it.&rdquo;  May I put this gloss on it: that they will be able to fool the people on this problem as they did on the land annuities problem?  The result of that will be, that in that roundabout way with a great dislocation of trade, we in fact pay more than what it is said we are keeping from them.  That is the second item the President has outlined for his <Col N="1626" /> Information Bureau.  We are going to have the whole matter of these annuities discussed.  They involve the finances of this country.  We had a Loan here recently and this morning also I tried to get from the Minister for Finance some particulars in regard to that Loan.  It is a thing the Government should be anxious to explain.</P>

Surely the Deputy does not contend that any activity of any Government Department which a Deputy may wish to discuss can be debated on this Vote? It certainly can not.  A question was asked to-day by the Deputy in regard <Col N="1627" /> to the last National Loan.  The question was answered and if the Deputy thinks that by a side wind on this Vote he can debate that matter now, particularly as he was precluded from debating it on the adjournment he is mistaken.</P>

I take it that the question of black bread is a major item of Government policy on which the Bureau will supply information so that it is relevant for discussion on this Vote?  Is there anything more important to the country than the finances of the country, with which the question of the National Loan is linked up, and the failure of the National Loan?  If there is anything which the Government Bureau will find it necessary to deal with it is this question&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us get clear on this matter.  The Deputy has reverted to the contention that this officer when appointed will have to deal with all aspects of Government policy and that therefore all aspects of the National Loan, for instance, are open for discussion.

That was the only excuse given&mdash;that there was a necessity for dealing with items, and the President outlined some.  If we are not to go beyond what the President mentioned, then where is the limit to be put?  I suggest that it is certainly not to be limited just because the President chose certain things, otherwise <Col N="1628" /> we will be forced to the conclusion that if the President made no speech in moving we could not discuss the Vote, which is absurd.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me confine myself to the points which the President gave as the foundation for the introduction of this Vote to pay this £900 per annum for the purpose of establishing a Bureau.  Revolution was the next item.  I do not know if there was a colour attached to it.  Journalists are fond of the word ruddy in front of that.  Are we on the verge of revolution? The President has led quite a number of people to believe that we are.  The President was forced to employ an instrument which he detested&mdash; the Constitution (Amendment No. 17) Act.  And why?  Mainly because of the famous Hailsham lie.  That was his own statement.  Having this information on our hands, we could not do otherwise than introduce this.  At the moment there are men being brought up on charges which the Ministry themselves, when examples are given to them amongst their own servants, describe as ridiculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald dealt at length with the revolution aspect, and I am not going into it in detail.  The basis of the President's contention for the use of the so-called abominable instrument of the Military Tribunal, described by his Minister for Finance as the seven bloodhounds long ago, is the fact that somebody lied to him and he was foolish and weak enough to <Col N="1629" /> believe a monstrous statement, flung out here as truth, about Deputy Mulcahy. He has run away every time that has been put to him since, and refused to give information about it.  Will the Bureau give the information, or hereafter is this £900 a year man to stand for the odium and contempt which the President's weakness in believing stories that he is too anxious to believe may bring upon him?</P>
    <P>The matter of the imprisoned journalist was raised already.  I want only to say this about it: somebody in Government circles, according to the oath of the journalist, not denied by his editor, gave information exclusively to that paper.  The person who gave the information was not man enough to come forward and say where it came from, and the Ministry who were brought into that case through that particular piece of evidence were not plucky enough to admit who had the responsibility on him for making the statement, and one man suffered.  Is the new appointee here going to be put in this ugly position, that any time there is a mishandling of Government information he is the man to be hauled before the Military Tribunal and do his month or six weeks for refusing to answer a question?  Is that what the £900 a year, rising by £25 per year, is to be given for?  I think in China they used to have a system whereby a man could buy himself off punishment by putting forward a substitute.  Is that the game here?  The President can laugh.  The President used not to laugh when Hailsham was mentioned before. He used the phrase once about words twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools.  He was either a knave or a fool, or possibly himself never understood it, and he certainly twisted the phrase. He now gets another conscience to put between himself and the public &mdash; a salaried conscience.  If there is another journalist to be imprisoned, this, presumably, will be the man; at any rate, this is the man on whom the odium will lie, and the President can indulge in his favourite game of repudiation.</P>
    <P>The biggest job of all in connection with the Bureau is to tell of the means employed to give employment to the people of the country.  Might I suggest <Col N="1630" /> a few figures that he might explain? Speaking in this House before Christmas, the Minister for Industry and Commerce asserted that the really true test as to the growth of employment was the test of the Unemployment Insurance Fund and the stamps that were bought for it.  It is a good test.  He stated in this House that in 1928 those figures were so much, in 1929 so much &mdash; an increase; and in 1930 still an increase. He then took a deep breath and took the plunge and said that in 1933 they were up by £60,000.  Then he made a rapid calculation, and it was an accurate one this time, that £4 in the fund represents a man given employment for 50 weeks in the year.  He then divided the figure by four and immediately there were 15,000 people in employment to his credit.  That bubble did not last long.  Another question put down revealed that the money had to be divided between the years 1931, 1932 and 1933, and it then appeared &mdash; this is possibly subject to explanation by the Bureau &mdash; that in 1931, the last year of the regime that was destroying Irish industry, 11,000 people had gone into new occupations. Then the Minister for Industry and Commerce came with his high tariffs, quotas, impositions, and helping the Minister for Finance to save money, and we find that in that year, with all these advantages and all the enthusiasm of a new Government and a new policy that is going to turn the country into a paradise, he put less than 6,000 people into employment.  Last year, with the continuance of the high tariffs and extra impositions and bounties and quotas, he had 1,500 people put into employment.</P>

      <P>If the President is going to ask the Bureau to tell how the Government is providing employment for young people, I am asking him to explain certain figures.  I submit it is quite relevant.  In two years the new policy which was to provide employment for the people has not succeeded in putting anything like as many into <Col N="1631" /> employment as the last Government did in the last years of its period. There is another side to that.  To-day I asked a question as to the drawing out of the fund.  That is the opposite side to it.  New men may come into the fund, but the people who are still there may get out of employment and may draw from it.</P>
      <P>In 1931, there was a sum of £546,000 paid out in benefit, and in 1932, the great year of tariffs, the great year of employment, the year when 84,000 people were to be given new employment, the payment of benefit increased to £638,000, nearly £100,000 more by way of unemployment insurance benefit.  That certainly will be something for the Information Bureau to think about, and that represents only industry.  I suppose when the President speaks of employment he will include agriculture.  What about the number registered as unemployed? What about the increased numbers going on home assistance?  What about the Unemployment Assistance Bill which, according to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, is to provide relief for 60,000 people for whom no work can be got?  According to the Minister for Education, it is not right to talk of 60,000 people; the figure should be 90,000.</P>

      <P>They may deal with agriculture generally.  They may tell us in a sort of jocose way why the Minister for Agriculture has gone on to milk.  The story used to be told of Lincoln that when he proposed to move a General whom he admired, General Grant, to pursue one of the defeated Generals on the other side, the objection was raised that he drank, and his answer was: &ldquo;I would like to know the brand; I will send some barrels of it to other people; he wins battles.&rdquo;  I can see the President looking at the Minister for Agriculture and his drink and work, and saying: &ldquo;If I catch any of the rest of you drinking milk, you will be sacked.&rdquo; Think of that unfortunate man.  He has all the oats of the country to carry. Previously I represented him as staggering about like a new Atlas with a greasy load of butter on his shoulders.  He probably will have to bear part of the repercussions of the peat scheme.  He certainly will fall foul eventually of those who have been deluded about wheat.  He is getting into trouble already about tobacco.  I wonder is there anything upon which he can pride himself?  Is there anything <Col N="1633" /> that the new Bureau will be able to say on his behalf?</P>

Who is it going to be, and who is going to make the appointment?  The papers have reported a certain name.  That may be repudiated.  Somebody may have to suffer for having given wrong information. I hope, to a certain extent, that the name is a correct one, not that I am to be taken as approving of the appointment, the person appointed, the salary given, or the whole scheme. I am, at any rate, glad of this, that the Ministry have not stooped to take anybody from a newspaper which has been found recently in this country professing it is an upholder of Christian principles, and even the great upholder of law and morals, and then stooping to review a book last Tuesday&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy who is departing showed such a complete lack of ingenuity and collapsed so suddenly that I take it the intention is to talk this matter out as long as ever the Deputies over there can manage to do so, and that they will endeavour to bring in every possible subject, to drag in everything they can.  They began by putting up Deputy Desmond Fitzgerald, who, when he accompanied the ex-President to America, was described as a reformed poet.  We all know what poetic licence means.  It means that you are never on your oath.  Well, Deputy Desmond reformed poet Fitzgerald was certainly not on his oath to-night. He has gone out so that he cannot be cross-examined.  He led the House to believe that the Government had actually censored a disreputable little rag issued by the U.I.P., that they had actually cut out passages of it.  Now, there are a good many people in the House, and I am putting it to all sides of the House whether that impression was or was not conveyed by Deputy Desmond Fitzgerald.  I am asking Deputy Desmond Fitzgerald or any other member of his Party to say whether it is true in fact that the Government, or any part of the Government did cut out, censor, black-out in the United Ireland Party organ the passages which he says were blacked out?  It is very easy for him to get out of the House.  It is very easy for the Deputy, having made that statement, and having put before this House statement after statement in relation to that, to get out so that he will not have to answer that question, the question of who it was took it out.  Who took those <Col N="1635" /> pieces out of the paper?  It is a disgraceful thing to have done that, it is a disreputable thing to have done it, according to the reformed poet.  But who did it?  He left you under the impression that it was the Government. I am asking the Cumann na nGaedheal Party or the U.I. Party, or the Farmers' Party or the National League or whatever they are calling themselves at the present moment &mdash; you have got to be very up to date to know what their name is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The League of Youth! They are getting so young that if they get much younger they will have to be carried around in cradles.  But I am getting back to the statement actually made that the Government censored and destroyed portions of their wretched little rag.  Deputy Desmond Fitzgerald is not the only person who knows all about that rag.  I am putting it to the other rag merchants: Is it or is it not true to say that the Government did take out portions of that paper, and if it is not true, who was it, that of their own choice, did that disgraceful thing?  Somebody had better send a message to Deputy Desmond Fitzgerald that we would like to get him here in the box.  Another thing he told us about was &ldquo;a single farmer's wife.&rdquo;  That is not merely poetic licence.  That is the very indecency that the Deputy who has just departed from the House has protested against so violently, &ldquo;a single farmer's wife!&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He said there was a dangerous situation in the country; that there was an organisation here consisting of most disreputable people, a privileged criminal organisation.  Deputy&mdash;no, not Deputy, but I think it is a pity he does not come here instead of leaving his office boys to talk for him and contradict him, instead of leaving his office boys to explain him away&mdash;<Col N="1636" /> General O'Duffy said the other day that every single member of the I.R.A. were Communists, and then he went on to say that he got 500 of these Communists in the U.I.P., and he next went on to say that there were 750 Guards dismissed for conduct of one kind or another that deserved dismissal and then he said that he got the majority of them in the U.I.P. &mdash;this privileged Communist organisation consisting of criminals recruited from the I.R.A.  He has these and the disreputable members of the Guards, 750 of them.</P>
    <P>We generally hear stories of miles of Blueshirts.  The highest figure I have yet seen of the Blueshirts in the Press was exactly the number of the 750 disreputable Guards and the 500 recruited Communists of the I.R.A. Naturally, Deputy Desmond Fitzgerald said that there is a privileged criminal organisation.  But we are not privileging.  Are they only suggesting that the President is privileging it? Then we have this salaried conscience. There is not a single man on the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches who ever drew or would draw a salary. There is such a high moral tone that their whole Party, through which they have carried on the government of this country, is such that not one single one of them took a salary.  Some of them would not even take four salaries and a bonus at the same time.</P>
    <P>They were so conscientious that they would not even divulge to the House for fear it might discredit the House, for fear it might shake and appal the conscience of the House, that while they were acting as medical officers, while they were acting as Deputies, while they were acting as other things as well, they were also directors.  A &ldquo;salaried&rdquo; conscience &mdash; four times &ldquo;salaried&rdquo; conscience!  I hope that in future, when some time 3,000 years after Tibb's Eve Deputies with long grey beards, with sticks to help them in, will come in to occupy again the Front Benches of Government and not that of the Rotary Club, it will be clearly understood there will be no salaries for fear it would interfere with their delicate consciences.  Again, there is a censorship.  They say it is <Col N="1637" /> not a censorship in the interests of the truth.  They say it is a censorship in the interests of everything that is untrue.  I wonder if that particular newspaper man were to publish the actual speech that Mr. O'Duffy delivers instead of the speech that is handed by his secretary to the Press, whether that would be regarded as censorship in the interests of truth?  It is time that somebody went round and really did collect these gems of political wisdom which are being suppressed by, I am sorry to say, all the papers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Only to the speech, and I am getting off that.  I am only indicating this.  The next thing they said was that the activities of this Press Bureau would be directed against perfectly lawful organisations.  Now I take it that they mean the hydra-headed, multi-named organisation to which they at the moment belong; or perhaps they are in process of changing from it to another organisation, whatever that is.  They mean the Fine Gael, or the fine gale &mdash; the big wind. That is a perfectly lawful organisation, and that statement is made by the ex-Minister, who passed the Public Danger Act, which at the present moment they are so very much annoyed about not having destroyed.  Under the precise provisions of that Act, by the precise machinery laid down by that Act created by them, that mutable organisation does in fact become an unlawful organisation.  A perfectly lawful organisation, therefore, is one which is, under the Act and the direct provisions of the Act passed by the gentlemen who complain of it, an unlawful society.  We did not create the machinery.  We did not create the machinery which we are told is being strained, and which made of those various organisations and their overnight successors illegal organisations. The Deputies opposite created it; the Deputy who complained of it created it, and it is under precisely that same machinery that whatever was done to the little rag of a U.I.P. organ was done.  They are responsible for it, <Col N="1638" /> whatever it is.  If a perfectly lawful organisation has become an entirely unlawful organisation it has become an entirely unlawful organisation under the provisions of the precise machinery set up for the purpose of making it an unlawful organisation.  They went on to say &mdash; I myself am frequently puzzled to see how I can be in order in discussing what they did say; I am referring to that delicate conscience which I have in those matters, and it is not a salaried conscience in this matter at all, but when a Deputy has for five or six years trod the path of order, without ever departing even by a hair's breadth from it, it is a rather serious matter that he should feel himself now being led down the primrose path to disorder following a reformed poet.  They told us that this Government &mdash; and remember we are discussing a motion to set up a Press agency of some kind &mdash; has committed a horrible primevality.  I should like a glass of water, I cannot go on on milk!</P>

      <P>I do not think the Ceann Comhairle would allow me to discuss light beer except in its relation to milk, which I think I will be able to do later.  This criminal organisation called a Government has actually allowed people to have guns without permission, and they want to know whether this new Press agent is going to repeat the declaration of the President that he has no intention of going out to get the guns.  Since when has it become a new thing for a President not to go out after and get the guns?  Did the President who went to America with the reformed poet go out after the guns where he knew they were?  Did General MacDuffy go out and get them where he knew they were, and where he told the late President they were?  Did he go out after the guns which he knew were in the hands of his own supporters, and which were taken out of the barracks of this country with the knowledge of the then Government?  Is there anything new about a President who does not go out to get the guns?  If there is not, why should they be so worried that there is to <Col N="1639" /> be set up a Press agent who might possibly talk about things of this kind?  Is it that they are afraid?  Is it that they are afraid that this disreputable Pressman might say: &ldquo;The custom of this country, as initiated by President Cosgrave and followed by President de Valera, is that no President will go out after the guns in the possession of anybody whom he thinks ought to have them.&rdquo;  There was ten years' precedent for that before we came in.  What is wrong with the precedent? There is nothing wrong with the President; I am speaking of the precedent.  What is wrong with the precedent?  For ten years Cumann na nGaedheal allowed anybody that suited them to have any kind of weapon they liked, to use in any way they liked, on whom they liked, for any purpose that suited their own Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that absolutely, and I am not going to discuss the policy.  I am simply dealing with the question of the existence of that thing, the President's connection with which was attacked &mdash; the bare existence of it.  If that thing had not existed that lie would have been got away with, and because that thing which they have stigmatised and attacked did exist that lie was caught and throttled and strangled and broken, and a different Government was sent here, sent on to these Front Benches than would have been sent if that damned lie had been allowed the propaganda and the freedom and the exaggeration that it would have had in the hands of the kept Press.  If there were not somebody to publish on that morning the result of the inquest, everybody knows what would have happened.  Naturally, they do not like the Press which queered the pitch of the vilest and most contemptible political manoeuvre that has ever disgraced politics in this country.  Then, Deputy MacDermot discussed, with considerable liberality the possibility of the existence of an impartial tribunal.  He told us and went into detail on the difficulties in regard to it, of the kind of tribunal <Col N="1641" /> that might have been set up.  This is on the question of whether or not we would have a Press bureau in this country.  Am I to follow him into that track?  I think I will not, sir. I think I will leave him wandering in the inane by himself.</P>
      <P>Deputy Anthony wants to talk about political appointments.  Our predecessors never did&mdash;these Simon Pures, these unsalaried consciences that set up the Appointments Board after they had stuffed every place in this country that they could with their own pals.  Yes, I like the conscience of these people who do not like political appointments after they had filled the plums for themselves.  They set up the Appointments Commission to prevent themselves having to decide between all the other people whom they did not reward and now what the poor unfortunate Pressman has to do with political appointments, I am again puzzled to know, but I am perfectly satisfied that Deputies opposite who, for ten long years, occupied the Front Benches of the Government and had all the responsibilities of Government, and all the respect which they naturally had for this great institution they have set up, must have known what that had to do with the Pressman or they would not have talked about it.

That is the sort of thing that is held out to us as black bread.  It is held out to us as black bread by the very Deputies who ate it in the restaurant day after day and did not know that they were eating it. I wonder if the propagandist, salaried-conscience Pressman will let that out? I wonder if by any chance he would reproduce, for the benefit of the public, cross sections, at different <Col N="1642" /> angles, of white and black bread?  He might, for instance, start a lottery, a guessing competition, as to which was the white and which was the black bread.  He would be amazed at the disreputable things he could do, but whatever he does with black bread, the Deputies opposite ate it and did not know anything about it.  Deputy McGilligan then goes on to raise a high question of economic policy upon which I think you will agree, sir, that I would be bound to discuss not merely tariffs, quotas, credit-reform systems, and millennium dawnings but these two years of defaulted money which the British are supposed to have collected in one year.  All that propaganda is founded on the idea&mdash; and it is one which I commend to the Minister for Finance because it is going to make his Budget very, very convenient &mdash; that all taxes that are collected on tariffed imported goods are paid by the person who sends in the goods.  The whole calculation of Deputy McGilligan depends on adding together the whole of the taxes collected on Irish goods sent into England and he says that all those are paid by Ireland.  If the Minister for Finance wants to balance his budget, all he has got to do is to go on putting tax after tax on the British and say that the British are paying all the taxes as they come in. There is not, even on the opposite side, a fool big enough to believe that. That, however, is the contention which is made.</P>

      <P>I was getting on to it. The next question was the registered unemployed.  What that has to do with the Press bureau I frankly do not know, but a late member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, a respectable member of society, a man who has &ldquo;walked with kings and yet not lost the very common touch,&rdquo; thought it was in order.  I will tell you what the Press bureau will say on the unemployment question. He wanted to know what it might possibly tell him about the unemployed. It will tell him that in every day of every week and of every month since last June up to the end of this year the figures were better, progressively better, than they were in the previous year.  It will also tell him that all the slanderous misrepresentations made are due to the difference between the figures of last year and the one before it.  It will tell him that that misrepresentation was due to the deliberate and maliciously untruthful suppression of the fact that those figures were taken upon an entirely different basis.  I think that would be a very useful thing for the Press bureau to do.  Say that you take the case of people on the other side who are asking to enter into certain contractual relations and, after they have discounted the fact that we are all liars, thieves and murderers here, after they have discounted the fact that no Party in this country will keep its agreement and the fact that both Parties in this country have decided that under no condition whatever, whatever Government is here, will they ever pay to England, to Mother England, their just debts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>After they have discounted all those things they will still be faced by the fact that it is suggested this country is unstable in the sense that our unemployment figures are right; that the people are becoming less able to meet their obligations even if they could.  Is not <Col N="1646" /> that a matter for the Press bureau: to say what I have said in this House and what the Deputies can quite easily check: that no Deputy in this House has contradicted and that no Deputy on the other side of the House has had the manliness to repeat&mdash;that in every day of every week and every month from last June until the end of this year the figures have been improved.  It might go on to tell them something more about the unemployment figures: that there has in the interval been a new Act passed for the purpose of dealing with unemployment in a different manner: in a more Christian manner: that a new inducement has been held out to the people artificially to register. It might go on to explain that the unemployment registration figures are rising and must rise until we reach a new balance represented by the bringing in of the people who think that they are entitled to get maintenance out of the new Act.  Would not that be very desirable, a proper thing for the Press bureau to speak of?  There are various other things that it might speak of.  I have no doubt that there are Deputies on this side and on the other side of the House who, before the debate concludes, will think of a lot of other valuable and useful information that this new officer of the State will be able to give.</P>

Opposition members were told they could not discuss every possible aspect of Government policy which might be dealt with by this Information Bureau, and the Parliamentary Secretary is proceeding to do exactly that thing: to initiate a debate that might not end for weeks if that line were allowed to be pursued.</P>

I wonder if in doing this there is any recollection of the fact that it is not 12 months ago since a Bill or a motion to provide something like £100,000 was put through this House to subsidise the political organ of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

We are asked now to provide a sum of £10,000 to disseminate Fianna Fáil propaganda. That £1,000, collected off every teacher of a vocational education committee, is to go to employ one man to spit out Fianna Fáil propaganda.  I ask the House to recollect that, within the last 12 months, we had to provide a sum of approximately £100,000 to subsidise the <i>Irish Press</i>&mdash; the newspaper of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <P>You are very fond of contradicting yourself, but you should get out of the habit of contradicting others when they are right.  We have had this particular proposal referred to by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance as an Estimate to provide a Press agency &mdash; a Press agency for the Party in power, a Press agency at the expense of the taxpayer to bolster up a tottering political Party. We had no justification given us by the individual who introduced the Estimate beyond the statement that it had to do with black bread and revolution.  If this were to put an instrument into the hands of the Government, costing either £10,000 or 100 times that amount, an instrument that would be genuinely used by the Government to deal with revolution or threatened revolution, I should have no hesitation in voting for the provision of the money.  But that organ, which has been already so heavily subsidised has, so far, only added to the forces of revolution in this country, and has never come out to condemn any of the agents or forces driving this country towards revolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always very obedient when it comes to the ruling of the Chair.  I propose merely to reply to some of the arguments put forward by the Parliamentary Secretary.  In his remarks with regard to the likelihood of revolution and his justification for the exercise of the powers of the Public Safety Act, he pointed to the fact that it was the creation of the Party that now sits here.  He rather laboured the point which has been laboured with very little success by lawyers sitting opposite, that any organisation declared under that Act to be illegal is thereby illegal.  If he had ever read the Act, or even glanced at it, he would know that the declaration in itself does not make any organisation illegal, but that that declaration is supposed to depend on contributory factors named and on evidence forthcoming that, in some one of these particulars, the organisation has offended the law.  The change of name, which he is so skittish about, is not any more remarkable than, nor is it so precipitate as the change of the man who wanted to lead a No Income-Tax Party in this country when he was blowing the bugle of Cumann na <Col N="1650" /> nGaedheal down in Cork, and changed not only his outlook, his political label, his financial tune, but his whole public creed merely because he was not selected by that Party and put up as a candidate.  People in glass houses should not throw stones.</P>
      <P>Changes of name on this side were merely in compliance with the laws made by the opposite side.  The change probably upset people opposite. They would like us to follow in their footsteps, defying the law because those laws were made by political opponents.  They would like to provoke us into the same type of lawlessness that they created, fostered and encouraged up to the date that they became the Government of this country.  If there is one thing that this country should be proud of, it is that there are in it organisations of youth that are not too hot-blooded or blinded by passion to comply with the law, no matter how unjustly it is administered. I myself felt, when I spoke here on a previous occasion, that successive bans would have the effect of stirring up organised trouble throughout the country.  At that time, I ventured to express the hope that such would not occur.  I am proud to-night to be able to boast that such did not occur.  The provocation of successive bans having failed to drive these people into revolt against the laws of the State, are being supplemented by every provocative statement that can be made by certain Ministers. They have been supplemented by provocative pronouncements in that heavily subsidised journal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>For your information, sir, and in order to demonstrate the fact that I am driving rigidly between shafts, before I referred to this particular line I drew attention to the fact that the previous speaker on the opposite side had discussed this ban, the reason why it was banned, and made mirth of the subsequent changes of name as a result of that ban.  The President, when introducing the Estimate, referred to the fact that among the subjects which should be dealt with by this Department were questions such as black bread and revolution.  I am following by that, and I am daring to express the hope that this subsidised Department will not have to deal with revolution.  I am replying to the Parliamentary Secretary that those changes of name were indicative of the desire of the political Opposition to respect the State, no matter who the rulers of that State were, and that these particular changes of name, which he makes a joke about here, were produced by the corrupt manipulation of the laws of this State &mdash; of the Executive Council of this State &mdash; and that if there is to be revolution in this or in any other country, it will be produced primarily by corrupt manipulation of the laws by those charged with the responsibility, mainly, of upholding the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are being asked to subsidise another political propagandist Department functioning under the Fianna Fáil Government, and the one we have already subsidised heavily has done more to incite revolution in this country than any foreign agents or activists in this country.  In the light of the provocative propaganda that is being disseminated by that subsidised organ day after day, I ask, are we wise to provide more money in order to carry that work further?  If the Fianna Fáil policy has so landed this boat on to the rock of shipwreck that every little worker and employee up and <Col N="1652" /> down the country has got to draw a little bit less for his labour at the end of the week, that even a sum of £1,000, collected from 50 or 60 individuals is vital to the further financial stability of this State&mdash;if there is any honesty or any sincerity in the case that was advanced from those benches last night, then, certainly, this £10,000 for political propaganda should not be voted.</P>

      <P>Notwithstanding the temptation to which one is subject by reason of the examples set by previous speakers, I do not propose to make any excursion into the domain of general State politics such as we have listened to in this House to-night. Deputy Fitzgerald opened the debate from the Opposition Benches and his speech was nothing more than a raking of the ashes of the civil war just an attempt to see whether he could discover in the ashes any spark which might be fanned into flame again so that he might re-enact here in words the physical struggle of 1922 and 1923.  Listening to the speech, it was perfectly clear that Deputy Fitzgerald was more concerned with using this House as a platform from which to attack a particular organ of the Press than he was to discuss the merits of the proposition that is before the House this evening.  His speech was one, long, blinding wail of insane political passion against a Press organ, just because it does not happen to take the viewpoint of the Party opposite.  One would imagine, listening to Deputy Fitzgerald's speech, that the Party opposite, when in office, had no Press organ whatever, but everybody knows that during the period they were a Government they had practically every Press organ in the country, not merely at their beck and call, but even in their pockets, and when one particular Press organ in this country at that time dared to criticise the policy of the last Government they were refused advertisements which were in the power of that Government to give.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald told us about all the vices of the <i>Irish Press</i> and all the dangerous and insidious things that paper does from the point of <Col N="1653" /> view of the Irish people.  The fact that it is progressing, from the point of view of circulation, looks as if the people of this country, who are not the money-bags of this country, are perfectly satisfied, or, at all events, reasonably satisfied with the news service given by that paper.  According to Deputy Fitzgerald, however that paper has every possible vice.  I will say this, however, that no matter what that paper does during its life-time, I am satisfied that it will never call an Irish soldier an assassin as some of the papers backing the Deputy's Party did, and that it could never sink to the disgraceful level of calling on an alien power to murder Pearse and Connolly as another Press organ in this country did.  We have been told to-day that the <i>Irish Press</i> has all the vices which it is possible for a journal to have.  No matter what mistakes it commits from the point of view of journalism, it will never disgrace the name of Irish journalism and Irish nationality in the manner in which other papers in this country have disgraced it.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacDermot talked on this publicity department as if he had never heard of a State publicity department before.  According to him, it is a dangerous and undesirable thing for any Government to have a publicity department at its disposal, because it could be used for all kinds of strange things by the Government in office.  If he had been familiar with the happenings in this country in 1923, 1924, and 1925, he would not be so shocked at the notion of a publicity department at all, because if he looks up the Estimates for 1923-24 he will find that the Government of the day, the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, of which he is now a member&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Well, the Deputy can pretend it as much as he likes.  I do not mind him pulling his own leg, but it is unfair that he should pull other people's legs.  In that year they spent £3,600 on a publicity department, when, according to the Deputy's Party &mdash; his Party now &mdash; these were years when there was so much milk and <Col N="1654" /> honey flowing about that there was no need to tell anybody they were there &mdash; it was so obvious to everybody.  In 1924-25, they spent £3,043 on a publicity department and paid the director of the department, whom they described as the head of the publicity department, £1,000 per annum &mdash; even though they only paid the temporary shorthand-typist 27/7d. per week and the unestablished messenger 25/- per week, and, in case he might indulge in any riotous conduct, they gave him an annual increment of 1/- a year. In the same Estimate further on we find that a sum of £5,250 was provided for publication and distribution in the Publicity Department for the purposes of purchasing, printing and distributing books, newspapers, pamphlets and photographs.  If the Deputy had been in the Party then his photograph might be well-known in the country now.  At all events we have it that in the year 1923-24 the Deputy's Party spent £3,600, and in 1924-25, £3,000, apart from the sum spent on the distribution of pamphlets, photographs and newspapers.</P>

      <P>If the research department of the Deputy's Party has collapsed I do not mind introducing him to the research department of the Labour Party, where he will get that information to-morrow.  The Deputy got up in blissful ignorance of the fact that there was a Publicity Department here before.  He has only now discovered that there was a Publicity Department, otherwise he would not have made such a foolish speech.  In his speech he committed himself to the principle that it was highly dangerous to have a Government Publicity Department.  If the Deputy had lived in this country in 1923-24 and 1924-25 he would have known perfectly well the purposes for which the Publicity Department in these years was used. Let the Deputy look at some of the Press statements issued in that period <Col N="1655" /> and he will have no hesitation in making up his mind that it was used for party political propaganda much more than in the interests of the nation as a whole.  I look upon this Estimate purely as a business one.  I see national advantage to the people of the country in being made aware, in every possible way, of the activities of any Government in power, so that they may know what Acts are passed by this legislature, the benefit of these Acts, so far as they affect the people, and in giving information with some kind of enlightened thought on the Acts of this legislature, rather than having them construed from documents by the vapourings at cross roads of people who have not prepared them but put into their hands by others as incapable of writing them as the persons who made the speeches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President made the case for this Estimate, that it was necessary for internal purposes and also necessary for external purposes.  I quite agree that it is eminently desirable, as a matter of external policy, that there should be some kind of Publicity Department which would give the people regular news items, showing the work of this legislature and the actions of any Government in power, no matter what the political complexion of that Government may be.  In existing circumstances, however, there is a particularly strong case for a Publicity Department, from the point of view of our relations with other nations.  Everyone knows perfectly well that there is a financial dispute on to-day with a nation which is capable of controlling, to a very large extent, the news agencies of the world, and which has shown in the past, perhaps never more effectively than during the great war, that it could use the Press agencies for every purpose for which it wanted to use them.  Deputy MacDermot travels frequently and does not confine his survey of life to this small island.  I wonder when travelling to Paris if he looks at the continental edition of the <i>Daily Mail</i> that circulates on the train.  Taking any news item in that paper that has any particular reference to this Government, I am perfectly prepared to allow the Deputy to arbitrate <Col N="1656" /> as to whether it is fair criticism or unfair criticism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to inform the Deputy that from my experience the French people do not read the continental edition of the <i>Daily Mail.</i> They read the French newspapers. Further, from my experience the official Fianna Fáil point of view is more than well represented in the French Press, and in the American papers, the two foreign countries with which I am most familiar.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Both.  The Deputy can have his choice.  Everyone knows that when Britain wants to blacken a people in the eyes of the world the Press agencies are used for the purpose.  Whenever it is a case of showing that the movement for Indian independence is a rabble movement, initiated by a low class in the community, the floodlights of publicity are turned on India, and the world is told of these awful people that Britain is spending so many millions of money trying to civilise, even though the people do not want civilisation by Britain.  Whenever it is a case of misrepresenting Egypt, or any other country where Britain wants to get a footing, the Press agencies throughout the world are controlled and manipulated.  With that knowledge of the manner in which the Press agencies are utilised for political propaganda by that country, it seems to me highly desirable that some effort should be made here to create an Information Bureau and a news publicity service to enable us to try to tell the world the truth about what is really happening here.  Some of us remember Britain's newspapers and Britain's Press Bureaux here.  We were told <Col N="1657" /> that the I.R.A. was a murder gang. That was the information that was disseminated by Britain's news agencies and by Britain's Bureaux in this country.  It seems to me to be highly desirable, especially in existing circumstances, that some effort should he made to secure that the Irish point of view should be put before the world, as well as the condition of affairs here, rather than looking to any other nation, for its own ends, to point out the real position.  In that sense I look upon this Estimate as a good investment for the nation.  The amount involved is small.</P>
      <P>I believe, from the point of view of the citizens resident here, from the point of view of our people who live in other lands, from the point of view of putting ourselves right with every other country, that this Estimate will yield a very substantial return, and will help to curb some of the misrepresentations of rather unfriendly neighbours.  I hope it will do much to curb many misleading statements issued by newspapers in this country, with the benediction of the Party opposite, in order to misrepresent everything done by the Government, just because they happen to dislike its political complexion.</P>

      <P>I think it worth while to assure Deputy Norton that, what he conceived to be his revelation with regard to the fact that an Information Bureau existed some years ago, has no effect at all in shaping my opinion, that in principle, in normal times, or anywhere near normal times an Information Bureau of this sort is a mistake and a danger.  After all we are human beings and it is a particularly characteristic failing of every Government to think that its particular point of view is the one that is right and the proper national point of <Col N="1658" /> view.  Consequently, if a Government has an Information Bureau at its beck and call, it is absolutely bound to use it for Party purposes.  I defy Deputy Norton to deny &mdash; in fact he has admitted by his own speech that he could not deny or would not deny &mdash; that it will be used for Party purposes, not for disseminating something that the Irish nation as a whole wishes to have disseminated but for disseminating the point of view of the particular Party that happens to be the Party in power at the time.  I say it is bad in principle.  Deputy Norton implies that we are doing the same thing as Great Britain is doing.  I would not care if Great Britain were doing it but it is not a fact that Great Britain is doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy implied it.  The notion that Great Britain has a stranglehold on the Press of the world, is altogether mistaken.  Great Britain is unpopular.  As a matter of fact, a powerful country is generally unpopular.  America is also unpopular in all European countries, and you will find that in nine countries out of ten, the general trend of the local Press will be against any Great Power where there is any matter in dispute between that Great Power and a Small Power. I believe the Deputy is entirely astray in thinking that there is a special need for a small nation to set up a Press Bureau.  As a matter of fact I doubt if this Bureau will be very much assistance to them, because I think that Fianna Fáil propaganda is being very efficiently conducted already.  I wish to compliment the Party opposite on the energy and efficiency of its propaganda.  It is put in such a form as to have an effect on uninstructed minds.  It would have little or no effect on instructed minds, but the Fianna Fáil Party does not consider instructed minds, knowing that they do not count very much from a voting point of view. On uninstructed minds it has its effect. It is well conceived and it is pushed with the greatest assiduity.  I daresay this Bureau will not add much to the efficacy of its propaganda.  The object possibly is to provide more jobs.  It is <Col N="1659" /> from that point of view that Deputy O'Higgins took particular exception to it, that it should be created at a moment when we are enforcing economies as per the Local Government (Temporary Economies) Bill, not to speak of the earlier Public Services (Temporary Economies) Bill, particularly at the moment when we are doing that, it is indecent to let the public in for the sort of expense that is proposed in this Estimate.</P>
      <P>It is really time that Deputy Norton and other Deputies should desist from the practice of expecting rather new members of the House, and members quite new to this Front Bench, to debate and stand over the doings of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party in the past.</P>

      <P>Everything they may have done may have been desirable, but I decline to spend my time reading up old files for the purpose of defending every past action of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  It may be that they were justified in 1924 in opening a Press Bureau.  I do not know the circumstances, or whether there were such revolutionary conditions obtaining then as to make such a thing necessary.  It is, however, irrelevant. In point of fact, what stands out is that when they were last in office they did not have such a Bureau. Presumably they gave it up because revolutionary conditions were past. That, again, I do not know, but they gave it up.  If they were justified in having it they were justified, and if they were not justified in having it, they saw the error of their ways and they gave it up.  Why should we be going back to a bad system on the plea that it was followed by somebody else? At the time perhaps, for all I know, it was justified.  I have tried to be moderate on this question, as indeed on all occasions in this House.  I have not personally rested my opposition to this Estimate on the sins of the Government.  I rest my opposition to the Estimate on the fact that it is unhealthy and unsound for a Government to set up with public <Col N="1660" /> money a Party Publicity Bureau.  It is a thing that is disgusting and cannot he defended.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacDermot is apparently troubled because this Press Bureau which it is proposed to establish may be used for Party purposes, something which, he implies, he and those associated with him, never consider, something which he assumes must be necessarily bad.  What does the Deputy mean by Party purposes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is about as clear as all the other utterances of the Deputy and means as much.  We have Party Government in this State.  This Party was elected by the people on a policy approved by the people, and the purpose of the Party is to give effect to that policy.  I know that Deputies opposite have not yet grasped the fact that the people prefer this Party to theirs.  For ten years they regarded themselves as appointed to office in this State, not by the will of the people, but by some Divine ordinance. They regarded themselves as demi-gods, ruling by some authority which came from within themselves and not under any obligation to seek any renewal of that authority from the people.  They look upon us as intruders, somebody who got into power by some freak of chance, or as a result of some vile, low-down trick.  Deputy MacDermot is beginning to get the same ideas as those with whom he is now associated, just as one child can get measles from another.  He is also beginning to regard himself as one of the little group of individuals, the little group of demi-gods, who are the rightful rulers of this country, and who have been wrongfully displaced by demons from the nether world who can do nothing right and whose sole purpose is to pile corruption upon corruption, to use Deputy O'Higgins' phrase.  The policy of this Party has been approved of by the people and if the purpose of this Party is to give effect to its policy, then any Party purpose that this institution may be used to effect, in so far as it conforms with the policy <Col N="1661" /> the people have approved of, is a good purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another consideration. One of the first functions of this Bureau is to provide a system of public education and Deputies opposite should be grateful for that, because they need that type of public education more than anybody.  As a sort of preliminary, however, we will give them a little private education.  Fact No. 1&mdash;there is Party Government in this State.  Secondly, the Fianna Fáil Government was chosen by the people and put into power by them to carry out a Party policy.  In case Deputies may have thought that the people made a mistake, we gave the people an opportunity of confirming their decision and they did it with emphasis.  They dotted the &ldquo;i's&rdquo; and crossed the &ldquo;t's&rdquo; of their decision. If there had been any lingering illusion in the minds of Deputies opposite as to what the people really meant when they put Cumann na nGaedheal out of office and put Fianna Fáil into office, that illusion must have been shattered 12 months ago when the people reaffirmed their decision.  Their decision was that this Party, with its policy, should be given control of the Government of this country and empowered to carry out its policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proceeding to do it.  In order to secure effective implementation of this policy it is necessary to secure in many matters of social and economic concern the co-operation of the public.  Not merely was this Government elected by the people, but it is a people's Government, recognising that its authority comes from the people and that its power to do anything effective depends on the extent to which it can get public co-operation in its task.  The main function of this institution is to assist us in getting <Col N="1662" /> that public co-operation.  It is not necessary to enumerate here for the purpose of making Party propaganda various matters of Government policy in respect of which public co-operation is necessary.  They are well known to Deputies.  In so far as they take any interest in matters coming before the House, they must know that a large part of the Government's programme depends for its fulfilment on the extent to which the people are prepared to assist it and bring it into effect.  If we are going to get that public co-operation in the degree in which it is required we must have the public informed as to the manner in which their co-operation can most effectively be given.  That is the purpose of the Bureau.  We have had a difficult task in giving effect to our policy, and the main difficulty was the deliberate campaign of misrepresentation which Deputies opposite embarked upon. Not merely did they try to wreck the Government policy on every item, but they tried to secure that those who wished to co-operate in giving effect to that policy would be misinformed about it.  On every occasion that the opportunity offered to them to prevent good being done as a result of Government policy they tried to prevent it being done for Party purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Party opposite, so far as I can see, does not disagree with this Government in anything except one thing.  The one thing with which they disagree is that they think they are better men than we are; but they are not.  They are wrong in that as in everything else.  That affects themselves. But, on the main lines of policy, whatever they may have said last month or last year or two years ago or last night, they appear now to be standing with us.  It is a good thing that this evolution of ideas should have taken place amongst the members of the Party opposite.  If this Press bureau does nothing else except make it generally known, not merely in this country but outside it, that Deputies opposite have hauled down all their flags and decided to endorse the policy of Fianna Fáil, the national policy on all matters, then it will be well worth whatever expense is involved in its <Col N="1663" /> establishment.  Is it not a good thing that the British should know that the Leader of the Party opposite stated only two nights ago that no matter what Government is in power the land annuities will never again be paid to England?  Does not that serve a useful national purpose so that the people in Great Britain who are hoping to manoeuvre the people opposite back into power in order to get that cash from the Irish people will realise that their last hope has been destroyed, that the last line of defence on which they were relying has been turned?</P>
    <P>I remember hearing a few years ago the Minister for Agriculture in the Cumann na nGaedheal Government discussing the possibility of growing wheat in Ireland and saying that you might as well talk about growing bananas. Is it not a good thing that the Party Convention which Deputies attended last week decided that the wheat policy must be given its chance?  Deputy MacDermot, of course, can excuse himself by saying that he does not stand over everything the Cumann na nGaedheal Government did.  He does not know what they did.  He will not find out from those with whom he is associating now, apparently, because they are very anxious to forget what the Cumann na nGaedheal Government did.  They certainly will not talk about it.  They have even been criticising this Government because its industrial policy is not vigorous enough.</P>
    <P>A short while ago the Control of Manufactures Act was not merely opposed but obstructed by them.  A few weeks ago they were criticising the Act because it did not go far enough. Is it not a good thing that we should have information as to the matters upon which we are all agreed given to the public?  Surely that is not serving a Party purpose.  The issue of the land annuities, the necessity for the development of a home supply of wheat, the necessity for industrial development, and other matters which were a short while ago matters of controversy, are now matters of agreed policy.  In so far as this Bureau sets out to secure public co-operation in effecting that policy and putting it into operation, <Col N="1664" /> then there is no Party purpose being served but the common purpose of all of us.</P>
    <P>I agree that Deputies opposite do not like being tied down to a policy. Perhaps they fear publicity as to their attitude at the moment on any given issue might tie them to that attitude and they do not like being tied.  We heard Deputy O'Higgins talking about men who change their Party.  If he had put back his right hand he would have hit Deputy Belton and if he had put back his left hand he would have hit Deputy MacDermot.  If he looked behind him he would see men who have in their time been associated with every political Party in this State and with attempts to form others that never came into existence.</P>

      <P>Let us consider the question of the inadvisability of having a Press bureau because it might be used for Party purposes.  The suggestion has been made here that any attempt on the part of the Government to influence the Press must necessarily be bad.  Deputy Norton referred to the fact that there was a Press bureau here before&mdash;an expensive one.  It disappeared it is true as such seven or eight years ago, but another institution was substituted for it.  Deputy Fitzgerald can tell Deputy MacDermot, if he does not know it already about the conferences that took place every Monday morning in Government Buildings when Mr. Ernest Blythe, the then Minister for Finance, met representatives of all newspapers except one and gave them their orders for the week.  Every Monday morning that conference took place and the representatives of the Press sitting around Mr. Blythe got from him their instructions as to the line they were to take on every issue <Col N="1665" /> of public importance likely to attract attention during the week.</P>

      <P>It was excluded from the conferences to emphasise the fact that the statements made were not mere impartial surveys of Government policy to be made public, but conferences of men associated for one Party purpose.  Deputy MacDermot is very innocent I know, but he is not so innocent as to believe that the others who sit with him on the benches opposite are as innocent as he is.  That arrangement worked very well.  All the newspapers of this country, with the one exception, were able to talk with one voice every Tuesday morning stating, not the truth but the representation of the truth which the Government at the time wanted to have believed.  That was very often misrepresentation.  It was as a result of that arrangement, that very close co-operation between the Government and the newspapers, that many ideas became accepted in this country which would never have been listened to by any intelligent person if all the facts could have been made available.  Not merely were those conferences held, but the Government's power to provide revenue for newspapers in the form of public advertisements was used entirely to subsidise those newspapers that supported the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  Can Deputy MacDermot explain to me why it was decided by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government that no public advertisements of any kind were to be inserted in any newspaper, whether a daily or weekly newspaper, critical of Government policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have not adopted that policy. The Deputy can read Government advertisements in his <i>Irish Times</i> just as we can read them in the <i>Irish Press.</i>  We have deliberately decided not to use that power, because we think it wrong that that power should be <Col N="1666" /> used in that manner.  But our predecessors had no scruples about it, and when the power of subsidising by advertisement did not prove sufficiently effective they devised the system of subsidising one particular newspaper on the ground that it used to print in an obscure column a paragraph printed in the Irish language.  Year after year they brought in an estimate for that particular subsidy on the ground that it was intended to encourage Irish when it was really designed to buy the political support of a particular newspaper that circulated in a constituency where an unpopular Minister was trying to hold his seat.</P>
    <P>It is true that we are spending a lot upon education.  This State provides a very large part of its revenue every year for educational purposes. This addition to the Educational Vote is a small one.  Nevertheless, it is an important, item, and if it succeeds in getting into the minds of Deputies opposite and those other people who are influenced by Deputies opposite that there is another side to the story than that which they are continually presenting, a side which is not associated with any particular Party, but a side none the less worth knowing, then it will be well worth while.  The particular side that we want Deputies to understand is that the various matters of Government policy that are likely to be the subject of publicity are designed to improve conditions in this country, to improve the status of the State, and the material well being of its people.</P>
    <P>It is, I think, rather pitiable to see Deputies opposite rising from their benches here day after day to gloat over every little item that they can extract from some public document which seems to show that conditions in this country are not all that they, might be.  If some factory closes down to-morrow, if any number of people are unemployed, if a particular section of our community are hit in some economic manner, Deputies opposite stand in their benches to cheer.  They are cheering every week-end at public meetings knowing that that tends to show that the fight for the improvement of the economic organisation of this State is <Col N="1667" /> not yet over.  It is pitiable.  Some of them at one time used to think themselves good Irishmen, used to talk about the effort that could be made to promote industrial development, to secure a recasting of our economic organisation so that we would become a more self-contained, a more self-sufficient nation.  Now that the effort is being made they, for merely Party reasons, find themselves opposed to it, and not merely that, but gloating over every little defeat that may be suffered in the campaign and pretending to ignore the much greater victories.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of this bureau is to secure that information will be given to the public and to Deputies opposite that will make them realise that the campaign that is being conducted in this country is not being conducted for the benefit of one Party or one section of the people, but for all the people, and that it is good national work, work in which they should be co-operating. In this matter we are hoping to get co-operation of the masses of the people, and I think we can be certain of that.  We can get that co-operation if information is available as to the manner in which it is required.  If the educational campaign is pushed sufficiently far, I believe we may eventually get the co-operation of some of the Deputies opposite.  In many respects they have publicly adopted our policy and subscribed to our programme. They have subscribed to it in broad outline if not in detail.</P>

      <P>We have laid out a corrupt Government&mdash;that is true.  I do not want to delay the House much longer.  I am surprised and pained at the manner in which the debate on this Vote has developed.  I think Deputies opposite should appreciate the necessity of having an organisation that would link up the people with the Government so that those in power would be given public assistance in the fulfilment of their policy that they might not otherwise be able to secure. The last Government tried to govern when it was completely out of touch with the people, and I think they have admitted it publicly that they were out of touch with the people.  This Government is determined, so long as it remains in office, to keep in touch with those who have put them into a position of authority so that it may have the co-operation and help of the people in carrying out the policy that the people endorsed twice within a period of twelve months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>As I listened to the speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce there came into my mind an epigram of a very well-known Frenchman.  &ldquo;Hypocrisy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is the tribute which vice pays to virtue.&rdquo;  I wish I could call the Minister for Industry and Commerce and his followers in the Fianna Fáil Benches hypocrites, because that would be a kindly word to apply to them in comparison to any word which can be applied to them after the extraordinary speech which we have just heard from the Minister.  There is no shame about it now, there is no secrecy about it now, there is no hiding of it now.  We have got definitely from the Minister the putting forward of this doctrine which we guessed was being practised before, but, no matter how much it was practised, we never <Col N="1669" /> thought it would be preached in this House, that the Fianna Fáil Government and Party consider they are entitled to use public money solely for Party purposes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the Minister has just put before the House&mdash;that we are entitled to use public money for purely Party purposes.  What is the reason he gave?  The reason he gave for this open avowal of corruption on the part of his Government, this undisguised avowal of corruption, is this, that they got a majority at the last election and, therefore, they are entitled to spend such public money as they wish in promulgating their ideas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the Minister for Industry and Commerce they are entitled to subsidise out of public funds any single purpose which they think is helpful to them.  Not merely that but we have this astonishing doctrine preached in this House that any Government that at any time ever has a majority in this House is entitled to use public money for the entrenching of its own position.  I have heard of graft in various countries in the world.  I have heard of political corruption in various countries in the world.  There are scandals in certain countries at the present moment arising out of political corruption.  But I wonder if the doctrine of political corruption has ever been preached so openly in any assembly in the world as it has been preached by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in that extraordinary speech which he delivered to the House to-night.  Now we know where we are.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce said they got a mandate from the people to carry out their policy.  Did they say to the people of the country, &ldquo;Yes, put us in office and we will use as much of your money as we wish to use for our purely Party purposes?&rdquo;  Was that part of the policy they put to the electorate when they got a mandate? <Col N="1670" /> As a matter of fact, I deny and I deny strenuously that the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the rest of the Front Bench of Fianna Fáil ever got a mandate for the policy they are carrying out.  He said they got a majority from the people twice.  What is the use of making statements in this House, statements which everybody knows to be untrue in fact? Take the election of February, 1932. What majority did they get then? They were in a minority if the Party that was not elected as tied to them did not form a coalition with them; they had no majority.  And the policy which the Labour Party put before the electorate at that election was not identical by any means with the policy which President de Valera and his Party put before the electorate.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I deny and everybody in this country who has studied Irish affairs to even the most slender extent must be aware of the fact that in that first election in February, 1932, President de Valera got no majority at all from the Irish people.  It was only because he managed after the election to induce the Labour Party to do what they had never said during the election they would do&mdash;to join up with them&mdash;it was because of that and because of that only that they got into power.  Take again the last election.  Even at the present moment they have not a majority of the elected members of the House as their professed followers.  There is actual equality at the present moment of those who are his professed followers and those who are not.  The Labour Party have not stated up to the present day that they completely endorse this policy.  The Labour Party have voted against him and they have criticised his policy, indeed very heartily criticised his industrial policy and his policy of whole-hog protection.</P>
    <P>It was only because of other reasons they proceeded to keep him in power. That is the reason why he is there now.  But never at any time has President de Valera received a mandate from the elected majority promising to support him in this House.  At one time, if the Labour Party had not twisted from the policy upon which <Col N="1671" /> they were elected he would not have been in power at all.  At the next election it was only by the sufferance of the Labour Party that he had anything more than a bare equality as far as the elected members of the House were concerned.  I know his Party propaganda and I know what it is.  I see the <i>Irish Press</i> which makes the statement that he was elected by the overwhelming majority of the Irish people. I do not mind that.  I do not take seriously anything of the political propaganda which is put forward in the official organ of the Party opposite. But it has surprised me that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has got the affrontery to come into this House and to make a statement which every single person knows to be at variance with the facts.</P>
    <P>But the Minister did not by any means stop there.  He said that we had changed our policy.  We have not changed our policy.  Our policy stands where it was.  He instanced that we have said that the wheat policy should be given its chance.  We have, but that is not a change of policy on our part&mdash; absolutely no.  We say now as we have always said that the wheat policy is a thoroughly unsound policy but we are thoroughly consistent in this one overriding, over-ruling principle which every Government ought to honour and which we certainly will honour.  That is that if persons have expended sums of money on the assurance given by one Government than its successors in office should not vary that promise to the detriment of persons who have invested money on the faith of that promise.  Persons have invested money on the faith of the promises made to them on this wheat policy and we say that since a Government gave that promise we as successors of that Government&mdash;and I trust I may safely promise very shortly that we will be&mdash; are bound to see that these persons who invested money on the promise of our predecessors are not deceived. That is an attitude from which we have never departed.  It is a perfectly fair attitude and it is an attitude from which I do not think any Government should depart.  If citizens invest money <Col N="1672" /> on a definite promise from one Government it would be very unfair, I think, to them that that promise should be departed from.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact I think the wheat policy is radically unsound and that it is bound to kill itself and kill itself very shortly.  The Minister said that he and his Party on coming in were pledged to a policy.  To what were they pledged?  I know that there is one thing to which they were pledged. That was that if they got into power the economic war would be ended in a fortnight.  That was the one promise that was given in every constituency in the State.  We know that there were pledges that there would be complete derating.  We know that there were definite clear pledges that there would be factories in every town and village specifically named by the Fianna Fáil orators at the cross-roads.  Those are the type of pledges and that is the type of policy which were put forward by the Fianna Fáil Party at the last election. That was the type of policy and that was the nature of the promises which induced a large section of the electorate to vote for the Fianna Fáil Party.  I say it is not our Party that has changed, but very much their Party that has changed.  They have changed since they came into office; they have changed very, very much indeed from what they used to be.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce talks about a change of policy on our part.  I wonder if in the history of the world you could get a more vital change of policy, a more complete <i>volte face,</i> than has been made by President de Valera and the whole of his Executive Council; I am not talking of his Parliamentary Secretaries.  Indeed, President de Valera is not satisfied with one <i>volte face.</i>  It is rather a little bit like a teetotum; he goes spinning round and round.  There was a time when President de Valera and his friends were actively up in arms against this particular State, the State of which he is now the head.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I respectfully point out that the Minister for <Col N="1674" /> Industry and Commerce based his argument in favour of that on those lines: that the policy of the Government has been approved of by the people, and that being so, the Government was eminently justified in spending public money in propaganding their policy, or whatever version of it may be on at the moment.

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The argument put forward was that their policy had been approved of by the people, and that therefore they had the right, as in this instance, to spend public money on the promotion of that policy, and in deceiving the people regarding it.  I suggest that, if that is the basis of it, then it does seem to me one has the right to consider the policy that was put forward by the Government and the policy which the Government is actually pursuing; to consider whether the theory of the Minister for Industry and Commerce should work out; and whether we as a Dáil would be justified in voting public money to promulgate some of the items of policy which the present Government is responsible for.</P>

      <P>I say that no such advertisements were given by the Government to our weekly Party paper.  I say that and I say that deliberately.  We had the regular Party organ, not an industry at all but a mere Party propaganda sheet, run by the then Opposition and run by the present Government, for the purpose of not giving the truth but to give its own version of the truth to use the Minister's strange phrase&mdash;to give its own version of the truth, whatever that may mean, to the Irish people. There was all the difference between subsidising a paper which, goodness knows, has been subsidised by strange and devious enough methods, and giving advertisements to a paper which is an ordinary industry run on the ordinary commercial lines upon which newspapers ought to be run.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, however, goes a little bit further and talks about the victories that he has achieved although he admits that, in some respects, conditions are not all that they might be.  There is not a person living in this country but knows that conditions are not all that they might be if there was anything like a competent Government in office. Conditions are so bad in this country that it is extraordinary how any Government, in the short space of two years, have managed to bring about a condition of affairs so deplorable and that is known by every person in this State.  It is known by everybody who is interested in agriculture, the main source of this country's wealth, and it is known by the increased numbers of unemployed who are walking the streets of our towns.</P>

      <P>And where are the factories?  We want to know where the factories are&mdash;these subjective factories, the factories that exist in the imagination of the Minister for Industry and Commerce which we, the ordinary men in the street, cannot find.  Now we know the Party purposes for which this large sum of public money is going to be spent.  It is to be spent on promulgating purely Party doctrines.  It is to be spent on making statements like the extraordinary statements of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, arising from his defects of memory, made in this House to-night.  Never before in the history of any country as I have said, has corruption stood up so openly, so brazenly and pronounced itself so openly, as has been done by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in his speech to-night.  Never before, I believe, in any assembly has the doctrine been openly, boldly and unashamedly preached that the Government in power is entitled to use public moneys for purely Party purposes.  It is not this measure really that is so much at issue; it is not the importance of the money that is really so much at issue but every single person in this House who gives a vote in favour of this Estimate will be voting in favour of the principle put forward by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He will be voting for the principle that the Government is entitled to buy support for itself out of public moneys and that is certainly a degradation to which, I think, few members of the Fianna Fáil Party will gladly lend themselves. They will go and vote&mdash;of that I have not the slightest doubt.  They will vote for corruption preached so openly as it has been preached but I think few of them will vote for that corruption willingly.</P>

      <P>In different circumstances, a publicity bureau for national purposes would do a good national service but we have in this country one publicity bureau known as 2RN, a wireless publicity bureau.  We want a counterpart to that in this Press bureau, which, I suppose, will <Col N="1679" /> be 2DV.  When the secretary of a national organisation in this country dared to offend the jazzing principles of a Minister, a talk he was to give from 2RN was promptly cancelled. Now, this Press Bureau is to be set up to do a national service and is it not very reasonable to expect that the authority that stopped Mr. O'Kelly from delivering his address from 2RN will stop and muzzle any public man in this country from having the services of that bureau?  Is it not a proof that if a bureau like this is set up, it will be used for purely Party purposes?  It might be no harm if they would when they use it for Party purposes, make it clearly understood, not only in this country but outside it, that it is being used for purely Party purposes so as not to disgrace the whole Irish race as being represented by what the Fianna Fáil Party are pleased to call a national policy.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce thinks that by thumping the table and saying, &ldquo;We did this and we did that,&rdquo; he must carry conviction.  How long are we doing anything that would entitle the Party opposite to dare to stand up in this national assembly and say that any member of this assembly, not on their benches, deviated from any political principles he held in years gone by.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce taunted us here with supporting, to quote him, &ldquo;our wheat policy, our beet policy and our industrial policy.&rdquo;  Deputy Norton went down and dug up a musty record to prove that Cumann na nGaedheal spent public money on some publicity bureau from 1923 to 1925.</P>

      <P>To-day I asked the Minister for Justice this question: If he will state (a) if he is aware that in giving evidence as a witness before the Military Tribunal on September 29th, 1933, Gárda John Martin (described as of the Special branch of the Gárda) swore that he had brought back a gun from America; that he had retained that gun in the Saorstát for at least the six months previous to August, 1933, and that he had that gun in his possession on September 29th, 1933; (b) if for any part of or for all this period, starting six months prior to August and continuing up to 29th September last, John Martin had not a permit under the Firearms Act; (c) if John Martin is still a member of the Special or any other branch of the Gárda or is otherwise employed in Government service, and (d) if any disciplinary action was taken against John Martin for having a firearm without a permit (if such was the case).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The answer I got was: &ldquo;The replies to parts (a) and (c) are in the affirmative, and to part (d) in the negative. Martin had no permit.  The gun was defective and was held as a souvenir.&rdquo; Putting all that together it comes to this: that the Minister does agree that in giving evidence before the Military Tribunal this member of the Special branch, John Martin, swore that he brought back this gun from America and had retained it; that he had no permit; that he is still a member of the Special branch of the Guards or some part of it, and that no disciplinary action has been taken against him.  I asked, by way of supplementary question, if the Minister would think of parading that man before the Military Tribunal and putting that forward as his excuse: the excuse that the gun was defective and held as a souvenir, and see what would happen.  The <Col N="1681" /> Minister made some retort about other people who had guns.  Then I asked the Minister, by way of a further supplementary, what I regard as the most important part of the whole question: Was it possible that Gárda John Martin, who had admitted having a gun without a permit, and who may have other guns without permits, would be sent to raid people's houses one of these days and might attempt to do what several of his colleagues have in proccedings been implicated in doing, namely, in planting arms on innocent people.  To that I got no reply.  I want to quote this evidence in extenso.  This is a case in which Deputy Belton figured and in which the Attorney-General figured.</P>

      <P>Guard Martin was produced as a witness in this great case.  He said he had joined the Force in August.  Previously he had been unemployed for six months and before that he was for four years in the United States.  He gave evidence as to an occurrence on the 20th September and was then cross-examined.  He said he took little interest in politics; he would say that he was in favour of <Col N="1682" /> Fianna Fáil; he was a member of no organisation; he had the gun in his pocket on the 20th September; he had a gun in the United States; he had no training in the use of guns.  The question was put to him &ldquo;you know what it was for?&rdquo;  He answered: &ldquo;I do.&rdquo; He was then asked &ldquo;you never fired a shot out of it?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No.&rdquo; The witness stated, in reply to a further question, that he had recently received training in the mechanism of guns.  He had brought back the gun with him from the United States and he still had it.  To a later question he said he was supplied with the gun in the Guards. He was then asked: &ldquo;So you have two guns?&rdquo; and his answer was &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; According to Martin he had two guns and he never fired a shot.  He then went on to say that he had some idea of the evidence that other people had given.  That gentleman is still in the Force.  It is admitted that he never had a permit; that he has no permit, and that he is a member of the squad that is kept occupied in raiding people's houses, a member of the squad in connection with whom a charge of sedition, if you please, was brought against another person for having said that if there was a particular gun found on him it had been planted by this particular squad.  The man who said that was not found guilty of sedition for having made that statement.  There were other cases in the Country Cavan where men were charged with being in possession of revolvers.  The defence put up for them was that the guns had been planted on them by members of the Force and the jury believed that story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these circumstances we are expected to take as a satisfactory answer the reply of the Minister; that a member of that Force was found to be in possession of a revolver without a permit, but that his statement is that the gun was defective and was kept merely as a souvenir.  There is not even disciplinary action taken against the man, and he is retained in the Force. I asked by way of supplementary question about parading him before the Military Tribunal.  I take now a Press report of the 21st December of <Col N="1683" /> last year.  A certain man was prosecuted for having a pistol and a quantity of revolver and miscellaneous ammunition on a particular date.  He said he had it.  He was asked: &ldquo;Why did you keep it without having a permit?&rdquo; His answer was he did not think it was necessary, that he had it as a souvenir.  I think the Minister must have been reading that case. Counsel for the Crown in the case said that it was much more serious for a man to whom a sense of responsibility could be imputed to keep unlicensed arms than for an ignorant man to do so.  I presume that Martin would, in the case that counsel referred to, be looked on as a man with a sense of responsibility and not an ignorant man. Therefore, according to the evidence given against one man in a case before the Military Tribunal, counsel would have said if this man Martin had been paraded before it: &ldquo;You are, supposedly, a man with a sense of responsibility and it is much more serious for you to carry arms without a licence than for an ignorant man to do so.&rdquo;  In one case, at any rate, the plea about the souvenirs did not work.</P>
    <P>A second man was also charged that day with having a .22 revolver, brown and rusty with age, and described by prosecuting counsel as archaic.  It was produced in support of the charge.  A plea of guilty was entered as to possession, but there was denial as to ownership.  The gun was handed to the court.  The President examined it and said that it certainly would never kill anyone.  &ldquo;It is absolutely harmless,&rdquo; he said.  With that indication of the mind of the court before him, prosecuting counsel had to say: &ldquo;I never saw it before, but it is somewhat antiquated-looking.&rdquo;  This counsel, I should remark, is a very strong Republican and ought to know something about arms.  Finally, the gun was pronounced harmless by the President, and counsel said that he must admit it was obsolete.  He added this remark, presumably on the instructions of the Attorney-General: &ldquo;It must not be left to persons like the prisoner to decide whether a gun was harmless or not.  In <Col N="1684" /> some cases old guns might be made serviceable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was a third case that day.  In this case, we get the junction of defective arm and souvenir, as pleaded in the case of Guard Martin, and evidence given that he was a man of high character.  He had fought, apparently, in all the wars that this country had in recent years.  The firearms and ammunition found had been in his possession since 1922.  The revolver, a .32, had been bought for five shillings.  The ammunition was not really revolver ammunition, but pistol ammunition.  The accused never had any intention of using the gun. Giving evidence for himself, he said he had had the revolver when in the army.  When he was demobilised, he remained in the country for five or six months and then went to America.  He returned to Ireland 14 or 15 months prior to the trial.  He left the ammunition at home and was careless about the matter.  He had no intention of using the revolver, which was defective. He finally said that the gun had been kept as a souvenir.  That was exactly Guard Martin's case.  Yet that man was paraded before the Military Tribunal.  A gun expert was called in about this weapon.  We do not know whether such an expert was called in with regard to Guard Martin's gun. The expert said that the trigger of the revolver was defective but the revolver was capable of firing a bullet by working the trigger with the thumb from the top.  The further statement was made&mdash;it is not clear by whom&mdash;that the weapon was a .32 revolver, that it was completely useless and that, if fired at all, it would be dangerous to the user.  These are three cases which it was thought fit to bring before the Military Tribunal.  In one case, there was a gun, rusty and obsolete.  Another man described his gun as a souvenir and was criticised by opposing counsel, who said it was not his business to say whether a gun was a souvenir or was obsolete.  In the third case, we get a junction of the two things in Guard Martin's case&mdash;a gun which was usless and kept as a souvenir.  These people were brought before the Military Tribunal and were <Col N="1685" /> ordered to enter into recognisances or else serve a term of imprisonment. Guard Martin is better off.  He joins the &ldquo;harriers&rdquo; and is not even disciplined. There is not a black mark against him in respect of this matter. He is not the type of character one wants to see in a police force, sent round raiding people's houses and searching for arms and ammunition, and certainly not with the reputation of some of his colleagues in that particular group, who have been held up to public comment in two recent cases where the charge was definitely made against them that they had planted arms.  In one case, the jury found clearly that they had and, in the other, the implication was that the story was true.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not a case of that sort.  That is the case I present to the House with regard to Guard Martin.  Two ex-members of the National Army are hailed before the <Col N="1686" /> Tribunal for being in possession of obsolete and rusty guns, declared by the President of the Court to be absolutely useless.  They are put under detention and arrest.  They are kept in barracks or in prison for some time.  Then they are hailed before the Tribunal and they must bind themselves to keep the peace.  There is, certainly, a finding of guilty against them and an imputation of wrong.  It is wrung out of Guard Martin in cross-examination in an ugly case that he had a gun.  When the matter is further pressed in the House it is said: &ldquo;It is true he had a gun and that he had no permit for it any part of the time.&rdquo;  Yet, the Minister thinks that he is a fit and proper person to send round to raid houses, that he is a fit and proper person for any police purpose.  He will not even take disciplinary action against him.  I think that that is a scandal. I think that if this man's colleagues in that particular branch had any thought for themselves they would make it clear that they repudiate that man and his activities as they ought to repudiate another man and his activities in that particular branch.</P>
      <P>This House ought to have been given more information as to who found this revolver to be defective, what examination was made of the story that it was a souvenir, what attempt was made to ascertain where the gun was first obtained, where it was held, whether there are any other arms in this man's possession, and how the gun was brought back into the country against the watchfulness which is supposed to exist as regards the bringing in of arms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, we should remember that, in the case of which I have spoken, where the glorious charge of sedition was made, the man concerned stated that ammunition found in a place belonging to him had not been put there by him, that it must have been put there by some member of the force that raided the premises, that in that case the ammunition was American, and were it not that the particular individual had discovered, and disclosed to the other people raiding, that a second gun was in possession of one of the raiders, it <Col N="1687" /> is quite likely that there would have been found not merely American ammunition, but an American gun to suit it.  Then there would have been a cast-iron case against the man who was found not guilty by the Tribunal on the sedition charge.  This is a case of grave suspicion and I shall ventilate that case and as many more as I get particulars of on every occasion until I get proper answers from the Minister and until he takes up a proper attitude with regard to them.</P>

      <P>I think that we were rather unfortunate in the ruling you, a Chinn Comhairle, gave to-day in regard to another question.  If it had been otherwise, we should not have had so much time wasted at this hour of the night.  Deputy McGilligan, in the number of questions that appeared on the Order Paper to-day, seemed determined to show an industry which the answers to these questions show is very misplaced.  He started in to-day by asking me a question about some man in Boyle.  That was very widely reported in the newspapers and I informed him that there was no remission of the sentence.  That was the first question.  Then he went on with another question and asked me about certain incidents that happened in Ennistymon.  It was the first time I heard about them or that the police heard about them.  Where Deputy McGilligan heard about them we should be glad to know.  The next question he asked me about concerned an attack on a hall in Ballygar.  Well, in that case a stone was fired at the house.  That was the attack.  Then there was a question about Tralee. That was reported in all the newspapers at the time.  All this goes to show the rather light way in which some people think of putting down questions to the House.</P>
      <P>We come now to this particular question.  I shall deal first with Deputy MacDermot's point.  When men are being taken into the Guards the same procedure is adopted now as has always been adopted.  Inquiries are made as to the characters of the applicants, from their parish priests and so on.  They have to submit to an examination and to a medical test. That is the usual procedure and it is the same procedure that was adopted previously.</P>

      <P>Why did you not say that before?  With reference to this particular question, let us deal with one aspect of it first&mdash;that is, in regard to the question of souvenirs, or rather from the point of view of people surrendering arms.  The attitude adopted by the previous Government, and, I understand, on instructions in 1923, was that where any person surrendered a firearm no prosecution took place.  I have reports here from the B. and D. districts, and during all that time from 1923 to the present day where persons, when questioned as to whether or not they had arms, admitted that they had those arms and surrendered them, not a single prosecution was brought.  I start with that position.  This man had this gun.  He had it openly.  There was no secret <Col N="1690" /> about it.  When he was questioned in court he admitted it, and there was no question raised about it, and when asked for the gun, he surrendered it. That was the position in the past.  If the Guards became aware that a certain man had a gun, whether defective or otherwise, he was asked about it, and if he surrendered it there was no prosecution.  That is correct and cannot be denied by anybody on the other side.  In this case, the gun was surrendered on the 30th, a day after he was asked by the authorities had he a gun.  He said he had a gun, that it was defective, had not been used and could not be used by anybody.  I have the report here which bears that out. The gun had a burst barrel and the hammer could not be used.  I do not want to go into the cases of everybody in the country&mdash;some of them Deputies of this House and some of them Senators of the other House&mdash;who have been asked to give up their guns and have not given them up when the firearms certificates were withdrawn. In this case, however, the police satisfied themselves that this old gun was defective and not capable of firing a shot or discharging a missile. In conclusion, I want to ask Deputy McGilligan to look up the Firearms Act and he will see there that no prosecution lies unless the weapon is a lethal weapon capable of discharging a shot.</P>
