      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state whether the plans and estimates for the provision of a waterworks scheme for Stradbally (£3,600) and sewerage schemes for Portlaoighise (£11,000), Mountmellick (£10,300) and Mountrath (£10,000) have been sanctioned by his Department; whether the area of charge has been fixed in each case; whether he can now state the amount of the free grant to be made available for each of the schemes mentioned and when such information will be communicated to the Laoighis County Board of Health.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first and second parts of the question is in the negative.  The schemes will be considered when the funds provided for the relief of unemployment are being allocated later in the present financial year.  No indication as to the amount of the grant that may be made available for any of the schemes can now be given.</P>

      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary say whether, in accordance with the promise he made on 8th June last year, he has submitted any recommendation <Col N="1554" /> to the Minister for Finance on the matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not aware of the amount of money that will be made available in the coming year for the operation of such schemes and we are not in a position to make any representations regarding any particular scheme.  As soon as we get an indication of the amount of money that will be made available under the Budget for public health schemes, the matter will be taken up with the Finance Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state (1) the estimated cost of the erection of a new fever hospital at Abbeyleix; (2) whether the full amount will be provided from Hospitals Trust Funds; (3) the date on which he sanctioned the contract; (4) what steps he has taken or proposes to take to compel the Board of Health concerned to give possession of the proposed site to the contractor in order to enable the latter to commence work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>(1)  Precise information as to the estimated cost is not yet available. Tenders have already been accepted for the erection of the buildings and the installation of lighting and heating systems at a total cost of £35,963 18s. 6d.  To this figure must be added architect's and quantity surveyor's fees, the remuneration of the clerk of works, and any expenditure on extra works which may be found necessary.</P>
      <P>2.  A contribution of two-thirds of the cost of the work will be made from the Hospitals Trust Fund, but in calculating the amount credit will be given for the capital expenditure already incurred by the local authority on improvements to the county institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>3.  The acceptance of the tender for the lighting installation was approved <Col N="1555" /> on the 22nd November, 1933; for the building work on the 15th December, 1933; and for the heating installation on the 8th March, 1934.</P>
    <P>4.  The demolition of the workhouse buildings involves the provision of alternative accommodation for the staff and patients in the premises. Every effort is being made to induce the local authority to proceed with the alternative arrangements suggested so that work may be commenced without delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it correct to say that proposals for the provision of alternative office accommodation for the board of health staff were submitted to your Department in the early part of last January and up to recently no reply had been sent to the board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The board were instructed on 26th ultimo to proceed with the provision of alternative accommodation. There is no information as to what action, if any, the board of health have taken on that matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state whether a contract for <Col N="1556" /> the erection of 13 houses at Ballinakill was given out by the Laoighis County Board of Health about June, 1933; whether work on this scheme has not yet commenced, and if so, what is the cause of the delay and what steps, if any, have been taken by the board of health concerned or by his Department to have work commenced within a reasonable time from the date upon which the contract was sanctioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  Work has not yet been commenced on the scheme as the contractor refused to sign the contract documents owing to a dispute with the board regarding certain previous contracts. I have approved of a proposal from the board of health to re-advertise the contract.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether an index of wage movements in industry, agriculture and commerce is compiled by the Department of Industry and Commerce, and, if so, whether he will state the movements of wages in each of the years from 1920 to 1933, inclusive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly (for Minister for Industry and Commerce)</NameTxt>
      <P>Only an index number of wage movements in certain occupations in agriculture is compiled for the Saorstát.  I will have inserted in the Official Report a table showing this index.</P>
      <P>The following table contains the only available index numbers of the average rates of cash wages per week of permanent male agricultural labourers who were stated not to have had free house or allowance of any kind.  There are two series of figures, one from 1920 to 1929, the other from 1925 to 1933. These series are not quite comparable either as regards period of time or type of labour to which the index number refers.</P>

He was reminding us that, in front of the legislative buildings of the State of Montana was a park in which there was one statue, a statue to General Thomas Francis Meagher, Meagher of the Sword, the first Governor of the State of Montana.

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister left the Vote on Primary Education, on the understanding that the whole of his policy would be discussed on his own Estimate, we were dealing with a question which I raised&mdash;an application from parents on the south side of the city for the setting up on the south side of a primary school that would conduct the whole of its business through the medium of Irish in the same way as Scoil Mhuire and Scoil Cholmcille on the north side of the city.  The Minister was indicating that he had got an application of that kind, but that there was a difficulty in the matter of setting it up.  He implied that the Department of Education could not stand the entire expense in providing that school, and that, in the second place, there was a school already existing on the south side of the city of the kind we were discussing.  I think the point is rather pivotal in the question of the policy of the restoration of the Irish language as the living language of the people. Some days ago, a deputation from the <Col N="1567" /> Irish speaking districts of County Galway came to see the President with regard to economic conditions in the West, and the Ministerial Press, dealing with the matter, indicated the way in which, in the opinion, I take it, of the Ministry, the Irish language was to be re-spread over the whole country.  It existed at the present moment in the Gaeltacht in full figure, as it were, and it was going to flow out from there, increasing the strength of the living language in the partly Irish speaking districts, and was going to flow from that over the rest of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that at this hour of the day, 12 years after the Irish people, through their own machinery of education, had taken steps to save the Irish language position as the living language position; anyone could pen those lines who had any practical experience of either the condition in the Irish-speaking districts or in the schools.  The Irish language living in the Irish-speaking districts is a thing without which we could not have again the language spoken by the rest of our people, but the Irish language in the Irish-speaking districts, the Minister, I think, will admit, is not a well of Irish that is bubbling with vigour at the present moment in the homes of the people nor is activity with regard to it so vigorous in the schools in the Irish-speaking districts that it gives any indication at present that in the Irish-speaking district, lies the vital force which will bring the language back into spoken use throughout the country in future. If the Minister has any misgivings on that matter, I would ask him to refer to the particulars printed in the records of the House for 31st May, 1932, when, following an enumeration of the position with regard to Irish-speaking homes in Irish-speaking districts and in partly Irish-speaking districts, certain very disturbing figures were published.  Figures are given there as to the number of homes in the Irish-speaking districts and in the partly Irish-speaking districts in each of the counties in which there is any Gaeltacht and in which as a first class, the homes are entirely Irish-speaking, <Col N="1568" /> that is, that the children as the natural language of their home speak Irish, and, as a second class, the number of homes in which Irish is the natural language of the grown persons, but where a situation exists in which English is the only language of the children, that is, that the older people are failing to hand on in the homes as the natural living language the Irish which they themselves have, and, as a third class, the number of homes in which English is the language of the home itself.</P>
    <P>Taking simply the totals in all those districts, the enumeration covered in the purely Irish-speaking districts 31,545 homes and in only 10,775 of these was Irish being handed on by the older people as the living home-language of the children.  In 14,305 of these homes, Irish was the natural language, the language naturally used by the old people in the homes, but English was the natural language of the children.  There were 6,000 odd homes in which English was the language entirely.  Turning to the partly Irish-speaking districts, the enumeration covered 50,956 homes.  In only 1,023 of these was the Irish language naturally spoken by the older people handed on as the home language of the people.  In 10,739 of these homes where Irish was the natural language of the people, it was not being handed on to the children, and there were 39,000 odd homes in partly Irish-speaking districts where English was the language of both the older and younger people.  It indicates, as I say, that the force that will spread the Irish language over this country again as a natural spoken language does not exist in the Gaeltacht. There does exist in the Gaeltacht that which we want spread over the rest of the country.  It is the spirit of the people in, say, places like the capital of the country&mdash;in Dublin, Cork, and other places&mdash;who are determined by their work and by their outlook to move such forces as may be necessary to bring back Irish as a spoken language that we must rely on.  It is there that the vital force exists that is going to do that work, if it can be done at all.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1569" /> The real centre of that vital force is those parents in places like, say, the City of Dublin or the City of Galway or the City of Cork, who, speaking Irish themselves or knowing something about the Irish language themselves and capable of speaking it to some extent, are determined to cooperate in the fullest possible way to secure that the children growing up in their homes will have Irish from the time they begin to speak.</P>
    <P>Here in the City of Dublin, as the Minister is aware, a number of parents did come together some years ago, and asked the Ministry of Education to help them in this movement, by setting up primary schools in Dublin that were Irish-speaking. That was done.  I have heard that as a result of difficulties met with at that particular time some years ago, when a school was set up for the purpose of encouraging parents who were bringing up their children with pre-school Irish, that the Department of Education, as a result of Departmental difficulties, no doubt, or rather as a result of a Departmental outlook and as a result of the outlook on the part of the inspectors and on the part of teachers, changed that school from being a school for children with pre-school Irish to a school that admitted children whether they had pre-school Irish or not.  That is past history, and the position in the north of Dublin to-day is that we have a primary school for boys and a primary school for girls, where the work is done entirely through Irish, and a preparatory school that will take children without pre-school Irish and prepare them for entry into the primary schools provided, it is found, after passing through the preparatory school that their knowledge of Irish is sufficient to enable them to follow the courses in the primary school without retarding the classes. When we come to the south side of the City of Dublin we find, as the Minister says, a school there.  I said in reply to the Minister, when he said that it was there, &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;; but there are so many in that school that the children are falling out through the windows, and I think that 700 children <Col N="1570" /> are on the waiting list of that school. The position then, from the point of view of the Irish language movement, with everybody prepared to help in every way possible to see that nothing is left undone to secure the spread of the living language in the homes, is that there are hundreds of parents in the City of Dublin at the present moment who are being deprived of facilities to send their children to primary schools where Irish will be entirely the language of instruction, because the Minister cannot spend a few thousand pounds to set up a school.</P>
    <P>I quite understand from the Minister's point of view and from the Departmental point of view, that there are serious difficulties in the matter of establishing precedents of that kind; but I submit that there is no difficulty in the world if the Minister examines it.  Dublin is the capital of this country.  It has an accumulation of about 400,000 people around it.  There is no other part of the country where the Minister has so much material at his disposal for experimentation, if he likes, and where there are so many people willing to have that experiment fully and properly carried out.  The Minister has had the experience already, in the schools on the north side of Dublin, that would warrant him, I submit, in making an additional expenditure of the same kind that was made there to secure that the other parts of the City of Dublin that are not reached by these schools will have the same facilities provided, because, while I had at times cause of complaint as to the Departmental approach to the running of these schools and the enrolling of pupils for them, nevertheless I think that results have been obtained there which the Minister would be very sorry not to have been able to see. There is, at this centre of vital force for the restoration of the Irish language, a large number of parents anxious to assist, and the Minister has been appealing for parents to assist in the matter.  Those who are anxious to assist are being deprived of any possibility of giving the Minister the assistance he requires.  They can be put in <Col N="1571" /> the position of giving him that assistance if the Minister will provide them in the south side of the city with the type of school that he has in the north of the city.  The pivotal nature of the work that can be done in the City of Dublin and the terrible importance of it, first, to the language movement as a whole, and then to the position of Irish in the Irish-speaking districts, are such as to leave no excuse to the Minister for not embarking on any expense to see that, at any rate, the people in the City of Dublin who want to Irishise their schools will not have the schools standing in their way.  It is an easy matter to raise an Irish-speaking family in Dublin.  It has been done already, and if it had not been done I would see very little hope of the successful development of some of the other work done in the schools. These pioneer parents, however, in the City of Dublin have shown the Minister that the thing he would wish to do can be done, and while I say that the real vital force that will save the language is not in the Irish speaking districts, the thing without which we cannot save it is in the Irish districts and is oozing away fast.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the increase in the number of secondary &ldquo;A&rdquo; schools in the country.  I wish that the Minister would assure us that there was real supervision over some of these schools.  There are &ldquo;A&rdquo; schools in the City of Dublin which, while they profess to teach and do teach their subjects through the medium of Irish, do not comply with what, I think, is the regulation and what certainly ought to be the regulation&mdash;that Irish should be the language of the recreation hours of the children as well as of the school hours.  It is perfectly absurd that special grants should be made to schools because they do their educational work through the medium of Irish and, in our present circumstances, do not also apply the regulation in the school that English shall not be used during the recreation hours.  The fact is that that is so in certain schools in Dublin.  That has taken the whole edge off the <Col N="1572" /> natural Irish-speaking children going there and anything which tends to do that should be removed out of secondary schools which are secondary schools &ldquo;A&rdquo; at the present time.  It is a very small matter of discipline and it should be a very small matter of hardship. If it is a hardship to ask children during recreation in secondary schools to talk Irish, when they are supposed to be getting their education entirely through the medium of Irish, then I think there is something wrong with that particular secondary school. It certainly puts a very unnecessary break on the teacher's work and I think can do nothing but create very serious difficulties for teachers if the children are allowed to talk English during recreation hours.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his opening statement on primary education dealt with the new scheme for giving money grants to parents in the Irish-speaking districts whose children apparently go to the schools with a pre-school knowledge of Irish.  I think the Dáil would like to hear some more details from him on that matter and would like to hear whether he is applying in the Irish-speaking districts any systematic supervision as to the linguistic capacity of the children when they first go to the primary schools.  I think that the matters I speak about are fundamental to the whole problem of dealing with the restoration of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister has made any reference to or discussed in the House in any way the position with regard to the inspectorate in the Irish-speaking districts.  If the Minister has not done anything to examine that position or unify the inspectorate in the purely Irish-speaking districts, then I think he is allowing valuable time to slip and he is neglecting to institute a controlling factor that would be of enormous actual value in keeping the language a living force in the Irish-speaking districts, because if the inspectorate has very great power over the teachers and over their minds I feel sure that one lack in the present position is that the inspectorate have not a definite objective in their minds as regards the position of Irish in the schools and the position of Irish in the <Col N="1573" /> homes.  I think the inspectorate in the Irish-speaking districts should have that.  I think they should have that as a kind of mass mind and that it would impress itself effectively on the teachers and have valuable results on the work done in the schools.  I feel also that it would extend further than the schools and that it would link up very effectively the schools with the homes in the general work of preserving the Irish language in the Irish-speaking districts and giving it some of the vigour which I suggest it lacks at present&mdash;the vigour to wish to live and to wish to spread.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When I spoke on those Estimates last year I said to the Minister that I thought we had reached a stage when it was highly desirable that some sort of inquiry should be set up to review the work of the last ten years in the schools of this country in its bearing on the task of reviving the Irish language.  I called in question the prudence of teachers trying to teach infant children and other children through the medium of Irish when they have not a competent knowledge of the language themselves. If my memory serves me well, the Minister ended up by getting rather indignant about it, and said that he was not going to be bothered answering foolish contentions of that kind. Twelve months have elapsed since then and the Minister has changed his mind. He says in the statement which he made in introducing the Education Estimate this year that he hopes &ldquo;when in the future the teaching profession contains a considerable proportion of these native speakers the position of Irish in the schools will be more satisfactory than it is to-day.  As to the progress made at present in Irish, I cannot say that it is satisfactory in the primary schools.&rdquo;  That is precisely the line of argument I followed 12 months ago.  It is precisely the line of argument that brought the Minister to his feet in indignation to protest against the reckless charges that were being bandied about without sufficient inquiry being made.  After 12 months' cogitation he is coming round to the <Col N="1574" /> view that there was something in the case I made.</P>
      <P>I want to make the same case now. There is no use couching your lance and attacking all the national teachers in the country; there is no use attacking the University because Irish has not made the progress it ought to make.  The proper thing to do is to sit down and try and find out why Irish has not made the progress it ought to make.  The only way the Minister can get that information is to seek the assistance of the people who are in constant and daily contact with the problem in the schools and in the homes.  He ought to set up a consultative committee, perhaps with a fixed term of existence, to make one report to him on the condition of Irish in the schools as they see it to-day, and to make such recommendations as they think would help in promoting the Irish language amongst the school-going generation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit to the Minister that he is beating the wind so far as the revival of the Irish language is concerned if he hopes to revive it in the schools through the medium of teachers who are not themselves native speakers. The native speakers through the part of the country from which I come, and indeed over most of the Gaeltacht, have a word to describe the bulk of the Irish that is taught in the national schools to-day.  They describe it as &ldquo;book-Irish&rdquo; and then they laugh heartily and address the unfortunate child, who has come home with his book-Irish, in English.  Now, book-Irish is the Irish that children learn from teachers who are not themselves native speakers.  There will be exceptions; there are exceptions, as we all know.  Some people have a peculiar linguistic gift.  Some people who never knew any Irish until they were practically grown-up have the strange gift that they can go down and acquire it and become nearly as fluent and nearly as correct in accent and inflection as a native speaker.  But the vast majority of the people who are not born native speakers bear the mark of that upon them all their lives. They never have the same facility in teaching the language to the children <Col N="1575" /> committed to their care; they are never able to teach the language to the children committed to their care in the same way as can the native speaker.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Mulcahy has just said, a number of men recently interviewed the President on behalf of the Gaeltacht.  They brought under his attention the economic stress under which they are living, and the very peculiar difficulties that apply in their area.  I have pointed out to the Minister for Education, more than once, that he is in a position to make a very material contribution to the relief of that economic problem in the Gaeltacht, and at the same time to make the most valuable contribution that can be made to the revival of the Irish language in this country.  What is the problem in the Gaeltacht?  The problem in the Gaeltacht is that practically every farmer in it is living on an uneconomic holding.  Most of the people in the Gaeltacht look forward to being accommodated with land outside the Gaeltacht.  The <i>Irish Press</i>&mdash;the Government paper&mdash;came out with an article which many of us understood to mean that the inhabitants of the Gaeltacht were to be forever penned up in that area.  The leader of the deputation which waited on the President answered them pretty sharply.  One means of relieving their difficulties would be to migrate them all from the Gaeltacht into another area in the country, and to give them economic holdings of land.  Whether that be eventually decided upon or not, an enormously important help can be provided in the meantime by making it possible for the children of the people in the Gaeltacht to earn a decent livelihood in this country; to earn a salary sufficient to enable them to send home a few pounds every year, just as in the past the emigrants used to send home a few pounds from America or Australia or wherever else they had gone.  The teaching profession is a profession which would furnish a very large number of the young people coming up from the Gaeltacht with just such a salary.  What I have urged on the Minister again and again, if he <Col N="1576" /> really means business&mdash;and I sometimes doubt if he does&mdash;is that he should go down to the Gaeltacht and make a determined effort to get every available boy and girl there for the teaching profession.</P>
    <P>I must say it was with considerable consternation, in that connection, that I found the Minister apologising in his preliminary statement for the percentage of places which he reserved for native speakers in the preparatory colleges, and explaining that after all only about 19 per cent. of the places in the training colleges are, in fact, reserved for candidates in the whole of the Gaeltacht area, or not quite one-fifth. Is that something to boast of? It is quite true that a very high standard in oral Irish is required for candidates, and that a very considerable proportion of places is reserved for candidates who get this very high percentage&mdash;85 per cent.&mdash;in oral Irish. In my view, no matter what percentage they get in oral Irish a native speaker of the language, who was born with the language, is infinitely more valuable as a teacher of the language than any person who has acquired Irish as a foreign tongue.  In my view also the young people of the Gaeltacht are entitled to a preference in regard to this matter.  For generations their people have existed under conditions of the most appalling material privation, and the survival of the language in this country is due to the people of the Gaeltacht.  They are entitled to a preference now when it is within the power of the Government to give a preference, and it is good business to give them a preference.</P>
    <P>I outlined last year a practical scheme for giving effect to that preference. I suggested to the Minister that any child from a national school in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht who was a native speaker and who was prepared to submit himself to a test for capacity to be trained as a national teacher, ought to be taken on.  Of those, a comparatively small percentage would prove to be suitable material for training as teachers.  For the unsuitable ones some alternative occupational training could be provided.  There is ample scope for training them as domestic <Col N="1577" /> economy teachers, woodwork teachers, technical instructors under the local technical instruction committees, and for a variety of other occupations, as some kind of compensation for having volunteered to submit to a test for fitness to become primary teachers. After you have got those native Irish-speaking teachers, to my mind what is far more important than setting up all-Irish schools in North Dublin or South Dublin is to see that in the Breac-Ghaeltacht every teacher is a native Irish speaker; to see that at the earliest possible moment the children in the Breac-Ghaeltacht will be made familiar with the Irish language.  You will then have a situation in the Breac-Ghaeltacht where you have the children familiar with the language&mdash;and when I say the language I do not mean book Irish; I mean Irish; you will have their grandparents, to whom the language comes more naturally than does English, and between the children and their grandparents you will have the parents, who know Irish but have given up using it.  If you once get the children talking to their grandparents over the heads of their parents you will very quickly get the parents talking Irish too.  In that way you will have converted a considerable part of the Breac-Ghaeltacht into the Fíor-Ghaeltacht, and out of that you can spread the language.  If you once get the tide flowing in the opposite direction from that in which it is flowing now, the fight is won, and it becomes only a matter of time until you have spread it all across the country.</P>
    <P>It does not matter what you do in regard to the development of the teaching of Irish in the City of Dublin, or the City of Cork, or the City of Waterford, if the Gaeltacht is shrinking as it is shrinking.  If the Fíor-Ghaeltacht is turning progressively into the Breac-Ghaeltacht, and the Breac-Ghaeltacht into the Galltacht, the doom of the Irish language is sealed.  Let no one imagine that by the setting up of Irish-speaking schools or trying to promote the teaching of Irish in the national schools in the Galltacht they are going to preserve the Irish language as a living language in this country; they are not, if at the <Col N="1578" /> same time the Gaeltacht is perishing. The Gaeltacht is perishing, and if things go on as at present it will continue to perish.  When we cease to have a Gaeltacht in this country it is only a matter of time until the Irish language becomes a dead one.  It is going to take a mighty big push at this stage to prevent that happening.  I say now that I see very little realisation of the magnitude of the problem by the present Minister for Education. If half the enthusiasm for the prosecution of the economic war were put into the revival of the Irish language it would do.  If half the enthusiasm for proving that we are traitors and are playing England's game were put into the task of reviving the Irish language it would do.  If there were half as many people prepared to shout half as loudly, &ldquo;Up, Irish,&rdquo; as they are prepared to shout &ldquo;Up, de Valera,&rdquo; we would do.  And that is going to be the test.  There are a lot of people romping around this country prepared to bawl &ldquo;Up, de Valera&rdquo; and &ldquo;Up, the Republic,&rdquo; but when you ask them are they prepared to do some really hard work they fade out of the picture; they wrap the green flag around them and vanish into the green wood.</P>

An important preliminary is to get some kind of a committee together, people who are in daily contact with the facts and who will report to the Minister for Education what their views are.  The teachers want that; the Minister wants it; everybody wants it.  I am quite prepared to abide by whatever decision they come to, if they make a full investigation and if they are of a personnel calculated to inspire confidence and reassure everybody of their independence and determination to tell the Minister the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister went on to say that as regards the teaching of subjects <Col N="1579" /> generally, apart from the question of Irish, the results were, on the whole, satisfactory, except in rural science and mathematics, in which he could not find much progress visible.  Does the Minister consider caligraphy a suitable subject for national schools?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear it, because I must say from what I have seen coming out of the national schools in the way of caligraphy, it is anything but satisfactory.  There are exceptions, showing that there are teachers who are well able to teach children how to write.  Provided that matter is present to the Minister's mind, I have very little doubt that the defect which, I believe, exists, can be remedied; but I am surprised to hear from the Minister that he is satisfied with the standard of writing at present being turned out by the primary schools.  It is of enormous importance to young people going out to earn their living or, indeed, about to engage in any mode of life.  It strikes me that in both the primary and secondary schools insufficient attention is paid to it and the result is that many children leave the schools practically illiterate from the point of view of being able to write a legible or a firm hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see the Minister congratulates himself on his scheme for giving a small yearly gratuity to each household in the Gaeltacht for each child able to speak Irish fluently and naturally as a result of the use of Irish in home life. Gratuities may serve some purpose, but I do not like them.  I would far sooner that the Minister would promise that any child who can speak Irish fluently and naturally as the result of use of Irish in home life, would be provided with a good job.  If he does that, he will make every child in the Gaeltacht not only anxious to learn the language, but proud to show his neighbours he <Col N="1580" /> is able to use it.  If he can do that, he will have got right down to the defect which besets the difficulty of reviving the language of this country. The Minister also spoke of his determination to increase the supply of primary teachers from the training colleges for women.  I hope when he does undertake the increase of that supply he will bear in mind the desirability of having a native-speaking personnel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me draw his attention to this anachronism.  The present situation is that a certain number of places are reserved for speakers who come from the Fíor-Ghaeltacht. There is a further reservation for persons getting 85 per cent. in oral Irish.  Let us say a girl lives in a house which is in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht and she is qualified for special consideration.  Another girl lives a hundred yards from her across the boundary of the townland and she is in every way the equal&mdash;perhaps the superior&mdash;of the Fíor-Ghaeltacht resident. Not if you burn down Marlborough Street could you get that girl any of the concessions that her nextdoor neighbour secures owing to her Fíor-Ghaeltacht residence.  I have every sympathy with the persons bound up by the letter of the statute or the letter of the regulation.  It is <Col N="1581" /> impossible for persons whose sole concern is to administer the law as it is laid down, to break the law; but it is not impossible for the Minister.  I remember one case.  I think the name was Brighid Gallagher.  I do not think anyone denied that she was in every way qualified for all the advantages and benefits that accrued to a resident in the Gaeltacht.  I do not think anyone denied that, in fact, she was a resident of the Gaeltacht; but it had to be admitted for the purpose of the relevant Act of Parliament that she was living in a townland that was described as in the Breac-Ghaeltacht and she was not allowed to become a teacher on the advantageous terms available to a resident in the Gaeltacht.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt the Minister means that, so far as the additional supply of women primary teachers is concerned, he is going to do his best to secure that they will be native Irish-speakers. May I commend to his favourable consideration forthwith the case of Miss Brighid Gallagher?  We find that within the terms of the statute she is not entitled to the benefits available to residents of the Gaeltacht. You will find, however, that according to reason and commonsense she ought to be.  Will the Minister take steps to see that she and all others like her are captured for the teaching profession?</P>
      <P>I did not quite catch Deputy Mrs. Concannon's interruption.  The next time the Deputy is speaking I will not make a scurrilous interruption <i>sotto voce.</i>  If I want to interrupt I will interrupt loudly so that everyone can hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the urgency of providing new schools in the Dublin area, and I think he said that the urgency of this problem made it somewhat difficult for him to do as much as he would like to do in rural areas.  I should like to remind him that, while everyone recognises that it is very necessary to provide school accommodation here in the city, where you have bad school accommodation you have a double inconvenience in rural areas where the children go a long journey to school.  Children may in rural areas have to go <Col N="1582" /> one, two or three miles to school.  It is a great hardship on them at the end of a three-mile journey to arrive in a bad school.  I submit to the Minister that that aspect of the situation ought to be constantly present to his mind when allocating funds for the erection or improvement of schools.  I asked him last year in that connection if he had considered the desirability of central schools with buses drawing children from rather a larger area than they usually come from, and he said he would be very glad to make the experiment if he could find a manager who would be prepared to co-operate with some hope of success.  I should be very interested to hear what progress, if any, he has made in that direction.</P>
    <P>I forbear making any protracted references to the recent Congress of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation. I can very well imagine it to be an exceedingly painful subject for the Minister and his colleagues.  I regret to point out, but I cannot help doing so, that the Northern Ireland Minister for Education attended that Congress and was made welcome, but that when our Minister's letter of apology for non-attendance was read at that Congress, Deputy's Rice's colleagues dissolved into uproarious laughter.  That was appalling enough, but when somebody mentioned Deputy Breathnach, the President of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, and recalled that the organisation had provided £200 for his election expenses, just as Deputy Mrs. Concannon to-day interrupted <i>sotto voce</i>, a lady was heard to say, &ldquo;Did we get good value for it?&rdquo; and there was a thunderous roar of &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  What inference will Deputy Rice draw from that?  Will he draw the inference that we have the best Minister for Education, a Minister who is going ahead and doing the best he can for education, that we have a Minister who is doing all that he can with the means at his disposal to promote education; that we have a Minister who has the confidence of the profession and that he is doing all that is necessary for the promotion of the interests of education in this country? If the Deputy does draw this inference, I may assure him as a member of the <Col N="1583" /> public that these are not the inferences that are drawn by those who read the reports of the Congress in the public Press.  I would be glad to know if on this Estimate we can discuss reformatories and industrial schools?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Then it may be well that I should raise one or two questions, and it would be well that we should hear what the Minister has to say on these matters.  A lot of people in this country do not even know, and they never bother to inquire, what system obtains in the administration of law in this country with reference to juvenile offenders.  I must say that, being interested in that question, I have come to the conclusion that certain factors in it amount to little less than a public scandal.  Juveniles, for the purpose of which I speak, are persons under 16 years of age.  From time to time, children of that age come in conflict with the law.  The procedure then is that they are brought before the Children's Court on Friday mornings in the City of Dublin, and before the District Courts in rural areas.  So far as children of the poor in Dublin are concerned the procedure adopted is that when they are brought before the court they can be discharged, remanded on bail or in custody, or they can be consigned to an industrial school or reformatory according to their age and the nature of their misdemeanour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1584" /> There is a certain difficulty in discussing this problem because the Department of Justice and the Department of Education interlock in a most peculiar way.  In certain stages of the proceedings the children are under the control of the Department of Justice and at later stages and even at intermediate stages, they are under the control of the Department of Education. I may, therefore, be excused if I am slightly irrelevant in detail. Children are brought before the District Justice in the presence of a probation officer and in the presence of the Gárda who is prosecuting.  The District Justice, seated on a bench in the Children's Court, hears the charge. I submit that that procedure is entirely wrong.  The atmosphere of a police court is not suitable for the correction of juveniles.  It is important to remember that it is not an ordinary police court; it is a special court for children and, normally, the general public are not admitted.  Only the parents and the parents of other children who may be brought up are admitted.  Nevertheless, to a small child it presents the atmosphere of a police court.</P>
    <P>I submit that in that connection the procedure is wrong and that where the child requires to be corrected by law the proper procedure is that the child should be brought before the District Justice sitting in his own room and there, in the presence of the child's parents, the lady probation officer and the prosecuting Gárda, adequate inquiries can be made and whatever punishment or rebuke may be necessary can be safely administered.  It might, in order to preserve the principle of publicity for any form of criminal proceedings, be necessary to admit the Press.  But, to my mind, it is highly desirable to avoid giving it any appearance of a public court, particularly of a police court when you are dealing with small children.  It is highly undesirable too that the Gárdaí should appear in their uniforms when prosecuting children.  I have frequently seen the Gárdaí at work and I know the Gárdaí do all they can to avoid frightening the children or intimidating them.  Still, it is undesirable that at a very early stage in a <Col N="1585" /> child's life, it should come to look upon the Civic Guard as a kind of enemy and of course, it will associate its unpleasant experience in court with the uniform of the Gárda Síochána if they wear a uniform when conducting these proceedings.</P>
    <P>Now, the case having been stated, the child can be discharged.  Nothing arises under that head but sometimes a District Justice feels it is necessary to make inquiries into the child's home surroundings and into the causes for the child doing wrong and he remands the child to a place of detention in Summerhill, in the City of Dublin. The moment he does that the child passes out of the jurisdiction of the Department of Justice to the jurisdiction of the Department of Education, and we are told that he is moved to an educational establishment, there to abide a week, while investigations are being made and in order that a report may be made on his general demeanour and character by the custodian of this place of detention. What is the place of detention? I do not suppose that 5 per cent. of the citizens of this State know of the existence of the place, where it is, who controls it or what it is for, and it is very necessary that they should.  What is this place?  It is an old Georgian House in Summerhill, and those of us who were born and reared in Georgian houses know how gloomy and forbidding they are.  My information&mdash;and I have no official information of the procedure conducted therein&mdash;is that it is kept perfectly clean and that the children, from the point of view of cleanliness and justice and food, are adequately looked after, but the premises are entirely inadequate and there is no open space for the children to go to except a small stone square back-yard. The place is under the control of the Department of Education because it is represented that the children sent there are to have the beneficent influence of education.  I do not think the Minister will contradict me when I say that for the past ten years, a schoolbook has never been seen inside the doors of that establishment.  They may have risen in their more prosperous days to a stick of chalk, but I doubt it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1586" /> This establishment, as I say, is used for the purpose of detaining children on remand.  I am deliberately using the language of moderation.  I recognise that this is not a problem which is specially the responsibility of one Party or another.  It is a problem rather for a non-political group to examine into and to reform, but I want to say that I could not conceive any more unsuitable or deplorable accommodation for the problem for which this place of detention is intended than the place that is there at the present time.  While, as I say, it is neither dirty nor ill run, it is deplorable and it is something that ought to be remedied without any delay whatever.  The children are there under conditions which are altogether unsuitable for this stage of development in the administration of juvenile criminal law. The average population of it is about seven children and they range from very tender years.  I have known children to be there as young as three-and-a-half or four years of age.  Under such circumstances, they would usually be accompanied by an older brother and they would be there on their way to an industrial school, but when you realise that you have children ranging from four years to 14 years of age penned up together in an old Georgian house, situated between two tenement houses in Summerhill, I think that, without painting the picture too luridly, the House will realise that the accommodation, to say the very least of it, is inadequate and unsuitable and ought to be remedied.</P>
    <P>That place is usually used for a week's detention, but it is sometimes used&mdash;rarely, but still sometimes&mdash;for longer periods of detention, and I do not think it should ever be so used for longer periods of detention.  When a child comes back after spending a week on remand there, he comes before the District Justice again, and the District Justice then must make up his mind to do one of three things.  He can commit the child to the care of a suitable person, which, in my opinion, is the ideal solution; he can send the child to an industrial school if he is under 14 years of age, or if the child is over 16 years of age, he may send it to a reformatory, of which there is only one <Col N="1587" /> in this country, at Phillipstown.  If the child is over 16, he must send it to a reformatory, if he desires to confine it at all, because he cannot send children under 16 to an industrial school.  The Minister will correct me if I am wrong. I think those are the correct ages&mdash;a child over 16 years cannot be committed to an industrial school; he must go to a reformatory, if a District Justice decides that he must be confined in a place of detention, and similarly, if a child is under 14, he cannot be sent to a reformatory, but must go to an industrial school.  I want to submit that that system is entirely wrong.  The industrial schools in this country are largely peopled by youngsters who, by misfortune, are orphans and destitute and have never come into contact with criminal activities at all.  Remember that there are certain children&mdash;those under 14 years of age&mdash;who must go to an industrial school, and unfortunately one does find, rarely but occasionally, precocious children of just under 14 years who do get involved in very deplorable circumstances which bring them into conflict with the law.  There ought to be some special school or place of detention where children so circumstanced could be sent for special treatment, and for segregation from the children of poor but respectable parents who never came into contact with crime at all.</P>
    <P>Take the boy of over 16 who may be guilty of some very trivial offence, and who merely wants a period of discipline, who merely wants, perhaps, to be taken away from a bad home surrounding, but for whom a couple of years in a good, stiff school would mean redemption.  He has got to go down to a reformatory, although he was never a case for a reformatory.  He is not a potential criminal at all, but merely a wild youngster who wants discipline and a stern hand over him for a couple of years.  Then, you have all the cases in between him and the precocious bad boy of 14, who is no more than a child and who, if taken in time, even though he is a potential criminal at 13 or 14 years of age, can easily be reformed, <Col N="1588" /> and for whom association with older boys of superior character could be very useful under prudent and proper surveillance.  What I ask the Minister to do is to provide in addition to a reformatory and the present industrial schools, a school of his own founding&mdash; such a school as is described in Great Britain as a Home Office school.  I ask him to put it under the charge of an Order of Priests whose special mission is the reform of recalcitrant youth.  I ask him to leave it in the discretion of the District Justice to pick out the children who shall go to the industrial school, and for them I would intend the kind of children under 14 years of age who are continually playing on the streets and becoming entirely unmanageable in their own homes, whose parents come to court and say&mdash;&ldquo;I cannot control that child any longer; I have done my best, and I cannot control him.  I abandon control of that child.&rdquo;  Short of that, I do not think the child should ever be taken out of the family circle, but where the parent says that it is beyond his or her capacity to control the child, I say let that child go to the industrial school.</P>
    <P>Where you have a youth of 17 years of age and the Guards come in and say:&mdash;&ldquo;This is a precocious boy of 17; he is in fact on the verge of becoming a vicious criminal,&rdquo; let that boy go to the reformatory.  For immediate cases which are more to be pitied than condemned, and who have become wild through lack of family influence and such things&mdash;the cases of older boys who cannot be prevented from doing silly things again and again to their own danger as well as to that of the public weal&mdash;let the District Justice have the option of sparing them from contact with potential criminals and, at the other end, with the precocious child, of abstaining from putting them into contact with the population of the industrial schools throughout the country, and let him group them together in what I shall describe, for convenience, as a Home Office school under the direction of the Minister and under the immediate control of an Order of priests who will be well fitted for the work.  Having set up that school, I <Col N="1589" /> want him to set fire to Summerhill and provide an annex to that Home Office school which will be under the direction of this same Order of priests. There should be a competent matron in it also.  I feel sure that if Deputy Mrs. Concannon would go down to the Children's Court some Friday and see little children being taken from their mothers she would join with me in saying that the presence of a competent matron to impart some kind of material atmosphere in a place of detention to which these children would be removed, is essential.  Such a matron would want to be a very highly trained person, and I do not think that expense should stand in the way of securing the services of such a person.  If such a person were appointed, children, whether subsequently proved to be guilty or not, could be removed on remand for a week without anyone feeling that substantial injustice had been done. It would provide an atmosphere as closely approximating to the family atmosphere as it would be possible for the State to make it, and there the children could be watched over and cared for prudently, while enquiries were being made as to their family control, character, and so on.</P>
    <P>I have only very briefly outlined a general scheme.  My reason for bringing it forward is to impress on the House the necessity of a full investigation of this whole question. I trust the Minister will give me the credit of having deliberately abstained from using violent or inflammatory language.  I might have painted the picture much more eloquently and much more dramatically, but I fully recognise that it is a problem which has been recently very adequately dealt with in Great Britain and only very recently dealt with there, and that it is a problem which requires the same detached consideration in this country.  The burden of my appeal to the Minister is to set up a small commission of persons interested in these problems with the object of submitting a scheme to him, and then to seek the co-operation of all Parties to bring pressure to bear on his colleague, the Minister for <Col N="1590" /> Finance, to provide the necessary money.  I would be doing less than justice to my cause, however, if I did not say that there is in our midst a really grave scandal.  I think that everyone concerned with these questions is agreed that there is a problem urgently requiring reform. An exactly similar problem existed in England up to about 18 months ago, when they passed the Children Act of 1932 or 1933, perusal of which I commend to anyone who is interested in these matters.  A very interesting commentary upon it was recently published, the perusal of which I recommend to anyone interested in these matters.  We have no reason to chide ourselves on having fallen far behind the measure of reform existing in regard to this matter in other countries.  We have not, but we may. Reform was long overdue in England. It had taken place to a very large extent in America as a result of special circumstances that existed in the City of Denver and the State of Colorado where the movement for reform started.  We are two or three years behindhand in the removing of this urgent evil in this country.  I appeal with confidence to the Minister to put his hand to the work now with the intention of making an end of this problem in this country once and for all before the end of 1934.  I think I can assure him that any co-operation he may require to that end will be gladly forthcoming from every part of the House.</P>

      <P>Níor mhaith liom an ócáid seo a scaoileadh tharm gan cúpla focal a rádh i nGaedhilg i dtaobh na ceiste atá ós comhar na Dála fé láthair.  Sa chainnt a rinne an Teachta O Diolúin bhí sé ag tabhairt comhairle a leasa do na Teachtaí ar na binnsí seo.  Is breaghan rud an deagh-chomhairle gan aon amhras ach is fearr i bhfad an deagh-shompla. Tuigim gur Gaedhilgeóir an Teachta O Diolúin.  Do b'fhearr míle uair a dheimhneochadh sé dúinn annso agus do phobal na tíre chó dáiríribh is atá sé i dtaobh aithbheochainnt na Gaedhilge dá labharfadh sé roinnt Gaedhilge sa Dáil anois agus arís.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1591" /> Molaim an t-Aire go mór toise gur i nGaedhilg a chuir sé a thurasgabháil ós ár gcomhair.  Deir an t-Aire ná fuil sé sásta leis an dul ar aghaidh atá dá dhéanamh ins na bunscoltaibh maidir le haithbheochaint na Gaedhilge.  Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil aoinne go bhfuil suim á cur aige i scéal na Gaedhilge sásta go bhfuil dul ar aghaidh chó maith agus do b'fhéidir déanta go dtí so.  Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil na múinteóirí féin&mdash;an dream acu atá ag obair go dúthrachtach dílis ar son na teangan &mdash;sásta leis an méid atá dá dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Maidir liom féin, ní dóigh liom go n-eireochaidh leis an nGaedhilg fé mar ba mhaith linn go n-ísleochthar an Béarla, agus go mbainfear de chomhacht na teangan gallda san.  Caithfear cuimhneamh i gcomhnuidhe go bhfuil an dá theangain ag troid i n-aghaidh a chéile, go bhfuil an lámh uachtair ag an mBéarla go fóill agus go bhfuil an Ghaedhilg i mbaoghal a caillte.  Dá luaithe a leigfear d'aon mhúinteóirí in aon áit sa tír gur mhian leo é dhéanamh an Béarla a chur uatha ar fad is eadh is túisce a chífimíd an Ghaedhilg ag dul ar aghaidh mar ba cheart agus ag dul inuachtar.</P>
    <P>Maidir le scéal na Gaedhealtachta, is maith liom go mór an socrú atá déanta ag an Aire chun deontas speisialta a thabhairt d'aos óg na Gaedhealtachta go bhfuil an Ghaedhilg mar theangain teaghlaigh acu.  Im' thuairim féin déanfaidh an scéim san morán chun an Ghaedhilg a chosaint sa bhFíor-Ghaedhealtacht.  Is clos dom go bhfuil maitheas dá dhéanamh cheana féin ag an socrú so atá luaidhte agam imeasc túismightheóirí a bhí pat-fhuar go maith roimhe seo i dtaobh Gaedhilg a labhairt leis an aos óg.  Ba mhaith liom a fhághail amach ó'n Aire an bhfuil sé sásta le staid na Gaedhilge i gcursaí Gairm-Oideachais. Ní dóigh liom féin go bhfuil an scéal chó maith agus ba cheart é bheith.  Tá eagla orm go bhfuil a lán teagascóirí óga ná fuil Gaedhilg acu agus ná fuil aon iarracht á dhéanamh acu chun í fhoghluim.  Is cuma liom cé'n t-ádhbhar teagaisc atá ar siubhal ag teagascóir. Níl aon leath-scéal an t-am san de'n ló <Col N="1592" /> ag duine óg díobh a bheith gan Ghaedhilg agus tá súil agam go bhféachfaidh an t-Aire chuige go bhfoghluimeóchaidh siad í agus go gcuirfidh siad i bhfeidhm í.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom leis a fhághail amach ó'n Aire an féidir leis tuarasgabháil bhliantúil maidir le hobair Choisde na Leabhar a chur ar fághail.  Tá a lán daoine a chuireann ana-shuim i n-obair an &ldquo;Gúim&rdquo; agus i gcúrsaí litiridheachta na Gaedhilge agus nách eol dóibh cad tá ar siubhal ag Coisde na Leabhar agus gur deacair dóibh eolas cruinn d'fhághail n-a thaobh.  Ba mhór an rud é dá mbeadh tuairisc bhliantúil ó'n gCoisde sin le fághail againn.</P>
    <P>Is gnáthach ana-chuid cainnte a dhénamh gach bliain faoi'n nGaedhilg nuair a bhíonn an Meastachán so i gcóir Roinn an Oideachais ós comhair na Dála.  Moltar mórán rudaí mar mhaithe le haithbheochaint na teangan, ach is baoghal liom, gur beag atá dá dhéanamh sa Dáil againn chun aon deagh-shompla a thabhairt do'n phobal.  Is anamh ar fad a labhartar aon Ghaedhilg sa Tigh seo, cé go bhfuil roinnt mhaith Gaedhilgeóirí i measc na dTeachtaí.  Is deacair a chreideamhaint go mbeadh daoine dáiríribh i dtaobh an scéil nuair ná fuilid sásta an Ghaedhilg atá acu do labhairt annso anois agus arís.</P>
    <P>Mara bhfuilid baill an Oireachtais go bhfuil an Ghaedhilg acu sásta í labhairt i n-obair an Oireachtais agus sompla maith a thabhairt do'n phobal i gcoitchinn, is deacair bheith ag brath ar an bpobal suim ró-mhór a chur sa scéal agus glacadh leis an gcomhairle go léir a tugtar dóibh i mBéarla.  Ní beag san de'n turus so, a Chinn Comhairle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Before putting one or two questions to the Minister in connection with his statement, I should like to congratulate him on two things in it.  One is what he has done with regard to the development of physical culture in the schools which I agree with him is a subject that has been too much neglected in the past.  The other is the inquiry he has set on foot as to the desirability of raising the school-leaving age.  So far as the expense of that project is concerned, I cannot but feel that we should be using <Col N="1593" /> our money very much better in spending it on improving the education of our young people in that way than, say, in creating the new territorial Army, or in many other ways in which we are spending money at present.  Of course I realise the force of what the Minister says as to the technical difficulties of providing additional education, apart from the expense.  I do not know whether such material is available in the way of teachers in the country at present as would make us confident that, say, two extra years would be usefully employed by the young people if they were kept at school.</P>
      <P>As usual, a very large part of the Minister's statement, and the major part of the discussion on that statement, has turned on the Irish language. There is only one question that I should like to ask with regard to that and that is whether the continuation and technical education is given at all in the Irish language and, if so, with what result; whether it is found that that sort of education and education, say, in domestic science and domestic economy for girls is something that can be adequately given through the medium of the Irish language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we hear a great deal every year about the Irish language we hear little or nothing about other aspects of national culture which I personally consider are of even more importance. I am continually struck by the extraordinary ignorance of the mass of the people of this country of Irish history and also of Irish music.  I see that the Army band has been performing for certain schools in the Dublin area. I do not know whether their performances have been so arranged as to familiarise the children of these schools with Irish music in particular&mdash;I hope they have.  At any rate it is not possible to send the Army bands all round the country to perform at schools. I should like to hear whether the Minister does not think it feasible to do a great deal more than has been attempted in the past to familiarise the children of this country with the traditional Gaelic melodies.  Possibly the humble and useful gramophone could be made to take the place of the <Col N="1594" /> Army bands in the country districts. I really feel that an effort ought to be made as the present state of affairs is disgraceful.  I find that even in towns, on the occasion of political demonstrations, when people are parading about the streets and want to sing something, they do not know any Gaelic melodies to sing.  You hear them singing the &ldquo;Soldiers' Song&rdquo; without knowing the words, as a rule; and of course the &ldquo;Soldier's Song&rdquo; has nothing Gaelic about it.  Or you hear them even singing songs like &ldquo;Daisy Bell.&rdquo;  How that music-hall song of the nineties comes to be alive in Ireland I do not know.  You hear them singing &ldquo;Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer do,&rdquo; which has nothing to do with any political issue.  It is really a mysterious and disgraceful thing that the people of the country do not seem to know the good old Gaelic melodies or the words that go with them.  I wish an effort could be made to spread a knowledge of these things.</P>
    <P>The same way with Irish history. Whatever knowledge men may have in Ireland of what has occurred since 1916 they seem to know little or nothing of what occurred before that. It is not merely that they know nothing about the general philosophy of Irish history&mdash;that is bad enough&mdash; but they are not even familiar with the lives and opinions of the most picturesque figures of Irish history. They may know about a certain number of isolated incidents&mdash;battles and slaughters&mdash;but, speaking generally, I do not believe there is a country in Europe that has less knowledge of its own past history than Ireland has at present, in spite of the fact that, I think, all the instincts of the Irish race are such as would lead us to expect that we would be familiar with our past history; that we would cherish the memory of our great men and of all sorts of events which seem to be now forgotten.</P>
    <P>I cannot help thinking that too much stress has been laid on the language to the exclusion of other things that go to form Irish culture. My personal belief is that the language is the least important of several <Col N="1595" /> factors that go to the making up of Irish mentality.  It is not that good histories do not exist&mdash;they do.  If we are speaking merely of the period since the Norman invasion, we have in Lecky's book an almost ideal impartiality. I do not suppose a more impartial history has ever been written in any country than Lecky's. It is extraordinary how much Lecky's book contains.  Although it is called a history of the eighteenth century it goes back to the Norman invasion and gives a magnificently impartial picture of everything that took place in Ireland since.  We have another view of history in Douglas Hyde's book on the history of Irish literature. Although called a History of Literature, it is much more than that.  Like Lecky's, it is really an encyclopaedic book.  The more you read other things, the more you find that everything is in Lecky and Douglas Hyde between them.  I read the other day &ldquo;Hidden Ireland&rdquo; by Corkery which had been warmly recommended to me and I could not find a single thing in it that had not been already said better by Douglas Hyde in his book.  It seems to me that we are not familar as we should be with the masterpieces that do actually exist.  I should like if the Minister, when making the annual statement to us on the progress of education in this country, would always tell us as much as he can about the progress of education in Irish music, Irish literature and Irish history as well as in the Irish language.</P>

      <Col N="1596" /> Dhein an Teachta Ó Diolún a lán cainnte mar gheall ar an nGaeltacht agus aontuím le furmhór dá ndubhairt sé.  Níl aon amhras ná gur ceart cuid mhór de na múinteóirí fháil sa Ghaeltacht.  Do bhí a lán cainnte maidir leis an rial a tugadh isteach mar gheall ar na múinteóirí ó'n bhFíor-Ghaeltacht. Deirtir nach féidir duine fháil ach amháin ón Ghaeltacht nó ón bhFíor-Ghaeltacht&mdash;ach na daoine atá á rádh san, níl aon ciall le na gcainnt. Do dhein an Teachta MacDiarmuid tagairt do chursaí staire agus dubhairt sé gur cheap sé ná raibh aon tír sa domhan in a bhfuil níos lugha measa ar stair ná an tír seo.  B'féidir go bhfuil an ceart aige.  Do chuireadh na scoileanna náisiúnta ar bun chéad bliain ó shoin agus ní raibh stair a mhúineadh ach le fiche blian.  Ach mar a bhfuil an stair go maith ag muinntir na tíre seo, tá rud aca chó maith le stair, sin, seannchas, agus ní dóigh liom go bhfuil tír san Euróip a bhfuil an oiread measa agus eolais ar sheannchas is mar atá sa tír seo.

    <P>Aontuím le morán dá ndubhairt an Teachta Ó Briain agus ceapaim go bhfuil an ceart aige, mar gheall ar an troid sa tír seo idir an dá theangain agus' sé mo thuairim leis nach mbheidh an buadh ag an nGaedhilg go dtí go mbeidh deire leis an troid sin agus an Ghaedilg i n-uachtar.  Do chuir an Aire scéim scolaireachta ar bun le h-aghaidh na Galtachta agus maidir leis an scéim sin ní aontuím gur ceart Bearla a bheith riachtanach.  Ní féidir liom fheiceál&mdash;agus dubhairt é seo leis an Aire cheana agus deirim arís é&mdash; cionnus tá aon chiall leis sin.  Cur í gcás an leanbh a thagann fé'n scéim sin, ní mór dó Béarla labhairt; ach ní h-é sin an rud a dhein Sean Buidhe nuair a bhí sé ag iarraidh an Béarla do chur in uachtair sa tír seo.  Do chuireadh iachaill ar dhaoine Béarla labhairt agus ní raibh aon tagairt do Ghaoluinn.

Níl annsan ach iarracht ar Bhreac-Ghaeltacht do dhéanamh do'n bhFíor-Ghaeltacht&mdash;nídh <Col N="1597" /> atá in aghaidh polaisaí an Rialtais maidir le aithbheochainnt na teangan.  Ní cuirfear an meas ceart ar an nGaoluinn go dtí go mbeidh slighe ceapaithe a chuirfidh ar chumas Ghaedhil an post is aoirde sa tír seo do ghnothú agus gan aon eolas aige ar Shacs-Bheurla.  D'iarr an Teachta O Briain ar an Aire gan Béarla do dhéanamh riachtanach agus ba mhaith liom cuidú leis 'san iarracht san, go háirithe, 'sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Dubhairt an t-Aire annso nuair bhí an Meastacháin seo á chur os ár gcomhar aige ná raibh sé sásta le staid na Ghaedhilge 'sna mbun-scoileanna. Níl éinne sásta agus tá fáth ann maidir leis sin.  Im' thuairim, 'sé fath is mó ná an clár a bheith ró-throm.  Tá an iomad adhbhar leighinn ar an gclár. Do cheapad an clár sin 'sa bhlian míle naoi gcéad is fiche agus bhí sé i bhféim 'sa scoileanna ar feadh cúig bliana. Cuireadh Comhdháil ar bun sa bhliain 1926 chun fheabhas do chur ar an gclár agus cheap daoine go gcuirfí an feabhas sin air.  'Sé an rud a bhí ó na múinnteóiri ná an chár do laghdú ach ní deineadh é sin.  &lsquo;Sé an rud a deineadh ná an clár do thromú mar deineadh adbhar leighinn riachtanach d'eoluidheocht tuaithe.  Anois, ní féidir linn dul chun chinn ar an tslí sin, má tá uainn an Ghaedhilge do chur ar aghaidh. Tá an Bearla níos aoirde ins na scoileanna indiu ná bhí sé fiche blian ó shoin agus ní h-é sin a bhí uainn nuair do leagadh amach an scéim chun an Ghaedhilge do chur in uachtar.  Tá níos mó maitimeatica anois ná bhí fiche blian ó shoin.  Nuair bhí mé i mbun scoil ní raibh agam le deanamh ach na &ldquo;Trí R's.&rdquo;  Bhí mé ag cainnt tamaill ó shoin le beirt bainisteóir scoileanna idir-mheánach agus dubhradar go raibh siad ar aon aigne go mbfearr leo go mór an tsean-chlár ná an nua-clár&mdash; an tsean-chlár plus an Ghaedhilg&mdash;mar go bhheach cruinn-eolas ag na mac leighinn ar ghramaideach agus ar Bhearla agus ar áireamh.  Ní mar sin atá an scéal anois, dubhradar, mar níl cruinn-eolas ag aon mhac leighinn ar aon nidh de bharr a bhfuil le déanamh aige agus dá bhrigh sin, ba cheart an clár do chumhanngú.  Tá sé ro-leathan ar fad Tá sin á radh ag na múinnteóirí <Col N="1598" /> le blianta.  Ar chomhairle an Aire, do chuireadh coiste ar bun chun an cláir do scrúdú.  Bhí beirt cigire agus triúr múinnteóirí ar an gcoiste sin ach níor tháinic pioc as.  Mar dubhras, bhí na múinnteóirí ag lorg slí chun an chláir do laghdú ach ní raibh na cigirí sásta agus thuit an coiste ar lár.  Ba mhaith liom go mór dá gcuirfeadh an t-Aire in úil do'n Dáil, nuair a bheidh sé ag tabhairt freagra ar an ndiospóireacht seo má tá sé sásta leis an gclár?  An gceapann sé go bhfuil sé ró-throm mar ní fuláir go bhfuil an tuairim sin aige mar atá ag gach éinne.  Ba mhaith liom leis dá nabradh sé cad é an tsúil atá aige go mbeidh na múinnteóirí in ánn gach a bhfuil ar an gclár do mhúineadh agus do na mic-leighinn é d'fhoghluim? Ní féidir é a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Do dheineas tagairt anuraidh do chigireacht agus dubhart go raibh na múinnteóirí mí-shásta leis an gcigireacht agus ná raibh na cigirí féin sásta leis.  Do réir mo thuairimse, níl feabhas taghtha ar an sgéal. Tá an t-amhras ceana ann agus a bhí ann anuraidh idir an oifig agus na cigirí agus na hoidí, agus is mór an truagh é sin.  Níl a fhios agam cé tá cionntach leis sin.  Níl aon amhras ná gur dhein cuid de na cigirí obair ioghantach ins na scoileanna.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Breathnach has referred to a number of matters which have received some attention at the recent congress of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, and perhaps it is advisable that I should make brief reference to some of the points which he has raised.  I think that even the most vehement defender of the rights of the teachers or of the claims of the teachers must admit that the Minister, who is the person responsible for the very substantial expenditure of several millions <Col N="1600" /> of money, is bound to see that as far as possible the citizens, the country, and, above all, the children, get the advantages for which we are paying out that expenditure.  I think also that the Minister, since he is in touch with the administration, with both the teachers and inspectors, and also with the managers of schools, is in a position which few laymen occupy.  During his tenure of office he has unlimited opportunities, I might say, for getting information on any point which he thinks may be of interest or of importance from the educational point of view.  Therefore, if the Minister chooses to call public attention to certain aspects of educational policy, I think that it is extremely foolish and ill-advised for the teachers' organisation, or any other body, to find fault with the Minister on that account. May I say also that at no time, either now or heretofore, have the representatives of the teachers' organisation found the Minister or his officials in any way lacking in receiving representations from them, in meeting them, or in discussing with them problems of importance to them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>A good deal of the anxiety which appears to oppress the teachers, and to move them, arises from the old question of salaries. Any Minister who is responsible for the administration of education in this State must feel it his duty, must feel it to be to his interest, to the interests of the country, and of the different people concerned in education, that there should be security, and that there should be the best possible conditions for the teachers.  For a very long period&mdash;generations, I think&mdash;the teachers were agitating about their salaries.  During all that time there was a running sore&mdash;an old grievance &mdash;and it was undoubtedly difficult to make the progress which one would expect to make if the teachers were working under more settled conditions. In 1920 the teachers got a very good settlement from the British Government. The circumstances of the time, <Col N="1601" /> as I indicated when speaking on the superannuation scheme, were peculiar. The fact that the British Government at that time gave the teachers a particularly good bargain in regard to salaries does not at all mean that they would not have changed their minds. In fact, we have only to look at the conditions in Northern Ireland or Great Britain to realise the truth of my statement that there is nothing whatever to show that the British Government&mdash;this fairy god&mdash;mother, as the teachers seem to believe&mdash;would not have changed their minds.  Cuts have been made in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  When it is borne in mind that, of the 9 per cent. cut which we have made, at least 4 per cent., even from the most favourable view that the teachers could take, is necessary as a contribution towards pension and, therefore, there is a balance of 5 per cent., which, even if you add the 10 per cent of 1923, compares very favourably, indeed, I think, with the cuts in other countries, having regard to our general circumstances here.</P>
      <P>I should also like to say, although I dislike making comparisons of this kind, that the civil servants, for example, who are grouped very largely in the City of Dublin, have had, we must remember, to bear severe cuts in the form of reductions in the cost-of-living figures.  I think that since 1920 the cuts in respect of those on a scale of about £300 a year would amount to over 27 per cent. of their remuneration. In the case of those under £300 the cut was actually greater.  If the teachers, from the very beginning, since the new salaries agreement was brought in in 1920, were definitely put on the same basis as civil servants, they would, as I reminded them when speaking last on this matter, have had to bear certain disabilities in this connection; they would have had a reduction from time to time in the cost-of-living bonus attached to their salaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next questions is with regard to the programme.  For some time past a campaign, I think I might call it, has been made in the country that the primary school programme is overloaded. It is, undoubtedly, a fact that <Col N="1602" /> the primary school programme here compares unfavourably with the programme in other countries, by reason of the fact that we have a second language here.  It is to the credit of the teachers that they have made such progress as has been made, having regard to the fact that whereas there is only one language on the primary school programme in other countries we have two languages here.  The teachers themselves, I think, were largely instrumental in having the policy of teaching through Irish accepted here in the Free State.  As far as I remember, they were largely instrumental in recommending that policy to the Minister for Education under the old Dáil.  When the new programme was instituted in the schools the teachers were very adequately represented on the conference which examined the whole question, and they agreed to the recommendations.</P>
    <P>What have I to say with regard to this question of whether the school programme is overloaded or not?  All I have to say is that in spite of the complaints about Irish, about the school programme generally, and about the inspectorate, we find that&mdash;judging the situation by the rating which the teachers receive from the inspectors&mdash; the conditions are satisfactory.  They might almost be said to be extremely satisfactory.  29 per cent. or 30 per cent. of our teachers are rated as highly efficient, about 65 per cent. or 66 per cent. as efficient, and about 5 per cent. as non-efficient.  These figures, I think, go to show that the programme is not absolutely impossible. It equally goes to show that the inspectors are not extremely strict; that there is a fair standard, and that a fair standard is being achieved on all sides.  With regard to rural science, it must be remembered that we are an agricultural country.  While in other countries it can be argued that the trend has been to take rural science out of the primary school programme, and put it into the programme of the higher primary or continuation school, we do not like, having regard to our circumstances here, our love of the land and of the calling of the land, to <Col N="1603" /> take rural science off the programme unless we are satisfied that there is going to be a definite benefit elsewhere. In the second place, if we were to take rural science from the programme we should like to have something in the way of a substitute, which would bring the pupils into touch with the life about them, and give them a lively interest in the staple industry of the country.  That is the position with regard to rural science.  I left the matter entirely in the hands of the Committee composed of teachers and inspectors.  I think there was not the slightest doubt about the teachers' attitude from the beginning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreathnach" hpid="Cormac Breathnach Cormac Breathnach">
      <NameTxt>Cormac Breathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the inspectors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The inspectors, in spite of the encouragement they received from the Minister, could not see their way to recommend that rural science should be dropped in the elementary schools.  The encouragement they got from me was to do whatever they thought best, having regard to all the circumstances, and to the conditions under which the teachers were working. There is then the question of mathematics. Arithmetic, of course, is an exceedingly important subject in the primary schools, and there is always the question whether the teaching of arithmetic is as satisfactory as we should like.  I think, however, that competent critics and those who know intimately the position in our schools are satisfied that, on the whole, definite progress has been made in regard to the teaching of arithmetic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the present primary programme was being prepared, authoritative evidence was submitted regarding the question of mathematical teaching in this country and its importance was stressed.  It was felt that some groundwork should be laid in the primary schools in algebra and geometry, so that, apart from other benefits which such teaching would bring to the children, the path might be made easier for study later on.  I have always had in mind the fact that the effort to <Col N="1604" /> revive Irish as a spoken language undoubtedly rests very largely with our schools.  The responsibility rests upon the schools to do that work.  It is through their instrumentality that we hope to achieve success.  If I am satisfied that by lightening the school programme we can achieve more success in the way of advancing the use of the Irish language and improving the efficiency of the teaching in Irish.  I can assure the House that I certainly shall endeavour to lighten the programme. The point is that at the moment there are two different schools of thought. We feel that as regards the teaching of mathematics it would be a definite step backwards if we were to depart from the idea that the Education Department had, when they instituted this new programme, of doing some ground&mdash;work, some preliminary study no matter how bare or how elementary&mdash;some elementary principles&mdash;in geometry and algebra.  We feel it would be a definite step backwards if we were to eliminate these subjects from the primary school programme. This is a question that is constantly under examination and we are always anxious to get evidence bearing on it.</P>
    <P>With regard to inspection, I think the figures I have given showing the rating of the teachers throughout the country indicate that the inspectorial system is not too rigid and is not unfair.  It was stated that a young unattached inspector recently gave six months' notice of a general inspection to a teacher who had been for a considerable time rated as highly efficient. It has been the custom for such inspectors to give notice to the district inspector, and I think such action should have been taken in this case. No complaint was made to me personally with regard to this inspector or any other inspector, although there has been a mass of vague charges. But even if there is a single instance of that kind it must be remembered that inspectors are human and, as well as everybody else, they possibly have failings.  Just like some teachers, for example, it is possible that inspectors make mistakes from time to time.  But why should we attempt to indict the whole inspectorial staff because of an <Col N="1605" /> incident relating to a young unattached inspector?  It seems to me there must not have been any real gravamen in the charge if we have to depend on an isolated instance of that kind.  Here again the Education Office carried into effect certain recommendations as far as they understood them.  I have yet to see in what particular we have departed from them.  The Education Office definitely carried into effect recommendations of a committee on inspection in the primary schools where the teachers were represented and where they had a very large say in the making of the recommendations.  The recommendations of the teachers now seem to be that general inspections as such should be dispensed with for a five years' period, except for the awarding of diplomas or where a teacher or manager applies for an examination.</P>
    <P>Such a suggestion is at variance with the recommendations of the Committee on the Inspection of Primary Schools which sat in 1927.  I do not take responsibility for that particular committee; I disagree with some of its recommendations, but as far as I have been able to ascertain, the recommendations of that committee have been carried into effect.  The change might briefly be described as being the institution of a special inspection of the individual teacher rather than a general inspection of the school as a whole, which had been the practice up to then.  Sufficient time has not elapsed, I think, to say definitely that this new system of inspection of the individual teacher has been a failure.  It has been in operation only since 1928 or 1929.  It took some time to get under way. Even at the present time the inspectorial staff are not satisfied that the new scheme has got a fair chance or that we have yet sufficient opportunity, sufficient experience of its work, to enable us to make a definite judgment upon it.  The recommendations made at that time were that where teachers were men or women of well defined service and efficiency there was no need to have general inspections in their cases every year, or even perhaps over a number of <Col N="1606" /> years.  But in the case of other teachers it was recommended by this committee that there should be general inspections from time to time. If I mention the classes of teacher in respect of whom the committee thought inspections should be made, I think every reasonable man will agree that there is a very good case for continuing general inspections. Where a teacher is on probation, where a teacher's rating is definitely not &ldquo;efficient,&rdquo; where a teacher is young and has not got the five years recognised experience which enables him to be placed in charge of a school, or where a teacher's work appears to the inspector to have deteriorated&mdash;in these cases the committee recognised there was a strong need for an inspection.</P>
    <P>I would like to know now we are to justify departure from these recommendations at this stage.  There seems to have been an idea that the general spirit of inspection which the teachers may have thought would have been changed has remained and that there is still rather more of what they described as a defect in the system of inspection.  We have it stated that the committee were of opinion that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the defect in the then existing system of inspection appeared to be that too little importance was attached to the special aspect of inspection in comparsion with its aspect as a controlling agent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The question is, where are we to draw the line in regard to this matter? How is the Education Office to make up its mind as to whether good work is being done and whether the necessary standard is being maintained and whether we are getting value for the huge expenditure we are making on education unless we have some such machinery as the inspectorate gives us which enables us to be in constant touch with the work in the schools?  I wonder how long will the standard which we have at the present moment, whether we may be fully satisfied with it or not, continue if the inspectors were to be withdrawn for perhaps a five years' period?  Rightly or wrongly, educational administrators in this country in the past believed <Col N="1607" /> that inspection had a definite function in the system and that the value of accidental and unanticipated visits largely added to the value of the work of inspection.</P>
    <P>But even if we were to ask the inspectors to devote their whole attention to advising the teachers and helping them in their work, if we should ask them to give up their normal duties and to concentrate on this, I doubt if there would be any great improvement in the situation so far as the teachers are concerned.  Because, although we have 13,500 teachers we have only 60 inspectors, so that even at the present time each inspector has to look after 220 teachers and perhaps 120 schools.  If the inspectors were to devote half his energy or even his main energy to the work, shall I say, of organisation, of modelling lessons and giving illustrations of what should be done, how many of those 120 schools would he succeed in covering during the year and to what extent?</P>
    <P>The inspectors, I think, realise that in this matter of Irish in particular it is their duty, and it is the policy of the Department through them, to give every possible assistance and to co-operate in every possible way with the teachers in overcoming the difficulties that the new programme brought with it, in regard to Irish.  I think, however, if the teachers will examine the question they will see that it would be utterly impossible to do away with the inspector as a director, to some extent as an instrument through which we know what is going on in the schools, and as an instrument through which we modify policy from time to time&mdash;make suggestions to the teachers and amend where we see fit or where we see necessary.  There is a certain amount of work other than school work thrown upon the inspector. There is examination work, the setting of papers and so on.  During the past few years since this committee of inspection reported there has been a gradual development in the Department towards reducing the amount of that work upon the inspectors and increasing to some extent the inspectorial staff.  That is still going on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1608" /> But I think it is not fair or just to have general charges levelled against the inspectors particularly by a body representing the vast majority of the teachers.  I think it is most unfair and unjust that general charges without substantiation should be brought against inspectors.  The inspectors are not in a position to defend themselves. They cannot write letters to the Press. They cannot pass resolutions.  They cannot hold mass meetings to say what they think about the national teachers.  Perhaps that is just as well! I would remind the teachers that the main body, perhaps the vast majority of the inspectors, have been recruited and at present are drawn from the teaching body.  If the teachers have reason to complain of their inspectors then I do not really know what answer can be made to them.  As far as I am concerned I am satisfied that we are getting the very best men and women available to us into the inspection service.  I quite realise that these men and women have difficult work to carry out and I would only ask that they should get the same consideration from the teachers as the teachers demand for themselves.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the advisory committee to which I referred briefly last year.  I do not know whether Deputy Breathnach referred to it, but I wish to state again that in spite of the fact that the matter has been further canvassed, and indeed a certain effort has been made to set up such a council, altogether apart from the Government apparently, I do not yet find myself able to agree that such a council is necessary, or that it is going to do useful work.  I am still at a loss to know what the functions of this advisory council are to be, how it is to be composed, and what are to be the relations of the Minister with this advisory council. We hear a great deal about the desirability of taking the parents into conference and into council on matters affecting the welfare of their children. That, no doubt, is a very desirable development, but I would like to know how we are to select those particular parents&mdash;those who are to be represented on the advisory council?  How <Col N="1609" /> are those representatives to be selected; what qualifications are they to possess?</P>
    <P>As I stated last year, I think, to some extent, we have a very good substitute for the advisory council in this House, in men who are representative of the people and of the parents in particular. When discussing in Committee on Finance the educational expenditure for the year the Deputies here have an opportunity of discussing matters that they consider of importance to the parents or to the children.  I fail to see how the parents can be more adequately or better represented on such a council than they are in this House at the present time. As far as I can judge, the main bulk of the members of the suggested council come from the teachers, both primary and secondary.  There may be some managers or certain other educationists represented, but generally speaking, I think it is the representatives of the teachers who are mainly concerned.</P>
    <P>If such a council were to have representatives of different educational interests in addition to the primary and secondary teachers, such as the universities, religious orders of men and women, the management of primary and secondary schools, training colleges, preparatory colleges, and so forth, is there not every likelihood that it would tend to become a mere debating society?  How long would it remain in session and on what particular matters would it come to an agreement, or on what matters would it make any worthy recommendations to the Minister or the Department?  I should also say here again that the Minister and the officials of the Department are at all times ready to meet representatives either of the teaching bodies or the other interests concerned.  We do meet them and have met them.  It has been our general practice to consult them on questions where we consider it was only right and fair that they should be consulted, for example, when we propose to make any changes in the regulations.</P>
    <P>I think that such a council if it be set up eventually would concern itself very <Col N="1610" /> largely with recommendations regarding expenditure.  I can assure the House, as I have already done, that there is no lack whatever of avenues upon which we can fruitfully progress if we can only secure the necessary finances and the necessary resources. There is the whole question of the maintenance and the cleaning of the schools, their upkeep, as well as the building of new schools and the replacement of unsuitable ones.  There is the question of sanitary accommodation in our schools.  There is the question of the raising of the school leaving age, the question of setting up higher primary schools and increasing the provision of scholarships for brilliant children from the primary schools to the secondary schools. There is the question of the better provision of scholarships for the university, of up-to-date modern equipment in our schools; arrangements for playing fields, swimming baths, gymnasia, and so on.  All these suggestions would provide great improvements in our educational system, if they could be carried out, but they will all require money, and if the function of this advisory council were to be to pass resolutions and send them up to me asking that I should take steps to get ahead with this development or the other development, to spend money on this matter or the other matter, and if I were to be in the position, as I probably would be in a large number of cases and as any other Minister would, to see that the project, while very desirable, could not be undertaken in present circumstances since the necessary finances could not be provided, what was to happen then?  Were the advisory council to say &ldquo;We are not satisfied with this Minister and we would like to take over the control of the administration ourselves&rdquo;?  I should like to remind the House that we have had boards in the past.  We had the National Board, responsible for primary schools, and we had the Intermediate Board, responsible for secondary education.  These Boards were responsible definitely for the administration of these two branches of education in this country, and neither of them had been found to be <Col N="1611" /> satisfactory.  Fault was found with both.  In the future things may be different, no doubt.  We have very greatly changed conditions at present, but so far we have not been given any clear idea as to what sort of advisory council is in mind or what would be its functions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon referred to the question of Gaeltacht students in the training colleges.  I assure him that it is very far from my mind to apologise for any increase that may have been made in the number of these students under the regulations; but on account of the very misleading statements that have been made from time to time, particularly by teachers, who should know better and who must be acquainted with the regulations, I should like to advise the public that, in fact, as Deputy Breathnach himself has just stated, the number of candidates in the training colleges from the Gaeltacht is only a very small percentage.  The position at present is that almost two-thirds of the candidates who are admitted to the training colleges come through open pupil-teacher system or through open competitive examination, and in these two classes the candidates from English-speaking districts particularly secure most of the places.  They have to pass the Leaving Certificate examination and, in the case of pupil teachers, the Intermediate examination. In the case of the other third of the candidates in the training colleges who come from the preparatory colleges, only 40 per cent. of the places are being reserved for the Fíor-Ghaeltacht &mdash;only 40 per cent. of one-third. Really, the percentage, as I have stated elsewhere, is not at all out of keeping with the standard of merit which has surprised those who have intimate knowledge of the examination results&mdash; the standard of merit of these Gaeltacht students.  When one realises that in counties like Donegal there are no great post-primary facilities for the boys and girls in the Gaeltacht&mdash;in fact, I think that in no part of the Fíor-Ghaeltacht itself have they opportunities for continuing in intermediate schools&mdash;nevertheless, even in the case of the 40 per cent. of one&mdash;third of the <Col N="1612" /> places in the training colleges which are being reserved to the Fíor-Ghaeltacht students, these students have to pass the Leaving Certificate examination. Accordingly, their parents have to go to a considerable amount of expense&mdash;I think, probably, out of all proportion to their means&mdash;to endeavour to get for their children the intermediate education which is necessary if, even under this system of preference, they are to find their way into preparatory colleges.  I should like very much if we were able to go further and to say definitely that a larger proportion of these places would be awarded to students from the Fíor-Ghaeltacht, but there are very large numbers of parents in other parts of the country also who are endeavouring to get a secondary education for their children, who have had them prepared and who have had the teaching profession in view for them, and who have spared no energy and trouble in endeavouring to give them the best knowledge possible of the Irish language. In deciding what percentage of places we are going to give to the Fíor-Ghaeltacht students, we must have regard to the likelihood of suitable candidates coming from the Fíor-the educational standard we are likely to get.  We cannot afford to depress that standard unduly and we must have regard to the claims of parents elsewhere, for example, the parents Deputy Dillon referred to, who, while not classed as residing in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht, nevertheless, may consider themselves as native Irish speakers. The question in regard to that particular matter of residence in the Gaeltacht that presented itself to me was: was I going to loosen regulations and allow people to come into the Gaeltacht, to have their children classed as residing in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht, when the school they were attending had not even a handful of native Irish speakers?  Now, we have to go by schools in this matter.  We class a school either as a Fíor-Ghaeltacht school or not, and if there is any nucleus at all of native Irish speakers in that school, so long as the inspector is satisfied that they come from Irish- <Col N="1613" /> speaking homes, I think that the smallness of the number has not militated against the school being considered a Fíor-Ghaeltacht school; but when the inspectors find that there is only a solitary individual or only two or three individuals in a school and that there is a doubt whether they come from really native Irish-speaking homes, I think it would be stretching the regulations unduly and would, in fact, be doing harm elsewhere if we were to allow these isolated cases to be classed as residing in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht. When we are definitely satisfied, under the bonus scheme or some such other scheme, irrespective of the school they attend so long as they are in the Gaeltacht area, that children come from native Irish-speaking homes and are native speakers themselves, I daresay it may be possible to treat them all on the same basis and give them all the same facilities in regard to these scholarships.  At the moment, however, since the method of procedure is by prescribing schools as Fíor-Ghaeltacht or otherwise, the inspectors have no option, where there is not this nucleus of native Irish-speaking children, but to rule such schools out.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy referred to the language flowing out from the Gaeltacht. As I pointed out last year, Sir, I cannot accept the position which Deputy Mulcahy has carved out for me &mdash;that I should be Minister for the development of the Irish language. Other Ministers and other Departments have their responsibilities also. Other Parties have their responsibilities and Deputies and the general public have their responsibilities in this matter if we are to make progress with the revival of the Irish language. So far as my personal opinion is concerned, however, I consider that while maintaining an active and progressive policy in the Gaeltacht and encouraging the people there to maintain the Irish language as the sole medium of intercourse as far as possible between themselves and the world outside, we should also go ahead in the Gaeltacht; we should intensify, as far as we can, the policy of Irish in the schools and endeavour to extend the use of Irish through the Government Departments <Col N="1614" /> and through the Administration as well as through the country generally.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy referred to a number of minor matters, including an &ldquo;A&rdquo; school, where he said that English was being spoken at play.  There is a difficulty in certain large schools, where a portion of the school has been set aside as &ldquo;all-Irish&rdquo; though the rest of the school, while not all Irish, is progressing&mdash; some subjects or some classes may be taken in Irish.  We can take it, I think, in regard to all these schools that a definite effort is being made to have all instruction through Irish at the earliest possible date.  But, in regard to those very large schools which have only succeeded in completely Gaelicising a portion of the school up to the present, there is the difficulty of maintaining a complete barrier between the children in that portion of the school and the children in the remainder of the school.  Except for the fact that the children in the all-Irish school meet the children in the remainder of the school from time to time, I do not think that there is any serious ground for criticism.  I think that all these &ldquo;A&rdquo; schools endeavour to carry out the policy with the right Gaelic spirit and with the right determination.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy asked for details of the bonus system.  We have not yet any details.  We have not yet appointed the additional inspectors who will be required in view of the increased administrative work which will be necessary to carry this bonus scheme into operation.  But I think the House can rest assured that the bonus will not be given easily.  The inspectors will have to be definitely satisfied that the children are definitely native Irish-speaking and that Irish is spoken as the language of the home.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy is still interested in the question of the inspectorate in the Gaeltacht and seems to have the idea that more work could be done by the inspectors in advancing the language. We have seen, as I have explained to the House, the nature of the complaints made against the inspectors. <Col N="1615" /> The inspectors' instructions are to co-operate with the teachers as far as possible.  The House will remember that a definite age limit was fixed in regard to Irish when the new policy was brought in in 1922.  Teachers who are approaching middle age are not expected to make the same effort as the younger teachers, but in regard to those younger teachers, who are either native Irish speakers, or who have gone to colleges where the work was done practically completely through Irish for a period of years, there seems to be no excuse for not expecting that Irish will begin gradually to take its place as a medium of instruction.  That was the intention, and without inflicting unnecessary hardship on the teachers I think that with co-operation between both teachers and inspectors that purpose can be achieved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon would like us to have an inquiry with regard to this question of teaching children through Irish.  I have visited a good many schools myself and it is really surprising what can be done when the teacher is either a native Irish speaker who is a good teacher, or even by a very skilful teacher with a fairly moderate knowledge of Irish.  The progress which can be made in the infants' departments is extraordinary.  I am not of course satisfied that we have always approached this question of bringing a new language into the schools, as a new language it undoubtedly was, from as purely a scientific standpoint as we should have done.  I would be very glad indeed if from time to time our inspectors and teachers could come together, or our teachers themselves could come together, apart from the inspectors, if they so wished, to discuss these problems; to see whether, for example, the question of having only Irish in the infants' school from the first day that the child comes to the school is the most successful method, or whether a little English should be allowed for a while until the child becomes accustomed to the new atmosphere.</P>

      <P>A great deal, of course, depends on the personality of the teacher.  But I certainly would like to see in certain schools experiments being carried out to show the general body of the teaching profession what can be done and we would be very glad to give the teachers every help and encouragement.  If the teachers, who were specially efficient and who found that their particular programme and their particular way of dealing with their problems had been successful, brought their own experiments and their own experience before us, we would be very glad indeed to try and bring the whole question before the public as it should be done through the medium of conferences of teachers and of educationists.  Up to the present very little has been done in showing the public what really can be accomplished. I think the vast body of the public do not realise the very great advance that has been made in some schools where, as I say, the teacher had an unlimited command of Irish, or where, even with a moderate knowledge of Irish, a teacher was exceedingly skilful and in that way was able to take every advantage of his opportunities. We may be able to devise some scheme by which we will better appreciate the work that is being done by those teachers who have succeeded in making Irish the medium of instruction in their schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But, as regards the general principle of teaching children through Irish, I think Deputy Dillon will not contend, if a child is to learn the language in the way that we expect children to learn the Irish language&mdash;that it will, as far as possible, be native to them; that they will regard it as something which they acquire in their infancy; that they grew up with it&mdash;that the ages of four to eight are not, as has been stated by a distinguished educationist in Dublin, the best years for the acquisition of the Irish language. That, at any rate, is the principle that the programme has been carried out upon.  The only way in which we can test whether that is the best age, or whether the complete Gaelicisation of the infant schools and the infants' departments as the first step&mdash;whether <Col N="1617" /> that is or is not the most satisfactory and most efficient way to carry out our purpose, we can only find out, I think, by trial and error.  But, as I said, I should certainly like to see more experiments, particularly in our larger schools, because the public do not realise the good work that certainly is being done in some schools, and in order to give educationists this encouragement, to show them where the work is being done so that they can go and see for themselves, and when teachers' congresses come together we might occasionally have papers and discussions on topics of this nature.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of handwriting which Deputy Dillon referred to, it is well known that when people look back on their youth and when they consider the best boy in the class, the best handwriting in the class and the best arithmetic in the class, and compare it quite arbitrarily with some particularly unfortunate example of handwriting and arithmetic of the present day, they say, of course, &ldquo;Were not things so much better when I was going to school?&rdquo; You can always go back on the old reports and find with regard to the three &ldquo;R's&rdquo; that inspectors were really never satisfied. We never can be, I think, really satisfied in education with the progress that is being made.  No good teacher ever is satisfied.  A good teacher will tell an inspector, as I have heard inspectors say, &ldquo;Here is my class; I am not satisfied with them at all; I have not got the results I think I should have got.&rdquo;  That is the right spirit.  If we had more of that we would certainly have less complaint and less bickering about this question of the inspectorate.  If from the beginning the teachers realised that the inspector's business was to help, that it was the inspector's business to co-operate and give advice, and that the commonsense thing to do was to tell the inspector the difficulties under which one is working, the attendance, the poverty of the children, and all those other circumstance which may be adverse, it would be very desirable.  The very first instruction <Col N="1618" /> the inspector gets is to make allowance for all those adverse circumstances.  Is the teacher a real enthusiast, as he or she should be, particularly in regard to this matter of Irish?  I myself doubt and have always doubted whether there is any real benefit in asking people to teach Irish who have no interest in Irish, whose attitude seems to be, &ldquo;Why all this unnecessary trouble about Irish? Is not the English language sufficiently satisfactory as a medium of intercourse? Does it not meet our requirements sufficiently?&rdquo;  So long as the teachers have not a better interest, and a more professional interest, if I may say so, in the development of the Irish language than I have noticed occasionally, I fear that we are not going to make the progress which we should like.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon also referred to the question of industrial and reformatory schools.  I do not know whether I really can compliment the Deputy on having stated his case in moderate terms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh you can.  I was extremely moderate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the fact that the Deputy has a personal experience and a personal impression about those gloomy and forbidding Georgian houses, and the dreadful effects they may have on one's character, making one terribly gloomy and all that kind of thing, has had an unduly depressing effect upon the Deputy.  I do not think that the number of young children in the Summerhill place of detention can be very great.  As the Deputy knows, I went there myself, having heard his complaint, and I found that there were very few younger children there, and the period of detention, as he has stated, was generally a week.  Perhaps on rare occasions it went up to three weeks. We have since made arrangements to provide books, but I think the Deputy will realise that no matter in what place of detention you keep those children who have been neglected&mdash; some of them were pretty good scholars, but others had been somewhat neglected&mdash;and whatever the circumstances may be, it would be <Col N="1619" /> impossible for any teacher to make very much progress with them, except perhaps to keep them engaged for the period during which they are there. No definite educational result could be achieved, and in fact I think the Deputy is not correct in referring to the establishment as an educational institution.  Summerhill place of detention should really be under the control of the Department of Justice, because the reason that we have this problem at all is, as the Deputy indicated, that when boys are on remand industrial schools will not take them. The industrial school manager feels that the boy might be sent to a reformatory and during the period when he is on remand no industrial school manager will take responsibility for taking him in.  As a matter of fact even in the reformatory cases we have not such savage or vicious types of crimes as they have in other countries, and I certainly agree with the Deputy that it is a pity that in those matters we are not able to handle the problem in a somewhat more sympathetic and more modern spirit.  This particular place of detention for example is under lay control. It is a particular problem, and there is always the difficulty that you are going to have only a small number of boys there, seven being the average, for a short period of time, and that it will be difficult to deal with them properly until they are committed finally and definitely to some other place of detention.  We have this to congratulate ourselves upon, however, in this country, that most, or, I think, all the schools and reformatories&mdash;we have only one reformatory now but we used to have two&mdash;are under the control of Orders, of brothers or nuns or priests in some cases.  The value of religion in the administration of those establishments is enormous.  In other countries I notice that in spite of their very best efforts, and in spite of the most modern methods of administration when carried out on lay lines, the system was not at all effective, particularly in dealing with the girls.  We have reason to congratulate ourselves here that we have those devoted Orders of men and women to take <Col N="1620" /> responsibility for those children.  We are, in fact, going to set up a commission to deal with this question of reformatory and industrial schools.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">

      <P>It was mooted some years ago, and negotiations were carried on between the Department and the industrial school with reference to better educational provision, and better educational facilities in those institutions.  About the time I became Minister a definite arrangement was made by which junior boys&mdash; boys I think were chiefly concerned&mdash; were given practically the full-time national school education, the work on the farm and in the workshops being confined practically altogether to the senior boys.  That was a definite advance, and was very satisfactory. As far as education proper in those establishments is concerned, it is subject to supervision by our ordinary school inspectors, and they report to the Department.  Apart from the particular problem that Deputy Dillon has raised with regard to the Summerhill place of detention, there is the question of the training&mdash;particularly the industrial training&mdash;of those boys and girls as well, and of what is going to happen to them after they leave the institutions. In that connection, I may say that from inquiries I have pursued I am satisfied that every possible effort is made by managers of industrial schools to keep in touch with the boys when they leave the schools, but some boys are of a nomadic and vagrant nature and they cannot be traced. They change practically every week, so it is nearly impossible to avoid unfortunate occurrences.  If the statistics are examined however, in regard to either the boys or girls it will be found that a very small percentage indeed turn to crime.  Even then, as Deputy Dillon said, the crime is often not very serious, and if properly handled those young offenders could, I am sure, be made into respectable citizens.  There is also the question of the financing of those institutions. That is really one of the problems which the commission will have to examine.  Apart from the fact that <Col N="1621" /> the Widows and Orphans Pension Scheme will affect the numbers in those institutions, there has been, up to the present, a serious reduction in numbers, with a consequent increase in overhead charges per unit.  The managers of those schools are not satisfied that they can do better work, or that they can make the improvements which we should like them to make in order to provide for the better training of the boys and girls, unless we make better financial provision for them.  One of the problems that the new commission will have to examine is in what way these schools will be maintained in the future.  I suppose the House can take it that another effort will be made to try and transfer the entire responsibility to the State. Up to the present the local authorities have been paying portion and we have been paying the lion's share.  We have the personnel of the commission practically completed and I think that the House can take it that the commission will start its labours at an early date.</P>

      <P>I have not the list finally prepared yet.  Mr. Cussen will be the chairman and he is a very experienced man and has a great knowledge of all the different problems, as the Deputy knows.  Before I pass from that question, I would like to say there is another problem which we had contemplated examining in connection with this commission; that is the problem of defective children.  At the present time the responsibility would be really more on the Local Government Department than upon us to make inquiries as to the extent of that problem and what steps might be taken to provide a special type of education for defective children.  We have not at the present moment sufficient statistics to enable us to say what is the extent of the problem.  If we can get the information from the medical officers of health we may be in a position either this year or next year to institute some experiment in one of our Dublin schools for the special instruction of these defective children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1622" /> Deputy Dillon referred to the question of central schools.  We have been considering a type of reorganisation of schools on somewhat the same lines as has been carried out in other countries; that is to say, the transference of children at the age of 11 plus from the elementary schools to post-primary schools.  I think Deputy Dillon's proposition was really for amalgamation of existing national schools, the bringing together of all the children in a central school.  To a certain extent that policy has been carried out and a most troublesome problem it is.  In a great many of our rural schools the average is falling and there is always the difficulty that one or perhaps two teachers in the amalgamated schools may find themselves in a position of jeopardy owing to the falling attendance and they are in danger of losing their positions.  If we combine a number of schools as Deputy Dillon says, we may be able to effect an economy in staffing, but I wonder how far we are going to get with the teachers' organisation in asking them to agree with us that the services of large numbers of their members should be dispensed with? Even then it would not be entirely an economy, because it is estimated that the cost of transport of the children from the outlying schools to the central school might run to £6 per child.</P>
    <P>In addition to that there is the question of organisation.  As I indicated in my opening statement, specially equipped and trained teachers will have to be provided for the higher schools and classes.  Better organisation will be necessary.  It is doubtful in the long run if we would have any real economy.  The cost of transport at the rate of £6 per child over the whole country would amount to something like £1,000,000.  If we could have an experimental scheme of that kind, we would be very glad to assist in having it carried into operation.  If the Deputy had as much experience as I have had of the problem of dealing with redundant teachers, he would realise that it would be very difficult to carry the proposal through.  We are trying to advance towards higher primary schools.  It is a question of <Col N="1623" /> reorganisation which will take the greater part of a generation even with our best efforts and we are going to have a good many of precisely the same problems as I alluded to in connection with Deputy Dillon's proposal.</P>
    <P>If we consider raising the school age even to 15 years, it is incumbent on us to make an effort to provide post-primary education in the rural and particularly in the Gaeltacht areas. The vocational schools are undoubtedly doing very good work, but I am not quite satisfied that we are getting the best results from vocational schools in rural areas.  I was very keen on having vocational schools in rural areas, but I feel that if we could have a general reorganisation in connection with the raising of the school age and get a number of higher primary schools going in the more congested areas, we could then see what is the best way to advance.  The more varieties of schools we have, the better.  The higher primary school would really carry out substantially the kind of work the vocational school is doing.  The intention is that it should be based on an agricultural economy, have a strong agricultural bias, and selected national teachers would either be called for special intensive courses or, while going through the training colleges, would receive additional instruction to enable them to carry out the work of teaching in these higher primary schools.  The proposal is only being considered at present, but we have given it a great deal of consideration. Just like a great number of important educational innovations, it is largely a question of finance.</P>
    <P>Deputy O Briain referred to the question of the standard of English in the Gaeltacht areas.  That is a matter we are examining, but I think the Deputy must be aware that even amongst the native Irish-speaking population there is a desire that they should not be unilingual and have only Irish.  They feel they should not be deprived of a knowledge of the English language, which will be so necessary for them in future years.  There is quite a strong feeling in the Gaeltacht <Col N="1624" /> areas in favour of bi-lingualism. We have to bear that in mind.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacDermot referred to a number of matters of general interest. I would like to take this opportunity of making a few remarks in regard to them.  With regard to physical culture, we had last year a course of training for teachers in vocational schools, and we hope further steps will be taken by vocational education authorities to enable teachers in these schools to take out testimonials in physical culture or to enable them to attend courses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

      <P>Are these boxing matches?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>No, they are not, but boxing matches might be included. With regard to national schools, we have had a number of very brief courses.  The Army authorities were good enough to give us the use of their instructors, and successful courses for teachers were carried out in Irish and English.  I think there will be no difficulty in the larger centres in getting further assistance from the Army in the way of providing instructors. We have not very many instructors in the country, outside the Army.  We have a number of ex-Army men, but we have not any institution in which this instruction could be carried on in a specialised way, although instruction is being given in the training colleges.  For the present, until some better arrangement is made for the provision of whole-time teachers of physical training, we shall have to depend on those part-time courses which are carried out by the Army authorities.  I would be very glad indeed if we could have the co-operation of the teachers' organisation generally in organising these courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacDermot asked whether continuation education is being carried on through Irish in vocational schools.  It is, and very satisfactorily. We have a number of continuation schools, the head masters of which are Irish teachers, men of personality who have succeeded in making a striking success of their schools.  We <Col N="1625" /> have in view that some of these continuation schools should be really on the same lines as the famous Folk Schools in Denmark&mdash;that is, that they would have definite national characteristics.  It is difficult to see how they can be regarded as typical of this country if the Irish language has not a prominent place in the curriculum. Domestic science, although a very important subject, is a subject which has certain difficulties.  There is a difficulty which presents itself in connection with a good many other technical subjects&mdash;the difficulty of text books and the need for Irish-speaking instructresses.  But I am glad to say that in domestic economy very good provision is being made for instruction through the medium of Irish.  I hope that in the course of time it will be possible to carry out instruction completely through the medium of the Irish language.  I now come to the question of Irish music in schools&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I interrupt the Minister there?  Do the domestic economy classes include cookery?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, cookery, sewing, laundry, possibly other subjects, but especially these three.  On the question of Irish music in the schools, there is a lack of effort, I must admit, in regard to this matter.  Colonel Brasé and the Army authorities were good enough to co-operate with us in having these concerts. Teachers and children have been at these concerts and I think they have been very well satisfied.  A good deal of attention was given to Irish music as far as possible.  But we must recognise that there is a paucity of music that is suitable for arrangement either for bands, orchestras or school choirs. If we had some organisation outside which could take upon itself the task of arranging these old Irish melodies to which Deputy MacDermot has referred and particularly arranging them for school choirs, it would be very useful work indeed.  Gramophones and wireless can also be used to a certain extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacDermot also referred to the teaching of Irish history.  I have <Col N="1626" /> only to say in that connection that history if taught strictly as a text book subject can be very dry and terribly disappointing, particularly to the children. But the imagination of the children can be stirred if, as I said, with regard to the language question, the teacher is an enthusiast, if he is interested and has personality, if he impresses upon his pupils the lessons which he takes from history or the interpretation which he places upon historical characters.  If he has personality he can add life to his lessons and illustrate in a striking manner the subject of history.  Then these lessons will be entirely different from what they would be where the teacher adheres strictly to the text books and never undertakes to carry out a course of general reading or to do a little research for himself in regard to his local barony.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the new programme we have at all times emphasised the importance of the study of local history.  If there is a lack of knowledge in our national schools, a lack of the knowledge of the old tribes, clans, traditions, and historical associations, connected with the septs in any particular neighbourhood, then, I do not think the blame can be placed on the Education Office. It may be that there is a lack of easily accessible matter, but if one goes through a museum or a library, or if one could only go to the trouble of looking through the vast amount of material that has been collected in recent times, one cannot complain of the shortage of material.  This is a matter in which we should have a great deal of help through the voluntary efforts of associations outside.  I would say to the Deputy with regard to the books to which he has referred that we have an interesting example at the present time of a writer who was very successful, I think&mdash;or should have been very successful&mdash;as a novelist in English and who is now writing novels in Irish.</P>

I think I have dealt with the main points that have been raised. <Col N="1627" /> Although it is not really our province to give a resumé in the annual report, if Deputy MacDermot looks at it, I think he will find that a good deal of attention is given to any activities which are connected with the schools. The musical side, for example, I am sure will get more attention in the future and possibly more may also be done with regard to local history and the forming of historical associations. But the important thing is to remember that the main elements and fundamentals of education have first to be attended to.  In addition to undertaking this overwhelming task of restoring the language, if we ask the teachers to take up a great many other matters which may seem to us important, and upon the preparation of which time and energy may be required, we may not get quite as much co-operation as we require.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he has any information to give on the question of the standardisation of school books in primary schools?  More than 75 per cent. of the children and their parents find it a very difficult matter to keep buying those books.  The books are being changed from year to year, but if the books were standardised, say for a certain number of years, the books could sometimes be used by other members of the family in succeeding years.  perhaps the commission which the Minister has referred to would consider that matter, and if the Minister has any information people will be very anxious to know what decision he has come to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Educationists at the present time dislike being confined to particular standard books.  I think the Deputy will find that if we are to prescribe a particular book or set of books a great number of defects, either real or otherwise, will be discovered in them.  The tendency of the present time has been to give teachers more liberty than had been the case under the old &ldquo;results&rdquo; system, and as part of that liberty they have been given a certain amount of freedom in the choice of books.  You have also to <Col N="1628" /> take into account the effect on the publishing houses, since the old National Board gave up producing books of their own and selling them. I remember that when the National Board was first started they gave out books that were, I think, practically free, and the English firm of Murray complained to the then Minister about it, and, as a matter of business, the Board had either to give up selling or to increase the price of their books so as not to be in unfair competition with publishing firms.  We have that problem to-day.  The publishing companies have been publishing books and unless we take over the publication work altogether I find great difficulty in seeing how we can go back to a standardised set of books.  There are different teachers and different educationists preparing books.  These books are all suitable for schools and if publishing houses approach us and ask us to put these books on the list and if the books are suitable for particular standards, we cannot very well refuse.  So that, as regards the particular problem of the standardised books I think it is extremely difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been thinking of bringing out a standardised reader, but there again, even in the case of an English reader, there are different tastes. Different schools like to have different types of readers.  City schools prefer a reader dealing with city topics, whereas schools in a rural area might like lessons on different topics, and children in schools in a fishing district might prefer another kind of reader and so on.  We have made inquiries, of course, with regard to the question of free school books and found out that if we were to supply books free to all our primary schools it would cost about £100,000 a year.  Then, again, there is a very strong body of opinion in the country that thinks we have gone far enough in the provision of facilities for parents in respect of their children, and while under the Constitution education is certainly guaranteed as being free, there is a strong body of opinion which considers that free school books should not be given.  We can do it if we are in the <Col N="1629" /> position to provide the necessary finances and if we think, at any time, that it is the most useful way in which we can spend £100,000.  There again it is a permanent liability and we have not been able to consider embarking upon it at the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexHaslett" hpid="Mr. Haslett Mr. Haslett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps there is an aspect of that question raised by Deputy McGovern which might be put to the Minister.  I think it would be fatal to provide just a standardised book for all schools.  If I understand Deputy McGovern's point correctly, it is one which we hear often in country districts, and that is that a particular school, after it has selected a reader from the list, should stick to it for a few years.  At least I agree with the Minister that it would not be a good policy to standardise one book for all and not to allow for selection.  I think, however, that some order should be given to the teachers not to change every other year or so, because it might be the case that many families would find a difficulty in providing for these changes of books.  That is the particular point I should like to emphasise along with Deputy McGovern.</P>

      <P>If a better book comes on the market we have no option, of course, but to place it on our list, and inspectors and teachers, I suppose, will recommend the better books.  It is a very difficult question and we have not been able to find a solution, but we are gradually trying to reduce the number of books on the list and to take off those which we consider the least suitable. We will try as far as we can to make that list permanent and to reduce it to the smallest dimensions.</P>

      <P>On that Vote, Sir, I understand that last year there were certain minor deductions made from some of the grants in connection with the School of Art, I think, and I was going to ask the Minister this year if there was any prospect of those grants being restored.  The reductions were very small&mdash;something like £100 or £50 &mdash;in the grants made, I think, to the School of Art and one or two other institutions of that kind.  I do not know whether the Royal Irish Academy comes under this Vote.  I should like to know whether that is a charge on the Department of Finance or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>We have altered our policy, of course, and I have not the details at the moment.  There had been what I might call a policy of translating heterogeneous works&mdash; works of fiction, for example, rather trivial in value I think&mdash;into Irish.  We were committed to publishing all those works which had been accepted.  Since I became Minister I have been trying to get on to works of a more standard type.  Although we have advertised, for example, for translations of text books suitable for secondary schools the number of manuscripts forthcoming has been very small.  That probably largely accounts for the balance&mdash;the fact that we have desisted from the policy of translating books of fiction holus-bolus practically into Irish.  We are trying to get books translated of a definite value from the Irish standpoint. I will write to the Deputy about that.</P>

      <P>This sub-head is for the production of Irish county histories.  I understand that the editor here is the Rev. Michael O'Flanagan.  What I wanted to ask the Minister is, what he is going to do with the histories when he gets them? Are they for school books?</P>

I explained, on the occasion when I was introducing the Estimate first, that the whole matter would be considered when the manuscripts were available as to the form in which they would be published and whether they would be published otherwise than for general reading.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Gúm is under a special heading because the general promotion of the interests of the Irish language is committed to the Department of Education and they were, I suppose, entitled to take any steps they saw fit or necessary to take with a view to promoting the use of the Irish language both in the schools and outside and after school hours.  It was necessary to provide some literature in Irish to occupy the time of pupils who desire to carry Irish out of school into their homes.  There is provision under the head of Miscellaneous Expenses, sub-head 21, and if it were desired to subsidise books of general interest one would have imagined that it would come under that heading, and coming under that heading, one would have imagined the task being committed to some person or body who were experts in the matter concerned. I do not know if the gentleman charged with the work here is a historian, or has any special qualification, or has made any particular study of the question of local history in this country.  It may be that he has, but I think the House should be informed <Col N="1634" /> of the purpose for which those books are being prepared and of the ultimate cost of publishing those works and whether the value of the work given in will bear any relation to the cost of publication.

      <P>I concur in what Deputy Kelly has said.  In regard to Deputy Dillon's reference to County Roscommon, we all know that County Roscommon is to be torn to pieces and slaughtered as if it were a calf under the new Government Bill, so that there is no necessity for having any record or any history of Roscommon from now onwards.  I should like to ask the Minister if he is satisfied that the sum provided for the National Gallery is sufficient to meet the expenses in the case of national manuscripts or books which have to be bought?  I think that during the last ten years the National Library has been starved to a great extent, and that many manuscripts and documents which should have come into its possession have been lost to it owing to the insufficiency of funds at the disposal of the National Library. I was glad to see the appeal which appeared in the <i>Irish Press</i> a short time ago, asking that those who had a personal contact with the establishment of the First and Second Dáil and of the State should send in to the National Library such manuscripts as they might possess.  I think that appeal should be made wider and that it should be answered by all those who have any manuscripts or documents in their possession.  I would not ask anybody to do anything which I am not prepared to do myself.  I have myself given to the National Library everything I had, which was of any value from a national or historical point of view, dealing with those years, and I think that everybody should do likewise. That would, to some extent, enable the National Library to form records which would be available for students in years to come.  I think the appeal which has been made should be answered and should be broadcast throughout the country, so that the National Library should have all available documents and manuscripts dealing with that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the provision for the purchase of manuscripts and books for the National Library is sufficient.  I am informed that the <Col N="1638" /> provision is quite ample, and that no difficulty has been experienced in purchasing the material which the Library considers really valuable or essential. That is my information.  Quite recently a most valuable collection of the Letters of Lord Edward Fitzgerald was published for £600.  As the Deputy has told us, he himself has made some valuable gifts to the Library, for which he deserves the gratitude of all who are interested in those matters.  With regard to the Easter Week material, the National Library is not taking steps to go out and take down material, but they are prepared to accept any material in the way of manuscripts or accounts given by survivors of or participants in the movement of that period, or in the succeeding movement.  A guarantee will be given that such material will not be published.  As the Deputy knows&mdash;I do not know whether the House generally does&mdash;a good deal of material dealing with the history of Easter Week has already been accumulated. It is not the intention to publish the material, but it is very essential that all necessary steps should be taken as soon as possible to collect accounts from those who have taken part in the movement.  It is very necessary that those accounts should be taken up, and for that reason the Library published a statement that they were willing to take and preserve in safe keeping any documents given to them.</P>

      <P>There is just one question which I should like to ask, really in order to give the Minister an opportunity of clearing up the point. It has been freely stated amongst people who are interested in the National Gallery that a certain amount of pressure was put on the Directors, or whatever its governing body is called, to force them to buy a certain picture at an exorbitant price.  I presume the Government recognises all the time that once a competent body is set up to deal with the purchase of pictures for the National Gallery or any other public institution&mdash;that body being chosen, as one presumes, because of their competent knowledge of the subject, and of their conception of the value in the material&mdash;there should be no interference with it.  It is freely stated that strong pressure was put on this body to force them to buy a picture at a really ridiculous figure, as far as I can judge.</P>

      <P>I consider the Deputy's remarks are quite uncalled for.  They are just as much a reflection on the Board as they purport to be on the Minister.  I had no knowledge whatever of the matter, and would not in any way countenance any such transaction. The Board are entirely free in that connection.  It is entirely a matter for themselves, and for their own judgement.  I do not think that the Board, whom to a certain extent I represent here, will be at all pleased with the Deputy's reference to the matter.  I consider it a criticism of the Board and I have no fault what-even to find with that Board.</P>

      <P>Go ndeontar suim ná raghaidh thar £984,487 chun slánuithe na suime is gá chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1935, chun costais an Airm agus Chúltaca an Airm (maraon le Deontaisí áirithe i gCabhair) fé sna hAchtanna Fórsaí Cosanta (Forálacha Sealadacha); chun costaisí áirithe riaracháin ina thaobh san; agus chun costaisí fén Acht Bunreachta (Leasú Uimh. 17), 1931.</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £984,487 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1935, for the cost of the Army and the Army Reserve (including certain Grants-in-Aid) under the Defence Forces. (Temporary Provisions) Acts; certain administrative expenses in connection therewith; and Expenses under the Constitution (Amendment No. 17) Act, 1931.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Army Estimate for the regular Army for the financial year 1934-35 is based on an establishment of 560 officers and 5,350 other ranks.  The <Col N="1641" /> number of other ranks is the same as that in the Estimate for 1933-34, but the number of officers shows an increase of five.  The figure of 560 includes 20 officers specially commissioned in connection with the new Volunteer force.  The actual officer strength at the end of March was 547, so that the figure of 560 allows for the promotion to commissioned rank of 13 cadets at present serving in the Military College, who, if they pass the necessary tests and examinations, will be eligible for commissions during the financial year.</P>
    <P>The number of cadets provided for is 15 against 28 in the previous year, and the reduction is due entirely to the limitation in the number of new entrants.  In this connection it should be observed that non-commissioned officers of a suitable type are, from time to time, selected to undergo courses for commissioned rank at the college, and it is anticipated that during the present year there will be about four such non-commissioned officers who will be eligible for commissions.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of re-entries, provision has been made for the re-entry into Army service of 300 other ranks over an average period of three months.  This provision is to enable reservists who show particular aptitude to extend their term of training so that they may undergo intensive courses of instruction in the specialist branches of Army service, and thus render themselves capable of undertaking the task of instruction.</P>
    <P>Class &ldquo;A&rdquo; reserve is composed of soldiers who serve a number of years with the colours, and the remainder of their term of enlistment on the reserve. The provision for this force has had to be increased from 4,700 to 5,200 other ranks.  The increase is practically authomatic inasmuch as it depends directly on the number of men whose time with the colours will have expired, and who will, therefore, be due for transfer to the reserve during the year.  The financial provision for 5,200 has, however, been reduced by 20 per cent., because it has been found that the numbers reporting for annual <Col N="1642" /> training are about 70-80 per cent. of those on the reserve rolls.</P>
    <P>Class &ldquo;B&rdquo; reserve is composed of soldiers who, having served three months with the regular Army, are transferred to the reserve in which they serve the remainder of their term of enlistment.  Recruiting for this force has practically ceased for some time past, and the number provided for has, therefore, been reduced from 3,500 to 2,500.  The actual strength at the end of March was approximately 2,700, and when allowance has been made for wastage and for soldiers not reporting for annual training, it will be seen that even the reduced financial provision should be adequate to meet requirements.  In point of fact and of policy this force will gradually disappear.</P>
    <P>The provision for the Volunteer reserve is based on the actual strength of 358 all ranks obtaining when the Estimate was compiled.  It is intended in due course that this arm will be absorbed in the new Volunteer force, and consequently no provision has been made for any increase in it.</P>
    <P>As regards the Officers' Training Corps, provision has been made for 700 cadets as against 650 in the previous year's Estimate.  The actual strength at the end of March was about 698, so that the provision is practically based on the existing strength of the corps.</P>
    <P>The number of personnel provided for the Officers' Reserve remains at the same figure as in the previous year's Estimates.  Finally, as regards the new Volunteer force, provision has been made for the annual training of 300 who were enlisted before the end of March, for the initial or annual training of 12,000 to be enlisted during the present financial year, for enlistment grants in respect of 14,000, and of training grants for 20,000 volunteers. The policy and organisation of this force have already been fully outlined to the Dáil when the Supplementary Estimates were taken on February 7th, 1934.</P>
    <P>Turning from the aspect of establishments to that of finance, it will be observed that the present as compared with the previous year's original Estimate shows a net increase of <Col N="1643" /> £223,417.  Of this amount £196,116 is directly attributable to the new Volunteer force, and £6,000 to expenses in connection with the Constitution (Amendment) Act, so that there is only a nett increase of £21,301 on the original Estimate as submitted last year.  This amount, together with any decrease on certain sub-heads, has been utilised in providing partly for the increased numbers of class &ldquo;A&rdquo; reserve, but mainly in providing for technical courses, equipment and material for all corps and services of the Army.  The increased expenditure on technical equipment and material finds ready justification in the very fact that the regular Army is a small one, and that the smaller the Army the more intensive must be its training, the more highly organised its units, and the more specialised its equipment and weapons.  The policy of the State as regards the Army is briefly to have a small highly trained standing Army which will serve as a pivot around which may be organised, developed and trained the entire reserve and Volunteer forces and, if necessary, the entire man-power of the State, and to that end the Army itself is being and will be provided with the most intensive training and the most up-to-date arms and equipment which the State can afford.</P>
    <P>Hitherto we have more or less concentrated on providing the artillery with suitable guns, but the time has now come when the needs of the other corps and services and infantry must be seen to.  In the present Estimate we are taking steps in that direction. Thus Army educational schools for soldiers will be increased and equipped and specialist military courses abroad will be provided for specially selected officers.  For the infantry we are testing the value of new self-loading rifles; we are providing more portable light machine guns, and we are making a beginning with the most modern pattern of trench mortar.  For the Armoured Car Corps we are providing light tanks, and we are enabling the corps to bring its cars up-to-date.  The Signal Corps will have a new mobile wireless car to enable it to communicate <Col N="1644" /> with aircraft in flight; wireless sets to permit of intercommunication between armoured cars operating at a distance, and its telephonic system will be modernised.  Such equipment costs money, but it is money economically spent, for if there is to be an Army at all it is in the long view more economical that it should be an effective instrument of defence rather than a weapon that cannot be relied upon in an emergency.  Moreover, in carrying out this policy every effort will be made to make the Army self-reliant and as far as possible self-contained.  The Army will in fact be made as far as possible to adapt itself to the State's economic policy of self-reliance and self-sufficiency.</P>
    <P>Modern types of technical materials and weapons will be purchased, but no endeavour will be spared to produce and find the requirements of the Army within the country, so that it will be independent as far as possible of foreign stores.  Thus the construction of a munition factory continues to engage active attention, and during the year it is hoped that some of our plans will reach fruition.  The Air Corps is about to embark on a scheme of training boy mechanics who will be instructed in the detailed assembly of aircraft, and on the repair and maintenance of aero engines.  During the year it will undertake the reconstruction of two crashed aircraft, and as soon as the boys are trained and the personnel have acquired the necessary experience, the general assembly of all Army aircraft will be undertaken. Incidentally such trained technical personnel should in due time prove a valuable asset to this country in the development of civil aviation.  The Armoured Car Corps will recondition and modernise their own cars; the Signal Corps will bring their own equipment up-to-date, and will fit out the radio van intended for communication with aircraft, and finally, the Ordnance Corps will undertake the manufacture, or at least the assembly, of field kitchens needed for each corps and service of the Army.</P>
    <P>Such in outline is the Army policy on which the present Estimate has been framed.  At this point it may be <Col N="1645" /> well to emphasise that the moral and physical, as distinct from the technical qualities of the Army, are of the highest possible character.  During the last financial year about 600 recruits were enlisted for Army service, and the average strength of the Army fluctuated around the figure of 5,700.  Out of that number we had only 14 deaths, and of these three were due to accidents in the air; and the percentage of casualties, due to illness, was only just over 2 per cent.  As regards the moral qualities of the Army, the discipline, loyalty and enthusiasm of the soldier, it may be pointed out that during the whole year we lost only 25 men through desertion, a fact which bears testimony to the good relations existing between officers and men, to the admirable conditions under which the men serve, and the high morale of the troops generally.  In this connection also, it should be observed that during the combined exercises our young soldiers with full kit carried out for a fortnight long marches daily, despite much physical hardship and discomfort, and that not a single complaint was received from any of the four counties in which they operated reflecting on their conduct or discipline.</P>
    <P>The two outstanding events in the Army during the past year were the combined exercises and the inception of the new Volunteer force.  The later is now getting into its stride. The area officers have taken up their duties: 151 Sluaighte Committees have been formed and 24 are in course of formation and the first batch of the new formation were sufficiently advanced in training to take their part in the annual parade on St. Patrick's Day.</P>
    <P>As regards the combined exercises, it must be noted at the outset that field exercises are an essential element of training in all arms, because through them alone can be tested the theoretical training given to officers in schools and colleges, and the collective training of separate units.  No exercises of this nature had been carried out in the Army since 1926, and even then the exercises were of <Col N="1646" /> an elementary character, being confined to infantry units with a small detachment of other arms.  There was, however, no real test of the system of command, staff and supply. The exercises carried out during the past year were of a more searching and ambitious character.  A reinforced field brigade of all arms about 4,000 strong was pitted against a skeleton force of about 1,000 strong, specially organised for mobility and consisting of armoured forces, horse cavalry, air corps, and three small infantry battalions, to afford necessary fire cover. Both forces had their own system of command, staff and supply.  The general object aimed at was to test the effectiveness of a non-mechanised against a highly mechanised force, but the special object was to test the theoretical lessons imparted at the Military College and subsidiary schools.  In both directions valuable information was obtained.  The system of command was thoroughly tried out, and was found to be proceeding on the right lines.  Staff work was found to be particularly good, and the system of supply was shown to be most efficient.  Night after night, for 14 days, 120 tons of food, forage and petrol were loaded 20 miles from the front lines, and were successfully delivered and distributed under the cover of darkness, to each unit in the field, so that men and horses were fed, vehicles were replenished, and the forces were ready at dawn to restart their operations.</P>
    <P>The air corps continues to render any service which civil aviation may call for.  It provides landing and accommodation facilities not only for the Irish Aero Club, but for any visiting aircraft.  Repairs were carried out, but care is taken to ensure that such repairs cannot be done elsewhere by local commercial firms.  Sites for proposed aerodromes or landing sites are inspected for the purpose of seeing that international requirements are complied with: applicants for commercial or private flying certificates are examined: aircraft are inspected for the purpose of registration and the renewal of certificates of airworthiness: and regulations are <Col N="1647" /> now being drawn up concerning the conditions which should govern the airworthiness of aircraft generally.</P>
    <P>Finally, the equitation team continues to renew its previous successes. During the past year it participated at horse shows held in Nice, Rome, Brussels, Lucerne, Chicago, New York, Toronto and Berlin.  The cost to the State of seven of these shows&mdash;the figures for Berlin are not yet available&mdash;is approximately £2,199, but this was offset by prize money amounting to £717, so that the net cost to the State was only £1,482.  The prize money represented 9 first places, 11 seconds, 12 thirds, 8 fourths, 4 fifths, and 12 other placings. The primary purpose of the equitation team attending these shows is to advertise the Irish hunter and the Irish horse breeding industry generally, but the team also serves other national purposes.  Their contact with foreign officers engenders a spirit of comradeship between armies; their sportsmanship in friendly rivalry excites feelings of admiration and goodwill in the countries they are visiting, and their victories in crowded arenas demonstrate to the ordinary citizens of foreign lands better than any diplomatic missions the fact of this country's distinct nationhood and sovereignty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join with the Minister in the tribute he paid to the splendid quality of the men in the Army.  That was my experience while Minister for Defence, and, from what I have been able to learn about it, that still is the character of the Army.  I was glad to hear the Minister confirm that and pay a tribute to this splendid body of men.  I rather regretted to see that the Minister has estimated at the present strength of the Army in certain directions.  He even calculated, for instance, on a decrease in the reserve.  I should think it is rather unwise to go on that line because it is possible that the new Volunteer force may not materialise exactly as he expects it.  I think it would be a pity if that should happen, but one should <Col N="1648" /> just as well recognise the possibility of it.</P>
      <P>With regard to the B reserve, I should mention that they are drawn from all over the country.  They come into the Army for just three months and after that they are passed on to the reserve.  It is a pity that the Minister should definitely budget now for their disappearance.  He also seems to calculate on a more or less stationary position with regard to the O.T.C.  He may be quite right there. It may be that from his knowledge of the educational institution from which the O.T.C. comes he is satisfied that the highest point is now reached.  At the same time it is to be hoped that the authorities will do all they can to encourage young men in these educational institutions to come in their strength into the O.T.C.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be rather hard to follow exactly the figures as the Minister read them out.  He mentioned that there were 600 new enlistments during last year, which is quite gratifying, but there is one point to which I wish to draw the Minister's attention&mdash;it is this: it must be recognised that in the case of the man who has been in the Army for ten years, that Army work has actually become his normal mode of living.  But the Minister referred to the time expiry as automatic&mdash;that when a man's time expired he should go automatically into the reserve.  I do not think that that necessarily follows.  No doubt it frequently must follow that he goes out into the reserve when his time has expired. At the same time, the Government has to consider what is just and they have to consider that when a man has been reattested over a period of years, say for eight or ten years, he has automatically mapped out his life in the Army service, that the man has been in the habit of thinking of himself as spending his life as a member of the Army.  Though the Government or the Minister has the power arbitrarily when the time has expired to enforce the expiry, yet to send out such a man at the same time is a thing in which I think the Minister would agree there are questions of justice involved.  When considering the case <Col N="1649" /> of the man who has been for a long time in the Army, then as between that man and another there is a <i>prima facie</i> case for his being retained.</P>
    <P>I think that the Minister announced that an Army Pensions Bill is coming on shortly.  I think I am correct in that.  I do not want to anticipate what is to be contained in that Bill, but actually before I left the Army a draft, possibly requiring amendment, was in existence.  If I remember rightly that draft did visualise that the men who spent almost 20 years in the Army or something less than 20 years would be eligible for a pension. That is long overdue.  It would be possible for the Minister to arrange that anybody who has been in the Army for a long time should go out, and thus no pension could accrue.  I think if that Pension Bill is coming in, consideration should be given to men who have gone half-way towards qualifying for a pension.  There would be a decided element of injustice in arbitrarily closing their careers in the Army and driving them out into the world to find a living anyway they could whereas if they were allowed to stay in the Army there would be a regular career for them.  The Government has recognised that anybody who gives service should have a pension.</P>
    <P>With regard to the new Volunteers the Minister said that his policy with regard to them was outlined on a previous occasion.  That is true.  I do not remember everything the Minister said on that occasion.  But he said that one of the most worthy and deserving objects one could have in mind was the bringing together of men who had been comrades at different periods but who had taken different sides afterwards.  He said he wished to see that brought about and used this as an instrument to bring them together again.  I assume that the Minister referred to 1922 when the men were on two different sides.  One would assume that none of them would have been under the age of 18 which would now mean that all of them would be over 30 years of age which would seem to indicate that the real recruitment, as far as that end in view is concerned, <Col N="1650" /> should be for people of not less than 30 years of age&mdash;say, between 30 and 40&mdash;and that that would be more or less the major portion of it.  I do not mean that that can be assumed to apply to any of the younger recruits. As far as they are concerned, the object of the Volunteers is quite a different matter.  Just a short time ago the Vice-President made what, with all due respect, I would suggest was rather a foolish speech, to the effect that if guns were necessary with regard to our fellow-countrymen belonging to the Six Counties there was the Volunteer Reserve behind the National Army. I have no doubt that the President, and probably the Vice-President himself, regretted that statement as soon as it was made, but I think it was unfortunate to suggest that this body was being recruited for the purpose of aggressive, or possibly aggressive, action against the people of the North.  There is one point which I do not suppose anybody is interested in, except perhaps myself, but I do think that it is about time the Government adverted to it&mdash;it does not seem important&mdash;and that is the official name for the National Army in Irish. It takes two forms, that of Oglaigh na hEireann and Fianna Fáil.  Those are the Irish names of the Army.  When an officer of the Army is writing on behalf of the Army he writes on paper headed &ldquo;Oglaigh na hEireann&rdquo; and he may sign himself adjutant-general, chief of staff, or quartermaster-general, according to the position he holds.  The Government permits another body, a seditious and illegal body, to call itself Oglaigh na hEireann, which is a name legally applying only to the National Army. When a letter is sent out by the body to which I refer, a letter very often of a seditious or criminal nature, headed &ldquo;Oglaigh na hEireann&rdquo; and signed adjutant-general, or O.C. Dublin, or something like that. it is a libel on the Army.</P>
    <P>In the same way, the words &ldquo;Fianna Fáil&rdquo; are an Irish equivalent of National Army.  The Army transport goes about, and soldiers have on <Col N="1651" /> their badges the letters F.F., standing for Fianna Fáil.  With the National Army in existence, any body calling itself Fianna Fáil is clearly acting, if not in a seditious, at least in an illegal, way.  In all friendship, I suggest that the Government Party might, on some suitable occasion, take the opportunity of changing the name of their Party. They could do so without changing their policy.  It actually is illegal, if not seditious.  With regard to the other body, I have seen letters&mdash; threatening letters and seditious letters&mdash;with Oglaigh na hEireann printed on them and signed adjutant-general and so on, and really one has had to look at such documents to see if any particular address was given, because the other body carefully did not put any specific address, but just put &ldquo;Dublin&rdquo; on the documents. When one saw that there was no address, such as Parkgate Street or whatever it might be, one knew that it emanated from a criminal organisation. At present the Government has permitted this body to go about calling itself that, and when a man does so and signs himself adjutant-general on such a document he is signing the name of a definite high officer in the National Army.  Usually the letters are of such a nature that, to attribute them to an officer of the National Army, is decidedly libellous.</P>
    <P>I am not going to crow over the Minister, who so often objected to the cost of the Army by pointing out that it is costing more now than it did when he protested against its cost in my time. I regret that the cost of it is going up.  At the same time, I am quite satisfied myself that as far as reduction and economy were concerned, I did all the work that need be done, and to carry it on further would be definitely harmful.  I notice, however, that there have been a number of promotions, judging from the figures here, and promotion is a matter where, with the best will in the world, injustice is often done.  I think that some time ago&mdash;it may have been last year&mdash; Deputy O'Higgins asked certain questions about the medical service.  It looks as though there have been certain <Col N="1652" /> promotious there and that captains are costing more than they did last year although other ranks are costing just the same.  Now, the increase in the cost of captains could be brought about in two ways, either the lower commissioned ranks had been promoted to be captains or there were additions.  I have heard that completely new men have been taken into the medical service since the Minister took charge.</P>
    <P>As far as I remember, Deputy O'Higgins asked questions about that, and the Minister said that they had been recruited in exactly the same way as had previously been done.  The Minister said&mdash;he can correct me, if I am wrong, because I am not saying that I am quite right&mdash;that there were no appointments in that service from about 1924.  As far as my memory goes, in the early stages there was a sort of advisory board to advise the Army in the selection of qualified medical doctors and that at a later stage, say, about 1924&mdash;I am speaking subject to correction by the Minister &mdash;the deans of the medical faculties of the various diploma-giving bodies in Dublin were communicated with when anybody was wanted for this service and their advice taken.  From what I understand, when the Minister took charge men were brought over here from England.  I did hear that one man was commissioned for a day or two and then went out, presumably because the Government were going to bring in a Pensions Bill and it would look bad for him to claim a pension as being disabled&mdash;the Minister will correct me on this&mdash;but that he had already been taken into the Army as a man able to carry on in the medical service.</P>
    <P>I have referred on other occasions to the bringing into the Army and the commissioning of 20 men from Australia and other places.  I do not want to question that policy, but I want to point out again to the Minister that my objection to that chiefly is that it is an injustice to the men already in the Army.  Every man, who is a lieutenant, or second-lientenant, has the right to expect, provided that he does his work properly, <Col N="1653" /> that when vacancies occur it will mean promotion for him.  If you bring men in arbitrarily and place them in some rank of the hierarchical scale of the Army, it is an injustice to the men in the lower ranks.  There are men in the lower ranks of the Army who have given completely satisfactory service for the last ten or 12 years and who have not been promoted for one reason only, and that was that from the very nature of the way the Army came into existence there was not the natural flow of promotion up through the Army because there was not that more or less average distance in age between the various ranks that would normally exist.  To bring in men and place them over those men with that long service is a definite injustice. A minor matter arises on that.  As far as I noticed in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> when these men were taken in they were commissioned as captains.  I think it was an understood thing, or a general order in the Army when I was there, that if anybody were being commissioned, no matter what one might intend to make him, he was only commissioned as a second-lieutenant.  He could be made a second-lieutenant and then promoted to be a colonel or a general the next day, if the Minister desired.  The advantage of what I think should have been done is this: if you commission a man with a high rank in the Army it is not possible to demote him.  If it became necessary, if you felt that there was redundancy in the higher ranks, or that he deserved some punishment, not to the extent of being dismissed from the Army, but in the nature of demotion, then it could be done provided his commission was as second-lieutenant, which does not prevent promotion. I think it is a decided mistake and a bad rule in the Army if men coming in are to be commissioned with a high rank, which is quite unnecessary.</P>
    <P>With regard to the cadets, I think the Minister made provision for 13.  He referred to the limitation of the number of entrants.  The number of entrants may be limited merely by the fact that only a certain number may present <Col N="1654" /> themselves for examination or only a certain number may pass.  On the other hand, he seemed to imply that the limitation came from above, namely from the Minister.  I hope that is not to be the case.  I hope the Army will continue annually to take in cadets.  In saying that, I am not in any way proposing that there should not be promotion from the ranks.  The Minister suggested, I think that as he had drawn up the Estimate it was possible to have five or six men from the ranks promoted to officer standing. That, I think, is a very desirable thing. If a man gives good service, shows proper qualifications and ability, and is in every way suitable to be made an officer, that should be recognised in him and he should have, at any rate, an opportunity of becoming an officer. At the same time, I think that if we are to keep recognising that the Army is not a thing for one generation only, but that it must keep on taking in from outside each year, the Minister should see that a certain number of young men are given the opportunity of becoming cadets, of passing the examination, and, during the two years' training, passing the examination at the end of each year, and then becoming officers in the Army.  Most of the officers, I admit, are rather on the young side, especially the senior officers.  At the same time, the Army has been in existence for 12 years and there was fighting long before that. Young men of 18 coming along should be taken into the Army, so that in ten, 20 or 25 years' time they will have had every opportunity of studying the soldier craft and the officer science and will be able to run a really regular Army for us.</P>
    <P>I should have liked to have compared the Estimate of this year with the actual figures of recent years, but I have not got them with me.  The figure given here is £1,476,731.  That is roughly, I think, about £300,000 more than before the Minister came in.  I think that that is a very large increase in the cost of the Army.  £300,000 at present is a very serious matter.  I know, of course, that each year that goes by there is naturally a normal increase in salaries for length of service <Col N="1655" /> and so on, but I think that actually this increased cost is due to the fact that the Minister has branched off into this new Volunteer body.  I should like to have heard more about the way he proposes to administer this. There is no doubt that it is very difficult to get proper discipline and proper order in an Army which is scattered in small bodies all over the country.  I think that the business of having a civilian committee more or less in charge is a thoroughly wrong proposal. The Minister said on one occasion that the officers in charge are going to be part of the Army and going to be subject to the ordinary hierarchical order of the Army.</P>
    <P>It seems to me an extraordinary situation in which you will have in any given town a body of Volunteers and you will have an officer there and a civilian committee.  It seems to me that if the Army is going to be run as an Army it should go through the Minister, the Chief of Staff and G.H.Q. straight down to the officer.  Those civilian committees, although they might work quite well at the beginning, are ultimately only going to be a nuisance to the Army and to the Minister himself.  I can understand that he might want them in the beginning as a sort of recruiting committee, but I hope that once the men are recruited those civilian committees will cease to have any function; that when the men are recruited the Army will control them.  The civilian committees must almost inevitably, with the best will in the world, only make themselves a nuisance, trying to get things to go the way they want them rather than the way the Army with a full knowledge of its needs wants them to go.  I think the committees will be only a nuisance, and I should like to hear that they are only to cover the recruiting period.  I had an idea that the original number of those Volunteers was to be about 15,000.  The Minister spoke in the special allowance business of 20,000.  I see the figure here for these recruiting fees is £11,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Vote on which it is very difficult to speak.  It is a Vote for raising and maintaining an Army in the Free State.  The Minister for Defence, as Commander-in-Chief of the Army is responsible, of course, for everything in the matter of administration and so forth.  I regret, Sir, that during the discussion the Minister was supported by only one member of his Party, and that was a woman.  I noticed that a pacifist came in later.  We should really get some statement as to what is the Government policy with regard to defence, and, if I may say so, offence, in this country.  Putting it plainly, what is the Army for?  It does give concern to more than the two members of the Minister's Party who are here tonight. It gives concern to persons outside who heard the wild statements such as that referred to by Deputy Fitzgerald.  Sitting here and having had experience of the heat which is sometimes introduced into debates, and the way in which it all dissolves into cold air sometimes, we may not take those remarks so seriously, but I think everybody in this House and outside it will agree with me that a remark made by a responsible Minister of the Government and one with long experience in political affairs in this and other countries&mdash;a remark such as that referred to by Deputy Fitzgerald&mdash;is one which will have repercussions, not only within the <Col N="1657" /> Free State itself, but from one end of Ireland to another.  It is a matter of common knowledge that next morning an order was issued by the Government of Northern Ireland saying that he would not be allowed to enter there.  I think that that was a case of the Vice-President putting himself, putting his Government, and putting this State into the position of being insulted by the Government of the Six-County area.  Those matters and other things which have happened are matters to which I shall refer on the figures in the Estimate itself, because people are perturbed as to what is the intention of the Minister for Defence, and of course, of the Government itself, with regard to the Army.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald has referred to several matters to which I do not want again to call the attention of the House, but I should like to go through a few of those figures, and draw the attention of the House to the particular sections and sub-sections in which there is an increase.  I take it that it will be all more or less covered and is all explicable by the fact that this new force called the Volunteers is being established.  I think that the Government must give to the House, and must give to the country, some more satisfactory explanation as to the necessity for those gunmen who never broke out should not be interrupting in the House&mdash;and secondly, as to the efficiency or otherwise of such an organisation.  Nobody will object to the expenditure of money on physical training and on training, if necessary, in the use of arms, although God and the country know that we have had too much knowledge of arms in this country during the last ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first increase is that of £24,127 for provisions and allowances in lieu.  I take it that that increase arises also from the establishment of this new force.  The second I see is an increase for clothing and equipment of £73,862.  In war-like stores there is an increase of £49,508.  In incidental expenses there is an increase of £7,545.  That is Sub-head X, and is particularly interesting when an examination is made of what <Col N="1658" /> is called &ldquo;Incidental Expenses.&rdquo;  The other increase to which I desire to refer is in Sub-head AA, Expenses in connection with the Constitution Amendment (No. 17) Act, 1931, which shows an increase of £3,200.  This is in the year of grace 1934, when the Government have been over two years in power, after giving a promise of peace, prosperity, good-will and a general Garden of Eden throughout the land.</P>
    <P>We should like to hear from the Minister an explanation&mdash;at least I am not sure whether or not he explained already&mdash;of the increase in the number of short-term recruits and re-entries, and whether that also covers the new force.  I see that for the year 1933-34 the number was 900 and that for 1934-5 it is increased to 12,300, the expenditure increasing from £5,940 to £27,960. Under Sub-head P, I see the most important increase is in ammunition. There is an increase from £54,872 to £104,380 under the sub-head, the greatest increase, as I have said, being in ammunition &mdash; from £20,400 to £58,365.</P>
    <P>I referred to Incidental Expenses, and I observe that the greatest increase in that is in the second-last item, where something called &ldquo;the hire of halls&rdquo; is increased from £300, which was the provision in the Supplementary Estimate, to £7,500.  I want to refer finally to Y.3&mdash;Volunteer Force, Enlistment and Training Grants (Grants-in-Aid).  I think the Minister should explain more fully to the House what this particular money is, and how it is to be expended.  It says: &ldquo;Provision required to enable Capitation Grants of 5/- for each 1st and 2nd line Volunteer who is finally approved and 7/6 for each 1st and 2nd line Volunteer who has performed certain prescribed training, to be made to Area Funds to be established under Regulations and to be administered by Area Administrative Officers for such purposes and in such manner as are defined in Regulations by the Minister for Defence.&rdquo;  The regulations, I take it, have not yet been published.  The two matters which I want to refer to in connection with those two expenses are, first of all, the expenditure on <Col N="1659" /> halls, and secondly, expenditure on what is called Grants-in-Aid to local committees.  I had the advantage of having a short holiday in the precincts of the village where the President of the Executive Council spoke last week.  The Government paper was covered over with expressions of delight at the huge concourse.  I do not know whether the Minister, his Government, or his very few back benchers realise that the general conversation through the country is: &ldquo;Oh, why would they not get a big meeting, are they not giving away thousands of pounds to keep up halls for their own Party all over the country and calling them soldiers' halls?&rdquo;  I am telling the Minister what is said throughout the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GearoidOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take your word for that, Sir.  As a matter of fact it does not matter what the Minister said as far as my veracity or otherwise is concerned.  Returning to the huge expenditure on this new force or the necessity for or the efficiency of it, this is giving some thought and worry to the country.  In the very praiseworthy expressions used by the Minister in connection with the Army and its work during the last year, I am sure every Party in the House, as well as the people outside, will join. We are very pleased to hear it.  The more the Minister praises the old Army, the Old Contemptibles so to speak, the more one is worried about what will happen to the defence forces, and to the defence of Ireland generally, in view of this new departure. He told us what an excellent standard was shown during the 14 days' training.  I should like to remind the Minister that the best way of preserving that very high standard is to ensure, as Commander-in-Chief and as Minister, that as far as honesty and straightforwardness go, every facility will be afforded to every officer, N.C.O. and man in the matter of promotion by service.  Some of us <Col N="1661" /> read of the man in the Scriptures who was brought in at the eleventh hour and got the same treatment as those who had worked all the day.  The Minister is now bringing in persons in the eleventh year and he is not giving them the same status as those who were in for the previous 11 years. He is promoting them over those who have been there for 11 years.  It is really a matter of importance that young officers&mdash;second lieutenants or first lieutenants&mdash;should feel that they have settled down to a career in life, that at some time there will be promotion for them, after 11 years, or possibly less.  It is regrettable and it must be a cause of disturbance and chagrin to these young men to find persons brought in&mdash;it does not matter what their political opinions are&mdash;and placed in a position superior to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to have a contradiction from the Minister as to whether these persons were not recruited to the Army Medical Corps, but were commissioned with the rank of captain, and made senior to a number of other officers who have been waiting for promotion since 1923 or 1924.  Before I left the Army a special examination took place and officers in the Medical Corps&mdash;qualified doctors&mdash;were placed in a regular list from one down to 19 or 20, when a line was drawn and all below that line were asked to retire. The others were kept on and promoted according to the position they found themselves in after the examination. It is quite possible that only one or two doctors have been promoted to vacancies since 1924.  There is a number of officers with the rank of lieutenant or second-lieutenant.  I would like the Minister to realise that in the Army more than in any other service, and in a special service in the Army more than amongst the rank and file, efficiency and honest service is expected.  Efficiency, honesty, thoroughness and satisfaction with one's lot can only be assured when persons holding a rank have the feeling that they will get promotion when someone else goes out, and that they will get it because they deserve it. There is a feeling generally running through some of the special services in <Col N="1662" /> the Army, and even in the regular infantry, that it is more important for the junior officer to be a friend of the man up at the top than to have a good record for efficiency, or to be able to pass all tests from the day he entered, whether it was 11 years or one year ago.  The other sub-section of the Vote to which I want to refer is A.A.&mdash; Expenses in connection with the Constitution (Amendment) Act, 1931.  In the year 1933-34, £2,800 was spent under this sub-head, and this year the sum which it is proposed to expend is £6,000, an increase of £2,300.  I should like to know, in the first place, whether the Minister expects that, as a result of Government policy or for some other reason, there will be a recrudescence of crime and a necessary invocation of the powers of that Act during the present year.  I should like to know also whether the Minister for Defence or the Minister for Education is responsible for the payment of the lecturer in education of the persons arrested and kept in Arbour Hill barracks&mdash;the lecturer who, as the Minister probably knows, described certain estimable citizens of this State, now dead, in most dastardly words.</P>
    <P>In proposing this increase of £2,300, the Minister and his Cabinet have the satisfaction of knowing that every penny, so far as they can ensure it, will be used not legally to punish but illegally to punish men who are of opposite political opinions to themselves; that they will use it as mercilessly as they can, first, last and all the time, simply because these people are their political opponents.  This, taken in conjunction with what Deputy Fitzgerald has referred to, taken in conjunction with the talking and crowing of the Vice-President about taking a gun to the North, this increase in the numbers of men trained militarily, this increase in each detail of war-like stores must be regarded seriously by the country. These are matters for which the people on the opposite benches will very soon have to answer to the electors of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in asking the House to consent to a Vote of <Col N="1663" /> about £1,500,000 for Army purposes, is asking for what he described on the 22nd May, 1930, as &ldquo;a huge sum.&rdquo; Having just listened to soldiers and ex-soldiers speaking on this Vote, I am tempted to ask if the Minister has at all considered the capacity of the country to bear this burden.  On all sides we hear cries and tales of distress.  We have a reduced revenue, and increased expenditure.  We have embarked on a policy of what I can only designate as &ldquo;crazy economics.&rdquo;  Yet, we have the Minister asking for this huge sum of money for the purpose not only of maintaining the regular Army but of maintaining a new Volunteer force&mdash;a proposal which I opposed when it came before the House in its First or Second Stage.</P>
      <P>There are one or two matters on which I should like to be satisfied and upon which I feel many citizens would like to be satisfied.  We should like to know something further about the purpose for which this new force has been established.  The Minister, in the course of his statement, mentioned something about the equitation school and the officers and men who are engaging with other nations in friendly rivalry.  This is one of the few items in this huge Estimate with which I find myself in agreement, because it has done more than all your military displays and all your pageantry of arms to advertise the resources of this country in horseflesh.  We always boasted that we could breed good horses, but we are forced to ask ourselves, if we have thrown away the market for our horses in the same way as we have cut out the market for many other things produced on the farm, that that money will be spent to the best advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good deal of doubt exists in the minds of ordinary citizens as to the objects for which this new army has been established.  We had a speech during the past couple of weeks&mdash;a most bellicose speech&mdash;from a responsible Minister.  That speech has been adverted to in the course of this debate.  In reading it, I wondered whether I was reading the speech of a generalissimo of the Mexican Army or whether I was reading the words of that <Col N="1664" /> gentle soul, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, Deputy Seán T. O'Kelly.  I never thought that Deputy O'Kelly, who occupies such a responsible position, was such a war-like and bellicose gentleman.  He has succeeded in antagonising the persons with whom he and his Party professed to be endeavouring to unite.  All Parties in the State proclaimed, when facing the electors, that one of their great objects was to reunite with the North, that the present division was an unnatural division and all of us subscribed to that.  We are told that the North must come in some time.  I believe that the North will never come in&mdash;why should they?&mdash;if bellicose speeches of this kind represent the mind of the Minister.  We have a new army.  For what purpose?  Is it to march on the North?  Is it to march on Great Britain?  Is it to march on the United States?  Perhaps a quarrel might be provoked with some of the eastern nations in order to show our wonderful military progress.  Listening to the speech of the Minister this afternoon, one would think that this country was rich in all kinds of resources and that, instead of a revenue of £30,000,000, our revenue ran into billions.  There is a certain school of thought in this country, as in other countries, which subscribes to the principles laid down by the League of Nations, providing for the scrapping of munitions of war and the cultivation of the arts of peace.  We, in this country, have subscribed to that doctrine all along and now not alone are we making an addition to the plant which comes under the heading of &ldquo;warlike stores&rdquo; but we are establishing a new army.  Again I ask, for what purpose?  We are told that it is for the defence of the country.  If I thought that there was any danger to the country from a foreign invader, I should agree with that but I think that the people have got enough and to spare of the use of arms.  If this army is to be used against men who have given loyalty to the Free State since its establishment, if it is to be used against men who established that State, let us be told and we shall then know where we are.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1665" /> In that connection I would like to know from the Minister if it is a fact that for some time past a number of officers, known as the &ldquo;hunting squad,&rdquo; have been interviewing soldiers, non-commissioned officers and men at the Curragh and elsewhere as to their activities during a certain period of the history of this country. Amongst the questions put is one to this effect: &ldquo;Have you had any British service?&rdquo;  Those who have been ex-British soldiers and served in the National Army from 1922, 1923 or 1924 have got their marching papers. That goes to show that these men, on account of whose activities and loyal service to established government we are sitting here, have got their marching papers.  This Parliament functioned because of the work of good statesmen and loyal soldiers who defended the State.  Now because of their activities over that period they are handicapped and in other ways victimised.  It is now a crime if an Irishman had served during the European War.  Our present National Army must no longer have men in it who had previous service in the British Army.  We are told about the friendly rivalry that exists at different times in various parts of the world where our mounted officers take part in contests.  We all take pride in the victories achieved by our equitation officers.  When the Minister speaks of friendly rivalry can that be said to describe the kind of rivalry that the Minister is setting up in the establishment of this new army?  Is it for the purpose of friendly rivalry or for the purpose of something that I could call by a different name?  For instance, is it for the purpose of turning their guns on peaceful and law-abiding citizens because they helped to build up this State that he is creating this army?</P>
    <P>There are one or two matters that I would like the Minister to take into consideration.  I would not mind if one-half of this Vote, although it is a huge sum of money, were devoted to provident purposes such as making some kind of provision for the ex-soldier in the National Army who completes his time and leaves the Army.  What is the position of a man of that kind?  Such a man leaves <Col N="1666" /> the service and enrols in the reserve. He is called up annually and receives a relatively small sum of money.  But in 99 cases out of 100 he joins the ranks of the unemployed.  Whatever little sum he had leaving the Army is soon exhausted, particularly in the case of married men or men with dependants.  I said if one-half of that was devoted to making some provision by way of a small pension or gratuity for men who leave the Army, it would be a good thing.  Everyone knows that a man who served ten or 15 years in the Army finds it very difficult to get work in civilian life unless he has some trade.  Young men after eight or ten years in the Army will be turned adrift with little or no prospect of getting work.  I put it seriously to the Minister apart from partisanship or Party politics that this is far more important&mdash; looking after and making provision for soldiers when they leave the Army &mdash;than adding to our guns and warlike equipment.</P>
    <P>I have personal knowledge of, and personal contact with many of those unfortunate wretches who have completed their service in the Army and registered at the labour exchanges. I make this charge very definitely&mdash;and I do not make charges unless I have the proof-that from the advent of this Government to power discrimination has been exercised against men because they were ex-National Army men.  I ask the Minister to consider seriously the necessity for making some provision out of the money voted here for soldiers, non-commissioned officers and officers, after leaving the service.  I could give the Minister several instances of the exercise of the discrimination I have referred to.  I would like if the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance, would indicate in the proper quarter that it is not the policy of the Government to discriminate against these men.</P>
    <P>There are many items in the Vote to which exception could be easily taken.  While I would like to criticise some of those items, most of the money has already been allocated <Col N="1667" /> and spent.  In addition to that it is the declared policy of the Government to increase these armaments.  Again I say the more you spend upon war-like stores the less there will be to spend upon unemployment assistance and so forth.  I feel that the citizens of this State are going to get a very great shock before this session is through when they will find that the Estimates of 30 millions of expenditure will have been increased by another six or seven millions.  In this State of 26 counties does it not appear to the Minister that this is an extraordinary sum to spend upon an army that would not be able to stand up any longer than the Belgain Army did in the Great War, even in a country suited as this is to guerilla warfare? I ask the Minister to consider these matters.  This money of the people is going to be spent upon armies and war-like stores.  Surely in this State of 26 counties, not so rich in mineral resources or any resources except agriculture, it is time to cry off this crushing expenditure of money. I fear there will be a financial collapse in this country.  We have been informed that we must all reduce our standard of living and come down to the hair shirt.  If anything is going to bring us down to the hair shirt I think it is the Minister's policy of the military tunic.  I will not vote against this measure because I believe it must be passed but I suggest to the Minister that he could reduce it by one-half and still have an army sufficient for this State, fit for all ceremonial purposes, fit for receiving distinguished visitors with all the necessary paraphernalia and equipped to assist the police force in the event of serious civil disturbance if, which God forfend, such necessity should ever, arise in this country again.</P>
    <P>Between new armies and new police forces, all these things involve a huge expenditure to the State, a huge expenditure from the unfortunate working classes of the country, a huge expenditure from persons who would otherwise put money into industry, a huge expenditure calculated to deter people outside the Free State as well as inside it from putting money into industry.</P>

      <P>Two years ago, the Minister promised the House that he would carry out a scheme which was then in preparation to enable members of the O.T.C. to acquire technical training in certain branches of the defence forces, particularly with reference to aviation.  The Minister promised that he would carry out that scheme, and on two subsequent occasions in this House in the last two years he reiterated his undertaking.  I regret that that promise has not been carried out.  As far as I know, no steps have been taken to enable members of the O.T.C. to acquire efficiency, at any rate in the aviation branch.  I do not know whether the Minister has definitely turned down the scheme, but certainly if so, he should have made an announcement to that effect because it has caused very considerable disappointment. Some years ago the Minister for Finance assured the House that after careful consideration and study, the Party which is now in power had come to the conclusion that the defence of the State could be carried on for £750,000.  That was some years ago. The Minister has been in power for two years, but he has not yet decided to carry out the decision arrived at by his Party at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We see in this Vote certain sums involving a large increase.  There are also sums in other Votes which are incidental to the Government policy with regard to increasing the Army. We have a large sum in the Vote for Public Works which does not appear here and which is not under discussion to-day.  There are other items in other Votes which would add considerably to the amount of the increase of which we are asked to approve.  As other Deputies have pointed out, the Minister refused during his opening remarks to give any inkling as to what was the Government's policy with regard to national defence.  The Minister is obviously funking his duty as Minister for Defence.  He is obviously funking the duty of facing up to the problem presented by the continued defence of our coasts by the British forces.  The Treaty to a considerable extent has lapsed.  It has been broken in many directions.  The items in the Treaty dealing with the <Col N="1669" /> coastal defence of this country, in my opinion, are no longer operative.  They have ceased to be operative because they have not been carried out.  The Minister is very careful to avoid tackling the problem of the Treaty ports. Ministers may be very bellicose and patriotic in their statements to ignorant people in the country, but when it comes to dealing with the really vital matters affecting our national defence they run away.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not prepared to face the question of the Treaty ports.  He is not prepared to face the question of taking over control of our coastal defence.  When we look at the large amount of money which is being spent on establishing this political army of territorials or whatever you may call them&mdash;in Wexford they were known a century ago as yeomen&mdash;we realise the amount of good which could be done in the way of national defence if this money were properly spent.  A sum of £300,000, say after five years or so, would give us a small navy of submarines, but that is being wasted in village halls.  It would also provide us with some efficient coastal defence air squadrons, whether they be land machines or flying boats, does not matter.  Certainly we could have a reasonable attempt at coastal defence with the money which we are squandering on this political Army.  I myself am in favour of the establishment of an Irish Navy, even if it starts from very humble beginnings.  Money spent in that way would certainly be better spent than in the manner in which it is proposed to be spent by the Government.  The Minister, as I say, is not prepared to face the main issue of national defence.  He is asking us to waste the people's money on a political Army, which cannot under any circumstances be considered capable of undertaking the duty of the defence of the coasts of this country.  For that reason, I do not see why the Estimate should be passed.</P>

      <P>Some years prior to the Fianna Fáil Party getting into power they occasionally published in the newspapers and on the dead walls <Col N="1670" /> particulars regarding the Governor-General's salary.  In that connection, they exhausted not alone the Vote under the heading of the Governor-General and his establishment, but they went further and added to it various items which are usually published either at the end of the first list of sums of money which it is proposed to vote, or at the end of the Estimate.  Following on their example in that case, and taking this instance, this Vote, if it were published on the dead walls of the country from one end to the other, would mean a total expenditure of £1,923,897, to be found on page 298 of the Estimates.  I suppose if that were to be published as the cost of the Army in this particular case, we would be accused of misleading the public, but it is there in black and white, and that is the amount some of the taxpayers of this country, if not all, will have to contribute. The cost has gone up on that of the previous year.  As Deputy Anthony has pointed out, our wealth has not increased proportionately to the increase shown in this Estimate.  The resources of the country are not superior to what they were 12 months ago.  If you take only the figure which the Minister asked for in the Vote it is something like £200,000 over last year.</P>
      <P>One of the first things that anyone would have to consider in a case of this sort is: can we afford it?  The view of the Government and of its supporters up to the time that they came into office was that we could not afford what we were then spending. They said it was too much; that it was beyond our resources; that it was unnecessary, and so on.  Now some case should be made for the increase in the expenditure under this Vote: some case other than what has been made up to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not remember the exact words which were used by the President of the Executive Council when he went to Geneva some two years ago, but my recollection is that they ran in this way: that the League of Nations had been meeting year after year, that pious expressions of opinion about peace were being heard on all sides but <Col N="1671" /> that no great effort had been made towards bringing about that peace: that one might draw the inference that the continued production of armaments, the massing of troops and the efficiency of the various armies on the Continent were all against peace. Now, we cannot go to Geneva and preach peace and come home and prepare for war.</P>

      <P>And people would be led to believe from the President's speech that we were hypocrites on the Continent.  That was what they said. Are we to have continental hypocrisy imported into this country?  Three questions arise in connection with this Vote.  The first is: what are the resources in this country equal to in the matter of defence; secondly, can we afford this; and thirdly, are these the best means to adopt?  This scheme, according to the Minister, will give us a considerable number of troops at a given moment.  On the question of efficiency in the field, there is one notable instance on record which occurred 32 years ago.  An army of some 50,000 or 60,000 men kept at bay for some years an army of 400,000 men. I think there were practically 400,000 troops sent into the Transvaal, and for two years 50,000 efficient troops, properly handled, were in a position to keep that big force at bay for practically that length of time.  This is a huge army that is proposed here. What about its efficiency or what is the scheme that is behind it?  Who are the military experts who have advised on it?  We have been told nothing about that.  When one speaks about a reserve, one usually finds that reservists were formerly soldiers who had spent a considerable time in learning <Col N="1672" /> the work of soldiers, in being trained as troops, in being officered by men whose whole position in life is taken up in soldiering&mdash;by non-commissioned officers who have risen from the ranks, who have been accustomed to command men and know all about military manoeuvres and who were in a position to take the field at a moment's notice.  Here we are going to have a reserve without those in it having had previous training.  To my mind that is not good business.</P>
      <P>We would like to know who the military experts were who recommended this.  We have sent men, I believe, to the Continent, to America and to England.  Does that scheme represent their considered opinions? Is it their view that it is the best that can be given for the people's money and, mind you, there is a considerable amount of money involved in this&mdash;£200,000 over and above what we spent before.  If we can afford it, if the country is sufficiently prosperous to bear this additional burden of a couple of hundred thousand pounds, and if the circumstances are such that our defence needs the expenditure of so much money as this, then a case ought to be made for it. We are not living in a time when it is necessary to finesse.  The people own this country and the resources of it. It is from them that we are to get this money.  They are entitled to know, in the first place, what further need there is to strengthen the defences of this country, what dangers have got to be met, and what need there is for an extra army of something like 34,000 men, and if the resources of the country are in a position to meet such expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me take one item in this Estimate.  Under the heading of Appropriations-in-Aid, revenue from lands is estimated at £3,726 as against £4,250 for last year.  Are they the same lands and is the same area involved as last year?  If so, it must be plain that the receipts have gone down by 12½ per cent.  This is an estimate, I know I presume that the best face that could be put on it has been put on it.  The reduction there is one-eighth.  As the main wealth of this country is derived from the land, <Col N="1673" /> are we to take it that the Government measure of the reduction in receipts from land is to be put down at 12½ per cent. over a year?  If that is so, is there not a greater need still for an examination of this Estimate from the point of view of the people's capacity to bear this particular burden?  The main and the important items in connection with this business is: first, what is the need for the extra defence; secondly, are we capable of meeting the burden, and thirdly, is this the best method and is it backed by expert military advice?</P>
    <P>Taking some of the smaller items I would like to know from the Minister what is the present method of buying tea for the Army.  When I was Minister for Defence it was put up to me on one occasion that we should advertise for tea and take the lowest tender.  That is not good business, in my opinion.  If you want good quality tea you have got to pay for it.  The suggestion that I made was, I believe, acted upon at the time, namely that you should fix a price at which good tea would be available, then ask for samples at that price and take the best of them.  I do not know whether that system has been departed from or not.</P>
    <P>The second point is in connection with the equitation school and the sale of horses.  The Minister wants good horses.  They are in this country. They can be got here and trained here. My view about it is that if we get a sale for these horses in other countries we are, in effect, sending out an advertisement for Irish bred horses.  It may be that we will not win perhaps as many prizes.  I am not so much concerned with prizes as that the quality of Irish bred horses should be known all over the world.  I think it is a very great mistake to allow high-class bloodstock out of the country.  I believe we would have been more successful in some competitions if we had kept in the country some of the good bloodstock that was exported some years ago.</P>
    <P>I cannot say whether the provision which is made for the feeding of horses is for the same number of horses as last year.  On page 304 the <Col N="1674" /> feeding is estimated to cost £6,182 this year as against £7,055 for last year.  If the number of horses be the same, the Minister can appraise in the same way the reduction in the cost of feeding as compared with last year. On the other hand, if the number be not the same, there is no point in it. I take it there is not the same number of horses.  The hiring of horses is down by £2,000 for the month and that probably accounts for that.  The other point which has been referred to by some Deputies is in connection with the organisation of this new force and the commissioning of persons who had not got Army service and the giving to them of Army service equivalent to the service of men who have served over the whole period.  If the thing is done and cannot be remedied, there is an end of it.  If it were done simply to reward people, it ought to have been done in another way.</P>
    <P>It is not good business from the point of view of an institution like an army to grant arbitrarily or generously service which has not actually been given.  It is most upsetting and must be unsatisfactory to persons who have given actual service.  This is not one of the subjects which I like dealing with in this House.  The events of the last 10 or 12 years must be lived down some time or other.  I say, however, that it was not necessary to do things of that sort in the way in which they have been done.  In connection with administration it is very necessary in the case of this Government, as with us, to take such steps as not to give dissatisfaction to people who have given good service or give to persons outside an opportunity of using political power to obtain advantages to which their services do not entitle them.  Similarly, in connection with the way in which the new Army is supposed to be recruited, there is a tinge of political activity which it is not desirable to see in any country.  If that job has been done, it cannot be remedied, but it is not good administration to have a Ministry using its political supports throughout the country over a matter of this sort.  If they were denied help from other directions there would be an excuse, <Col N="1675" /> but they were not denied help.  They did not seek help to make up what should be a national army and not a sectional army and there is absolutely no excuse whatever for the way in which they have dealt with this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been very few points of any great worth made about the Estimate.  Deputy Cosgrave has asked a few questions which it might be as well to answer.  He asked what is the need for the Volunteers? The need for the Volunteers is that we want to secure that this country will have the most efficient and the most effective army that it can possibly afford.  No matter how much we all hope that there never will be war again, or that no one will attempt to interfere with our rights, we would be neglectful of our duty if we did not prepare to defend our rights if called upon to do so.  That, I take it, is the policy that the previous Government were acting upon when they organised and kept an army.  Deputy Cosgrave wants to know is this the most efficient way to do it.  My answer is that even the previous Government, or at least the Minister for Defence and the General Headquarters Staff then must have been convinced that it was, because they endeavoured to do exactly the same thing which we have succeeded in doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald said the Volunteers were a flop, or he used words to that effect; he indicated that the Volunteers may not have been a success. Deputy Fitzgerald endeavoured, when he was Minister for Defence, to organise Volunteers and he spent quite an amount of money on it.  He succeeded in getting about 300 over a period of years.  In two weeks after recruiting was opened we succeeded in getting 10,000 to come forward, and at the rate at which applications are coming in I have no doubt that within the next few weeks many more men will have offered their services than we can possibly accommodate.  We have a need for an efficient Army.  The best way to get peace is to be prepared for war.  That is my opinion.  When other countries show their guarantees that <Col N="1676" /> they are not going to go to war by reducing their armaments, it will be time for us to follow suit.  At the moment you have other countries increasing their expenditure on armaments. Since 1926 they have been doing that to the extent of something like 100 per cent.  It is well known to anybody who knows anything that the decrease in unemployment in England has been caused by the increase in armaments.  It is well know that the people employed recently in other European countries have been employed in consequence of the increased expenditure on armaments. I do not know if all this is going to mean a clash.  Anyway, we must be prepared to guarantee to our people that we will be in a position to defend our neutrality in case Europe goes to war.  That is the job of the Army.</P>
    <P>I believe that this country with its resources is able to afford an army that will secure it against external aggression, if it has the wisdom to utilise its resources in the proper manner. We are providing for an increase of £196,000 consequent upon our decision to organise the Volunteer force.  Practically every penny of that money will be spent within the country. Deputy Cosgrave and other Deputies will have perceived that, following upon our decision to secure uniform and equipment for the Volunteers, some factories that were on short time are working overtime supplying the material.  This money is not going out of the country.  It is circulated within the country and in that way it is not a national loss.  We have resources in food and other necessities of life to compensate men for working or fighting for us, and I think it is up to us to do it to the extent that is necessary.</P>
    <P>The efficiency of the Volunteers was questioned.  Deputy Cosgrave asked what was going to be the efficiency of the Volunteers.  My belief is that within a year or so the national defence forces here, taking the combination of the regular Army, the Volunteers and the reserve, will be as efficient defence forces as the Swiss army.  The Swiss army with a small population and a small country of about 3,000,000, just the same as ourselves, <Col N="1677" /> was able to guarantee the neutrality of Switzerland at a time when it would be greatly to the advantage of any of the contending Powers in Europe to go through that country in the Great War.  They were able to defend themselves in the centre of Europe, and I believe that with that combination of the regular Army, the reserve and the Volunteers, we will similarly be able to guarantee our neutrality.  Deputy Fitzgerald, speaking in relation to the Volunteers, said it was a bad thing to have sluagh committees and that the committees should be dropped as soon as the recruiting would be finished.  He does not seem to me to have grasped the functions of the sluagh committees. I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>When the adjournment was moved on the last day I was discussing the statement of Deputy Norton in support of his motion, and I was charging the members of the Labour Party with dragging before their supporters in the country a smoke screen&mdash;dragging a smoke screen of probable disorder across the position and across their particular responsibility for the position that Deputy Norton has discussed. I was asking them if the Labour Party were seriously interested in the proposals they were making and in the intention enshrined in the motion and would they make some <Col N="1678" /> attempt to get back to the principles which they themselves enshrined in their published policy issued under the names of Deputies Norton and Davin in a booklet called &ldquo;The Nation Organised,&rdquo; because it will require a return on the part of the Labour Party to some close proximity to these principles if they are going to help the workers to get employment, and particularly to get anything like security in any kind of employment that they say they require for them.</P>
      <P>There are certain things in the published Labour Party policy that I would particularly draw their attention to.  I ask them what are they going to do with reference to these proposals or what are they going to do that has any relationship to the principles enshrined in these proposals? Deputy Norton has issued a sample of the things that might be done&mdash;drainage, turf getting, water supply, the reconstruction of school buildings, sewerage schemes, land distribution, afforestation, further intensification of house building and slum clearance, cleaning of burial grounds, speeding of public works, cleaning of rivers and streams, improvement of Government buildings, widening of streets, rounding of corners, etc., all based upon moneys that the Deputy considers can be got on the credit and capital of the country.  I think in their innermost minds he and the members of the Labour Party must know that that is all oratory, mere talk, and that no amount of that talk and no amount of urging on the part of the Government to give work to the unemployed can give them work and provide along these lines as long as the present destructive policies are continued, policies that are destructive of credit and destructive of capital.  I call attention to paragraph 45 of their published policy, in which they say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We believe that a failure to improve the position of Free State produce in the British markets, relative to that of competing countries, would mean rapid retrogression, involving enormous loss, and all possible efforts should be made <Col N="1679" /> to place our goods at the head of the market.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The head of the British market! As part of their original policy they proposed a tax of 5/- a head on cattle exports so as to form a pool to ensure owners against loss due to expense and disease.  But even that small imposition on the cattle trade of the country for the purposes of benefiting through the Labour Party that export industry was withdrawn at the first annual conference the Party had because they found that it was unwise to interfere by any kind of interference with the export of cattle.  At any rate, the interference with the external market was, in their opinion, going to bring enormous loss to the country.  They believed that.  They knew it well and they have given reason for knowing it, because they had a market three times as big outside the country able to consume the produce we have been producing as the home market we had.  They believed even in co-operation with members of the British Commonwealth. They believed that an improved type of trade could be got by this co-operation.  In paragraph 121 they stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For instance, if the proposals now before the British public for a national grain board for the purchase of Britain's supply of Overseas wheat were to come into effect, we would try to become participants of the benefits of such a scheme in respect to the comparatively small tonnage of foreign wheat the Free State would require. On the other hand we would be willing to participate in a similar scheme made applicable to the sale on a national scale of our butter and eggs exports etc.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then in paragraph 122 they say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Seeing that the object of these proposals is to reduce the margin between what the producer receives and what the consumer pays, and to limit market fluctuations, considerable advantage would come to this country through inter-State co-operation of this nature.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In relation to the financial dispute <Col N="1680" /> between ourselves and Great Britain they say in paragraph 127:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Labour Party would insist upon securing for the Free State every advantage accruing from any international agreement to which this country is a party but declarations of policy on issues between nations, particularly on questions relating to finance and debts, ought not to be made in the language of challenge and defiance.  The jingo politicians of small nations as of great, are notorious for the disastrous consequences of their leadership, financial and political.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the last page of their booklet they say that the Labour Party holds:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That in a dispute regarding interpretation of statutes, political parties are not qualified to pronounce judgment but favours expert inquiry into United Kingdom assets and liabilities and claims and counterclaims referred to in the Treaty with a view to revision of financial relations with the British Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the general question, under the heading political, they say in paragraph 118:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But we believe that the country needs a rest from agitation for mere political changes so that attention can be devoted to the solution of the much more serious economic and social problems which so closely concern the national life.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In every one of these important matters during the last two years the Labour Party have run away from their own policy.  I am now discussing the motion which was put before this House by the Labour Party 12 months ago.  I think it appeared first in the Order Paper on the 6th April, 1933.  Looking back we find that in the 12 months since this motion was put on the Order Paper asking for additional State expenditure to start public works and to relieve unemployment in the country, our trade has been reduced by £14,000,000, that we finished a year in which the expenditure on home assistance was £830,000 as against £676,000 for the 12 months before that.  I am speaking of the years ended 31st December, <Col N="1681" /> 1932 and the 31st December, 1933.</P>
    <P>We find ourselves in the beginning of this year, starting a new year after that very big increase in the payment of home assistance throughout the country, with the home assistance paid for the end of February, the last month which is available, gone up an extra £1,000 a week over the amount paid in the same month last year, although the same month last year showed such a considerable rise over the year that went before it.  We find unemployment figures rising.  Since the 1st of January this year they have risen by 22,000.  In the same period from the 1st of January, 1933, to the 3rd of April there was a reduction of 18,000.  So that, we find ourselves with that fall in trade; we find ourselves with that increase in home assistance; and we find ourselves with that increase in unemployment; and in the City of Dublin itself we find that the cost of maintaining the able-bodied under the poor relief system, has gone up by 25 per cent. as against this time last year; that is, the weekly expenditure. We find ourselves discussing this matter after Deputies of the Labour Party have expressed themselves in many ways very bluntly on the conditions that have been and are being brought about.</P>
    <P>Deputy Pattison, in April last, after about 12 months' experience of that policy, said in Kilkenny on the 3rd of April:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We were to have heaven on earth but it is actually hell upon earth.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I will get the quotation for the Deputy.  It is from the Press of the 3rd of April, 1933.  He is also reported in the Press on the 10th of June, as having stated at Carlow:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There were few workers who realised that all those false promises were being dished out without any intention of ever fulfilling them as far as Labour interests were concerned.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton drew attention to the conditions existing in the new industries. <Col N="1682" /> Deputy Murphy has been pointing out that.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;all grades of workers, from road-workers to Gárda and teachers, were faced with the same cry for lower wages and worse working conditions&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and he called the policy national suicide.  Everybody knows that agricultural labourers, from one end of the country to the other, are being paid less at the moment than they have been paid, I might say, since the setting up of this State.  I heard it described, from a place not very far removed from Dublin, that the wages of these men were that they got their milk and they got their meat and half-a-crown. The Deputies cannot point to any single part of the country in which conditions are not worsening. Deputy Norton tells us that there is no use in making comparisons between the unemployment figures of to-day and those of last year.  He says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not think they matter very much.  The serious position to-day, so far as the unemployed people of the country are concerned, is not so much a matter of comparison of unemployed figures to-day with those of two, three, five or ten years ago.  The problem for these people to-day is to know what steps the State, which has a moral responsibility in this matter, is going to take for the relief of the unemployment which is pressing so heavily on the people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>After all, what is the State?  The people.  Deputy Norton, asking to have the situation relieved, has nothing to suggest but a large number of pieces of public work that must be paid for either out of public revenue or by borrowing, and he says that public work will require to be carried on in this particular way for a very long time.  He says, in column 1360:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is quite clear that you cannot, within any reasonable period, hope to see our industries developed to such an extent as to make it possible to absorb into productive employment even half of those now seeking for an opportunity of working, but who are unable to obtain that opportunity.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1683" /> At the same time, on the agricultural side of things, he explains that agriculture in this and in every other country in the world is passing through a period of acute depression.  He says that &ldquo;the State can create credit and capital for the purpose of financing a public works policy of that kind; that it is not orthodox finance, but it is difficult to talk about orthodox finance when you are presented with a situation in which you have 80,000 unemployed men and women.&rdquo;  To-day you have 100,000 unemployed men and women.  Where are you going to get the revenue to employ these people on State works, and where are we going to get the credit if we are pursuing policies that are absolutely destructive of the real wealth at the present time in this country, the agricultural industry?  There is no use in running along, as Deputy Davin runs along, on the unity stunt.  He hoists the flag of unity on his public platform.  He is going to unify everybody.</P>

      <P>I will send the Deputy a copy of his speech, where he really endeavours to avoid facing up to the question of what should be done in this country to improve employment by saying: &ldquo;Everybody is divided in this country and I am going to stand for unity.&rdquo;  There is no use in Deputy Davin saying that he is going to stand for unity and then thinking that that is going to solve the difficulty, say, of the agricultural labourers in his own constituency or the town workers, or that that is going to improve his credit or any other body's credit on which to borrow money to put these people working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton becomes a Republican on his latest platform.  The kind of Republicanism that is wanted in this country is the kind that James Connolly had, who saw a job to be done and went out and did it and paid the price of doing it; and the job of Republicanism that wants to be done <Col N="1684" /> in this country or that has the spirit of Republicanism is the task of seeing what has to be done with the finances and the policies of this country on constructive lines so as to give our people a chance of living, even if political leaders have to pay the penalty.  Decisions must be taken, and the sooner the Labour Party come from under some of the banners they are raising at the present moment and take decisions on the material matters in front of them, the sooner what Deputy Norton wants to see for employment in this country will be brought about.  Deputy Corish raises the flag of Catholicism.</P>

The members of the Labour Party are not blind to the position that we have, and day by day they are coming more and more up against the practical problem that they are going to be asked to tackle, and no number of flags is going to help them, either spiritually or materially, to do their work and to show that they are going to help the people on whose behalf they are <Col N="1685" /> speaking or on whose behalf they were asked to come here and speak.</P>

      <P>I pointed out that when the members of the Labour Party were going before the electorate, before the Fianna Fáil Government came into office, they drew attention to the very desperate state of the country then.  In the <i>Watchword of Labour</i> of 16th January, 1932, we had this as regards the pitiful position of some people in the country who had to pay rates:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Whole armies of unemployed besieged the country homes throughout the country, while a piteous tale is told by one rate collector in the following words typical of the South of Ireland: &lsquo;In one case my official duties compelled me to distrain a cow and small calf, the only stock on a farm of 50 acres, where the father was helpless, and the <Col N="1686" /> mother, with six little children, followed me along the road in anguish for the little ones, who were dependent on the milk of this cow for their sustenance.  I abandoned the seizure and gave the poor woman some assistance to get a little bread and groceries.  Is it to be contended I was guilty of a breach of duty, or am I to be compelled to perpetrate deeds of Cromwellian atrocity?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was in 1932.  &ldquo;Deeds of Cromwellian atrocity.&rdquo;  Could not members of the Labour Party go to South Tipperary and Kilkenny and Waterford and see acts that compared with that would be indescribable?  We had a case in South Tipperary where 22 cattle were seized from an unfortunate woman to pay rates and sold for £1 per head.  Of course, Deputy Norton will say: &ldquo;The Labour Party refuses to be influenced by the artificial wailing of the ascendancy class, whose hatred of the Labour Party and the Government was only equalled by their venomous attacks on the pre-Truce I.R.A.&rdquo;  That is the sympathy that is got to-day by people when their whole source of living is seized and their cattle are sold at £1 per head to pay rates.  Deputy Corish has reason to know that it is not easy for people to pay rates.  I should like to hear Deputy Breen and Deputy Hayes, of Tipperary, on what they think of that action.</P>

If the Minister does not appreciate that that is a hard case I <Col N="1687" /> refer him to some reports from the District Courts, where district justices, after going into the merits of the cases, put back the payment of the rates for many months and arranged to have them taken in instalments. The case quoted by the Labour Party as a distressing case of having to pay rates has been multiplied all over the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Holohan, I am sure, could make even a much more vigorous case than I am making on his own particular subject.  I am drawing the attention of the Labour Party to the fact that not only have you cases where people's cattle are taken and sold for £1 per head to pay rates, but you have had cases before the District Courts, and the district justices, in case after case, gave time for the people to pay the rates, having gone into the merits of the cases.  The only thing that the editor of the Ministerial journal has to say on the case of a person who said that when he drew an overdraft on the bank he drew it to pay his workmen's wages first rather than to pay his rates was that he had money and did not want to pay them.  The position with regard to the rates, with regard to our trade with Great Britain, the position complained of by the Labour Party at the time, that Denmark was getting a better do in the British market than we were getting&mdash;all that has been worsened by the destruction of Irish capital, by the lowering of Irish wages and the prejudicing of the future of Irish workers in every part of the country, both in agriculture and other industries.  The contribution to <Col N="1688" /> employment here has been mainly tariffs and Deputy Norton has expressed himself vigorously enough on tariffs to show that there was something in what the Labour Party enshrined in their policy that tariffs were not the beginning and the end of all industrial prosperity in this country.</P>
      <P>A day or two ago the last bit of machinery was taken out of Gallaher's factory.  I had with me two people who had been receiving £3 5s. per week in Gallaher's factory.  The only work they received since the factory was closed was eight months' employment on three days a week on relief work at 29/2 per week.  A couple of months ago one of them went to a labour exchange in Dublin and saw the person in charge and asked to be helped to get employment.  He was asked was he not on relief work and he said he was.  He was asked had he not a nerve to come there and ask to be found employment while on relief work.  He had lost a permanent position in a developing industry at £3 5s. per week and he was given eight months' relief work at 29/2 per week and he had the &ldquo;neck&rdquo; to think of approaching a labour exchange in Dublin with a view to being put back on some kind of permanent employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes&mdash;by an official.  The Minister promised that he would see that the employees of Gallaher's were put back into some of the industries that were being started. The Labour Party have been having fortnightly meetings with the Minister to discuss the general policy.  They are supporting a general policy which destroys our agricultural industry and which is building up industrial conditions here that they do not agree with, and that they really see no decent prosperity coming out of.  They support the policy of a Government that tells them through their Minister of <Col N="1689" /> whatever he is now&mdash;Forestry&mdash;that the whole economic conditions of the present world are shattered to pieces, and that we have to start all over again.  If the world has to start all over again I would ask the Labour Party to turn back a bit to some of the things they thought they ought to do as a matter of policy; to some of the things that ought to be, with them, a matter of principle; to make their restart on those; and to get away from the one particular line of policy they are on at the present moment&mdash; a one-day strike against Fascism, a political levy against O'Duffy, and all that kind of thing which they know is quite futile.</P>

The leader of the Labour Party will not then be coming here and making himself ridiculous by adopting the litany policy of the Minister for Industry and Commerce &mdash;giving us a litany of all the things that could be done here if we would only scrap orthodox finance, and hold out our hand to get all the money that would come into it on the credit of our national character, and the great resources of this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On this motion, moved by Deputy Norton, we had from him <Col N="1690" /> a clear statement on the policy of the Labour Party for the immediate alleviation of the unemployment position, and the permanent solution of the problem which unemployment constitutes.  We had from Deputy Mulcahy, following that, what I presume is the clearest possible statement of the attitude of his Party on the matter of unemployment, and his suggestions for its solution.  Before I deal with the matters raised by Deputy Norton I think we should dispose of Deputy Mulcahy's points. I gathered from him that unemployment is due to the economic war; that it never existed before the economic war, and will disappear immediately the economic war is settled.  That is the policy of Deputy Mulcahy's Party as expounded by Deputy Mulcahy.  He spoke a lot about one-day strikes; he read extracts from the Labour Party pamphlet; he talked about the effects of the no-rate campaign in certain parts of the country, all of which were, in a sense, relevant.  In so far as he dealt with the motion before the House he told us the policy of his Party in relation to unemployment. It is just as well that we had that clearly stated.  I know that General O'Duffy has got some fantastic notion about getting all the workers of the country conscripted into labour battalions, and marched around up and down the hills to do an odd job here and there, being permitted, if the General likes, to send home to their families at the end of each week some contribution from their wages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case, it was half an hour on this occasion and an hour on the last occasion.  He spoke at considerable length, and he gave us his solution of the unemployment problem.  He gave us a clear statement of his attitude in relation to it, and the manner in which he would deal with it if by any misfortune he were translated to this side <Col N="1692" /> of the House as a member of the Government.  He said he would settle the economic war.  His only idea about the whole subject was, as he stated, the restoration of the market which is three times as valuable as any market we have at home.  Presumably, if that desirable end was achieved, unemployment would cease to exist.  Again I want to remind Deputy Mulcahy that unemployment as a problem, and as a serious problem, existed here long before the economic war began.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Deputy Alfred Byrne is going to make a speech.  I should like to be able to take time to go back over the records of the debates on unemployment which took place here in 1931, 1930, 1929, 1928, and 1927, and to read out the speeches which Deputy Alfred Byrne then made.  It would be quite interesting were it not for the fact that it would be a bit monotonous, because all the speeches were the same.  In any case it would be unnecessary, because we will hear exactly the same speech from Deputy Alfred Byrne on this debate.  We will hear it again, no doubt, with the changes necessitated by the passage of time, but precisely the same in all other respects.  Unemployment existed here in those years. Unemployment was a very serious problem in those years, despite the fact that up to 1930 a very considerable number emigrated from this country in every year, hoping to find in America or elsewhere an opportunity of earning the livelihoods they could not find here.  Emigration has stopped from causes outside our control, and the unemployment problem which existed has been aggravated on that account.  The unemployment problem will not end with the economic war. If Deputy Mulcahy, or Deputy Brennan, or any other Deputy opposite, thinks that the mere termination of this dispute with Great Britain is going to solve unemployment, I want him to tell us what the unemployed are going to work at as a result of the stoppage of the war.  Deputy Norton said in the course of this debate that with the development of mechanisation in industry not even the fullest possible industrial development that could conceivably take place here would be sufficient <Col N="1693" /> to absorb all the unemployed. Deputy Mulcahy, however, thinks that all those unemployed would immediately get back to work if the financial dispute with Great Britain is ended. Work at what?</P>

      <P>The Deputy will have an opportunity of making a speech when the Vote is being taken.  I am anxious to get out of the heads of Deputies opposite the misconception that they have as to the facts.  Unemployment is not due to the economic <Col N="1694" /> war, nor will it end with it.  The fall in agricultural prices, to which Deputy Mulcahy referred, is not due to the economic war.  The fall in agricultural prices started in April, 1929, and it has continued ever since.  The fall in April, 1929, was severe.  It was not quite as severe in 1931; it was much less severe in 1932.  If the Deputy will take the agricultural prices index and draw a graph he will find that the curve will show a rapid fall in 1929 and in 1931 tapering off and levelling out in 1932, although still falling.  The fall in prices of primary products has taken place in every country in the world. It is the cause of world depression. It has produced an international conference which was unable to correct it.  It has caused Governments of every country to adopt novel, and sometimes revolutionary, methods in an effort to stop it.  They have not succeeded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The restrictions upon the export of Saorstát agricultural products to Great Britain are not due to the economic war.  They would not be removed at the termination of the economic war. I do not want Deputies to take my word for that.  I am asking them to take the word of British Ministers, who have been repeatedly asserting that these restrictions have been occasioned by British internal policy, and are going to remain so long as British internal policy remains unchanged. I refer Deputies to the statement of Mr. Stanley Baldwin to the British Farmers' Union only last week, in which he again made that assertion, and pointed out that with the termination of the Ottawa Agreements in June next the policy of the British Government will be further to restrict imports of agricultural goods, and particularly of meat products, into Great Britain from countries with whom Great Britain has no economic war.  Again, I want to remind Deputies of the newspaper report which was read here by the Minister for Agriculture dealing with the communications which passed between the Governments of New Zealand and of Great Britain.  The Government of New Zealand is on the most friendly terms with the Government of Great Britain, <Col N="1695" /> and New Zealand is regarded as one of the most loyal of the Dominions. When the Government of New Zealand communicated with the British Government, offering to allow all British goods in free of tariffs if the British Government in return would undertake that New Zealand agricultural produce would not be the subject of quota restrictions in Great Britain, the British Government turned down the offer.  It is necessary to state these facts, which most informed persons are already aware of, in order to get rid of the fog of misconceptions which Deputies opposite are allowing to cloud their thoughts&mdash;if, in fact, they do think&mdash;so that we can bring out the essential facts of the situation clearly, which must be done if any attempt is to be made to deal with this question.</P>

      <P>The number of persons registered at the exchanges has increased, but a very large number of these people are not unemployed.

There is also the fact that as the Unemployment Assistance Act comes into full operation on next Wednesday, there is consequently an inducement greater than ever to every person in this country who can sustain any kind of case to qualify for assistance under that Act to register at the exchanges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to get this discussion down to actualities, by saying straight away that the unemployment situation is serious.  It is not as serious as some Deputies opposite would have us believe, nor is it of recent development.  It has always been serious since the depression began, at the beginning of 1929, and, in fact, for a much longer period.  It is because the unemployment problem is serious that the Government has taken what might be properly described as revolutionary steps in order to deal with it, and to alleviate hardship.  I mentioned that on next Wednesday the Unemployment Assistance Act comes into operation.  There may be criticism of the principle of that Act, but it is, at any rate, an attempt to give effect to a measure of relief designed to secure that persons, when unemployed, not through their own fault, will be protected against destitution, if not secured comfort.  Under that Act, there will be paid out on an average about £25,000 a week through the various exchanges.  It is an entirely new scheme, a new service much bigger than any existing service of the same kind in this State and much more comprehensive than any similar service yet established in any other State.  It has taken us a long time to perfect the machinery to operate it.  Even at present the machinery is only partially complete. It will be able to work next Wednesday, perhaps not completely satisfactorily, but, nevertheless, in some manner.  After a little while, the bearings will have been run in and it will work more smoothly.  But it does represent one big effort to deal with the serious unemployment problem here&mdash;and only one effort.  I have always described that Act as the third line of defence against hardship arising from unemployment.  The first line of defence is industrial development, the second is what Deputy Norton is pleading for&mdash;a large scale programme of public works.  We hope that, in due course, it will be possible <Col N="1698" /> to prevent unemployment at the first line or, if not at the first line, then, at least, at the second line.  But if conditions are such that neither the first nor the second line is effective in stopping unemployment, there will be the third line to ensure that persons unemployed will be secured something to enable them to maintain life.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy talked about the condition of the farmers.  His evidence that the farmers' conditions were bad was that certain people had refused to pay rates and that, in one case, a lady had 22 head of cattle seized and sold to pay her rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Sold for £1 per head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They would probably have realised more if they had seized her motor car.  In other cases, as the Deputy is aware, luxuries of that kind were seized and sold to pay rates which the persons concerned, incited by members of the Deputy's Party, had refused to pay, although they could well afford to do so.  The Deputy can get by Parliamentary question or through the columns of the newspapers information as to how the rates have been paid.  He will find that in those parts of the country where one might expect hardship, where the population has always been pressing against the limits of subsistence, the rates have been paid better this year than they were in some other years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The places where, in the main, the rates have not been paid are where there are large farmers.  The percentage of rates remaining unpaid is due to the fact that these large farmers have failed to pay.  I am not denying that they are less able to pay a heavy rate charge now, because of the fall in prices, than they were some years ago.  That is so, but their failure to pay was not due to inability to pay but to an organised campaign.</P>

      <P>That deterioration was caused by the fall in prices in external markets and the restrictions imposed by external Governments in consequence of that fall in prices.  These factors have operated in every country in the world and I assert that they have operated, in many directions, less harshly here than they have in most countries.  Live stock is, undoubtedly, one of our principal agricultural products. Excluding cattle, of the products raised by farmers, there is no product in respect of which it can be said that the situation here is more <Col N="1700" /> critical than, or, in respect of most of them, as bad as it was.  In previous debates, I have given figures for week after week showing that in respect of a number of agricultural goods the prices now operating are higher than they were 12 months ago.

That is the fact. Deputies may deplore the fact, but that gets them nowhere.

      <P>Or to attempt to deceive anybody else into believing that <Col N="1702" /> there is available in Great Britain now, or will be at any time in the future, a market for live stock capable of absorbing the production which we undertook in previous years.  It is not there.  I again refer to the fact that only last week the President of the Council in the British Cabinet, Mr. Baldwin, asserted in a most emphatic manner, in a manifesto to the British Farmers' Union, that they were going definitely to conserve the market for meat in Great Britain for the British producer and to limit supplies from all other countries.  He pointed to the fact that their Treaty obligations with Canada, Australia and New Zealand terminated in June, and that, with the termination of these engagements, supplies from these countries were to be cut down also.  Deputies who try to deceive members of the farming community into the belief that there is any action open to any Government in this country, that will secure for them again uninterrupted entry to the British market for live stock, do the farmers of this country a very great disservice.  I did not want to go into these matters because they are only slightly relevant so far as the motion is concerned, but that statement does clear the air, and does help Deputies to realise that in tackling the position we have to have regard to actuality and not to the fancies to which they may care to give utterance.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton, in the course of his remarks, supporting this resolution, which asks the Government to take steps to provide a large scale scheme of public works to relieve the distress occasioned by unemployment, argued as follows: We have within our control all the powers required to deal with the unemployment problem.  And he said that we had to face the fact that the development of industry, which is taking place and which has taken place, no matter how intensive it may be, because of the development of machinery and the tendency towards the adoption of labour-saving devices in modern industry, is not capable of absorbing our unemployed. The words he used were:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The plain fact we have to face, <Col N="1703" /> in respect of our industrial activity, is that our industries to-day are not capable of absorbing all our unemployed people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He argued that industry might help to deal with the problem, in a much greater degree, if legislation was introduced reducing working hours so that to maintain the same production a larger number of hands would be required.  He dealt also with the position of agriculture, and the reaction of world prices upon agriculture here, similar to those on agriculture in other countries; and while he agreed that the change over from live stock production to the production of tillage crops might, in due course, have its effect upon the unemployment problem, nevertheless he argued the process was likely to be slow and that we could not depend upon it for any immediate improvement of the situation.  Therefore he urged that the resources of the State should be mobilised in whatever form the Government thought best in order to finance a scheme of public works and thus provide the opportunity of using the unemployed in some useful manner.  And he then proceeded to indicate various kinds of public works that had occurred to him and to the members of his Party which he would like to see undertaken.</P>
    <P>I think that we must, first of all, examine very closely the facts of industrial development upon the unemployment situation.  If it is true that the mechanisation of industry is having the effect of lessening the effect upon unemployment which development might otherwise have, and if, in fact, it is not possible now to absorb the unemployed persons in this country, no matter how great the industrial development we may secure in industry, that situation would be serious indeed.  It is quite true that President Roosevelt carried out an investigation of unemployment conditions in the State of New York and came to the conclusion that if every factory in the city of New York was put to work at full time, or even at overtime, all the unemployed in that city would not be absorbed.  It is quite true that every day new devices <Col N="1704" /> for speeding up production, and for the elimination of human labour, are being adopted in many industries and that, in fact, it is possible to get, in respect of these industries, a very great increase in production without any increase in employment and, in fact, with a decrease in employment.</P>
    <P>I remember well in Canada, in 1932, I went with a British Minister to see a nickel works in a certain province.  Some 50 people or so were employed there.  The manager told us that a few years before the same production from this works required the employment of between three or four thousand persons; but an entirely new process of production was introduced and the result was that they could maintain their output with one-tenth of the number of people they formerly employed.  That development has taken place in a much similar way here.  But I submit it is an open question whether it is true to assert that the various possible industrial developments will not give us work for all the people now unemployed whatever their number be.  It is, of course, difficult to forecast what employment will be given by any particular development and we must always bear in mind that economists calculate that for every two persons employed in production at least one person is employed in distribution or a luxury occupation of one kind or another. The forecasting of the employment to be given by any industrial development is often very inaccurate.  It was always regarded as axiomatic that the development of the flour industry would have no effect on employment.  The Tariff Commission, after exhaustive enquiry, expressed the opinion that the production of flour required in Irish mills would only increase employment by 150.  In fact, 550 people extra have been employed in Irish flour mills since June, 1932, when the tariff was imposed, and we have not yet supplied cur requirements.  Two or three new mills are being built and still further mills are being planned, so that the actual number will be further increased.</P>
    <P>On the other hand Deputy Norton <Col N="1705" /> referred to the brushmaking industry. Despite the fact that, as a result of tariffs, the output of that industry has been increased by nearly three times, the new conditions were made the occasion of the reorganisation of the industry and the introduction of new methods of manufacture with the result that the total employment given by the industry has actually diminished. There is, however, still a wide field of industrial activity untouched.  We have succeeded in the past two years in producing activities in the directions where it was easiest to produce activity, in respect of industries where there were not the same difficulties, either in respect to the management or the staffing, as will exist in the case of industries to be created in future.  We got that development in relation to industries where increased production and increased activity could be secured with the smallest capital expenditure.  We have now reached the stage in our industrial programme where the new concerns will have to be of larger size, require a heavier capital investment and can only be brought into existence with the assistance of technical skill, both in the management and in the staff, not at present available in the country.  These industries however are of the kind that absorb workers in large numbers and which mainly require for their operation male workers and adult workers.  They cannot be brought rapidly into existence. The actual construction and equipment of factories will in some cases take over 12 months but, even upon that work, employment will be available which will have its bearing on the situation.</P>
    <P>The housing programme of the State is being pushed ahead as rapidly as possible.  Very great activity is being undertaken in all directions.  In some respects it has been held up by the absence of skilled workers, as Deputies will have read in the Press for themselves.  There is, of course, a natural reluctance on behalf of the trade unions catering for these skilled workers greatly to increase their numbers by the admittance of new entrants without some guarantee <Col N="1706" /> that the present scale of development will be maintained, because otherwise they might find a slackening off in activity at a later stage and consequently a much greater demand amongst their members for whatever work might be available, with reactions on their general standard of living. The development of the housing industry, however, even at the scale at which it has been possible to undertake it having regard to the limitations which I have mentioned and the other limitations imposed by the nature of the machinery at the disposal of local authorities, has also created the possibility of other industries which are being established and extended at the present time and which are capable of very considerable development.  I have been, in fact, surprised, on going into the figures in respect of many of the materials required in house construction, to find the extent of the market available and the extent to which we are still unable to supply our own requirements. Our efforts in recent months have been very largely directed towards interesting people in the organisation of concerns to undertake the production of these goods.  I say, however, it would be a pessimistic idea to allow to operate in our minds that it is not possible to deal with our unemployment problem by industrial developments.</P>
    <P>I suppose Deputies will differ as to the extent to which industrial development is possible here but there is, I assert, much more to be done than has been done and in the doing of that we shall make a very considerable gap in the ranks of the unemployed. The reorganisation of agriculture, involving as it does a much more intensive tillage programme in respect to wheat, beet and the cereal feeding stuffs required by farmers, must also have its bearing on the unemployment problem.  It is true, that while our industrial and agricultural plans are working out, there is a situation which has to be dealt with, but a situation which, I assert, is being dealt with in the public works programme of the Government, backed by its unemployment assistance <Col N="1707" /> scheme.  There are, of course, limitations naturally imposed upon any public works scheme that can be undertaken.  No matter what that scheme may be, whether it be a waterworks, a sewerage, a drainage or an afforestation scheme, there are technical engineering problems which must be solved and the resources at the disposal of the State and at the disposal of the local authorities in the solving of these problems are limited.</P>
    <P>It is easy enough to say that there is work to be done.  Deputy Norton suggested quite a number of directions in which there is work to be done.  It is a much more difficult matter, however, to organise the doing of that work&mdash;to provide the direction, to prepare the plans, to get the men actually down on the job.  The preparation of the plans alone involves considerable delay and these plans must necessarily be carefully prepared so as to ensure that not merely will work be provided for the unemployed but that useful results are likely to accrue from the doing of it.  If it were merely a matter of employing men, it would be quite feasible to engage them to make holes and fill them up.  It is not that class of work on which we want to engage the unemployed, because unless the work is of a useful nature it is better that they should not work at it at all.  It takes much more in hard cash to put a man on work than it does to maintain a man in the same degree that he would be maintained from the wages arising from the work. If you have 100 men unemployed you can pay each of these men 30/- at a cost of £150, but you could not put them into employment at a 30/- wage for £150.  Even at the simplest form of work, such as road construction, at which only simple tools like spades and picks would be used, the provision of these tools, the provision of the materials and the provision of directional control would involve an expenditure of almost as much again&mdash; another £150 a week.  However, if we are going to use national funds for the purpose of putting men to work we must ensure that we are going to get a return for the money so expended. <Col N="1708" /> That involves, as I have said, the solution sometimes of intricate engineering problems and always the direction of the operations with considerable care.</P>
    <P>Deputies have had explained to them the difficulties that arise in connection with, for example, any large schemes of afforestation.  Afforestation involves the planting of trees and before it can be undertaken numbers of young trees must be available.  I understand that the afforestation experts say that the trees must have been grown in this country, that it is not feasible to import young trees from abroad and plant them here as they seldom make good progress.  Consequently, as a preliminary to any large scale afforestation scheme, there must be a nursery stage.  That at present has been organised and this year or next year afforestation work will be on a much larger scale than heretofore. The following year it will have reached a point at which we will be able to maintain if for a number of years after that, so that the full afforestation programme of the Government, outlined by the Minister concerned, will be given effect to.</P>
    <P>The erection of public buildings of any kind is not, in my opinion, a useful form of work to undertake for the purpose of relieving unemployment, because the type of persons, apart from preliminary work on foundations or demolition, that would be employed upon such schemes are, in the main, not unemployed at the present time. In fact, in respect of a large number of such classes of persons they are in demand and are not available in sufficient numbers to meet the requirements of the ordinary housing programme. Certain plans in connection with public buildings are in contemplation, but the immediate relief of unemployment requires works of a different kind.  The reclamation of land, the drainage of rivers and so forth is all work which has been, and is being, undertaken.  But, again, there are very definite limitations upon that class of work arising out of engineering problems.  However, the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary who are dealing with these matters from <Col N="1709" /> day to day will be able to inform the Dáil of the actual undertakings that have been carried through in the past year, and of those that are planned for the coming year.  I think they will be able to point out that, to the limit of the resources made available, very useful work has been done and a very large amount of employment has been given.  The returns show that at various stages in the course of the year, especially during the winter months when unemployment is considered to be at its worst, there have been from time to time over 40,000 people employed upon Government works or works assisted out of Government funds of one kind or another. The provision of these public works has, of course, its bearing upon the industrial and agricultural position.</P>
    <P>It is, I think, a remarkable thing that there appears to have been no slackening off whatever in the consumption of goods in this country. Most of the retail concerns, the accounts of which are made available to the public at the annual meetings of shareholders, have reported in this year an increased trade over the previous year.  It was not merely a matter of one concern, because of good management or exceptional circumstances, doing well at the expense of others, the remarkable fact is that they have all had the same report to make.  The trade statistics available show that the consumption of the goods in most frequent use from day to day and from week to week has been well maintained and that, in fact, there has been an increase in the consumption of many classes of goods the sales of which are regarded generally as an index of the purchasing power of the people.  That situation is, no doubt, partly due to the public works which the Government have undertaken, and partly due to the fact that the very large sum which previously went out of this country to pay for manufactured goods imported is now being retained here and circulated again and again during the course of the 12 months through new or existing industrial concerns.  It is partly due, too, to the fact that the farming community, even though they have had to <Col N="1710" /> face a substantial fall in the prices of their products, have also enjoyed a considerable reduction in their operating costs.</P>
    <P>It is not correct to pretend or to assert that the whole of the fall in prices, to which reference has already been made, has been borne by the farming community.  Nothing of the kind has, of course, occurred.  The expenses which the farmer has to meet out of the price he secures for his products have all been reduced. This year we are providing almost £2,000,000 in relief of rates on agricultural land.  It is the largest sum that has ever been provided for that purpose in any year since the Saorstát was established.  This year, in addition, the farmers have had their annuity charges reduced by half.  That left available amongst them to meet other charges the sum of almost £2,500,000.  There have been reductions in the prices of the materials used by them&mdash;feeding stuffs and so forth&mdash;and various measures are being adopted in order to make these reductions more effective and of direct benefit to them.  The fall in agricultural prices in respect of certain commodities has, therefore, been in a large measure offset by the reduction of other charges, and we must also bear in mind that in respect of a number of agricultural products prices are now moving upwards and the indications are that they will continue to move in that direction.  I refer particularly to those commodities which are sold in large quantities. The prices of milk and butter, of milk products of various kinds, and of pigs and bacon have all been well maintained. They are much higher, in fact, than they are in other countries. The prices for oats and barley have been moving upwards, while the prices now obtaining for sheep are higher than they have been at any time since an early date in 1931.  The price of potatoes has also gone up.  In fact, the customs authorities are now engaged on the problem of dealing with persons attempting to smuggle potatoes in from Northern Ireland, where the price for them is very much lower.  The price of wool has also <Col N="1711" /> advanced considerably.  The prices for other agricultural products have also either been maintained or they are moving upwards.  The position, therefore, is that in respect of those commodities the reduction in charges to which I have made reference&mdash;the reduction, for instance, in the price of feeding stuffs&mdash;has been of very direct benefit to the farmers and has helped them to meet their losses upon live stock.  In respect to live stock, the measures which are being adopted by the Government will help farmers to carry over the transition period before the new order is in full operation. Farmers appear to have been able to maintain their purchases of industrial <Col N="1712" /> goods to much the same extent as in previous years.  Again, I would remind Deputies of statements which have been made by persons who have no sympathy with the Government: of men like Senator Sir John Keane, who is a director of the Bank of Ireland. The information available to them is that not merely are sales being maintained, but that cash payments for sales are as good, if not better, than they have been for a number of years past.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
