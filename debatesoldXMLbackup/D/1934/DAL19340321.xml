      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state (1) the total number of certificates of approval granted in County Roscommon to persons for reconstruction of houses under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932; (2) the number in which final certificates of completion have been issued; and (3)  the total number in which grants have been actually paid and if any complaints have reached his Department concerning delays in making payment of the grants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>(1)  The total number of certificates of approval granted in County Roscommon to persons for reconstruction of houses under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932, is 162.</P>
      <P>(2)  The total number in which final certificates of completion have been issued is 14.</P>
      <P>(3)  The total number in which grants have been paid is 31.  In the case of 14 houses final payments have been made and in addition instalments have been paid in respect of 17 houses.  Representations have been made from time to time regarding the delay in dealing with applications for grants for reconstruction but in many cases the delay was found to be due to the failure on the part of applicants to supply the necessary information required to determine their eligibility to receive grants under the Act.  In other cases the delay was due to the practical difficulties experienced in investigating the large number of applications received.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Any abuse which may arise because of the undue detention of tobacco in bond, I presume, will be sufficiently safeguarded against by the forthcoming legislation for the control of growing.  I should like to point out that such provision need not necessarily be made by way of import duty alone.  If experience indicates that the forthcoming legislation does not deal adequately with such abuse as the Deputy contemplates, then, I think that the question of the imposition of excise duty might be considered should the circumstances require it.</P>

The committee referred to has now been set up, and, as I have already said, it is hoped that when the committee has had some experience of the nature of the funds concerned, and of the nature of the investments which are available, it may be able to make recommendations which will enable such legislation as may be necessary to be introduced in due course.</P>

      <P>This is necessary for the working of the Stabilisation Act.  When the Stabilisation Act was introduced this time two years it was provided that the levy must not exceed more than half the butter duty and the bounty must not exceed the butter duty.  At that time the world price for butter was 110/- per cwt. and a levy of 2d. and a bounty <Col N="1239" /> of 4d. were quite sufficient.  Last year we had to raise the duty because the world price was 66/- or 68/- and it is much about the same this year. That duty was brought forward last year under the Emergency Act and it lapsed after eight months and it is now necessary to renew it.  It is necessary also to bring it before the Dáil on this occasion.  The duty is being raised for the working of the Stabilisation Act and not as a protective measure, because no butter has been imported for practically three years and it is not likely that butter will be imported.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened from time to time to Deputies on the Government Benches telling the House what the Government have done for the dairying industry and qualifying that by asking: If the Cumann na nGaedheal Government were in power, what attitude would they adopt?  I have before me the balance sheet of a creamery society.  The price given to the farmers for milk last year was 4d., the year before 4.31d., the preceding year it was 4.35d. and during the year before that it was 4.84d., so that for three or four years previously, notwithstanding the Government aid last year, the price paid to the farmers was considerably higher.  This particular creamery society had collected off them for last year a sum of £5,226 13s. and they received in the way of bounty £2,440. If there were no levy or bounty the price which the farmers would have received per lb. of butter would be 13.04d. and contrast that with the figure of 11.54d. which the farmers received under the Government's scheme for a levy and bounty.  This is the Government that is doing everything for the farming community.  If we were working on our own we would have got more than we did get last year when the Government's policy was operating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, the Minister will tell us that we have a guaranteed price in the home market.  I quite understand that, but some other means should be adopted for stabilisation besides that which is at present in force.  There is no doubt the price of butter is too high <Col N="1240" /> for the poor people and they are developing a taste for margarine.  The Minister for Agriculture admitted on a recent occasion that 4d. is not a paying price for milk.  The Minister knows that it costs 5½d. to produce a gallon of milk, yet 4d. was the price which ruled last year.  I hope in the future, when Fianna Fáil Deputies tell us what the Government is doing for the dairying industry, they will bear those facts in mind.</P>
    <P>Dairying is not a paying proposition and has not been for many a long day, except in respect to subsidiary things such as the rearing of calves.  If you do away with live-stock, as has been hinted at, I do not see any future for dairying, because one is dependent on the other.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two matters in connection with this resolution to which I wish to draw the Minister's attention.  I would like to know how he prevailed on the Minister for Industry and Commerce to allow him to operate without having to resort to that useful omnibus weapon, the Emergency (Imposition of Duties) Act. They imposed tariffs in handfuls for the last six or 12 months, and the great majority of them were never submitted to the Dáil.  It was suggested to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the imposition of a tariff was a matter that ought to be submitted to the Dáil, but he said they never were submitted.  He said his predecessor or the predecessor of the Minister for Finance had exactly similar powers and had used them, and he was merely using the same powers now.  He forgets, of course, that the powers were not exactly similar.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not forgetting. The difference between the powers which Senator Blythe, when he was Minister, had, and the powers which the Minister for Finance now has is this.  If the former Minister imposed a tariff he was under a statutory obligation to come to the Dáil for approval. Under the existing legislation the <Col N="1241" /> Minister for Finance and his colleague can legislate <i>ad infinitum</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They can legislate <i>ad infinitum</i> in respect of tariffs and, so far as one can see, there is no necessity to come before the House. Tariffs are changed and chopped and imposed without any reference to the Dáil.  It is really quite surprising when we see the blushing Minister for Agriculture coming along with a proposal for a tariff.  We thought that was quite an out-of-date procedure. The normal procedure would have been to go hat in hand to the office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and ask him if he would graciously condescend to consent to an imposition of this tariff under the Emergency (Imposition of Duties) Act which we passed 12 months ago.</P>
      <P>On this question of butter, I asked the Minister for Agriculture some time ago what price he got for the butter which he exported to one of Fianna Fáil's alternative markets.  I asked that question because, at an earlier date, the Minister interrupted me in a speech and said that I would be amazed if I knew the price he got for butter that he had sold in Germany, and he implied that he got 136/- a cwt. He did not say so directly, but he implied it.  Accordingly I put down a question asking him explicitly what he did get.  He was absent from the House at the time, and the Minister for Defence answered the question on his behalf.  The reply was to the effect that he was prepared to give me the information in confidence.  I refused to accept it on those terms.  I repeated the question and the Minister for Agriculture refused to disclose the information I required.  However, the Appropriation Accounts were published to-day, and the Appropriation Accounts deal, under one head, with the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Act, 1932, and the Butter Fund.</P>

      <P>I turned to these Appropriation Accounts, Sir, for information, thinking that I might find in these accounts an exact and detailed account by the Comptroller and Auditor-General of the way the moneys expended by the Minister in respect of bounties were administered.  I was unable to find in these accounts any reference to the amount of bounty which was paid on butter exported to Germany, or, indeed, any explicit statement such as would furnish me with the information that I sought to get from the Minister by a question. However, this much I know; this much I am able to ascertain, that the administration of the bounty schemes in general has given rise to a good deal of perplexity; that it is extremely difficult to extract any detailed information at all from such examination as has been possible of the administration of these schemes.  This much, also, I was able to ascertain, that it is absolutely essential that this House should know, and that this House should know at the earliest possible opportunity, what loss or profit the Minister for Agriculture has made on whatever transactions he undertook in the export of butter to Germany or to other continental countries and what levy, if any, he made upon the butter fund for export bounty on butter that he sent to the Continent.  Further, it is essential for the country to know what price he accepted from continental buyers for butter which he shipped out of the cold stores of this country to the Continent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Curran has referred to the very high price that has been ruling in this country for butter as a result of the butter levy and bounty scheme, and he has pointed out, what both he and I pointed out 12 months ago, that this scheme was going to put a burden of a very inequitable character on butter consumers in this country, and that this scheme might much better have been financed from the Central Fund by legislation in this House.  I do not propose to enlarge upon that aspect of the situation at this stage, but I do propose to press very strongly for a complete and detailed statement from <Col N="1243" /> the Minister for Agriculture of all the transactions in which he has engaged in the sale and purchase of butter during the last 12 months with continental countries.  It is essential that this House should know (1) how much butter was shipped; (2) the price the Minister got for it; and (3) the amount of bounty, if any, which he collected from the butter fund in respect of those exports.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, Sir, I might be permitted to reply to those two very weighty economic contributions from the two Deputies who have just spoken.  Deputy Curran thinks that if his creamery were left to work on its own, things would go better and that the other creameries should be let carry on as best they could.  I think it is quite a fair question for Deputies on this side of the House to ask what would become of butter if Cumann na nGaedheal were still in power.  The Cumann na nGaedheal Party opposed this Standardisation Bill when it was introduced, and it is to be presumed that if they were still in power they would be opposed to it.</P>

      <P>I admit that it is silly to think that they might not change, because they have been changing all along.  But one would think that a normal Party, such as Deputy Curran thought it worth while to join, would have some fixed ideas about prices of butter and about how to regulate the prices of butter.  Take the price of New Zealand butter in England at the present time.  We never got as good a price for our butter in the English market as New Zealand got until Fianna Fáil came into power, but since we came into office we did get as good a price.  The price at present is from 68/- to 72/-  Suppose there were no tariffs and that Cumann na nGaedheal were back in power, in friendly relations with England once more&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am just mentioning facts as they would have been if the Deputy had his wish of having Cumann na nGaedheal in power.  His creamery would be getting 68/- on the British market&mdash;I suppose the same price would apply here.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not Danish.  I was referring to New Zealand butter, and Cumann na nGaedheal never did as good as that.  Danish butter is up to 90/-.  New Zealand is from 68/- to 72/-, and Australian butter is lower in price.  So that, if Cumann na nGaedheal were in power, the price would be 68/-.  Deduct 20/- from that for creamery expenses and Deputy Curran would be getting 2d. a gallon for his milk.</P>

      <P>Deputy Curran makes the contribution that if his creamery had no levy or bounty&mdash;under present conditions, I take it&mdash;things would be better for them.  He wants to let other creameries pay the levy and to let his creamery be exempt.  The whole principle of this stabilisation scheme is that for all butter produced you pay so <Col N="1245" /> much money into the pool, and for all butter exported you take the total amount out of the pool.  Unless all the butter produced pays into the pool, the amount to be extracted by those exporting will not be as high, so that the prices go down all round.  Unless every creamery comes into it, there is no doubt that the price of butter will fall.  There is no way out of that. Deputy Curran says the price of butter is too high to the poor in this country. That is quite true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a great thing if butter could be cheaper.  The strange thing about it, however, is that there has been an increase in the consumption of creamery butter in this country during the last two years.  So that if the price of butter is higher than it was under Cumann na nGaedheal the only possible explanation is that we have not as many poor people in this country, or that the poor are better off, because they are consuming more butter.  Deputy Curran will not admit that.  He says they paid 4d. in his creamery.  He is a member of the committee of that creamery, and I want to remind him that they paid a very bad price.  They should have paid more than 4d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, where they are badly managed.  Where they are well managed they pay more.  The average price is a bit above 4d., and it is obvious, therefore, that the well-managed creamery is giving a good lot above 4d. and the badly-managed creamery is giving below 4d.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is time for us to be amazed in that case.  The Deputy asks why was not this duty put on under <Col N="1246" /> the Imposition of Duties Act.  It was put on in that way at this time last year.  After the eight months we did not require it and under that Act it lapsed, because it is only operative for eight months unless confirmed by the Dáil.  We did not require it after eight months so we let it lapse.  I do not know whether it is good legal advice or not, but I am advised I should not try that a second time and I came to the Dáil.  I am very glad that I did come to the Dáil because the two enlightening speeches of Deputies Curran and Dillon should really go on record.  They will be most useful for Fianna Fáil at the next election, if we have not to use them sooner.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon wants to know how we did on the German butter.  I told him on that occasion how we did on the German butter.  I told him that he would be amazed if he knew how well we did.  He comes back and asks what did we get.  If he looks up the returns, whether of exports or imports or output or production in this country, he will notice that where there is only one firm involved the name of that firm could not be given, because one particular firm does not like to have its business disclosed.  In this particular case we do not mind.  The Dairy Disposals Board's accounts will be audited&mdash;not of course for the year 1933-34 in the year 1932&mdash;they will be audited the year after, not the year before.  The Deputy will then have an opportunity of seeing how we did on the German butter.  We consulted the person in Germany to whom we sold the butter.  We told him that there was a rather curious Deputy in the Dáil who wanted to get more information and we asked him if he had any particular objection to our giving the information.  He said he had absolutely no objection to my giving the information to the Deputy in confidence, but he objected to the information being given to the Dáil.  I am prepared to give that information to any Deputy who comes to me and he can see how we did on the German butter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because I was told by the buyer of that butter in Germany that <Col N="1247" /> he did not want it discussed publicly, but he was prepared to let me give it to any Deputy.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not bother very much about them.  Deputy Dillon says the accounts of this transaction in the Appropriation Accounts are very perplexing. I must make some sort of an appeal to the Comptroller and Auditor-General to simplify these accounts in future for Deputies of the calibre of Deputy Dillon, but I think most Deputies will understand those accounts if they look through them.  I do not think there is anything difficult about them.  The Deputy wants to know how much butter we exported, the price, and the bounty paid.  The bounty paid is the bounty payable under the Act.  The bounty under the Stabilisation Act must be paid when butter is exported.  On the other hand, there is in addition to that a Government subsidy.  That was not paid because it was not necessary.  That was a matter of 30/- at least that we saved on the German butter.  In addition to that, the Dairy Disposals Board made a very good profit on the butter exported to Germany.  So that really this alternative market, which meets with the sneers and the contempt of the people opposite as compared with the great British market, in the case of butter at any rate, was a better market than the British market for that particular deal last year.  What it may be in this coming year I do not know.</P>

He has gone on to say that the price he got in the German or continental market yielded him, through the Dairy Disposals Board, a handsome profit.  I am now examining that market, and examining the veracity of that statement.  I refer to the transactions which took place during the financial year 1932-33.</P>

      <P>11,188 cwts. of butter were purchased for £66,000 and sold on commission to this continental agent for £39,936 2s. 9d.  The loss on this transaction was £31,389 17s. 10d.  We bought the butter at 119/4.  Our expenses in negotiating the sale of the butter were 8/-.  The gross cost of the butter was, therefore, 127/4.  We got for the butter delivered 71/4, so we lost on the butter 56/- per cwt.  That is the nature of the alternative market which is being provided for the farmers of this country by the Fianna Fáil organisation.  Will they allow us, on this occasion, to congratulate them? In view of the fact that those figures are available to the public in respect of the transactions in 1932-3, I think it is absolutely essential that the Minister should justify himself before the House in the statement that the Board made a profit on the butter transactions into which he entered during the year 1933-4.  He lost 56/- a cwt. in the previous year.  He says he made a profit this year.  I think the House is entitled to know how he did it.  I think the House is also entitled to know why it is that he furnishes the House with one version of the facts when he is speaking here, and, through <Col N="1252" /> their Committee on the Appropriation Accounts, with an entirely different version of the facts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the alternative market, the Minister said it was a better market than the British market.  I suppose in Fianna Fáil minds there are relative definitions of the word &ldquo;better&rdquo;.  To our minds a better market means a market in which one gets a better price, and in which one can at least sell an equal quantity of the commodity one is exporting. The House would like to be informed as to what amount of our butter would be accepted in the German market.  Is there any comparison at all between the amounts that would be accepted in Britain and in Germany?  I do not think the Minister can convince us that Germany will accept anything at all equivalent to the amount we could sell to Britain.  Some eight or nine months ago in a discussion on some other motion the Minister for Agriculture definitely promised, I think it was Deputy Dillon, that a day would be given for the discussion of the whole dairying question. We have never had a day since for that discussion.  I personally would like that the House would shortly be given an opportunity of discussing the dairying industry in full-not in regard to any particular item of it-because obviously to get into a discussion of all the particular items of the dairying industry to-day would be, if not out of order, inadvisable on this particular motion.  There are one or two things that I should like to make allusion to. One is the statement of the Minister that if certain things did not arise&mdash; if the economic war were not there and other things did not arise&mdash;the Irish farmer would be getting 68/- for his butter in Britain.  I should like definitely to deny that.  The price of Danish butter, on the average, in England&mdash;I cannot give the exact figure but I can give a rough calculation&mdash;was somewhere about 90/- or 92/- during the last 12 or 14 months.  The Minister was wrong when he said that we never approached the price of Danish <Col N="1253" /> butter.  We did approach the price of Danish butter during the Cumann na nGaedheal administration and if my memory serves me aright, on one occasion we even passed the price of Danish butter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall look up the matter, as I say, and send it to Deputy O Briain.  The fact remains that on one particular occasion, the price of Irish butter did pass the price of Danish butter, and it was never a terrible lot behind it.  One could assume that if everything was normal and if we had not all the disturbance that we have with England, we would have been getting somewhere around 80/- a cwt. for our butter in the English market.  We would be getting that price, with free trade, without the economic war and without, I dare say, the hostility there may be against us on the part of certain buyers in England, but it is inevitable that if you hit another man in the face, he will give some little delicate tip back, and I have no doubt that we possibly are suffering in that way in relation to the price we are getting for our butter in England.  The Minister said that we could not have provided anything equivalent to the fourpence per gallon <Col N="1254" /> for milk which they have provided. The Minister himself is giving a direct subsidy of 31/-.  I do not say that he always uses it, but he has the power to use it, and he uses most of it, and if we applied that, having a free market, and if we had not all this ridiculous fight that we have, to the current price of butter in England, we could produce the price of 4d. per gallon for the farmer, without any imposition on the home consumer. That is definite.  We could produce that without any imposition on the home consumer.  The Minister says that we all voted against the original Dairying Act.  We did not all do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some members who did not, but I should like to refresh the Minister's memory by stating that even though a few of us voted for the Minister we definitely expressed our opinion that the Act would not do fully what the Minister hoped it would do.  I, myself, asked the Minister, at the conclusion of that debate, if that particular Bill gave the creamery proprietor or the farmer any power that he had not already got from the Cosgrave Administration, and the Minister said that it did not, so that, in fact, all that that particular Dairy Produce Act did was to compel certain people to do something which they might have done freely.  Compulsion is not very useful in this country or any other, and compulsion did not do very much in this particular matter, because the Minister had to depart from this Act before it was very long in operation.  I do him the justice of saying that it was mainly the economic war that caused him to depart from it, but if it had not arisen the Minister would have been forced to take other measures to keep the price of butter up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to prolong the debate. It is not possible to go into the items of the dairying industry to which I particularly wish to allude.  I rose principally to try to induce the Minister to promise us a definite day on which we could thrash out the dairying industry between us once and for all, <Col N="1255" /> and examine where we are drifting and find out in what way we could better the situation generally.  One would like to go into the question of the sale of calves and, possibly, the sale of dairy cows.  I am not going to refer to them now, but one cannot discuss the dairying industry properly unless one goes into these matters.  On the butter question, however, I should like to state that if we had free sale in Britain, if there were no discrimination against Irish produce in Britain, the price we would receive for our best creamery butter would not be very much below what the Danish are receiving.  We, in this country, make quite good butter, and the Minister realises that; I think he said himself that the best Irish creamery butter is not surpassed by the best creamery butter of any other country.  With good circumstances and good salesmen and everything else required in relation to the sale of butter, our price would not be very much below the Danish price.  The price we would have been receiving in what I might call a free market would have been somewhere about 80/- a cwt.  A very small subsidy&mdash;£1 per cwt. or something equivalent to that&mdash;would have sufficed to keep the price of butter at the level at which it has been kept in this country without all the levies, bounties, a direct subsidy of 31/-, and without mulcting the consumer to the extent of 4d. or 5d. per lb.  I hope the Minister will say, definitely, that he will give a day for the discussion of the whole dairying industry, because, obviously, this is not a motion on which one could discuss all the ramifications of the dairying industry.</P>

He accused me of being a member of a very badly-managed creamery society.  I will produce my balance sheets to the Minister and he will find that it is not anything like what he says it is.  It is a reasonably well-managed creamery society. What I am personally concerned with is the price which the farmer gets for <Col N="1256" /> his milk.  I got 4d. last year, and that represents 10d. for the raw material&mdash; for the amount of milk that goes to make butter.</P>

      <P>Exactly.  That is what I am trying to bring about.  The Minister said that subsidy is not paid at all, so it seems that the producer is being mulcted for everything.  As I pointed out a while ago, we paid to the Minister's pool £5,256 and we got back only £2,000 odd.  That is not a very good proposition, so far as we are personally concerned.  The Minister is constantly asking for suggestions as to this, that and the other thing, and what I would suggest to the Minister is that he should give a direct subsidy and do away with the levy and bring the price up as a charge on the Central Fund or in some way other than the levy that is put on at present.  I do not mind what market you sell butter in so long as we get a price for it.  If the market is in Turkey, if it is better than the British market, that is the place to put it.  I do not care a twopenny ticket what market it is or where it is so long as the farmer is paid a decent price for the article he produces. That is all I am concerned with.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I was wrong in saying that the creamery of which Deputy Curran is a member is badly managed, but it was because I took an <i>a priori</i> view.  I thought it was badly managed when Deputy Curran said he was a member of the committee. I said there was no subsidy paid on butter going to Germany but there is a subsidy paid on butter going to Great Britain and other countries. The direct subsidy varied from 30/- a cwt. down to 24/- at one period of the year.  That item is costing this year £600,000.  If we were to do away with the levy and the bounty and replace that by a direct subsidy it would cost, roughly, £500,000 additional.  I am surprised at Deputy Curran advocating increased expenditure and increased taxation.  Deputy Dillon retreated from the 1933 position with regard to German butter.  He went back to the 1932 position and tried to make a point on that when he was dealing with the 1933 position.  When passing, he made a most unjustifiable attack on the German buyer who comes to this country to buy cattle. Whatever Deputy Dillon's feelings may be as between England and Germany, I think he should not make an attack on a buyer coming to this country to buy our cattle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Holohan will work himself up to make a speech some day.  The bounty was not payable on that particular consignment of butter in 1932, and if Deputy Dillon knew the law he would know that no bounty was payable on it because one of the provisions of the Stabilisation Act is that no bounty can be levied on butter on which a levy was not paid and no bounty can be payable on butter produced from the 1st December to the 31st March.  The export of butter in March, 1933, therefore, had no levy paid on it and it had no bounty paid on it, and the Comptroller and Auditor-General was right in saying that no bounty was paid on it.  Deputy Dillon has to be instructed on every point he brings forward.  The Deputy raises silly points and Ministers are always having to instruct him.  It is <Col N="1258" /> really a waste of time having such Deputies in the House.  The Deputy says we got only 71/4 for the butter sent to Germany.  The price in the British market was 66/-.  We got 71/4 for the butter exported to Germany. That was not very bad at all.  It was 5/4 a cwt. better than the British market.</P>

      <P>We will talk about everything that the Deputy mentions from the slaughter of calves to the slaughter of old cows, the price of butter and the price of eggs that Deputy Dillon was talking about in Glasgow.  The price of Danish butter was always above the price of Irish butter.  I am quite certain if the Deputy will go back and examine the prices from 1923 to 1931, for the period the late Government were in control, he will see I am right.  It must be admitted that when the late Government were in control they did quite a lot to improve the quality of butter in this country but I think the Deputy will find that at no period did the price of Irish butter come within 14/- a cwt. of the Danish butter.  The average difference would <Col N="1259" /> be 23/- a cwt.  I am giving these figures from memory but I know they are correct.  At no time did they come within 14/- of the Danish price.  Deputy Bennett said it is all very well to talk about the price of butter in Germany being better than the English price. But could we get better terms if there had been no difficulties about imports? We are getting into Germany with a certain amount of butter and, as far as the amount we are sending, we are doing well with it.  He says if we were on better terms with England we would possibly get better prices than we get, and that hitting a man a slap in the face will not induce him to give you a good price for what he is buying. I read a paragraph in the London <i>Times</i> of the 14th of March, and it will show you what the people who do not hit England a slap in the face are getting.  This paragraph says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;At the suggestion of the Prime Minister of New Zealand (Mr. Forbes) a round table conference assembled at Parliament House to-day to consider the plight of the dairy farmers owing to the serious fall in the prices on the British market and to attempt to devise a workable method to improve their position.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Prime Minister presided and read telegrams which had passed between the New Zealand and the British Governments in respect of quantitative restriction of dairy imports.  New Zealand asked whether the adoption of a practically free tariff on British goods would enable New Zealand produce to obtain a free entry in the British market.  Great Britain replied that tariff and quota problems were quite separate.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In other words, they do the same to New Zealand as they do to the people who give them a slap in the face.  They said that whether you take off the tariffs or not we are not going to allow your dairy products in free either quantitatively or free of duty.  The paragraph continues:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The British Government were committed to a policy of regulating imports.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="1260" /> That was the result of the advance on the part of the New Zealand Government towards the British Government.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Electoral (Revision of Constituencies) Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The two Articles of the Constitution which specially relate to the composition of the Dáil are Articles 26 and 27. The first of these Articles fixes the total membership, exclusive of university representatives, at not less than one member for each 30,000 of the population, nor more than one member for each 20,000.  The second Article entitles each university to be represented by three Deputies.  Under Article 26 the number of Deputies is to be fixed from time to time by law&mdash; the Oireachtas is to revise the constituencies&mdash;the proportion between the number of members to be elected for each constituency and the population of each constituency as ascertained at the last preceding census is, so far as possible, to be identical throughout the country&mdash;and the election is to be according to the principles of proportional representation.</P>
      <P>The presumption from the Article of the Constitution is that there are, in fact, to be local constituencies, and that it is the Government's duty to submit to the Oireachtas from time to time such proposals for revision of the constituencies as may appear desirable or necessary following ascertainment at census of population.  The first Schedule to the present Bill sets out the proposed readjustments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1261" /> The census figures disclosed that, to comply with the requirements of the Constitution, considerable changes would have to be made in the existing scheme of representation.  On the basis of the 1926 figures, in no fewer than 13 constituencies out of the 28 was the population per Deputy less than 20,000, and in five of these the figure was less than 19,000.</P>
    <P>Since the present Government came into power the question of revision has been under consideration in so far as time would permit.  Owing to the calls of other business as well as the difficulties met with in evolving a scheme which would comply with the Constitution and at the same time be workable, it was not possible until now to introduce this measure.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides for the election of 136 Deputies to Dáil Eireann for borough and county constituencies.  A proposal to reduce the number to 100 was rejected after full and serious consideration. It was clear that having regard to the volume of work performed by the Deputies, their various commitments, the amount of their correspondence and the time spent in travelling, such reduction in membership was not feasible, and with a view of securing that the reduction we have made should not press too heavily on Deputies, it was also considered advisable to reduce the size of the constituencies. This arrangement will, it is felt, enable Deputies to keep more in personal contact with their constituents and has been achieved by sub-dividing the larger counties and leaving smaller counties, wherever possible, intact.</P>
    <P>In the constituency Schedule the administrative county has been taken as the foundation.  The sub-division of the larger counties is in accordance with the practice which has been noticed heretofore in larger constituencies of voluntary allotment of particular areas as between Deputies.  When counties have a population between 50,000 and 60,000 there would proportionately be under-representation with two members and over-representation with three members, and there was really no alternative to making such additions or divisions as appeared to commend <Col N="1262" /> themselves so as to secure compliance with the requirements of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Out of the 31 administrative county areas in An Saorstát&mdash;27 counties and four county boroughs&mdash;19 such administrative areas have been kept intact, viz.:&mdash;County Boroughs: Cork, Limerick and Waterford.  Counties: Dublin, Louth, Meath, Longford, Monaghan, Cavan, Leitrim, Clare, Tipperary (North Riding), Leix, Offaly, Kildare, Kilkenny, Wicklow, Wexford and Waterford.</P>
    <P>The following counties, which have been sub-divided for the reasons stated, have kept their outside boundaries intact: Mayo, Donegal and Kerry.  In the case of nine administrative county areas it was necessary to add portions thereof to adjoining areas in the process of framing an equitable scheme of representation in accordance with the Constitution.  These county areas are: Carlow, Cork, Westmeath, Roscommon, Sligo, Galway, Limerick, Tipperary, Dublin County Borough.</P>
    <P>And here I take the opportunity of referring to the amendment which Deputy MacDermot has tabled, in which he alleges that the Bill, by gratuitously mutilating county units, violates both administrative convenience and historical sentiment.</P>
    <P>It does not appear that administrative convenience is violated.  Quite the contrary.  The provisions for the appointment of returning officers and assistant returning officers set out in the Second Schedule of the Bill, coupled with the establishment of smaller constituencies, are calculated to ensure much greater administrative convenience than obtained heretofore. Furthermore, the local registers of electors are so framed that no difficulty on that head can arise in the case of divided counties.  In no case outside Dublin has a district electoral division been divided, and in Dublin no difficulty is anticipated in so far as the register is concerned.</P>
    <P>As regards the Deputy's contention that the scheme violates historical sentiment, I assume that he means by the term &ldquo;historical sentiment&rdquo; that feeling which arises in all societies <Col N="1263" /> from a community of interests over a certain more or less prolonged period. I would not disagree with the Deputy on the point that a certain community of interest and tradition exists in our modern counties, but I think it would be overstating the case to say that we have in our counties that recognised corporate personality which we find in many of our boroughs.  But, however that may be, it would not be possible in framing our schemes of representation, having regard to the exigencies of the Constitution, to take cognisance in every instance of such local circumstances as might be held to generate historical sentiment.</P>
    <P>I might in this connection suggest to the Deputy that if we were to follow logically on the lines of historical sentiment we might find reason for departing from the county basis to a much greater extent than we have done.  The division of this country into counties has no roots in native organisation, being undertaken by the Norman and later invaders as a gradual process for the breaking up of national polity and the substitution of English methods of organisation, and in this light it might be held that the historical sentiment attaching to county areas is not so evident or so universal as the Deputy, in his solicitude therefor, appears to think.  If we were to allow historical sentiment to be our infallible guide in carving out constituencies, we might seek to go back to the old divisions which obtained here before, let us say, the Battle of Kinsale.</P>
    <P>We have not, however, been altogether unmindful of such historical sentiment or communal political personality as may be said to attach to county areas&mdash;and this appears more evident in some areas than in others&mdash; and in framing our scheme to meet the Constitutional requirements we do not think we have been guilty of any such violation as the Deputy alleges in his amendment.  As I have already said, we have followed the existing county area wherever practicable, and Deputy MacDermot, in suggesting that the county units have been gratuitously mutilated shows, to say the least, that <Col N="1264" /> he has not a deep knowledge of the complexity of the subject.  I move the Second Reading.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the amendment standing in my name:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete all words the after word &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;the Dáil declines to give a Second Reading to a Bill which by gratuitously mutilating county units violates both administrative convenience and historical sentiment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>A few minutes ago the Minister for Agriculture alleged that he was struck by the number of members of the Opposition who were coming round to approve of Fianna Fáil policies, and I could not help wondering whether he was referring to Fianna Fáil policies as they existed before the general election or to Fianna Fáil policies as they exist to-day.  This Bill is a case in point.  Until they came into power the Fianna Fáil Party were very free with their promises about saving money on the Oireachtas, and they urged that the Dáil could very suitably be composed of 100 members and no more. The first thing, therefore, by which one is struck in relation to this Bill, is not what is in it, but rather the fact that the Fianna Fáil Party have made no attempt to implement their policy in that respect.  Their conduct in that matter is analogous to their conduct in the matter of the Seanad.  We used to hear of the great saving that was to be made for the country by the abolition of the Seanad, and they departed from the policy of abolishing the Seanad in favour of a policy by which the expense remains the same, but by which the Seanad is deprived of effective powers. So, here, also, in connection with the Dáil, they have no intention whatever, apparently, of diminishing the country's expenses or of reducing the number of political vocations open to supporters of their Party.  As far as I can make out, they have reduced, in fact, the Dáil, under this Bill, not an inch further than they were absolutely compelled to reduce it by the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1265" /> I find that, in a way, I am an especially appropriate person to be leading the opposition to this Bill, because of all the provinces in Ireland the one that it is most unfair to is Connaught, and of all the counties in Ireland the one that it is most unfair to is the county that I have the honour to represent, Roscommon.  One bit of Connaught has been handed over to Munster and another bit of Connaught has been handed over to Leinster.  The representation of Connaught is being reduced from 29 Deputies to 24, and, whereas hitherto there has been one Deputy per 21,000 persons in Connaught, henceforth there is to be only one Deputy per 23,000 persons in Connaught.  Of all the counties in Ireland, Roscommon is to be the one where there is to be the smallest amount of representation per person.  It is going to take 23,782 persons in County Roscommon to furnish one Deputy, whereas in County Wexford it is only going to take 20,358 persons to provide one Deputy.  I cannot help inquiring the reason for the implied insult to the intelligence of County Roscommon and to the value of County Roscommon voters' opinions.</P>
    <P>The Minister alleges that it is quite superficial to imagine that there is no necessity for the kind of mutilation that is proposed.  Now, in County Roscommon there is a population, according to the 1926 census, of 83,500 persons.  What is wrong with that? Why cannot the county stand as it is? It can perfectly well furnish four members as at present without any violation of the provisions in the Constitution to which the Minister has referred.  Instead of leaving us alone, however, we are to have a section taken away and handed over to the new Athlone-Longford combination, and about 12,000 of our people are to be taken away from the county.</P>

      <P>I have the figures of the census here before me, and the population is given as 83,556.  Sligo, I admit, is a more difficult problem.  The figure does not fit in so well for Sligo to stand by itself.  However, while I quite admit that in some cases two counties may have to be thrown together, or even three counties may have to be thrown together, I think that that is a matter that is altogether different in principle from slicing up a county and destroying the county unity.  The most extreme case of destroying the county unity is that of Carlow, which is chopped up into small pieces and distributed all round; but all the cases under this Bill seem to me to be objectionable.  I object to a bit of Galway being handed over to Clare, and a bit of Sligo being handed over to Leitrim, and I object to the town of Youghal being handed over to County Waterford.  The Minister has not condescended to give the House any information that would tend to convince us that these peculiar dispositions were justified.  The Minister speaks of there being no administrative inconvenience, but the only administrative convenience or inconvenience that he has dealt with has been in relation to the actual conduct of elections.  That is not what is in my mind.  What is in my mind is that counties have got county interests, and that you will have in future, if this Bill goes through, counties divided against themselves.  You will have county councillors, say, belonging to the Roscommon County Council, who, for the purposes of the Dáil election, belong to Athlone-Longford, and the people of each county will not have what they are entitled to expect, and that is a harmonious machinery in existence, alike in the county council and in their representation in the Dáil, for seeing that the county gets a fair deal in any matters that may crop up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister makes light of county boundaries and says that they are not very deeply rooted in the past.  The historical sentiment we have to deal with is that which actually operates in the mind of our people, and there is no doubt, I think&mdash;certainly, in my experience, I have always found it to <Col N="1267" /> be so&mdash;that there is a very strong county feeling among the people.  In fact, it may be almost too strong.  I think that the people of one county are very apt to blaze up in jealousy over this, that, or the other matter against the people of another county.  None the less, it is a respectable sentiment, founded in a sufficiently long historical tradition, and I can see no reason why that sentiment should be derided.  I am quite sure that the people of the counties affected resent the proposed changes.  I know that, at any rate, two of them&mdash;the Roscommon County Council and, I think, the Youghal Urban Council&mdash;have passed strong resolutions to that effect.  I do not know about the others, but it would not surprise me to hear that some of the others have protested also.  I think that what the Minister should do is to withdraw this Bill until he has had time to study it with a great deal more care than he, evidently, has studied it up to the present, and that he should consider whether it might not be possible to comply with the Constitution by throwing together such counties as have to be thrown together, but not by cutting up any county&mdash;that he should leave each county its individuality. I urge that on general principles.  I urge it also, in particular, as a Connaught man, as Deputy for County Roscommon, and as one bred in County Sligo; so that I feel my sentiments especially assailed by the principles of this Bill.  I say &ldquo;principles&rdquo; of this Bill, but really I have some difficulty in discovering what is the principle of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Government, I understand, are in favour of proportional representation. All experts and enthusiasts on proportional representation agree that for the proportional representation system to work in the way it is intended to work, constituencies must be large, returning, each constituency, a considerable number of members.  I do not propose to weary the House or to confuse myself with arithmetical demonstrations of that, but I state it quite confidently, as something on which the proportional representation experts are agreed, that for minorities <Col N="1268" /> to have a good chance of representation, for it to be possible for individuals to break through the meshes of the big party machines and to get elected, large constituencies, returning a considerable number of members, are desirable.  Therefore, if the Government is honestly in favour of proportional representation I submit that it is acting wrongly in making smaller constituencies than we have at the present time; that, on the contrary, it should have gone in the direction of enlarging the constituencies.  It would, of course, as I pointed out, be quite possible to enlarge constituencies by throwing several counties together without cutting up any one county. Alternatively, if the Government is not really in favour of proportional representation, and it wants to get back to something more like what existed before, it might have created single-member constituencies.  I rather feel that single-member constituencies give as good an opportunity as anything else for an individual to break in, in spite of the party machine.</P>
    <P>I myself deplore the fact that politics tend to get more and more in the grip of party machines, and I should like to feel that it was possible for a man through local popularity, local influence, and the knowledge his neighbours have of him, to be able to take an independent line and to get into the Dáil from time to time in spite of the big parties.  My feeling is that that could, perhaps, be accomplished under proportional representation, carried out to its logical conclusion, with large constituencies, or also that it could be achieved by single member constituencies, where in a small area a man could get very well known and highly esteemed.  I feel that the scheme which the Government is adopting falls between two stools.  I do not know whether it is what they intend, but I am afraid that it will have the effect of making the tyranny of the big party machines more all-embracing than ever.</P>
    <P>It is a little, perhaps, outside the scope of this Bill, but not I think so far outside as to be against the rules of order, to remark that in the working <Col N="1269" /> of proportional representation I should like to see it forbidden for the party machines to instruct people in a constituency that in this section of it they are to place a party's candidates in one order and in another section to place them in another order.  That appears to me to be a mechanisation of politics which is really against the spirit of proportional representation itself.</P>
    <P>I do not think that this is a Bill which ought to meet with the approval of the House.  I do not think it ought to meet, especially, with the approval of small parties like the Labour Party. I do not think it ought to meet with the approval of Independent members, or of anybody who, like myself, once was in the enviable position of being an Independent member.</P>

In other words one is inclined to feel that this Bill is a bit of what is called gerrymandering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps it is not amiss to remind the House of the history of the gentleman who gave his name to that process&mdash; Mr. Elbridge Gerry.  Mr. Elbridge Gerry was a democratic politician in America in the years immediately succeeding the revolutionary war.  Immediately after the American revolution, power was in the hands of Washington and Alexander Hamilton, who, of course, had distinguished themselves tremendously in the revolutionary war and were very able statesmen.  But, in spite of the enthusiasm of victory, American politics became almost immediately exceedingly bitter, and Washington and Alexander Hamilton were frequently attacked for being bad <Col N="1270" /> Americans and next door to traitors, especially on the ground that they had not kept up sufficient quarrels with England and, above all, on the ground that they were so unpatriotic as to wish to adhere to the financial arrangements which had been embodied in the Anglo-American Treaty.</P>

      <P>Mr. Elbridge Gerry was one of the patriots who regarded George Washington and Alexander Hamilton as little better than traitors. Mr. Elbridge Gerry, when he became Governor of New York, or something or other in New York State, devised a new arrangement of constituencies.  It was after the Democrats got into power and Alexander Hamilton and Washington, I think, were both dead. He devised a new arrangement of constituencies which was designed to perpetuate the power of the Democrats. A map or sketch of one of the more eccentric of these constituencies was hanging up in the office of one of Mr. Gerry's opponents as an exhibit.  The well-known American artist, Gilbert Stuart, walked into the office, saw this thing hanging there, and said: &ldquo;What in Heaven's name is that?  It looks like a salamander,&rdquo; to which the owner of the office replied: &ldquo;No, it is not a salamander, it is a gerrymander.&rdquo; That is the origin of the word &ldquo;gerrymander.&rdquo; Looking at the eccentric constituency of Longford-Athlone, which twists round at the bottom and takes in a bit of Westmeath, twists up and captures a bit of my constituency of Roscommon, I think that the remark applied to Mr. Elbridge Gerry's constituency might be applied to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am 100 per cent. a parliamentarian and a democrat.  I have no sympathy with the language used by some of our eager young men, which seems to suggest that democracy and parliamentarianism are played out and that we are to substitute some entity called a corporative state or what not. I believe in parliamentarianism and, as a believer in parliamentarianism, I am very jealous of anything being <Col N="1271" /> done which tends to undermine the authority of parliament and the respect of the people for parliament.  I think that having established an electoral scheme the less one interferes with it the better, because, otherwise, it may become the practice of contending parties to seize every opportunity to revise the scheme in the interests of their own party.  It may be that we have reached a stage when we ought seriously to consider whether or not proportional representation is something that ought to be a part of our permanent constitution.  That is another question.  For the moment we are supposed to be carrying on with proportional representation.  If that is so, I think that this Bill should have been arranged on a different basis; that constituencies should have been enlarged rather than diminished, and that nothing should have been done&mdash; nothing need have been done, and I think nothing should have been done&mdash; to cut up the historical county units to which a great deal of genuine and quite reasonable and respectable sentiment does attach.  Accordingly, I move the amendment standing in my name, and I hope that before our debate is closed the Government may go the length of undertaking to withdraw the Bill, and reconsider the question in the light of the suggestions I have just made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to support the amendment proposed by Deputy MacDermot.  Like him, I have been wondering what the principle is at the back of the Bill which advocates the mutilation of county units.  There is no other Minister in the Government who so insists upon the working of the county unit as the Minister for Local Government himself.  He understands how necessary it is for practically all rating purposes that the county should be worked as one unit.  Consequently I think that a departure from this in the case of parliamentary representation is a very bad mistake.  We have the county council working for the whole administrative county; the county board of health, the county committee of agriculture, and the county vocational education committee.  All those <Col N="1272" /> local authorities are in some way or another connected.  You have Government grants coming to them, and very often certain representations have to be made at the office by the Deputies for the county with regard to those grants.  In that respect the mutilation of the county, unless it was an absolute necessity, ought not to have been ventured upon.</P>
      <P>I have been wondering if some mistake has not been made in the Local Government Department with regard to the mutilation of the County Roscommon, particularly since the Minister for Local Government questioned the figures of Deputy MacDermot.  The figures as supplied by the last census were 83,556 for Roscommon.  Roscommon County Council passed a resolution on this matter.  That county council is not by any means onesided politically.  Notwithstanding that, it passed a resolution very strongly condemning the mutilation of the county. I was amazed&mdash;when that resolution was sent to the four Deputies for Roscommon, asking them to use their influence to see that the county was not mutilated&mdash;to see the reply that came from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  It again, I think, proves that there must have been some mistake about the figures.  The figures for Roscommon, according to the last census, were 83,556.</P>

      <P>With four representatives that was one Deputy for each 20,889 of the population.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, in his reply, said that the population was too high for three and too low for four. As a matter of fact, he is wrong in both cases.  We are quite prepared to do with three Deputies in Roscommon, or with two Deputies in Roscommon, but we ought to be left Roscommon. The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, wherever he got his information, was absolutely wrong.  Not being over 90,000 the framers of the Bill could have made us do with three, but being over 80,000 we were entitled to four; so he was wrong in both.  Further to those figures, under the new arrangement the portion of Roscommon which remains will have <Col N="1273" /> 23,782 people for each Deputy.  Under the old arrangement it had 20,889. Wexford, under the new arrangement, will have one Deputy for every 20,358, which is a lesser number than Roscommon had under the old arrangement. In Roscommon four Deputies would be representing a greater number than in Wexford under the new arrangement.</P>
      <P>There is a group of counties which we must take and consider under the new Bill&mdash;Roscommon, Westmeath, Longford and Meath.  That is a group which has, under the new arrangement, got mixed up.  Taking the whole group together, under the old arrangement as existing to-day, they sent back 12 Deputies to this House.  The new arrangement provides that they will send back one less, that is 11.  The obvious place to find that one less was in Longford-Westmeath constituency, which returns five.  It had one Deputy to every 19,333 of the population, which it was not entitled to have under the Act.  That was the obvious thing to do. Instead of doing that a slice has been taken out of Roscommon and a slice out of Westmeath and added into Longford. Instead of leaving Meath to itself with its three members, they have a piece of Westmeath thrown in and get five.  That reduces the number to 11. The same 11 could have been got in the way I suggested, which was the obvious thing to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking about this matter to a colleague of mine from Roscommon some time ago&mdash;Deputy O'Dowd&mdash;he said that a representation of four or a grouping of four seats did not give any fair result of proportional representation. It does not give as good a result, I admit, as five or probably a larger number, but it certainly gives a very much better result than three.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce does not seem to agree with me.  In Roscommon last year Deputy O'Dowd pointed out that a representation of two for each Party was not warranted on the voting.  The following was the voting: There were 23,000 odd against 17,000 odd.  That gave two each.  That was allowing for 40,000 or 41,000 people voting.  There are some six or seven thousand votes being taken off us. <Col N="1274" /> Suppose the voting in Roscommon is 34,001 next time, and of that 34,001 you have 17,001 voting on one side and 17,000 voting on the other side.  The 17,001 would get 100 per cent. greater representation in a three seat constituency than the 17,000.  In other words, where you have a three seat constituency the Party that has one of a majority will get two seats against one seat to the other Party.  That is as near as you can possibly get to defeating proportional representation.  This new constituency which is suggested in Roscommon starts at the boundary in Ballinasloe, within, I think, some thirty odd miles of Galway Harbour, and extends to the borders of Ulster and Cavan.  There are 12,200 odd of the population of Roscommon being transferred to that new constituency.  The boundary between Roscommon and Leinster all along there is not an imaginary boundary at all.  It is the boundary of the Shannon, and there is absolutely no communication whatever between those 12,200 in Roscommon and the people in Leinster except one bridge 20 feet wide in Athlone.  The boundaries that exist in most counties where there is no river dividing them are, to a very large extent, imaginary boundaries, if you like.  The roads intersect and the people mix together at the fairs and markets, but I do not think you could get&mdash;I do not think you could dream of&mdash;a more aggravated case than the case of Roscommon, where you take 12,000 people and put them into a constituency with which, if you like, they have nothing in common. They do not know the people; they do not mix with the people; they do not attend the same fairs or markets, and their interests, as a matter of fact, are entirely different.  If the Minister for Local Government and the present Government are anxious to retain Parliamentary systems as they exist to-day.  I think that even they will admit that, for the sake of political parties, no matter who they are, the county unit is the best.  Take, for instance, this new constituency to which I have referred.  If you want a register of voters you will have to go to Roscommon for a portion of it, to <Col N="1275" /> Mullingar for another portion, and to Longford for a third portion.  That is the position.</P>
    <P>I think that in relation to this grouping of counties Roscommon, Westmeath, Longford and Meath, when it can be solved so simply and the same result achieved as the Minister proposes to achieve by this Bill, the Minister ought to reconsider the whole Bill.  I think he ought to agree to Deputy MacDermot's suggestion, and withdraw the Bill for further consideration, because county boundaries are important.  We have had the Government quite recently reviving old territorial boundaries for the purposes of the new Army.  We have the Oriel regiment, the Breffni regiment, the Desmond regiment, the Ossory regiment and the Thomond regiment, and mind you, the outlines of these boundaries do not matter one hoot to the people, but the county boundary does matter a whole lot for administrative purposes.  I am sure that nobody knows better than the Minister that the county unit is as important as it is.  He has quite recently, I understand, circularised our county with regard to the wiping out of district charges and stating that they must all be made county at large charges.  I agree with him, but I think he ought to go a step further in regard to this Bill, and that in the light of these figures he should withdraw the Bill and come back with other proposals preserving county boundaries, so far as he possibly can.  As Deputy MacDermot pointed out, there is not really very much, or any, injury being done where two counties, or three, if necessary, are thrown together, so long as you do not mutilate the county, but where you have to take a piece out of a county&mdash;like the case of Roscommon which I have mentioned, where you take a piece of Connaught and throw it into Leinster with a boundary like the Shannon between them&mdash;I think it is an outrage on the people, and the Minister would be very well advised at this stage in withdrawing the Bill and bringing back something on which we could all agree.</P>
    <P>After all, this matter of representation <Col N="1276" /> is not, or, at least, ought not, to be a Party matter, and if any attempt has been made at gerrymandering, I think it would be a very difficult thing to do, because even Deputies like Deputy Corry and myself do not know how soon our constituents may turn against us.  What we think would be quite a good thing to do to-day might be a bad thing politically to-morrow, so far as the revision of constituencies is concerned.  I think the Minister ought to try to bring in an agreed measure.  We are all quite agreeable to reduce the membership of this House in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, but some of us certainly protest very strongly against the mutilation of counties.  I make a personal protest against the manner in which the county which I have the honour to represent is mutilated. Under this new arrangement, the population of Roscommon per Deputy will be the highest of any constituency in the whole Saorstát, notwithstanding the fact that it was entitled to have its four Deputies as it stood.  On the whole, I think we have a very genuine grievance in our county, and I should like to hear from the Minister his decision to reconsider the whole matter and submit it to the House again in the form of an agreed measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Because that is what is going to happen, in fact, in respect of some of these particular constituencies. Every effort to tear down constituencies in order to ensure that they will elect three or four members is an attempt to restrict the principle of proportional representation.  If we believe in proportional representation &mdash;and we have had declarations from the Government Benches that they do believe in proportional representation; the present Minister for Industry and Commerce told us not so very long ago about the virtues of that system, and I agree that there are very many more virtues in it than in the principle of the single direct vote method of electing Deputies&mdash;and if that principle is to be maintained, the aim ought to be to create fairly large constituencies, so as to make it possible for constituents to give effect in an adequate manner to the principle of proportional representation, from the standpoint of electing, in proportion to their strength in the community, those elements which seek the suffrages of the electorate on polling day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that under this Bill an unnecessary amount of carving and paring has been done, and I cannot understand it even from the point of view of administrative convenience or even from the point of view of any factor which should weigh in the creation of constituencies.  We have got, for instance, the case of the County Limerick.  The County Limerick would be entitled to retain its seven Deputies if it were retained as the County Limerick. Instead it is cut into two. Though it has a population sufficient to justify the election of seven Deputies it is cut into two constituencies of three <Col N="1278" /> each.  It is proposed to allow the whole County Limerick to be divided into two sections to elect three Deputies for one section and three Deputies for the other.  What case has been made for doing that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see any good reason for doing that.  I can only see one reason, and that is that while pretending to give lip service to the principle of proportional representation the Government is, in fact, doing everything possible to limit the operation of the principle of proportional representation and get back to the principle of two big Parties.  Will somebody tell us if that is the object of this Bill? Nobody is prepared to say that.  Somebody might tell us that the object of this Bill is to create two big Parties, and to cut out all minorities so that the people must all line up either on one side or another, though they know that both sides have not the kind of policies that the minorities want. Then we will understand what is behind it.  If the purport of this Bill is to shepherd the electorate into either the Fianna Fáil or the Fine Gael camp I could understand it.  But I am greatly afraid that that is the object of the Bill.  Judging it by the amount of unnecessary carving that is being done that seems to be the motive force behind the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the case of Donegal, another constituency cut in two merely for the sake of electing three Deputies for one part and four for another.  Then we have got the County Galway cut in two for the purpose of electing three Deputies for one portion of the county and four for the other constituency. We have Tipperary cut in two for the purpose of electing three Deputies for one constituency and three for the other.  We have got Kerry cut in two for the purpose of electing three members for each constituency.  When we come to Dublin we have North Dublin and South Dublin and both these constituencies have been cut in two.  It seems to me that somebody had a knife when they were considering this Bill and that somebody feared that it would <Col N="1279" /> be a shame if he did not use that knife.  And so he used it.  The use of the knife cannot be explained by the Minister except on the basis of putting the electorate of the country into one political party or another.  What is the case for cutting up the County Limerick into two parts?  The county is being cut into two, is being deprived of its right to elect seven Deputies, and is being confined to six.  We have got the same position in the County Tipperary which is also cut into two and the people denied an opportunity of returning seven Deputies.</P>
    <P>Is the plea made that these constituencies are big and that they must be cut in two?  If that is so I do not see why a constituency like Clare is allowed to stand as it is and continue to return five Deputies; nor why a constituency like West Cork, 120 miles in length is allowed to remain as one. It is much more difficult to travel in West Cork or Clare than it is in Limerick or Tipperary.  Limerick and Tipperary are very much better served in the matter of transport than West Cork or Clare.  I cannot understand the Bill from the standpoint of travelling or locomotion.  And on what ground is it sought to leave West Cork and Clare as they are and to cut up Limerick and Tipperary?  Travelling is much easier in Tipperary and Limerick than in either Clare or West Cork.</P>
    <P>What case can be advanced for cutting up Dublin North and South?  You can travel all over the whole of North Dublin for 3d. or 4d. in a tram or bus. A sum of 3d. or 4d. will take you around the whole of South Dublin, or you can see the whole of each constituency by getting up on top of a high building.  No adequate plea can be advanced for carving up North Dublin or South Dublin merely on the score that it is a big administrative unit. You can go around either of these constituencies in a tram or bus or even walk round them in a couple of hours. I can only suggest that if North City and South City are being cut up it is in order to do away with the spirit of proportional representation and to <Col N="1280" /> shepherd into one or other of the two big Parties the electors of the State. I think it is unfair if the Government still believe in the desirability of maintaining proportional representation that they should do this thing.  I think they should preserve intact electoral units such as Donegal, Galway, Limerick, Tipperary, Kerry.  North Dublin might be allowed to continue as one constituency and so should South Dublin because even as one constituency North Dublin will only return eight Deputies and South Dublin seven Deputies.  In any case the maintenance of the unit which will elect seven members is very much preferable from the point of view of giving fair play through the principle of proportional representation, to cutting it up into two and in effect doing away with the principle of proportional representation.</P>
    <P>We are prepared to support the general principle of revising constituencies. Any vote we give for the Second Reading of this Bill is being given conditional upon the Bill being amended in Committee so as to pre serve the principle of electoral units and preserve the principle of proportional representation.  If that is done the Labour Party is prepared to support the Bill.  But if it is proposed to carve constituencies then the Labour Party cannot see its way to give endorsement to that principle if the Minister wants to enshrine it in the Bill.  I again repeat that there is no case for carving up constituencies like Clare, Donegal, Cork, Galway or North or South Dublin.  There is no difficulty in maintaining them as single constituencies. I doubt if the Minister, before this Bill was thought of by the Government or by himself, had a single request from his own constituency to carve it up.  I do not know whether Deputy Traynor made any request asking that North Dublin should be cut up in two or whether the Minister himself, Deputy O'Kelly, made any representation to himself as Minister for Local Government and Public Health that he would like to see North Dublin cut up in two.  The Minister knows he got no such request, and everybody knows that no such request has come <Col N="1281" /> from the public or even from the Fianna Fáil Party itself.  This Bill is simply carving for the mere sake of carving and limiting the operations of the principle of proportional representation. If the Ministry still believe in that principle they ought to give evidence of the fact that they believe in it by leaving the larger electoral units as they are.  It would be possible for them to make a revision of the constituencies, to keep in mind the principle of proportional representation, and let its operation operate in that provision.</P>

      <P>Deputy Brennan spoke about an agreed measure for this purpose. You could not get an agreed measure, and that applies not merely to this Dáil but to any Dáil.  Members of the Dáil have been elected under a certain set of circumstances.  Some of them will consider that their chances of being elected again will depend upon the maintenance unchanged of the constituencies which elected them. It might be possible to get three or four Party organisers, not themselves members of the Dáil, to agree upon a Bill, but to expect that the individual members of each Party, some of whom are bound to be affected in their electoral prospects by any changes made in the constituencies, can reach agreement is asking too much.  There is only one wise course to take, and that is to fix the principles and to prepare the measure on those principles, leaving out of account, altogether, personal or Party considerations.  It is desirable that the membership should be reduced.  It is necessary under the Constitution to reduce the membership, in any case.  It is desirable so far as possible to preserve county boundaries.  It is desirable to have the constituencies reasonably small in size, and it is desirable not to have too many constituencies electing an even number of Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1282" /> Let us take these matters in order. Deputy MacDermot argued that this Bill represented in some way a departure from Fianna Fáil's original policy. We contended in the past that 100 members would be quite adequate to do the work of the Dáil.  We still contend that, but having regard to the provisions of the Constitution and having regard to the diversity of interests in different counties and having regard to administrative difficulties, it is not at the moment practicable to get down to a membership of 100.  We are, however, moving in that direction, and a number of the changes which are being criticised here are changes which permit of reductions in the total number that might not otherwise be possible.  We have tried to preserve the county boundaries.  Applying the principles which I have enunciated, we have in all cases endeavoured to preserve the county boundaries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We have succeeded remarkably well.  Let other Deputies applying these principles get a map of Ireland, and see if they can work out a better scheme and maintain the county boundaries.  It is easy enough to maintain county boundaries by taking two counties, adding them together, noting the population and deciding on a definite number of Deputies to be elected irrespective of other considerations.  But there are other considerations that must apply and, if these are applied, then it will be found impossible to preserve county boundaries to any greater extent than we have preserved them.  Deputy MacDermot starts with Roscommon. He says we should preserve Roscommon, and Deputy Brennan says the same thing.  I invite either of these Deputies to start out from Roscommon, taking it that the first principle they want to apply is to preserve that county, unchanged, and I ask them to try to draw up a better scheme on the basis of the principles that I have enunciated.</P>

      <P>The Deputy operated on the principle that the larger the constituency the better, and he is perfectly indifferent as to whether the number of candidates to be elected is an odd or an even number.  Those are considerations that have to be taken into account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is perfectly true in theory that the larger the constituency the better the chance you give to the small minority group to get a representative elected, or an individual candidate to become a member of the Dáil. If the sole concern that is to operate in the minds of Deputies is to secure adequate representation for minorities or independents, it might be argued that the larger the constituency the better.  I contend, the main consideration should be to ensure that the majority gets adequate representation. At the last election one Party got a majority, and, of course, we have our own ideas of what will be the condition of things at the next election. Irrespective, however, of what we think of Party prospects, I think it is desirable to ensure that the majority gets adequate representation.  If you unduly enlarge constituencies, you may jeopardise that prospect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the main concern were to ensure representation for small interests or individuals, you could abolish constituencies altogether and institute for the Dáil the same method of election as once operated in relation to the Seanad.  The Seanad was elected by the largest possible constituency we could have.  The whole country as one constituency voted for it and the election was a farce.  I think any Deputies here who had experience of that election will admit it was completely farcical in every respect. There was a huge list of candidates between whom the individual voter had to choose.  It was absolutely impossible for an individual elector to find out anything about the personal <Col N="1284" /> characters or even the political opinions of a number of those seeking his votes, and the result was that only 26 per cent. of the electorate went to the poll.  The result of the election was very largely a matter of luck; in one or two cases it was a matter of skill, but luck mainly operated. That was the <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> in regard to large constituencies.  Any attempt unduly to enlarge constituencies produces the same evils, even though in lesser degree.  It is not merely the size of the constituency, the number of miles between one side and another, or how long it will take to travel across it.  There is the consideration of the number of candidates.</P>
    <P>The system of election by proportional representation is a complicated system.  Even in constituencies where one would expect a very high average standard of education, such as the National University constituency, a substantial number of the papers returned were spoiled because the electors were not able to understand fully the method of election.  The larger the constituency, the greater the number of candidates, the greater the difference between the economic interests of one part of the constituency and another, the more certain it is that the result will be either a matter of luck or a matter of very effective Party organisation.  In theory it might be argued that the individual has a better chance in a large constituency.  In theory it might be argued that the minority Party has a better chance of getting representation in the larger constituency.  It has not worked out that way in practice. The Party getting the better representation had the better Party organisation, because under these circumstances an efficient Party organisation was essential.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton can examine the electoral history of his own Party and he will find they have been able to achieve, on the whole, more satisfactory results in constituencies electing three or five members than in any constituency larger than five.  If one looks over the records of the various elections one finds that applies all <Col N="1285" /> round, that in the very large constituencies it required really efficient party organisation in order to secure a large number of votes over widely scattered areas with diversified interests.  That consideration operated in the minds of the framers of this Bill, and because it operated we designed the measure on the principle that the largest constituency would elect five members.  That does not operate to prevent the minority group getting representation.  That is a matter of arithmetic.  One can sit down with a piece of paper and calculate the percentage of the total votes cast that are required to elect a Deputy in a three or five member or a seven member constituency and, in fact, any group large enough to secure representation in this House in elections held in the whole of the Free State as one constituency can still in practice secure the same representation here under the system of election contemplated in this Bill, unless the individual members of the group are so widely scattered throughout the country that their effective voting power cannot be brought to bear in any constituency, and that is a most unusual situation and one not worth legislating for.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton asked about Limerick.  The effect of the change in Limerick is that the number of Deputies is reduced by one.  The same applies in Tipperary and in Donegal. We could have maintained these constituencies with their old representation without violating the provisions of the Constitution.  I think I could argue that it would suit the Government Party to leave them in that position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an intelligent anticipation.  In the case of Clare, the number of seats was five.  We decided that five was a reasonable size for a constituency, and in preference to reducing Clare to four and making it a constituency electing an even number of Deputies, it was decided to add a portion of Galway that had economic and other interests closely associated with Clare, in order to maintain five representatives.  In the case of West Cork, five representatives were always elected, and five representatives will still be elected, but the geographical outline of the constituency is being changed, and I think that most West Cork Deputies will agree that the change is for the better.  I say that it is not desirable that there should be a large number of constituencies having an even number of Deputies.  It is true that in any scheme we prepare there must be some such constituencies.  They cannot be avoided, but if there were a large number of them it is quite possible, under proportional representation, that the Party that got the majority of the votes would only get a minority of the representation.  Deputy Brennan instanced the case of Roscommon. In principle, the Party that gets the majority of the votes should get the largest number of seats.  In the case of Roscommon the Party that got the majority of votes did not get the largest number of seats; it got the same number of seats as the Party that got the minority of votes.  That was contrary to our interests, but in other circumstances it would also be contrary to Cumann na nGaedheal interests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, there was intelligent anticipation.  We did not distinguish between the fine points of difference between Deputy Brennan and Deputy MacDermot.  I take it now that there is no difference except that Deputy Brennan may have some idea about the corporative State that Deputy MacDermot might not agree with.  The fact remains that this is obviously the best method of division. The result of the election in constituencies electing an even number of Deputies was such as to indicate that proportional representation had been defeated, and it must be so, so long as that method remains.  If there are four members to be elected, that Party will get two seats that succeeds in getting two votes out of five, and the Party that gets three votes out of five, as against another Party that gets two votes out of five, should get the majority of the representation.  I feel sure that if Deputies opposite thought that at any time they could get a majority of the votes they would fight strongly for that principle.  As I say, some constituencies of that kind cannot be avoided, no matter what scheme you propose, unless you are prepared to abolish county boundaries altogether. If you are anxious to preserve county boundaries it will be necessary to have some constituencies of that kind, but the fewer there are the better, because the more there are the more chances there will be of the whole purpose of the electoral scheme not being fulfilled.  I have stated that the principles on which the Bill is founded are: (1) the reduction of the number of Deputies; (2) the preservation of county boundaries; (3) the abolition of unduly large constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I consider that a constituency electing five members is the best size to have, and Clare has five.  The fourth principle on which the Bill is founded is the desirability of not having any large number of constituencies electing other than an odd number of Deputies.  On these principles the Schedule was prepared, and I defy any Deputy to get a map of the country before him and, starting <Col N="1288" /> from any point he wishes, to apply these principles and produce a better result.  That result was produced after many months of experimentation by officers of the Department of Local Government and it represents the best attempt that could be made to apply these principles and, at the same time, to secure the preservation of county boundaries in the number of cases in which they have been preserved.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I want to advise Deputies opposite to stop talking about gerrymandering.  We know why they are talking about gerrymandering. They are starting now to explain in advance the reason they are going to lose the next election.  If, after the result of the next election is known, they cannot blame Fianna Fáil propaganda or Fianna Fáil promises or something of that kind, they will always be able to fall back on the Electoral Bill. They will say that they were gerrymandered. Everybody knows what is in their minds.  If they had the slightest hope that the next election would give them a majority they would not attempt to make that argument, because it is obviously going to discourage their supporters. They are throwing up their cards and pretending that the pack is stacked against them.  It is not possible to gerrymander in this country.  One reason is because proportional representation operates, and if proportional representation operates, then you have got the certainty that as a result of the election the representation of different Parties in the Dáil is going to be in almost exact proportion to the votes cast for each Party.  It has always worked out that way, and it will work out that way in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No; in a three-member constituency any Party that cannot get one vote out of four cannot get a seat. They must get one vote out of four in order to get a seat.  I know that Deputy MacDermot has very little hope of getting very many seats on that calculation; but the question is whether a Party that cannot get one vote in four should be entitled to get any special advantages here.  I do not say that there are not cases where Parties of even smaller size than that should not and would not get representation. They will get it, because, in practice, the supporters of a particular Party are usually grouped in areas and are not scattered about all over the population, and they will always be able to get one vote in four in a small constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say it is not possible to gerrymander constituencies here, because of the existence of the proportional representation system of election.  There is another reason, a good practicable reason, that Deputies opposite, I am sure, bore in mind when they themselves were trying to prepare their particular Bill.  Deputy Mulcahy spent a long time trying to prepare a Bill of this kind and he did not succeed in producing it to the Dáil.  It was because he found out this&mdash;that you could not get reliable information as to the political opinions prevailing in any district which would permit of gerrymandering.  In the old days, when there were single-member constituencies you were able to tell to a nicety how the supporters of a political party were distributed.  There were small areas in respect of which majorities, one way or the other, had been recorded on a number of occasions and you could reckon on one constituency as your stronghold or as a place where you were certain to be defeated.  Consequently the redistribution of seats was based on the knowledge of election results.  In the case of Northern Ireland, where political opinions went very largely with religious opinions, where census returns had given an exact picture of the distribution of persons holding different religious views in every part of the area, it was, of course, child's play to gerrymander the constituencies.  But, in the Free State, <Col N="1290" /> where single-member constituencies have not existed since either of the two main political Parties came into existence, since all the main questions that divide us have arisen, since modern political thought was formed, there does not exist in any part the information which would permit of a political organiser, or a member of the Dáil, saying that in such-and-such a townland or electoral district the votes went one way and in other townlands they went in the contrary way.</P>
    <P>It is true that occasionally candidates at an election, in contravention of the regulations, have succeeded in getting that information concerning certain districts, but the information they get is usually so scattered and unreliable that it cannot be properly applied and all the information made available to the candidates at the count, has all indicated that in every constituency the support of each political Party is evenly distributed in the main over the whole of the constituency.  That, therefore, substantiates the contention that the support of each of the Parties is evenly distributed over the whole country. Therefore, so long as you have the principle of proportional representation, it does not matter how you divide the country, or on what basis you prepare the constituency, the result will be the same&mdash;gerrymandering is not possible. Deputy Mulcahy found that out. We found that out, and so we prepared this Bill upon the principles I have enunciated without regard to Party considerations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite what the Minister said about gerrymandering, they cannot deny the fact that they have endeavoured to gerrymander the situation.  I think I can give proof of that as a result of what has occurred in the West Cork constituency.  I have not population details of that constituency with me at present, but we have had five representatives.  On the basis of population, I think that West Cork would still be entitled to five representatives.  The situation is that there are six electoral divisions in the Kinsale rural district taken from West Cork and thrown into East Cork, but <Col N="1291" /> we have 30 electoral divisions from North Cork thrown into West Cork. I think, on the present population, together with the 30 electoral divisions thrown in from West Cork, on a population basis we should have six representatives, but we are only getting five.  If that is not gerrymandering the situation, I do not know what is.  They are depriving West Cork of a representative and the Minister knows well that that representative would not be one of his supporters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>He would not; I am supporting the amendment to this Bill.  We have to deal with this Bill as it affects our own constituencies. The Minister says that the Government are aiming at reasonably small constituencies.  West Cork is one of the most unwieldy constituencies in the Free State.  It is 120 miles by 30 or 35 miles in extent.  We have a big portion of North Cork thrown into that constituency and we have a tremendous line of seaboard.  Deputy Norton dealt with the question of locomotion. It is very difficult to handle an election in West Cork.  Members of all Parties know that.  Locomotion is almost impossible.  We have peninsula after peninsula extending out. You go 30 or 35 miles down one peninsula and then you have to come back and go 55 or 60 miles down another peninsula.  That is the unwieldiness that the Minister is trying to avoid by reasonably small constituencies.  Then the Government are including this big portion of North Cork which carries us to the borders of Limerick and nearly to the Kerry border.  It is an impossible constituency to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says that they could not avoid the splitting of areas.  They reduced the representation of East Cork from five to three.  They have taken six electoral divisions from Kinsale rural district and they have thrown them into East Cork, with Cork harbour intervening.  I think that is most uncalled for.  I suppose that must be one of the divisions that <Col N="1292" /> the Minister for Local Government said was there before the Battle of Kinsale, to which he did not go back. It is the division of Kinsale in any case now.  We are, of course, all prepared to agree to the reduction of members.  Long before Fianna Fáil came into this House that was recognised and we will support that.  But I think it is most unfair that this mutilation of constituencies should be carried out.  I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment and to give further consideration to this, particularly to unwieldy constituencies like West Cork.  On a population basis he should give us our five members and not be trying to steal from us the representation that we should get by throwing in a big area of North Cork.</P>

      <P>I should like to support the principle of the Bill as introduced and to speak of my own constituency of County Galway.  Heretofore that county returned nine Deputies.  From the east to the west the county was some 120 miles and from north to south it was close on 100 miles.  It was impossible to work that county as one constituency, and I think there is a great advantage in at least dividing the county into two divisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keely</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to reconsider the grounds on which he proposes to transfer part of Galway to Clare.  County Galway, as I say, has nine Deputies.  Under this Bill we are going to have only seven.  The people of the county object to making a sacrifice so great as the sacrifice of two of their representatives.  We are, I think, the only county in Ireland which is asked to sacrifice two of its members. We are quite willing to sacrifice one, because on the basis of the population we should sacrifice one of those Deputies.  I have not the figures before me, but I think the population <Col N="1293" /> of County Galway according to the 1926 census is 169,366.  With a population of 169,366 Galway undivided or divided into two divisions would be entitled to eight Deputies; each Deputy would be representing 21,170 of the population. For that reason, I say it is very unfair that Galway should be deprived of two of its Deputies.  In the part of Galway which is to be put in with Clare there are 21 electoral areas.  In these 21 areas I think the population is something like 12,473.  When that 12,473 of the population from Galway is added to the Clare constituency Clare will return five Deputies to Dáil Eireann.  The population of Clare as it stands is 95,064.  That 95,064 plus 12,000 from County Galway will give Clare one Deputy for about every 21,500 of the population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said here that a slice of Galway with a common economic interest had been thrown in with Clare.  I think the Minister who made that statement was misled.  If you look at the map of the West you will find that between Galway and Clare you have a continuous mountain range from the shores of Galway Bay to the Shannon.  Across that mountain barrier there is but one or at most two passes. There is no connection or communication between the two counties.  County Clare, as far as I understand, is a dairying and pasture county, while the County Galway on the other side is a tillage county.  Therefore, there is little communication between the two counties nor have they anything economically in common.  When speaking against this mutilation I am speaking of the real objection of the people of South Galway to transfer to Clare. I may mention that at their last meeting the Galway County Council&mdash;a council composed of representatives of varied political Parties&mdash;were unanimous in protesting against the transfer of part of the county to Clare.  What I propose is that County Galway be made into two divisions.  If it is against the principle of the Bill to have constituencies returning an even number of representatives, if Galway is divided into two parts you can maintain <Col N="1294" /> three representatives for West Galway and five for East Galway.</P>
    <P>As I say, the population of County Galway entitles us to eight members there.  If that does not commend itself to the Minister I would suggest to him that he take the two counties, Galway and Clare, with four and eight representatives. The two counties would be entitled to 12 representatives in An Dáil.  If the two counties are taken and divided into four, the divisions returning three each, you will have constituencies that will be better suited to the West of Ireland than the larger constituency of four or of five. We have a rather sparse population in the eastern parts of Galway as compared with other parts of the county, and the smaller the constituency the easier it would be for the Deputies working that constituency, and the easier it would be for them to keep in touch with the people they represent in the Dáil.  Those are the suggestions I would make.  Either of those two suggestions will satisfy the people who are objecting to the principle contained in that part of the Bill.  As I have said, I support the Bill on the main principle.  I support it on the principle of reducing the size of the constituencies.  I think I would go further and hold that the single-seat constituency would be better suited to the conditions which prevail in Ireland to-day than this system of proportional representation.  We first got proportional representation under, I think, the 1920 Act.  The object of proportional representation was to give minorities a representation in the National Parliament.  If times were normal, if this country were not engaged in the disputes and conflicts that it has with an outside country, proportional representation is a system which I would undoubtedly stand over, but proportional representation to-day is hampering the desires and the advance of the majority of the people. Had it not been for proportional representation the members on the Opposition Benches would be very few to-day. You would be very few at the last election had it not been for proportional representation, and whatever <Col N="1295" /> you may think the majority of the people of this State believe that you are hampering the State in its national advance.  They believe that you are hampering them in making that advance which they desire, and in order to get rid of you this State would be glad to see the single-member constituency coming back again.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether Deputy Keely's proposal is a proposal which is going to be tried as another shot in the good old western way of getting the accursed crowd out of the Government's way.  At any rate, the Minister is to some extent trying to provide for that, because what Deputy Norton said is quite true &mdash;that you are almost getting back to a single member constituency when you get back to the three member constituency. However, the Minister for Local Government has presented us with a Bill, and at a suitable distance removed from that the Minister for Industry and Commerce presents us with a set of the principles, and asks us not to talk any more about gerrymandering. I agree that we probably will not.  There was a temptation to talk, at the beginning of this debate, of Kellymandering.  I think we will now have Kelly-mastering, whatever the outcome of that may be, because it is very interesting to take the principle expounded by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Bill as put before us by the Minister for Local Government and see where they link up.  There certainly does seem to have been something going on behind the scenes that brought this Bill and the set of principles which we have heard together, because the connection between them is not obvious on the face of it.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce tells us that they tried to preserve county boundaries, but the Minister for Local Government goes back into history to suggest that, after all, county boundaries are not really the things that some of us think they are.  There is almost a touch of anti-Republicanism <Col N="1296" /> in saying &ldquo;Up, Kerry&rdquo; or &ldquo;Up, Tipperary,&rdquo; or even &ldquo;Up, Limerick.&rdquo; Nevertheless, I think that the Tipperary feeling is strong enough and that even County Limerick feeling is strong enough to make me ask Deputy Breen, from Tipperary, or Deputy O Briain, from County Limerick, what is wrong with Tipperary and what is wrong with Limerick?  Like the County Kerry, they have a certain population.  At the present time we have seven Deputies representing Tipperary, seven Deputies representing Limerick and seven representing Kerry and without in any way infringing the Constitution, which Deputies now regard as so sacred, they could still retain the seven members for Tipperary, the seven members for Limerick and the seven members for Kerry, because giving Kerry seven members under the new system would give them a member for every 21,310 of the population; giving Limerick seven members, a member for every 20,049 of the population, and giving Tipperary seven members, a member for every 20,145 of the population&mdash;not a very great disparity.  Yet Tipperary is to lose a member and Limerick is to lose a member and Kerry is to remain where Kerry is&mdash;with seven members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not appear, when we consider the principle the Minister speaks about, that there is anything wrong in leaving Tipperary with seven and Limerick with seven, and it is certainly impossible to understand why Tipperary should be cut down to six and why Limerick should be cut down to six, so that the Deputies from these counties have, I think, something to explain. They may or may not have been present at the discussions that went on in regard to the preparation of this measure&mdash;discussions, apparently, as a result of which the divisions were made of the counties which the Minister for Local Government explained to us were made.  They arose out of the instinct to have voluntary allotment of particular districts as between Deputies. The Minister for Local Government brought us back to the battle of Kinsale. Many a fellow, no doubt, got smashed up at the battle of Kinsale, <Col N="1297" /> but I do not think that, since the days when people could be hanged, drawn and quartered, anything happened to anyone in this country like what is happening under the Minister's Bill to the County of Carlow.  If I had to express it bilingually, I should have to fall back on Canon O'Leary's description of what he did to Irish words when he began to spell them in a simpler way. &ldquo;Do thosnuigheas ar a gcinn do bhaint díobh agus a n-earbaill do bhaint díobh agus annsan, a mboilge do bhaint asta.&rdquo;  He found that the lettering was all wrong and he said: &ldquo;I began to cut the heads off them and the tails off them and then to cut the bellies out of them.&rdquo;  That is what happened to my poor Carlow in spite of the great principle of preserving county boundaries.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to talk to us about the Carlow situation.  Assuming that you can take an area like Carlow and divide it up like that, and assuming that you can take an area like the west of Westmeath and the south of Roscommon and hash it up like this is hashed up, would the Minister tell us why you cannot take the whole country and spot it down in five-member constituencies about which the Minister for Industry and Commerce thinks so much?  I agree with the Minister that the five-member constituency does give you a decent chance of having a proportional representation system, but why not have a few more of them, if the place can be hashed up like Carlow or even Galway, that Deputy Keely speaks of, or Roscommon or Westmeath, not to talk of Sligo?  The treatment of Tipperary and Limerick and places like Carlow is an astounding reflection on the Bill.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce tells us that the first principle in the Bill is to reduce.  I am glad that, while he accepts the principle of reduction, the Minister for Industry and Commerce accepts a principle that is forced on him, and he does not accept it any more than it is forced upon him, because I do not think that the Dáil should be reduced beyond what is proposed in this measure.  Deputy Norton has his own ideas about who are the dictators in this country, but, speaking <Col N="1298" /> as one of Deputy Norton's would-be dictators in this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I stand for a big Dáil.  I congratulate the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the very gentle way in which he subscribes to the reduction principle.  With regard to the second principle, of the preservation of county boundaries, I subscribe entirely to what Deputy Keely says about County Galway.  I think it is utterly absurd to take the southern portion of Galway and, as it were, throw it across a ridge of mountains into Clare, at the same time as you are following out number three principle.  You are taking County Limerick, which is probably smaller in area than Clare, and dividing it up in two. I should like to hear the Minister for Local Government attempting to square what is happening in Clare with the idea of small constituencies and what is happening in Limerick with the preservation of county boundaries.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce talks of how necessary it is to avoid even-numbered constituencies. He has the idea that I looked over a few schemes of this particular kind.  If he has, he will at least realise that there is a scheme that will completely preserve the present county boundaries and leave the constituencies exactly as they were, except that Wicklow would be thrown in with Kildare as it was formerly; will leave Tipperary with its seven members and Limerick with its seven members and give you a Dáil of 136, or, if a little more justice was done to Mayo, a Dáil of 137 members, and would not give you any greater number of even constituencies than the plan the Minister has put before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whereas the Minister's plan offers us 20 three-member constituencies, nine four-member constituencies and eight five-member constituencies, the Minister can have a plan on the lines I speak of, with not more than nine four-member constituencies, one six-member constituency and two eight-member constituencies, but the objection <Col N="1299" /> to the eight-member constituency is nothing like the objection to the four-member constituency from the point of view of what the Minister for Industry and Commerce speaks of. Instead of giving 20 three-member constituencies, it will give you six three-member constituencies so that the Minister can put a scheme before the House which will preserve all the county boundaries, which will give you the constituencies that are there at the present time and which will give, as I say, more satisfaction to counties like Tipperary and Limerick and will not make the awful hash that is being made of Carlow; will not give you more four-member constituencies than the Minister's scheme is going to give you; and will give you six three-member constituencies instead of 20.</P>
    <P>I would like to express complete agreement with what Deputy Norton says with regard to the large member constituencies.  I think that everything he said about this Bill being a scheme to wipe out proportional representation is absolutely borne out by what is in the Bill itself.  The principle enunciated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce is a principle to which I will subscribe.  But he reduces it to the extent he has reduced it.  The second of the principles of the Minister for Industry and Commerce is the preservation of the county boundaries.  I subscribe entirely to that.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health does not in presenting his Bill to us subscribe to that.  With regard to small constituencies I do not subscribe to small constituencies if they mean a larger number of constituencies.  I would be prepared to listen to it being argued that you could take the country and gird it with five-member constituencies. I would be prepared to listen to that being argued.  But as far as the fourth principle is concerned, to avoid even-member constituencies, that is the principle to which I subscribe wholeheartedly, particularly when it is a question of four-member constituencies. But the Minister has gone out of his way to provide us with as many four-member constituencies as he possibly <Col N="1300" /> could get without turning them into three-member constituencies.  I am entirely opposed to the scheme that the Minister for Local Government has put before us and to the very strange principles&mdash;at least which the Minister for Industry and Commerce worked into it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect that Deputy Donnelly and I are some of the few Deputies who have no grievances whatsoever with regard to this particular Bill.  We belong to one of the very few constituencies that remain untouched by this Bill.  I expect that we are living in times when we have got to be thankful for small mercies and every one of us feels grateful that we are not attracting any Government attention.  When the Minister was introducing this Bill on the Second Reading Stage he told us quite a lot about what was in the Bill.  He told us quite a lot about what we could read ourselves, but he told us remarkably little as to the principles or the reasons for this particular type of electoral planning.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce on the other hand did indulge fairly freely in an attempt to give us reasons.  The only thing that struck me about the reasons of the Minister for Industry and Commerce was that the reasons given by him were certainly very definitely violated in the Bill.  I would like to know just to what extent he was talking the Government mind and to what extent this Bill is a blunder or a misrepresentation of the Government mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would call the Minister's attention to one of two reasons given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. He said the principles which guided the framers of this particular Bill were first, the reduction of the numbers in Dáil Eireann.  If that were quite the principle I think everyone in the House will agree that the Bill is scarcely in accordance with that guiding principle of reducing the number only to the minimum demanded not by the Government but by the Constitution.  I am not arguing for a larger Dáil or for a drastically reduced Dáil.  I am merely pointing out that that principle <Col N="1301" /> advanced by the Minister for Industry and Commerce is not borne out in the Bill before us.  He told us that the second principle which guided the framers of this Bill was the preservation of county boundaries.  In the State to which this Bill applies there are only 26 counties.  None of these 26 counties was previously mutilated by any Electoral Bill.  We had partition only on the frontier of this State but we had no partition inside the State which we ourselves governed.  We had no mutilation of counties.  We had the absolute preservation of county boundaries before this Bill was introduced. Under this Bill nine of the 26 counties are mutilated.  Nine counties suffer mutilation of their boundaries under this Bill.  Yet, we are told by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the second guiding principle was the preservation of county boundaries.</P>
    <P>I make no apology to anybody for referring to that kind of debate as humbug. Whatever reasons&mdash;they may have been good, bad or middling&mdash;that guided the framers of this Bill they were neither the reduction of the members of the Dáil nor the preservation of county boundaries.  I am able to speak in a detached way because I represent one of those constituencies absolutely untouched by this Bill.  But if I belonged to Galway, Westmeath and more particularly to Carlow I would certainly ask the Minister standing for this Bill how does he reconcile it with the Government policy not to mutilate county frontiers and preserve county boundaries?  If the Minister for Industry and Commerce was in fact enunciating both these policies then the Bill is trampling into the dirt these two principles.  I do not belong to Carlow.  I do not represent Carlow but my native home is only within a couple of miles of the Carlow boundary and I know people there.  I do not know what justification can be advanced for driving not one line through Carlow but four lines and chucking portion of the people of Carlow into Wexford and another lump into Wicklow and another lump of the county into Kildare.  If there is any regard for origins, for local sentiment, even for local administration, <Col N="1302" /> people should be safeguarded from that kind of happy-go-lucky chucking them about as if they were so many unimportant units.</P>
    <P>There must be the nearest correspondence between central government lines and local government lines and there must, in addition, be some regard for, shall we say, athletic development in the country or political development.  This kind of reckless mutilation, reckless interfering, this throwing together of different areas in different counties in such a manner as needlessly to overlap is most unfair and in the long run it will mean that the people will not know to what county they belong.  For instance, the people in one section of Carlow will belong, from the point of view of central government, to Kildare. Their next door neighbours on one side will belong to Wicklow and their next door neighbours on the other side will belong to Wexford.  I regard that as an idle, reckless action that is very unfair to the people and shows very little consideration for the people.  There are Deputies opposite and if that happened in their native constituencies they would resent it.</P>
    <P>Every man has a right to be proud of his religion, proud of his country. In order to be proud of his country he has to be proud of his county and if his county is to be broken up like an egg for breakfast it will be impossible to develop any kind of local or county pride.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce even went further.  I do not know if he read the Bill before he rose to speak.  He said the ideal to be aimed at was five-member constituencies.  We have some 47 constituencies under this Bill and eight of the 47 are five-member constituencies.</P>

      <P>Eight out of 37 constituencies are five-member constituencies <Col N="1303" /> and we are told that the thing to be aimed at and desired is the five-member constituency.  We must take it then that the thing to be most desired is the thing the people of this country are going to get least of.  I am not particularly wedded to five-member constituencies, but I think the minute you go below five-member constituencies you get further and further from the fair application of the principle of proportional representation. I agree absolutely with Deputy Norton's observation.  The lower you get below five the more you drift apart from the principle of proportional representation.  I do not blame anybody who happens to be against proportional representation. It is merely one system that may be approved of by an individual or disapproved of.  As one Deputy, conscious of the history of this country and anxious for representation for minorities in order to bring them in close contact with majorities and in order to get the majority to understand the mind of the minority and the minority to understand the mind of the majority, I am very strongly in favour of proportional representation.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons why I object to this Bill as it appears at the moment is that it is an attempt to override the fair application of the principle of proportional representation.  The four-member constituency is about the most unsuitable constituency to give a fair hunt to the proportional representation system.  Even the Minister for Industry and Commerce says that.  And yet we have nine constituencies here with a membership of four.  In order to manufacture this type of constituency which, according to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, is not the most suitable type, and in order to make the minimum number of the type of constituency which he tells us is the most suitable, we have mutilation of eight counties.  We have, for instance, the important town and district of Youghal pitchforked into a county with which it has not, and never did have, any close association.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I stand corrected. I will say, however, that the town and district of Youghal had more close and continuous association with the County of Cork than with Waterford. Why it should be deliberately taken out of Cork and put into Waterford, I do not know.  I am not standing up to suggest that these things are done without any purpose.  I am standing up to resent the fact that we are asked to discuss the Second Reading of this Bill and as regards these points that stick out and hit one in the face, these particular acts of county mutilation, these reckless acts of transference of communities, pitchforking them into some other counties, we are not given a word of explanation or justification. I am not suggesting there is not some good reason for doing this.  There is some good reason behind most things; but it is unfair to put the Dáil in the position of adopting this important measure without any attempt being made to explain or justify what appears to be a haphazard, reckless chucking about of the people.  Before this debate concludes, before the last speakers opposed to the Government have made their contributions, or are prohibited from speaking a second time, I would like some authorised member of the Government Party to take the eight mutilated counties and give us a good, valid reason for the mutilation of the frontiers and the transference of the populations in those particular counties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government outlined the reasons for this Bill.  He stated the first reason was the necessity for a reduction in the membership of this Parliament. If the reduction was even more acute some of us might see our way <Col N="1305" /> to support it.  The second point was that it did not conflict with historical boundaries.  In the constituency which I have the honour to represent this measure is looked upon as an outrage and is resented by all who take an active interest in political or administrative affairs.  I was surprised a moment ago, when Deputy O'Higgins was speaking, at the Minister's intervention with respect to the historical associations of Youghal.  The Deputy pointed out that it had no association, politically or administratively, with County Waterford, and the Minister questioned that.  Admittedly we live on terms of the closest association and great personal friendship, if you like, and, of course, we have business relations, but I am not aware, nor have I yet heard, that there have been any political or administrative associations and I would like the Minister, if he can, to inform me to the contrary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the fact that under the Local Government Act of 1898 a portion of Waterford was administered in County Cork in the Youghal (No. 2) Rural District.  There is a case which proves my point more than the contrary one, because it proves that a portion of County Waterford was absorbed in County Cork, which is exactly the point I intended to make. If you examine the figures which you have put up both for the portion of Cork constituency, as you contemplate it, and the combined Waterford City and County, you will find that, leaving Youghal where it is you have approximately 80,000 and 70,000 for Waterford City and County.  But you take a portion that was always administered in Cork&mdash;their seat of administration was in Youghal&mdash;and you transfer it to Waterford.  If you wish to maintain the spirit which the Minister for Industry and Commerce states is the object of the Bill and to retain historical associations, the line of least resistance would be to re-create what was always associated there, thereby giving you even more than the necessary numbers for your electoral representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1306" /> I readily admit to the Minister that there was an intimate and close association between Waterford and Cork, or between a portion of Waterford and Cork.  That association, however, bears on the point I am making, that Waterford was administered in Cork and not that Cork was administered in Waterford.  Apart from that, we have other historical associations. That town always had representation. It had representation over 130 years ago in the Irish Parliament, when it had two representatives, and it had representatives in the British Imperial Parliament.  To-day, you are taking up that, with all its historical associations and with its business and administrative connections, and transferring it across a mile of the Blackwater into County Waterford.  If that is not an outrage on the spirit of the Bill, as it has been enunciated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, I do not know what it is.  Before passing from that I might say that, after all, every local authority in Cork resents the tearing up of the constituency, both from an administrative as well as from a legislative point of view.  Administratively, Cork City has always been our Mecca.  All our hopes and ambitions centred around Cork City. You are now changing all that, you are now turning a complete <i>volte face.</i> I have already said, as we have heard stated here to-night, that there is hostility and jealousy sometimes between different towns and constituencies and different sections of the community, but I can say emphatically that as far as Waterford and Cork are concerned no such hostility exists.  The closest friendship and business associations exist there, but there has never been any administrative or political association except in so far as Waterford was absorbed in Cork&mdash;not that Cork was absorbed in Waterford.</P>
    <P>With regard to proportional representation, in my view the cutting down of constituencies to three-member constituencies goes as far as you can to deprive the electorate of the spirit of proportional representation.  By doing so, you go as far as possible to negative the effects of proportional representation; and no better proof <Col N="1307" /> can be given of that than the answer of the Minister for Industry and Commerce when he says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;After all, is it not more essential to get a majority for the big Parties than to get representation for the small ones?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If that is not proof that the whole attempt that is being made here&mdash;I am not going to use the work &ldquo;gerrymandering&rdquo;&mdash;is to have as many three-member constituencies as possible with a view to carrying out what the Minister for Industry and Commerce states to be the avowed object, that is, to get a big majority for the big Party rather than to get representation for the small Party, I do not know what to call it.  However, I will let the small Parties decide that for themselves.</P>
    <P>Take the way this Bill has been received by the House.  It has been received by all sides of the House not from any Party point of view but purely from the point of view of the merits of the Bill alone.  Those who are opposing the measure are opposing it, not from a Party point of view, but because certain fundamental rights, such as the right of proportional representation, and certain historical associations are being interfered with.  It is on these lines and not on Party lines that we support this amendment.  You have had opposition to the Bill from Deputies on your bench.  I think I might claim that on all sides you have nothing at all like agreement.  I am quite satisfied that the members of your own Party will be compelled only under the ægis of the Party Whip to vote for what they speak against. Admittedly, a reduction of the numbers is necessary.  I am informed, and, I am sure, correctly informed, that the usual procedure in all cases of this kind, where no Party interests are involved, and where merely constitutional interests are concerned, is that a committee of the whole House is called in to collaborate on it.  I suggest that course to the Minister in all earnestness.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has asked how are we to get agreement.  Surely, the commonsense of the House will support <Col N="1308" /> the decision of the majority on such a committee.  I would suggest that the Minister should agree to withdraw his Bill on these considerations and that he would consider calling in a committee representative of all sections of the House to examine this Bill.  I sincerely hope that in the consideration of this matter by such a committee, other bigger and more vital issues will be considered, and, I hope, amicably settled.</P>

      <P>Undoubtedly, we are bound to get complaints, particularly in a Bill of this nature, where representation is being cut down.  There are some complaints, however, that should not be made.  In the first place, I should like to say this much, that no accusation of gerrymandering can stand.  I will take Cork County. In North Cork, at the last general election, we got two representatives out of three.  A large portion&mdash;I might say, the Republican portion&mdash;of my constituency is now being added to that in order to make four seats, which will still leave the representation of the North Cork portion of Cork County two and two.  I do not believe we could get another one, even as it stands.  On the other hand, however, I must thank the Minister for his ideas of my ability when he has thrown over six of the Blue Shirt areas out of Deputy Donovan's constituency to my constituency to be converted, together with the unrepresented portion of the Cork City constituency, which, unfortunately, has remained unrepresented during the last ten years.  When I say unrepresented I mean it.  I say that it was a scandal to have a rural electorate of 27,000 people remaining there for the past ten years represented by Cork City representatives who knew nothing whatsoever of their wants and could not speak for their wants.  I know what the burden was, and perhaps other representatives from my constituency know what it was also.  The greater portion of the rural work of the Cork City representation had to be done by me.  What do the Cork City representatives know about the roads problems or about any one of the Land Acts or about anything else <Col N="1309" /> that concerns rural needs?  They knew nothing about them and they could not pretend to know anything about them.  Accordingly, I must thank the Minister for providing for that portion of Cork City constituency.  As far as the division of my constituency, which concerns Youghal, is concerned, I certainly must agree with Deputy Broderick.  I do not know why there should be this desperate set that all sides of the House seem to be making on Cork.  I object to it.  There are 5,245 voters being taken out of Cork County and added to County Waterford.</P>

      <P>You are taking population and I am taking voters who are the people who count.  Taking either figure, the point remains that the new East Cork constituency, with the Youghal area included, has a population of a couple of thousand more than the County Waterford.  Why starve the larger one to help the smaller one? The proper thing would be to take a portion of County Waterford and put it under the control of Cork.  In the past that particular portion of County Waterford could never be governed except by Cork men.  I maintain that it should be handed over again to the control of Cork and should be put into East Cork.  Why take a large portion of Cork County in order to provide a four-member constituency in County Waterford when by taking a portion out of County Waterford you can provide a four-member constituency in East Cork?  As far as I am concerned, I do not care.  I will guarantee to convert any constituency, no matter how bad, in a very short time.  I will guarantee that even in Kilkenny.  I was not long enough there the last time to make the required impression, but I was greener then than I am now. <Col N="1310" /> Viewing it from any viewpoint, I cannot see any justification for the removal of portion of Cork County into Waterford.  If, for the purpose of representation according to the Constitution, there must be a division, then they should take portion of County Waterford and put it into County Cork, rather than take a far larger portion of Cork and put it into Waterford. There is no justification for the present division.  On the Committee Stage of the Bill an opportunity should be given for remedying mistakes of that kind.  Undoubtedly a very grave mistake has been made there, for which I can see no justification.  I agree with Deputy Broderick because, after all, I have done a large amount of missionary work in Youghal during the last few years.</P>

After all, as Deputy Broderick says, whatever association there was between the two counties in the past was an association between the two rural district councils under which a portion of Waterford was ruled by Cork.  I hold that that should continue, instead of having a portion of Cork attempted to be ruled by Waterford which would be absolutely impossible. I remember a story that Deputy Broderick told me some time ago.  He was inquiring for a certain farmer when travelling around.</P>

      <P>Quite obviously, this Bill gives as little satisfaction to certain members of the Fianna Fáil Party as it gives to members of this Party.  When Deputy Corry has criticised the Bill in one respect so severely, it is quite natural to believe that there are other members of his Party who are just as dissatisfied with it as he himself, because Deputy Corry on every occasion in this Dáil is prepared to get up and defend Government policy, no matter how absurd it may be.  In comparing the populations of Sligo and Roscommon I was immediately struck by one of the peculiar anomalies of the Bill.  The present population of Sligo is 71,388.  The electorate of Roscommon, assuming that this new Bill becomes law, will be 71,344, a difference of 44.  Roscommon, with 71,344 electors, is to have three members.  It is proposed under the Bill to take away about 5,000 voters from Sligo and transfer them across the Arigna Mountains to the County Leitrim.  That, on the face of it, would be a very absurd procedure.  I am perfectly certain that if the proposal with regard to changes in a number of counties had been carefully examined by the Minister beforehand, he would certainly not have agreed to some of them because, on the face of it, they are quite obviously absurd and quite contrary in every respect to adminitrative convenience; and not alone to administrative convenience, but even from the standpoint of elections.  That will cause a great deal of inconvenience to the returning officers in charge of those particular areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce boasted, as he has been reminded by previous speakers, that one of the principles underlying the preparation of this Bill was an attempt <Col N="1312" /> to preserve the county unit.  Surely to goodness Sligo is one county at all events where it is quite easy to preserve the county unit, because Sligo is surrounded by a chain of mountains from one end of it to the other, and, strictly speaking, it has no historical associations with any of the surrounding counties.  In a county like that it was quite an easy matter for the Minister to so adjust matters as to preserve the county unit, and allow the county to remain under this Bill as one electoral unit.  Instead, he starts at one end of the county and lops off three electoral divisions, transferring them bodily to County Leitrim.  He then proceeds along the mountains for some distance, and again begins the process of transferring other electoral divisions across the Arigna Mountains into County Leitrim.  The Arigna Mountains form a natural barrier between the two counties.  The people living on the Sligo side of the Arigna Mountains have no sentimental affiliations, or any other sort of affiliations, with the people in County Leitrim. The only reason for that, and probably it will be the reason advanced by the Minister, is that Sligo was linked up with Leitrim in the past and that they formed one constituency.  Surely the Minister, in the special circumstances peculiar to Leitrim, might have forgotten some of the principles which, according to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, guided him in the preparation of this Bill; he might have allowed both Sligo County and Leitrim County to remain intact and given them six members.  I do not see how that would in any way cut across the principles which guided the Minister in the formation of this Bill.  Neither would it have in any way cut across the principle of proportional representation. In fact, if he had done that it would be one very clear and definite indication that he meant to preserve the principle of proportional representation. As I say, if anything should have rendered Sligo County impregnable to the assaults which the Minister proposes to make on it under this Bill it is the fact that it is surrounded by a chain of mountains.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1313" /> The fact that Sligo County is to be dismembered in this fashion, and that between 5,000 and 6,000 voters are to be transferred across the mountains into County Leitrim, is going to give rise&mdash;no matter what the Minister may say to the contrary&mdash;to all sorts of administrative inconvenience.  Not alone will it give rise to administrative inconveniences from the point of view of purely local administration, but also from the standpoint of administering it even for the purposes of a general election.  The Minister himself knows from his experience of local government that, after all, local affairs impinge very frequently on national affairs.  In so far as they impinge on national affairs it is absolutely essential for the smooth working of things that there should be a certain harmony between local representation and national representation.  In so far as you separate local administration from national administration so far are you going to give rise to a certain amount of trouble as well.  The people who are to be taken out of Sligo and transferred to Leitrim will look to Sligo as their centre for the purpose of local representation.  I do not know what part of Leitrim they will look to as their centre for the purpose of political representation.  There are many matters affecting local administration which will also affect political administration; for instance you have the question of drainage and housing.  It is necessary that there should be a certain unity and a certain point of contact between local and political representatives on matters of that kind; and there are other matters as well.</P>
    <P>The whole principle underlying this Bill has been laboured by other speakers and I do not wish to prolong the discussion.  I consider that the Bill was rather hastily prepared.  The Minister probably felt that he was pressed for time, and that he was in duty bound to produce a Bill of this character.  He merely got certain drafts prepared, presumably, by a number of his officials, without having an opportunity himself of examining those drafts carefully, or at least of understanding what effect the sections <Col N="1314" /> of the Bill would have not alone on the local administration of the country but on the political administration as well. It does, as other speakers pointed out, cut across in a rather drastic way the whole principle of proportional representation. To me, at all events, that appears the most significant and the most dangerous thing in the Bill. Ministers may have their own peculiar views about how proportional representation should work out in the country, but it seems to me that the fact that this is a small country is all the more reason why every section of the people should get an opportunity of representation in the Parliament of the country.  By reducing the constituencies to three, four, or at the very outside five-seat constituencies, you are to a certain extent&mdash;in fact in some cases, I hold, to a very large extent&mdash; depriving at least one section of the people from the chance of getting representation in this Dáil.  In so far as this Bill will do that it is, to my mind, a real source of danger.  Apart from the other peculiar anomalies in the Bill that fact in itself would justify me in supporting the amendment moved by Deputy MacDermot.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDavis" hpid="Mr. Davis Mr. Davis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davis</NameTxt>
      <P>My intervention at this stage will be very brief.  I have not the complaints to make that some other Deputies had of interference with the county boundary, but I have to complain, and complain seriously, of the fact that the constituency which I have the honour to represent is being mutilated in a most absurd fashion.  East Mayo and North Mayo constituted one constituency in the past&mdash;what used to be known as East Mayo and North Mayo &mdash;that was when you had one representative for each constituency.  That has been altered now, and altered in a most peculiar manner, for reasons which I do not like to suggest, simply because it might be imagined that I had some personal feeling in making the suggestion.  But those who run may read.  We had four representatives in North Mayo and five in South Mayo.  I could see quite reasonable grounds for having transferred some of the electorate from South Mayo to North Mayo to enable North Mayo to <Col N="1315" /> retain its four representatives, and at the same time to leave South Mayo its representatives.  Portion of what was North Mayo is now being transferred to South Mayo, and portion of what was South Mayo is being transferred to North Mayo in a most absurd fashion.  If the Minister himself would only take a glance at the map he would see that what I say is fully substantiated.  The thing is done in the most roundabout fashion, for reasons which are obvious to anybody who has an eye not only to the political situation but to what might be a redistribution or revision of seats. I fear there is little hope of anything that I may say having any weight&mdash; I will not say with the Minister personally&mdash;as regards the Minister's decision.  There is another fact which I should like to advert to, and it is that promises were made by many speakers from the Opposition Benches when they were seeking office, and when they were seeking the confidence of the people, that this House had too many representatives altogether and that the number would be reduced.  In that I thoroughly agree and it is not the first occasion on which I said it. As far as I am personally concerned if, as they then promised, the number of Deputies in this House were to be reduced to 100, I am one of those who would very willingly support that proposition. I think 100 members would be quite sufficient, in fact in a sense more than sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the constituencies were properly allocated&mdash;I might say, properly represented&mdash;and if political ideas or political outlook were not allowed to enter into the manner in which they were treated we would get fair representation. I suggest that that has happened as between South and North Mayo and on these grounds, I strongly protest.  I feel that it is a very grave injustice to the southern portion of North Mayo to treat it as it is proposed to treat it in this Bill.  In North Mayo, the area stood with the whole barony of Erris in the Bill.  What is being added to North Mayo at present? There are three areas being added <Col N="1316" /> which were in South Mayo and in that respect, I feel that it is not treating North Mayo in a just manner.  On the other hand, the portion that did belong to North Mayo, and which formerly belonged to East Mayo, is being taken away and given over to South Mayo. The Minister, of course, will reply&mdash; and I am sure would be justified in replying&mdash;that it is, at all events, a matter within the county and that the county border has not been interfered with.  That I willingly acknowledge, but I feel that the constituency of North Mayo, which I have the honour to represent and the responsibility of representing in this House, is not being fairly treated.  It is on that ground that I make my protest and I hope the Minister will see his way to alter his decision in the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrRobertJRowlette" hpid="Dr. Rowlette Dr. Rowlette">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>I stand in a different position from that of most of the Deputies who have taken part in the debate, because the constituency I represent is not affected by this Bill. The Minister proposes to deal with it in a much more drastic manner than even he has dealt with County Carlow, to which reference was made a few minutes ago.  My interest in the Bill is mainly because of its effect on the principle of proportional representation. This House is based on the principle of proportional representation. That is embedded in our Constitution and must have captured the mind, the intellect and the judgment of those who framed our Constitution and no suggestion has been made here to-day that there is anything fallacious or untrustworthy in the principle of proportional representation on which to base election to a chamber such as this.  If that principle is threatened, if it is questioned by any Government, whether the Government in power at the moment or some other Government, it should be questioned on its merits and the principle itself should be examined and if found to be untrustworthy or likely to lead to evils greater than some other principle would lead to, it should be abandoned, but I do not think that, while it is the foundation of the representation of this House, that foundation should be rendered insecure by any tampering <Col N="1317" /> with it.  It is admitted by the members of the Government who have spoken that in so far as constituencies become smaller, through the smaller number of members, the principle of proportional representation is interfered with.</P>
      <P>It must be clear that when we drop down from a five-member constituency to a three-member constituency, we are doing away with a great deal of what is intended by proportional representation&mdash;that minorities, and not contemptible minorities, but minorities still relatively small, should have a possibility of gaining representation in the House.  With a three-member constituency, that possibility is diminished, so that the condition becomes almost nugatory from that point of view.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce said, and I would be inclined to agree with him, that he thought five the most suitable number of members for a constituency to elect, but under this Bill the smallest number of constituencies are to elect five.  No less than 20 are to have three, a number which admittedly interferes with the value of proportional representation; four constituencies are to have nine and five constituencies are to have eight, that is to say, that the Government, in its desire to base its representation on five-member constituencies, has been able to do it only in eight of the 37 constituencies into which the country is to be divided.  I was interested to hear the views on proportional representation of the Deputy representing County Galway.  He had no quarrel with the principle of proportional representation and he thought that it might have been allowed to persist in this country until there happened to be returned, through that principle, a larger number of Deputies holding views opposite to his than he wished to see returned.  The whole merit of proportional representation consists in making sure, so far as is practicable, that minorities will be represented according to their numerical strength in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy thought it was undesirable that those who happened to be in a minority in the country at a particular <Col N="1318" /> moment should have representation approaching their numerical strength in the country, because when they came here they gave expression to views which differed from his.  He does not openly question the principle of proportional representation but he is against it as soon as it brings in members who differ from him.  That is the only criticism of the principle of proportional representation we have had to-day from any of those who supported the Bill, either in whole or in part.  It is because I believe that the basis of the democratic constitution rests on proportional representation that I object to the Bill in so far as it interferes with proportional representation. I am not competent to express any views on the mutilation of various county areas.  From the sentimental and historical point of view, I think that everyone would prefer that the county areas would remain undisturbed and I think that local knowledge will show&mdash;the local knowledge I have of some of the areas mentioned and the local knowledge of many other Deputies&mdash;that great inconvenience may result from undue interference with those county areas. I would ask the Government seriously to consider the suggestion made by Deputy Brodrick that the Bill should be dealt with by a committee representative of all Parties in the House, at which it is possible that an agreed measure, that is, agreement on several principles of the Bill, might result.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Rowlette, my chief objection to this Bill is that it interferes with the principles of proportional representation.  I think that every Deputy will agree that proportional representation has hitherto provided for a number of Parties and for minorities fair representation in this Dáil.  If one analyses the results of the elections in any county one will find pretty accurately that the Parties have got representation in proportion to the number of votes they got.  I am not at all satisfied that even a constituency of five members is the best constituency to provide a true index of the results of proportional representation. I believe that large constituencies would provide better results. <Col N="1319" /> Outside proportional representation there are other difficulties in this particular Bill.</P>
      <P>Without making any charges of gerrymandering&mdash;and I do not propose to make any charges of gerrymandering&mdash;I should say that the distribution of seats in the proposed Bill is not equitable.  Various Deputies have spoken with regard to the different counties.  I should like to take a short analysis of two southern counties.  The Minister said that there were 13 constituencies with a population of less than 20,000 per Deputy returning Deputies here.  That is to say there are 13 constituencies with a population of less than 20,000 for each Deputy. The full reduction in the number of seats is only 11 so that these figures do not seem to work out right.  We have it as a fact that several constituencies returning Deputies with a population of more than 20,000 for each Deputy are cut down or partitioned.  Limerick has a population of 140,000 odd on the 1926 census basis.  That represents seven Deputies.  We may assume that the population has increased since 1926.  Everybody must assume that it has, for it is natural that a county like Limerick with a large city will increase in greater proportion than the increase in counties that have not a large urban population.  But Limerick is being cut one member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should make no case on that if the object of the Bill was to provide setting this House on an equitable basis.  No one would grumble about that.  I would not grumble if this House were cut down to a representation of 100.  But the comparison between Limerick and Clare is particularly illuminating. Limerick is being cut down though it has a population of 140,000 and was represented by seven Deputies.  Limerick has probably increased very much more in population since 1926 than Clare.  Clare failed by a few thousand to provide the 20,000 basis of population for its five members.  But to preserve the intergrity of Clare as a five-member constituency unit the framers of the Bill resorted to the expedient of putting in a little bit of Galway so that Clare would exceed somewhat the proportion <Col N="1320" /> of 20,000 per Deputy.  The population of Clare is 95,000 on the 1926 basis.  Obviously under the circumstances it would be impossible within the Constitution to keep five Deputies in Clare.  Either Clare had to be reduced to four Deputies, or in order to keep on the fifth a little section of another county had to be added.  The framers of the Bill chose the later alternative and they made it a five-Deputy constituency.</P>
    <P>Like most Deputies on this side of the House I am totally opposed to the dismemberment of counties.  If there was to be any dismemberment of counties, a dismemberment that would not have the disadvantage of creating local dissatisfaction, there might have been a small dismemberment of Clare. We might have gone back to the old days when Limerick City had representation on its own.  That might have been the best way of settling that difficulty&mdash;to take a section of Clare contiguous to Limerick, that part of Clare which has business connections with the City and which is affiliated in many ways with Limerick.  That part of Clare might have been included in Limerick City.  A portion of Clare might have been brought into Limerick in this way to make the city in itself sufficient to return three Deputies.  I am only making this suggestion to the Minister.  That would be one possible way of doing it, and leaving the rest of Limerick alone.</P>
    <P>As I have already said Limerick on the 1926 census basis has a population of 140,000.  I believe that the population has grown more in the City of Limerick than in Clare.  By taking into Limerick City part of the old Limerick No. 2 Rural District, a three-member constituency could be provided for the City of Limerick.  If it were necessary to divide the County Limerick for the sake of convenience it might have been divided in a convenient manner and not as it is under the Bill.  If one divides a square one divides it down the middle of the rectangle.  One does not divide a square diagonally.  If Limerick County were cut down the middle you would have provided two constituencies more easily worked.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that. The only object of cutting the constituency would be to make it more convenient for the Deputies to canvass.  I will say that the larger area is the better way.  I am not speaking now in any biased way for I am talking on behalf of the smaller Parties, the Independents and the Labour Parties, for instance.  The division of Limerick is obviously unfair to Labour.  If there is definitely any section in this House that should be opposed to this Bill in its general character it is the Labour Party.  The division of Limerick is obviously unfair to the Labour Party.  Limerick is cut diagonally leaving the constituency quite as long as at present.  The distance from Kilbeheny near Mitchelstown to Tarbert is somewhere about 75 miles. Surely that does not make the constituency of West Limerick very convenient to work from the point of view of the Deputies who have to canvass it. It does not make it any easier than it was when the whole county was together.  A man would have to travel from Kilbeheny to Tarbert under the conditions in the Bill but he would not have to travel any bit longer under existing conditions so that there is no interest served and there is no saving in that way in the Bill.  There may be something in the population basis as the Minister says.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I were to draw up a Bill myself I would give Limerick City three members, leaving the county as a whole for another division.  There is enough in Limerick to entitle the county and city to seven Deputies. There would be a much greater argument for making Limerick a unit in itself, and leaving Clare as it was without dismembering Galway.  The small section of Clare which had previously been included in the Limerick constituency could be added on to Limerick City and the two pnrely agricultural communities might be left.  Something might be said for that arrangement. If the Ministry did not see their way to do that I do not see that they have any right to cut down the number of <Col N="1322" /> Deputies in Limerick unless they proceed on an equitable basis in reducing members in every constituency.  There are some constituencies with the same ratio of population to Deputies that have not been reduced, and that is unfair.  If you are going to make a proper reduction in representation you cannot discriminate unfairly.  And there is unfair discrimination in this Bill in regard to the counties.  I have not got the list before me, but the mere statement of the Minister that there are 13 constituencies providing Deputies with a population of less than 20,000 for each Deputy and then the fact that there is only 11 of a reduction in the constituencies is an obvious proof that there are still some left.</P>

      <P>The Minister's statement was that there- are 13 constituencies with less than 20,000.  Perhaps he unintentionally made the mistake, but he said that there were 13 constituencies with a population of less than 20,000 and five with a population of less than 19,000.  At any rate, on that argument there is no case made for a reduction in the case of Limerick, which exceeds the 20,000 basis.  Unless there is a proper system worked out which will give a fair representation to all parts of the country, it is obviously unfair to discriminate as between one county and another.  There has been discrimination in the case of Limerick and Tipperary with regard to contiguous counties.  The Clare case is an obvious one where the representation fell a little short of the 20,000 and the expedient was resorted to of adding a piece of Galway.  Limerick could have <Col N="1323" /> been left alone without any violation of the Constitution or existing conditions.</P>
      <P>This unquestionably interferes with proportional representation.  I hold that large constituencies provide the best possible way of getting fair representation for the big and small Parties and the Independents.  I have no objection to a fair Independent representation. The Independent representatives we have had since the inauguration of the Dáil have been a great help in the preparation of legislation and otherwise; undoubtedly they have been a credit and any legislation that provides for a reduction of their numbers is not to be recommended. That is my principal objection. My second point is that if there is to be a reduction&mdash;and if there were a far greater reduction one might not object&mdash;it should be made on a fair basis and there should be no discrimination between one county and another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>A good many Deputies talked against the Bill on the ground that it was interfering with the principle of proportional representation. The Bill was deliberately framed to preserve that principle and it does so. There is, of course, a difference of opinion between people as to what is the ideal form of proportional representation. Some would like to see the whole of Ireland, that portion of it that this House for the time being controls, as one constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite true, there is a limit to most things.  But the fact remains that there are some people who would regard the whole of the Free State as an ideal constituency. <Col N="1324" /> There are many ideas as to what is the best form of proportional representation and the best area to select as a constituency.  I have taken a great interest in proportional representation. I was a member of a proportional representation society in this country long before the idea was definitely adopted as a guiding principle in elections.  I still stand for proportional representation.  I believe in this country it is suited to the needs of the people and I would vote against any Bill that proposed to abolish the system.  There are, of course, different schemes of proportional representation and I believe the one proposed in this Bill, the modified form that is adopted in the Bill, is the one that will give a fair opportunity to every Party that would be entitled to be heard in a deliberative assembly such as this.  I believe every such Party will get fair representation under this Bill.  I take full responsibility for the Bill, for whatever defects and merits it may possess.  I think it was Deputy Broderick who talked about officials of the Department getting instructions and drawing up a Bill without taking particular care as to different localities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Broderick Mr. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite certain who was responsible.  I withdraw my remark as regards the Deputy.  Perhaps it was Deputy Roddy who said it. However, the fact is that the officials act on instructions and I do not want anybody to think that the officials are responsible for what is in the Bill.  I am the person primarily responsible and I take that responsibility.  The officials in all Departments act on their instructions and advise, to the best of their ability, every Minister who asks their advice and guidance. The Minister lays down the lines and the principles which he wishes them to follow and they act on instructions.  I am satisfied that the principle of proportional representation has been preserved in a form that will give opportunities for representation to such minorities as would be likely to get a hearing in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1325" /> Another charge made was that there was a change of policy on the part of members of Fianna Fáil as regards what was spoken of before we took charge as a Ministry here. Undoubtedly, speakers on Fianna Fáil platforms did, I am sure, say on many occasions that the numbers in this House ought to be reduced.  Some went so far as to suggest 100 as being the number that would be suitable for this House.  I agree that the number of Deputies, if they are to be adequately representative of the country, ought not to be reduced to 100.  When I say that I am not thinking alone of population; I am thinking of the very wide area some members in the House have to cover in their constituencies.  This applies to members of our Party and of other Parties equally in the House.  When Deputies attend in the House, during the week-ends they have to visit their constituencies and they cover large areas so as to meet people and hear their grievances.  They are driving about and they never spend any time at home.  Some constituencies are very difficult to cover.  Looking at it from a practical point of view, and considering the amount of travelling and correspondence the average Deputy has to do, I think it would not be practicable to reduce the numbers in the House to anything below the figure I have suggested in the Bill.  I consider that Deputies, especially in the rural areas, have a very difficult task.  In the cities it is easy enough, because people come to our homes, but in the country where a constituency might be 70 miles in extent&mdash;and there are some constituencies considerably longer than that&mdash;Deputies have a really difficult time and if the numbers were reduced to 100 or 110 it would make the job practically impossible in many constituencies. The people would not have the touch with the Deputies that they would desire and there would be a loss of touch between members and their constituencies and, therefore, between the constituencies and this Assembly.  I think, therefore, that while there might be a few more lopped off here and there&mdash;it is possible perhaps that there might be a <Col N="1326" /> few lopped off&mdash;some even think that we have gone too far and that we should add a few more.  I am not absolutely tied down to 136 but I think it as near as we ought to go in reducing the number of members of the House.  Another point that we should bear in mind is this: According to the Constitution, we are bound to draw up our Bill on the last census.  The last census was taken a good many years ago&mdash;in 1926&mdash;and as a result of the non-emigration from the country, in the last three or four years in particular, the population has been growing, but we are not allowed by the Constitution to take note of any other figures than the figures of the last census.</P>
    <P>It is a pity, from that point of view, at any rate, that the Bill, that it was necessary to bring in according to the Constitution, was not brought in at a time nearer to the date of the census so that it would be a better reflex, not alone then but in future years, of the actual state of the population as soon as possible after the census had been taken.  It may mean, perhaps, that the Government may have to bring in another Bill after the figures of the next census are available.  I think it would be wise&mdash;and that was evidently the intention of those who drew up the Constitution&mdash;to have the membership of the House, within limits, as nearly representative as possible of the number of the population taken at the time of the census.</P>
    <P>So far, of course, we have to admit that there were certainly a number of Deputies, especially on our side of the House, who did suggest that we ought to try to get down to the number of 100.  I say now that I am not adopting the view they put forward, because I thought, on examination, that it was not practicable or wise, and, if you like, I convinced my colleagues of that.  Some of them took a good deal of convincing.</P>

      <P>Judging by practically all the speeches made, with the exception of the speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and my own, they were all criticisms of the Bill; but I expected that.  I did not expect anything else, because in a Bill of this kind, no matter who brings it in he is bound to hurt somebody's political and constituency susceptibilities.  That is almost certain, and therefore everybody who is touched in any way or who is likely to be touched, or who thinks he is going to be injured in any way, or who thinks that it will make it a little more difficult for him to get in and to secure the number of votes, that he thinks he would require, is bound to protest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that is what most of the Deputies who spoke against the Bill to-day&mdash;perhaps not all of them&mdash;were thinking of; or if they were not thinking of themselves they were thinking of some of their friends who were likely to be adversely affected as a result of the changes.  I know that applies to my own Party, and I should like to say that, outside the members of the Executive, not one member of our Party ever saw this Bill until it was published.  When it was published and brought to their notice I had many protests from members of my own Party, and they protested just as members of the Opposition did to-day.  I assure the House that the Bill was not prepared in any Party sense or that I had the interests of any Party in mind. The members of my own Party certainly were not consulted and their protests in regard to individual constituencies were not listened to.  I had some fairly warm protests from some of my own colleagues who thought that their interests were not being looked after as they expected they would be, or as they thought they should be. The Bill was not drawn up in that sense.  We tried to get a Bill that would meet the exigencies of the <Col N="1328" /> situation and that also would reflect the country's mind and the country's view.  The principles that I enunciated in the Second Reading speech and that were emphasised by the Minister for Industry and Commerce were the principles that we went on in drawing up the Bill.  We did try to preserve the county boundaries, and we have succeeded to a better extent than I anticipated.  There are some counties where the boundaries have been preserved but where constituencies have been divided.  I do not agree that when the county boundaries have been preserved and the constituency has been divided in two that that is destroying the county boundary.  It is not.  The county is still preserved as a whole.  We have not been able to do it everywhere.  For instance, in the cases referred to to-day by Deputy Brennan and Deputy MacDermot we have not been able to do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister please explain why not?  Why was it necessary to interfere with a county that had a population of 83,500 and was perfectly entitled to four members?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It was obvious that we had to interfere with some counties. I think that I had&mdash;I will not say a dozen&mdash;but I would say that I had ten different schemes and in every case I found that it was impossible to draw up a scheme on the lines that had been laid down without infringing the boundary lines of some counties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not grasp my point.  I can understand if a county had not got a population which fitted in with the idea that each Deputy would represent, roughly, 20,000 to 22,000 of the population, that there it was necessary to do something&mdash;either to throw two counties together or even to infringe on the county boundary&mdash;although I cannot say that I would agree with the latter &mdash;but where you have a county that is self sufficient and has got exactly the right population for the existing representation in the Dáil, what justification can there be for cutting up that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Some counties had to be interfered with and it happened <Col N="1329" /> that, when considering the position of the surrounding counties, some county had to give way somewhere in order to give extra population to another county that was being reduced in numbers.  What I was anxious to do was, as far as possible, to get small numbers&mdash;three or five, and get uneven numbers.  It is also done to an extent in County Cork.  Youghal had administrative associations with Waterford. Deputy Corry said to-day Cork ruled part of Waterford.  I do not agree with him in that.  It might be just as true to say that Waterford ruled in Youghal.  A joint committee met there for administrative purposes, but there was a long and intimate association between Youghal and Waterford.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bennett in discussing County Limerick did not say much on the question of the reduction of members.  Some of his Party, however, wanted a reduction of members <Col N="1330" /> and rather chided us that we had not reduced the number still further.  In a scheme of this kind some counties have to be hit.  For my own part, I was not anxious, and should not be anxious, if I judged from a purely Party point of view, to reduce the number either in Tipperary or Limerick, but these were two of the counties selected for reduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Why select any county? It certainly could not be claimed that it was done for Party purposes, because Fianna Fáil is strong in both of those counties, and we could have selected counties where we were much less likely to get the strong support that we get in those counties.  Deputy Bennett complained of the way in which County Limerick was divided and of how the line was drawn.  That had to be done from the point of view of population.  The heavy end of the population is in and around the city with the result that in Limerick one constituency is almost three times the size of the other constituency, if we take the area into account, but if you have to get a population, you cannot do it in any other way.  What I said in regard to Limerick and Tipperary applies equally to Kerry and Donegal, which have also been divided into two constituencies.  I do not think it applies to Mayo to the same extent. Mayo for a long time, at any rate, has been divided into two constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Kerry is divided.  The population has not decreased in Kerry as it has in Limerick.  Deputy Norton asked if representations were made to me to carve up constituencies.  Representations of that kind or any other kind were not made to me until the Bill was introduced and then I had representations of all kinds from all places.  The Bill, as I said, was not prepared in consultation with the Party.  To go back to the question of proportional representation, if the constituencies are large under proportional representation, as some of them <Col N="1331" /> now are, some people, as I said, would like to have them still larger. The larger the constituency the more necessary it is to have a powerful and wealthy organisation.  In very large constituencies minorities have a very poor chance of election unless they have a very powerful political machine behind them with plenty of money.  A moderately small constituency gives a better chance to a minority.  That has been our experience, at any rate.  The larger a constituency the more it throws the electorate into the hands of the big and powerful and wealthy Party. Within limits, a small constituency gives a better chance to the independent man, to the man who is standing on his own and who wants to get elected.  It gives him a vastly better chance than a very large constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter that people will divide upon.  You will get very wide differences of opinion as to what the limits of a constituency ought to be.  For my part, I would prefer the number that I have put into this Bill, that is, three.  As to the suggestion of gerrymandering&mdash; the charge was not definitely made; even Deputy MacDermot, I think, did not commit himself to that&mdash;but even if that charge were made, I say this, that I believe that opinion in this country in the last few years has been very fluid.  We are told by Deputies opposite that they have the backing of the vast majority of the people of the country to-day.  If that be so, it does not matter what the constituency is, or how one might attempt to gerrymander it.  If there is a big backing for any one Party in the country, no matter how you try to carve up the country or cut up constituencies or enlarge them, their view-point will get representation to the full extent to which it is entitled.  It would, therefore, be futile for any Minister or Government to try to gerrymander. I believe that political notions and ideas are fluid enough to-day.  There have been very considerable changes <Col N="1332" /> in the last few years.  It is quite possible that people who have changed in the last few years may change again.  No amount of gerrymandering will stop that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>So that gerrymandering will not save any Party.  It would be foolish to try, and we are not trying it.  I think it was Deputy Mulcahy suggested taking the country as a whole and dividing it up into five-member constituencies.  What would become of the county boundaries if that principle were adopted?  We would have some other charge levelled against us if we tried that.  The county boundaries would no longer be sacrosanct then.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins talked about the terrible thing it was to have County Carlow cut up.  I do not like to cut up County Carlow any more than I like to cut up any other county.  My own&mdash;I cannot call it county&mdash;City of Dublin is being cut up, and it is done for the purpose of getting smaller constituencies.  Deputy O'Higgins talked about one neighbour being in Carlow and the other in Kildare. That obtains at present.  There are people living side by side who are in different administrative areas, and in different counties.  I do not see what great difference it can make to them.  I do not say that the Bill is ideal.  I do not think that any Bill of the kind which could be introduced by anybody would be ideal.  Nothing in this life reaches the ideal of most of us, because those things are done by human beings and, therefore, they cannot reach perfection.  I do believe, however, that by the adoption of this <Col N="1333" /> Bill you will get fair representation of the views of the country.  You will the better get that representation by having a big number of small constituencies than a smaller number of large constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I say it is better for the small organisation, for the independent man, and for the minority.  Another thing it will do&mdash;and if Deputy MacDermot ever thinks of being able to form a Government he should bear this in mind&mdash;is that it will have the effect of giving to whoever is elected a better chance of having a stable Government, and that is important.  If there is one thing which has caused a good deal of trouble in those countries which have proportional representation in Europe to-day it is the want of stability as a result of that proportional representation. I think that this form&mdash;this modified form, if you like&mdash;of proportional representation will give a chance, whatever group is elected in sufficient majority to have a Government, to have more stability than has existed since the Free State was established.  I think that is an important principle, and I think it will work out that way.  I think it will serve the country and serve any Party elected to take control.  I believe that the lines on which I have gone in drafting this Bill will result in getting a House that will be truly representative of the people.  I believe that it will give a full opportunity to small as well as to big Parties to get their full measure of representation.  It will, as I have said, mean stability as well.  In all those circumstances I think it will be for the <Col N="1334" /> good of the country to adopt the measure which I had the pleasure of proposing.</P>

      <P>I move that the Dáil concur with the Seanad in amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 1.  The figures and words &ldquo;31st day of March, 1935&rdquo; deleted in line 19 and the figures and words &ldquo;31st day of July, 1934&rdquo; substituted therefor.</P>
      <P>This is an amendment which the Seanad insisted on inserting last night, limiting the operation of the Bill to the period ending the 31st day of July, instead of the usual 12 monthly period. In my opinion, this action on the part of the Seanad is part of the obstructive tactics which have been used by elements here and in England to obstruct and sabotage the efforts of this Government to maintain and defend the rights of the people.  I have no doubt, however, that the decent young men of the country will give the Seanad an answer by joining up in their thousands in the next couple of months the Volunteer section of the Army.  The young men of the country will show the Seanad and Senator Blythe that no private army will be allowed with impunity to seize power here, even with the support and assistance of the British and their other old allies.</P>

      <P>Personally I would expect that when the Minister is moving to accept the amendment made in the Seanad that he would do it in a different way from that in which the Minister did it.  As often happens with people of slow mentality and with stupid people, the Minister can only vent himself in very futile spleen.  The &ldquo;elements here and in England trying to sabotage and obstruct&rdquo;!  What are the facts?  The Government wanted, out of the public purse, to put money into the pockets of certain friends of theirs.  Instead of doing it decently, by giving them pensions, they proceed to bring into the Army these people&mdash;people obviously unsuitable for the work they are doing.  Whether they are suitable for any work I do not know, but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I wanted to speak about, but the Minister in a scurrilous way&mdash;not to put it any stronger&mdash;is trying to suggest, as his mind can only move on these lines, that this amendment is sabotage and an obstruction of the work of the Government, and that people here and other people in England are engaged in that obstruction and sabotage.  The Minister and his colleagues talk about the rights of the people and talk about forgetting the past and working for unity.  But he is the sort of man who thinks it is right that anybody who does not agree in conniving at the acts of the Government should be denounced as an ex-Britisher who is sabotaging and obstructing the work of the State. That is the sort of thing we would expect from the type that the Minister is.  The truth is that there was an attempt made to bring back people from the ends of the earth and to give the money out of the public purse for work for which they are unfitted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What I understand is, that the Seanad is not objecting to renewal of the Defence Forces Act, but seeks to prevent the Government from doing a wrong act.  The Seanad objects to being put into the position of conniving with the Minister in bringing people into the Army nominally to take charge of men and to train them while those people are themselves untrained and unfitted to do this work.  Instead of conniving at that, the Seanad took the alternative of limiting the Bill to the 31st July, 1934.  I do not see that the Seanad had any other option.  I hope that within these few short months the Government will have become wise, if not decent, and will recognise that it is clearly necessary and desirable that whomever they intend to put in charge of training the new volunteer force should themselves be trained first.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is eminently desirable on an occasion of this character to reserve, as far as one can, detachment. Still I do not think the occasion should be allowed pass without drawing the attention of the House and particularly of the Minister's own colleagues to the nature of the speech he has just made.  If the speech had come from another man I would have imagined that he had searched his vocabulary for the purpose of extracting from it and using the most offensive and at the same time the most unjustifiable language he was in a position to command.  Coming as it does from the Minister for Defence, with his scandalous record in debate in this House, the language he thought fit to employ does not surprise me.</P>
      <P>But it is a commentary on the purpose he suggests that he is trying to serve in the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Bill.  The purpose which he professes to serve is to bury the past differences, to eliminate bitterness and to provide a common platform upon which men who have parted in the past may meet again.  In the service of that purpose he charges by implication the whole Opposition in this country and in this Parliament with being in a conspiracy with certain persons in England for the purpose of sabotaging the Irish Government and preventing them from taking the necessary precautions to maintain the supremacy of the will of the people in this country.  From a responsible man such charges would be loathsome. From the Minister for Defence they are merely disgusting and grotesque.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting also that on this occasion the Minister has chosen to do what has never before been done in this House&mdash;that is, to make a scurrilous attack on Seanad Eireann.  This House will note and remember that <Col N="1341" /> the Minister, who makes that scurrilous attack on Seanad Eireann, is himself at present on trial before the Committee of Procedure and Privileges of Seanad Eireann for what is represented as being a gross outrage on the privileges of that House.  The Minister is at present smarting under the rebuke administered to him by the Chairman of that House and by the obligation that has been put upon him by the Cathaoirleach and members of that House to appear before the Committee of Procedure and Privileges to explain his dictatorial and tyrannical attitude.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Under normal circumstances, I would not refer to the matter, but a disgusting attack has been made on Seanad Eireann by the Minister, and it is right, I think, that the secondary motives for that attack should be exposed.  This Minister is under censure and is at present feebly trying to justify the attitude adopted by him with reference to the servants of yourself and the Cathaoirleach of Seanad Eireann.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am submitting that part of the splenetic attitude adopted by the Minister was due to the fact that he is at present appearing before the Committee of Procedure and Privileges of Seanad Eireann, that he has been rebuked by the Cathaoirleach and I am submitting that as a secondary reason for the speech made by the Minister.  The speech made by this man is deplorable to the last degree.  I can only hope, though I cannot believe, that it does not display the real spirit which inspires the <Col N="1342" /> Minister in the whole matter connected with the raising of the new force.  He will find it difficult to convince the people of this country after they have read the speech he made here to-day that we were not right when we stated, as we now state again, that the purpose in the Minister's mind when he founded that volunteer force&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Our representations in connection with that need not then be further referred to.  I think it right, however, to comment on this, that a restriction has been placed on the powers under which the Minister proposes to act with a view to creating this force.  He has three months, under the amendment which we are called upon to accept here to-day, to do a certain job and that job is to bring together men who were parted in the past.  I think when he is engaged on that task he should remember the men who were so deplorably parted and who we all hope, despite the Minister's attitude, may forget the bitterness that divided them in the past, are not boys of 18 to 23.  The men who were unhappily divided in the civil war are now men of 28 to 35.  If he wants to provide a platform for them, if he wants to go back on the attitude which he showed here to-day, he would do well to concentrate his attention on that stratum of our population and not on the younger members of the population to whom the use of arms will be a novelty. I deplore most strongly the terms in which the Minister spoke here to-day and I trust that the attack which he made upon another House of this Oireachtas will constitute no precedent for any Minister on those benches opposite or any member of this Opposition.</P>

Measaim go gcaithfear isteach is amach le £100,000 i rith na bliadhna airgeadais atá anois ann, agus suas le £120,000, sna bliadhanta atá rómhainn. Do caitheadh roinnt mhór airgid, freisin, chun Ceárd-Scolta agus Gairm-Scolta do sholáthar do Choistí Gairm-Oideachais.</P>
    <P>Ní raibh oiread múinteoirí Bun-Oideachais ar fagháil ó Choláistí Oileamhna na mban agus bhí ag teastáil sna scolta, agus tá modh fá chomhairle againn chun a n-uimhir sin do mhéadú.  Tá a mhalairt de scéal againn i dtaobh na bhfear, ámh; bhí beagán de bhreis agus ár ndóthain fear againn, i dtreo agus gurbh éigean <Col N="1345" /> dúinn baint d'uimhir na n-oileamhnach. Tá feabhas mór tagtha ar cháilidheacht an aos léighinn a glactar isteach sna Coláistí Oileamhna, agus is é fáth atá leis sin ná an t-árdú a rinneadh ar an gcaighdeán ionadachta, fothú na gColáistí Ullmhucháin agus an córas nua scoláir oideachais do ceapadh do chailíní.</P>
    <P>Fé mar is guáth rug scoláirí na gColáistí Ullmhúcháin an chraobh leo ag scrúduighthe na Meán-Scol. D'éirigh leo sin agus le scoláirí na Meán-Scol mór bhFíor-Ghaedhealach formhór d'onóir na scrúduighthe do ghabháil eatortha&mdash;agus sin cruthamhnas eile againn go bhfuil an Ghaedhilg oireamhach, mar mhodh mhúinte, do riachtanaisí uile na scolaidheachta.  Ba mhaith liom, sul a scarainn leis na Coláistí Ullmhucháin mí-thuigsint atá go han-choitcheann ar dhaoine (mar shaoilim) i dtaobh na bhfolamhantaisí atá i n-áirithe do scoláirí ón bhFíor-Ghaedhealtacht do scaipeadh.  Is ró-mhinic adéartar, le déannaighe go gcoimeádtar 80 per cent. de na folamhantaisí sna Coláistí Oileamhna do bhuachaillí agus do chailíní ón bhFíor-Ghaedhealtacht. 'Sé fírinne an scéil ach ná coimeádtar fiú 20 per cent. de na folamhantaisí sna Coláistí Oileamhna do bhuachaillí agus do chailíní ón bhFíor-Ghaedhealtacht. Is fíor go bhfuil 40 per cent. de na folamhantaisí sna Coláistí Ullmhucháin i n-áirithe do scoláirí ón bhFíor-Ghaedhealtacht ach ó thárla nach bhfaightear ó na Coláistí Ullmhucháin ach níos lugha ná an tríomhadh cuid de na scoláirí a mbíonn ionad dóibh sna Coláistí Oileamhna fágann san nach bhfuil sa 40 per cent. d'fholamhantaisí i n-áirithe sna Coláistí Ullmhucháin ach níos lugha ná trian den 40 per cent. sna Coláistí Oileamhna; sé sin timcheall le 13 per cent. de na folamhantaisí a bhíonn i n-áirithe sna Coláistí Oileamhna do scoláirí ón bhFíor-Ghaedhealtacht. 'Na theannta sin tá 20 per cent. de na folamhantaisí sna Coláistí Ullmhucháin i n-áirithe do scoláirí ón bhFíor-Ghaedhealtacht agus ón mBreac-Ghaedhealtacht agus is ionann sin nó 6 per cent., nó mar sin, de na folamhantaisí sna Coláistí Oileamhna; sé sin go bhfuil 19 per <Col N="1346" /> cent. d'fholamhantaisí na gColáistí Oileamhna&mdash;nó níos lugha ná an cúigmheadh cuid&mdash;i n-áirithe d'iarrthóirí ó cheanntair na Gaedhealtachta go huile.  Ní meastar go bhfuil an méid sin ró mhór mar tá an seismhadh cuid de dhaonradh na tíre sa nGaedhealtacht. Is fíor go bhfuil 20 per cent. de na hionaid sna Coláistí Ullmhucháin i n-áirithe d'iomaidhtheoirí a gheibheann 85 per cent. i n-urlabhra na Gaedhilge, ach tá cead ag scoláirí ó gach ceanntar iomaidheacht do dhéanamh do na folamhantaisí sin; agus ar ndóigh is é is lugha is gann dúinn súil do bheith againn go bhféadfadh iarrthóirí a chuireas rómpa iomlán a gcuid oibre do dhéanamh tríd an nGaedhilg 85 per cent. do ghnóthú i n-urlabhra na teangan ag an scrúdú ionadachta.</P>
    <P>Is áthas liom a rádh go bhfuil méadú mór ar uimhir na n-iarrthóirí ó na ceanntair fhíor-Ghaedhealacha ó thugamar cabhair airgid do bhuachaillí agus do chailíní na gceanntar sin chun a chur ar gcumas dá dtuismidhtheoirí iad do chur chun na gColáistí Ullmhucháin agus iad do chongbháil ionnta.  Is áthas liom, freisin, go bhfuil na tuarascbhála gheibhtear ó na coláistí ar shaothar na scoláirí sin go han-tsásamhail.  Tá súil againn go mbeidh staid na Gaedhilge abhfad níos fearr sna scolta ar ball nuair bheidh bun maith de na cainnteoirí dúthchais seo ag gabháil d'obair na múinteoireachta.  Ach maidir le staid na Gaedhilge sna Bun-Scolta i láthair na huaire ní féidir liom a rádh go bhfuilim sásta leis.  Níl ach aon scoil amháin fán gcéad díobh, taobh amuigh den Fhíor&mdash;Ghaedhealtacht, ag múineadh iomlán na n-ádhbhar tríd an sin ar dheich mbliadhna de dhlúthshaothar, agus is cóir fiosruighe 'na thaobh do chur ar bun.  Tá breis agus caoga scol againn i gceanntair abhfad ón nGaedhealtacht, agus gan i gcuid aca ach scolta tuaithe agus gan ionnta ach beirt mhúinteoirí, agus deineann siad iomlán a gcuid oibre tríd an nGaedhilg agus deineann siad go sár-mhaith í.  Deallruigheann sé sin nach bhfuil aon nídh sa Chlár Oibre a bhacfadh ar scolta eile an rud céadna do dhéanamh, go mór mór <Col N="1347" /> anois agus an Teastas Dhá-Theangach ag oiread sin de na múinteoirí. Maidir le múineadh na ngnáth-ádhbhar &mdash;taobh amuigh de cheist na Gaedhilge ar fad&mdash;tá a thoradh sásmhail go leor i ngach cás ach amháin an Tuaith-Eolaidheacht agus an Mhatamaitic, agus ní fheicim go bhfuil mórán dul ar aghaidh á dhéanamh leo sin.</P>
    <P>Sul a scaraidh mé leis na Bun-Scolta ba mhaith liom airdheanna áirithe inspéise dár gcóras oideachais atá dá saothrú againn le roinnt bhliadhain anuas do chur fá nbhur n-aire.  Ceann díobh sin is eadh an tsraith de chuirmeacha ceoil a tugtar saor do leanbhaí na Scol Náisiúnta i mBaile Átha Cliath.  A bhuidheachas sin againn ar Cholonel Brase; do thosnuigh sé ar na cuirmeacha sin anuraidh agus do lean díobh imbliadhna, agus thug Priomh-Bhuidhean Cheoil an Airm, fá stiúradh phearsanta an Cholonel, dhá chuirm ceoil gach seachtain i rith an gheimhridh do na leanbhaí scoile.  Is cinnte go n-árdóchaidh sé sin caighdeán an cheoil agus go rachaidh sé chun leasa go mór do.  Forfhás inspéise eile is eadh an fheidhm a baintear as oilteacht Mhúinteoirí an Airm chun lán-chúrsaí lúth-chleasaidheachta do thabhairt do scoláirí sna Coláistí Ullmhucháin agus sna Coláistí Oileamhna, agus do mhúinteoirí scoile atá ar feadhmannas i n-áiteacha mar a bhfuil suidhe Airm.  I dteannta an fhorfháis sin sna Scolta Náisiúnta tá forfhás seasmhach ag teacht ar lúth-chleasaidheacht sna scolta atá fá chúram Coistí an Ghairm-Oideachais ó cuireadh Cúrsa Samhraidh ar bun do mhúinteoirí san Iúl seo ghabh tharainn.</P>
    <P>Is é mo thuairim nach gcuirtear ceart suime i lúth-chleasaidheacht sa tír seo, ach tá súil agam, de thoradh an fhorfháis nua seo go bhfaghaidh sí a hionad cóir feasta i n-oideachas na hEireann.  Forfhás inspéise eile i gcúrsaí oideachais is eadh an scéim do ceapadh chun deontas beag bliadhantamhail do thabhairt do gach teaghlach sa nGeadhealtacht ar son gach leinbh a bhfuil ar a chumas an Ghaedhilg do labhairt go bríoghmhar agus go nádúrtha de bharr í bheith da <Col N="1348" /> ghnáth-labhairt sa mbaile.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh de dheagh-thoradh ar an scéim seo nach amháin go gcoimeádfar an Ghaedhilg 'na beathaidh i dteaghlacha na Gaedhealtachta agus na Breac-Ghaedhealtachta ach go gcuirfear oiread san de bhorradh agus de lúth innti go leathfar amach thar teoranna na gceanntar sin í.</P>
    <P>Is iad an dá nídh is inspéise le rádh i dtaobh an Mheán-Oideachais ná (1) an bhreis atá tagtha ar uimhir na scoláirí atá freastal na Meán-Scol, agus (2) an leathnú atá tagtha ar an nGaedhilg mar mhodh múinte sna scolta sin.  Bhí beagán níos mó ná 20,000 (20,509) scoláire sna Meán-Scolta sa mbliadhain 1921-22; do méaduigheadh ar an uimhir sin sa mbliadhain 1933-34 go 32,382; sin 57 per cent. de bhreis tinnrimh.  Tháinig an bhreis tinnrimh sin cothrom go leor i n-aghaidh na bliadhna agus ní móide go bhfuil barr a fháis sroichte go fóill, mar is mó an bharraidheacht atá ag an mbliadhain seo (1933-34) ar an mbliadhain anuraidh (1,316) ná mar bhí ag aon bhliadhain le déannaighe ar an mbliadhain a ghabh roimpi.</P>
    <P>Tá úsáid na Gaedhilge mar mhodh múinte sna Meán-Scolta ag dul i leithne go seasmhach le deich mbliadhna, ach is le dhá bhliadhain anuas a rinneadh an dul ar aghaidh is mó.  Bhí 34 scoil i Rang A (i scolta gnáth-labhartha Gaedhilge) sa mbliadhain 1931-32; do mhéaduigh an uimhir sin go 47 sa mbliadhain 1932-33, agus tá 60 scoil ag iarraidh cead teacht isteach sa rang seo i mbliadhna.  Do chuaidh uimhir na scol a bhí i Rang B (i scolta 'na ndéantar cuid den teagase tríd an nGaedhilg), do chuaidh uimhir na scol sin i méid ó 71 sa mbliadhain 1931-32 go 78 sa mbliadhain 1932-33 agus go 113 i mbliana.  Tá 314 de Mheán-Scolta ann i láthair na huaire, agus is soiléir le tuigsint gurb í an Ghaedhilg an ghnáth-theanga teagaisc i 19 per cent. den uimhir sin, agus go ndéantar cuid den teagase trid an nGaedhilg i 55 per cent.  Is fuiris feabhas agus rathmhaireacht na múinteoireachta a déantar tríd an nGaedhilg sna scolta sin do mheas ó thortha foillsighthe na Scrúduighthe Teastais.  Do fiafruigheadh díom anuraidh cia an dul ar <Col N="1349" /> aghaidh a bhí déanta leis an dtionnscnamh a bhí fá chomhairle le tamall chun Bun-Chúrsaí i dTeangthaibh an Lae Indiu do chur ar bun.  Tá glactha leis an dtionnscnamh sin anois, agus tá Bun-Chúrsaí ar na Cláir Oibre do na teangtha seo: Gaedhilg, Béarla, Frainncis, Gearmáinis, agus d'Eolaidheacht agus do Mhatamaitic i scolta na gcailíní.</P>
    <P>Do rinneadh tagairt annso, breis agus aon uair amháin le linn Meastacháin an Oideachais do bheith fá dhíospóireacht, do cheachtanna sa mbaile, agus dubhradh go raibh an iomarca ullmhucháin agus obair phinn le déanamh ag baile um thráthnóna ag scoláirí na Meán-Scol.  Do chuir mé an nídh sin dá ghéar-scrúdú, agus táthar tar éis cearcallach do chur amach chuig na scolta anois ina dtugtar cómhairle dhóibh ar cia an sórt oibre agus cia an méid oibre ar chóir dóibh súil do bheith aca go ndéanfadh scoláirí ag baile é.  Tá súil agam go gcuirfidh an cearcallach sin deire le n-a raibh de chúrsaí gearáin ag daoinibh.</P>
    <P>Tá tuarascbháil mhaith agam le cur ós bhur gcómhair i dtaobh an Oideachais Leanamhna agus an Cheárd-Oideachais.  Do lean Coistí an Ghairm-Oideachais go dlúth, le bliadhain anuas, den chóras forfháis a bunuigheadh fán Acht nua sa mbliadhain 1931-32.  Is léir ón gcuma 'nar éirigh le n-a n-iarrachtaí ó thús go raibh an-éileamh ar an Oideachas Leanamhna ag daoine óga a bhí tar éis na Bun-Scolta d'fhágháil agus a bhí ag feitheamh le hobair, agus go raibh an t-éileamh céadna ar Cheárd-Oideachas i Ranga Lae agus Tráthnóna. Bhí práinn mhór le méadú na scol a bhí ann cheana agus le tighthe nua do thógáil sna ceanntair a bhí 'na ngábha.  Do chruinnigh na Coistí uile, nach mór, tuille airgid chun foirne múinteoireachta d'fhostú.  Do foscladh áruis nua 'na bhfuarthas feisteas sealadach; agus do ceapadh córais i ngach Conntae, nach mór, chun áruis feileamhnacha a mbéadh buaine ionnta do sholáthar.</P>
    <P>Ní tháinig aon laghdú ar an mborradh ionganatach a bhí ar an obair leanamhna úd i gceanntair tuaithe, ar ar tráchtadh i bhfaisnéis <Col N="1350" /> na bliadhna anuraidh.  Do hoibrigheadh i mbun-áiteacha sna Conntaethe uile agus baineadh triail as cúrsaí éagsamhla.  Tugadh ceart ionaid i ngach cúrsa d'ádhbhair a bhfuil dlúthbhaint aca le saoghal agus le hobair feirmeoireachta, ach níorbh fhéidir saothar do dhéanamh dá réir sin toise a dheacracht a bhí sé múinteoirí Tuaith-Eolaidheachta d'fhagháil, agus ceal córach agus feistis chun ádhbhair fheidhmeamhla do mhúineadh, agus toisc a chostasamhlacht a bhéadh se múinteoirí de gach samhail do thabhairt go háiteacha iargcúlta.  Bhí aon chúrsa amháin, ámh, saor ó na heasbaí sin.  Cúrsa speisialta i dTigheas do chailíní dob eadh é sin, agus bhí sé fá chúram Ban-Mhúinteoir Tighis.  D'fhan sí sa gceanntar i bhfeighil na hoibre i gcómhnaidhe, agus bhí sí admhálach san teagase go léir, nó i n-urmhór de. Bíonn Cócaireacht, Obair Fuaghála, Obair Nigheacháin, Obair Tighis, Sláint - Eolaidheacht agus Réamh-Fhóirithin, Cunntaisí Tighis agus Cóimhfhreagartas ar chlár chúrsa dá leithéid sin.  B'uras a mheas, ón áirdtinnreamh a bhí ag an gcúrsa sin gur thaitnigh na hádhbhair sin leis na cailíní i gcoitchinne, agus tá súil againn go gcuirfear mórán eile de chúrsaí mar é ar bun do chailíní sna ceanntair tuaithe.</P>
    <P>Tá roinnt éigin de mhí-thuigsint ar dhaoinibh i dtaobh Fíor-Oideachais Cheárdamhla agus ba mhaith liom í scaipeadh dhíobh.  Déantar beachtaidheacht ó am go ham a theasbáineas go bhfuil mí-thuigsint ar dhaoinibh i dtaobh an coibhneasa atá ag CeárdOideachas agus ag Tiúscal le n-a céile.  Is é an gearán is minicí a cloistear ach nach mbíonn sé ar gcumas do na Ceárd-Scolta daoine lán-oilte i gcúrsaí speisialta i gcómhair tiúscail nua do chur ar fagháil nuair bhíonn gábha leo, ná i gcómhair seantiúscail a fhorbas ar obainne.  B'fhéidir gur ceart dam an fheidhm atá le Ceárd-Oideachas i gcómhair Tiúscail do léiriú go beacht agus sampla do thabhairt daoibh ar an gcuma 'nar féidir an fheidhm sin do chur i gcrích.</P>
    <P>Tá dhá phrímh-fheidhm le Céard-Oideachas&mdash;(a) aosóga d'oileamhaint d'obair speisialta; (b) feabhas agus <Col N="1351" /> slacht do chur ar shaothar na ndaoine a bhíos ag obair cheana agus tuille eoluis do thabhairt dóibh.  Chun an chéad fheidhm díobh sin do bhaint amach cuireann na hoidí a bhíos i bhfeighil na scol cuspóirí deimhneacha gnótha rómpa.  Ní oileann siad dreamanna de dhaoinibh óga chun bheith 'na saoir luadha, 'na ndéantóirí uaireadóirí, 'na mná fuaghála, 'na n-innealltóirí agus ná ngréasaidhthe gach bliadhain i ndiaidh a chéile, ach oiread agus leanfadh an bhean fuaghála de dhéanamh culaithirtí nó an gréasaidhe de dhéanamh bróg gan cuimhneamh ar bith ar an margadh. Nuair bhíonn cúrsaí speisialta ar siubhal i gCeárd-Scolta bíonn súil anáirde ag an lucht ceannais le hionchas go bhfaighfí na scoláirí do chur i gcrích, agus na sean-scoláirí mar aon leo; agus déantar beart dá réir sin. Do ghníd a ndícheall i gcomhnaidhe chun daoine lán-oilte do bheith ar ullmhacht aca i gcómhair ghnótha agus tiúscail, ach ní féidir leo daoine lán-oilte do chur ar fagháil ar an bpoinnte boise d'fhorfhás nua gnótha. Nuair nach mbíonn éileamh deimhneach ar cheárdaibh áirithe ní féidir le lucht ceannais na scol a dhéanamh ach na scoláirí do chur i n-órd do réir gharma, agus a oiread sin de réamhoileamhaint do thabhairt dóibh agus a chuirfeadh ar thóir bhuan-oibre iad 'na mbéadh suim aca agus fonn ortha feabhas do chur ar a saothar.  Nuair bhíonn na mic léighinn gabhtha le saothar oibre bíonn ar gcumas do na scolta an dara cuspóir do chómhlíonadh agus cabhair do thabhairt don aos foghluma ar bheith sár-oilte ar a gcéird.</P>
    <P>Mar shampla ar an bhfeidhmiú ba chuibhe do Cheárd-Scoil do dhéanamh do Thiúscal glacaimís cás Monarchan Bróg do cuireadh ar bun i gceanntar bhaile mhóir le linn an tséasúir seo atá caithte.  Ní raibh feisteas go leor i maighne na scoile chun cúrsa lán-aimseardha a bheadh lán-fheileamhnach don mhonarchain nua do chur ar siubhal, agus ní raibh sé ar acfuinn do lucht ceannais na scoile an mórsháslach a bhí ag teastáil uatha do cheannach.  Do ceapadh cúrsa oibre lae agus tráthnóna; rinneadh an <Col N="1352" /> ghnáth-obair um ló sa scoil, agus tugadh teagase sa mónarchain um thráthnóna do na macaibh léighinn, agus cleachtadh ar na hinnill fá chúram agus fá stiúradh maor áirithe a cheap bainisteoirí na monarchan don obair sin.  'Sé tháinig den chómhar sin ach go bhfuil bun mór de na foghlaimeóirí ag obair sa monarchain i láthair na huaire seo.</P>
    <P>Maidir le héifeacht an teagaisc a déantar fá chúram Coistí an Ghairm-Oideachais is féidir é idirdhealú 'na thrí rannaibh: (1) teagase ar ádhbhair cheárdamhla um thráthnóna d'fhoghlaimeoirí ó sé bliadhna déag go cúig bliadhna fichead d'aois; (2) teagase ar ádhbhair fheidhmeamhla, cleachtadh ar uirlisí agus ar ghléasradh éagsamhail do dhaoine óga um ló; agus (3) teagase ar &ldquo;Ghnáth-Ádhbhair Leanamhna&rdquo; don bhuidhin chéadna.  Tá feabhas seasmhach ag teacht ar chríochnamhlacht an teagaise a déantar um thráthnóna. Is móide an feabhas sin uimhir na mbuidhean do dhul i laighead agus a ngnéithe do dhul i gcosmhalacht, rud a thárla ó bunuigheadh go foirleitheadach buidheanta lae de ghnéithibh éagsamhla i gcóir daoine a bhí gan obair.  Tá laghdú mór ar uimhir na ndaoine atá díomhaoin agus ortha san atá ag gabháil d'obair nach bhfuil comh-bhaint aige le ádhbhar an teagaisc; agus tá de thoradh air sin gur féidir leis an múinteoir a shaothar do stiúradh ar fhaid bhealaigh speisialta, agus fós breis cúraim do dhéanamh de gach scoláire fá leith&mdash; mar gheall ar an laghdú ar uimhir na scoláirí sa mbuidhin.  Dírighthear an teagasc anois ar scoláirí géar-thuigsionacha stuamdha; agus ní foláir an teagasc sin do chongbháil ar chothrom árd feasta, mar muna ndeintí amhlaidh do thréigfeadh na scoláirí an rang agus do thuitfeadh sé as a chéile.</P>
    <P>Múintear na hádhbhair fheidheamhla go maith do na scoláirí lae.  Na hoidí go bhfuil Obair Adhmaid, Obair Mhiotail agus Tigheas á múineadh aca is gnáthach iad go héifeachtach agus spéis aca 'na n-adhbhair féin.  Cuireann siad spéis ins na gasraí de dhaoine óga a bhíonn fá n-a gcúram, daoine ná raibh aon taithighe aca ar oibríu úirlis go dtí tosach na ranganna agus gur féidir an feabhas a thagann ar a gcuid <Col N="1353" /> oibre a bhreathnú agus a thriáil ó sheachtmhain go seachtmhain.  Sompla an-mhaith den obair sin seadh na cúrsaí leanamhna lae 'na dtugtar ceachtanna speisialta ar Thigheas. Bíonn gasra cailíní fá chúram an mhúinteora ó cheann ceann an tseiseoin agus ní h-é amháin gur féidir léi chuile short tigheas a mhúineadh dóibh ach bíonn caoi aici ar dheagh-nosanna a raghaidh chun leasa dhóibh a mhúineadh dhóibh freisin.  Sin mar a déantar sna ranganna sin de ghnáth agus is mór an chreideamhaint do na múinteoirí é.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom cupla focal a rádh i dtaobh árdú an aois scurtha.  I rith an tseiseoin seo caithte is minic a moladh do mhuintir na Roinne cur leis an tréimhse scolaidheachta atá ceangailte ar gach scoláire do réir dlighe.  Ceithre bliadhna déag an aois a chaithfidh scoláire bheith aige sara bhfágfaidh sé an scoil do réir Acht Tinnrimh Scoile 1926.  Sin é an gnáth-dlighe a cuirtear i bhfeidhm i dtíorthaibh na hEorpa.  Do réir Achtanna Oideachais na Breataine Móire agus an tSaorstáit d'fhéadfaí an teora aoise sin d'árdú go sé bliadhna déag agus na scoláirí do chongbháil i scolta lán-aimseardha nó páirt-aimseardha.  Ach is fíor-annamh a rinneadh a leithéid go dtí seo.</P>
    <P>Ní furasta a thógaint orainn féin scolaidheacht fheileamhnach a sholáthar do chuile dhuine óg sa tír atá fá bhun sé bliadhna déag d'aois.  Tá deacrachtaí sa scéal ó thaobh na scolaidheachta agus ó thaobh an chostais.  Caithfí oideachas speisialta a thabhairt do na daoine óga sin&mdash; oideachas d'fheilfeadh don aibeamhlacht intinne a bhaineann leo.  Níor chóir iad do chongbháil ar scoil ar feadh dhá blian breise muna bhféadfaidís dul chun cinn dá réir.  Níor mhór teagase speisialta a thabhairt dóibh thar mar a tugtar sa ghnáthphríomh-scoil agus bhéadh breis foirne agus feistis ag teastáil chuige sin.  Ní hé amháin, dá bhrigh sin, go gcaithfí costas an bhreis tinnrimh do ghlanadh, ach caithfí teagase feileamhnach a sholáthar do na scoláirí sin&mdash;rud is costasamhla go mór.</P>
    <P>Mar sin féin is iomdha tír 'na bhfuiltear ag lorg an teora aoise nua agus <Col N="1354" /> á lorg go dian.  Táthar á éileamh i mbailte móra tiúscail na Breataine Móire agus á iarraidh ar na Búird Oideachais feidhm do bhaint as na comhachta atá aca fá na hAchtannaibh Oideachais.  Deallruigheann an scéal nach é an bhreis teagase ar fad atá ó na daoine sin ach táid an-mhí-shásta toise na sluaighte móra daoine óga bheith díomhaoin ar fágaint na scoile dhóibh.

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the motion:</P>
      <P>That in view of continued widespread unemployment the Dáil instructs the Executive Council to make available forthwith sufficient money to permit of the carrying out of large scale schemes of public works, so as to relieve the distress caused by unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of that motion is, <Col N="1358" /> firstly, to call attention to the serious unemployment problem which exists, and, at the same time, to urge the Government to take steps in the form of the provision of large scale schemes of public works to relieve the distress occasioned by the long-continued widespread unemployment. There is no gainsaying the fact that we have in this country to-day, as they have in other countries of the world, a very serious unemployment crisis, and while there are many who take the view that international co-operation between nations, and the regulation of international standards of life on a high scale, will contribute something to the diminution of that serious problem, the fact remains that we cannot wait here, any more than any other nation can wait elsewhere, for that international co-operation to develop in the manner that everyone would wish.  We have within our own control and within the ambit of our own life here all the power we need to deal with the serious problem which faces us here.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to make comparisons between the unemployment figures of to-day and those of last year, and the unemployment figures during the period that the last Government was in office.  I do not think they matter very much.  The serious position to-day, so far as the unemployed people of the country are concerned, is not so much a matter of comparison of unemployment figures to day with those of two, three, five, or ten years ago.  The problem for these people to-day is to know what steps the State, which has a moral responsibility in this matter, is going to take for the relief of the unemployment which is pressing so heavily on the people.  It is no consolation to the unemployed people to know that there is a slight fall in the unemployment figures.  It is a cause of despair to the unemployed if there is a rise in the unemployment figures, but until such time as you can absorb all the people into productive employment, or recognise that they have a right to maintenance at the expense of the whole community, and maintenance on a decent basis, it is little use to make comparisons of that kind and to <Col N="1359" /> expect that these comparisons afford any hope, or provide any measure of rescue for the unemployed people from the suffering and privation they are compelled to endure.</P>
    <P>In order to get an appreciation of what our problem in relation to unemployment is, it is necessary, to some extent, to survey the industrial position. I think it can be said truthfully that our industrial activities are showing signs of expansion, and, I think, in many respects, of considerable expansion; but it is a matter of considerable regret that in some of these new fields of activity, the labour which has been employed is mainly female labour and that a large section of that female labour is juvenile labour, recruited under bad conditions, paid bad rates of wages, and working intolerably long hours.  That phase of industrial development is unhealthy.  It is formed inevitably on a sandy foundation, and there can be no great measure of prosperity for the bread-winners in this country in respect of employment in industries where that kind of evil is a feature of the employment. While there is industrial expansion in many directions, and praiseworthy industrial expansion in some notable directions, we have got to realise at the same time that while people are being absorbed into employment on the one hand the development of the machine and the greater exploitation by mechanisation is on the other hand sentencing people to unemployment.  So that while, perhaps, the imposition of a tariff or the provision of new capital and a new pioneering spirit, on the one hand, may result in employment for certain persons, we have got to remember that, on the other hand, there is inevitably a growth in mechanised industrial development, and that is showing itself in the form of introducing machinery which is responsible for many people being put out of employment and compelled to join the throng of unemployed people.</P>
    <P>I think that the Minister must be familiar with certain cases in tariffed industries where, although the output of the industry, with the assistance of <Col N="1360" /> tariffs has been doubled or trebled, the amount of employment provided in the industry has actually decreased.  There is a noteworthy example of that in respect of the brush-making industry.  I think that the output of that industry under tariffs has nearly trebled, but there are less people employed in the industry to-day than before the tariffs were ever imposed.  Anybody who has any experience of that industry and whose business takes him into close touch with the workers knows well that in that particular industry we have a classic example of an industry being protected against foreign competition by the State and installing foreign machines in order to sentence the Irish workers in the industry to unemployment. That is an example which illuminates to a considerable extent what is taking place in many other industries.</P>
    <P>The plain fact that we have to face in respect of our industrial activity is that our industries to-day are not capable of absorbing all our unemployed people.  Our industries to-day are able just to hold the present number of employed people.  They may, in the course of further expansion, be able to employ an additional number, but it is quite clear that you cannot, within any reasonable period, hope to see our industries developed to such an extent as to make it possible to absorb into productive employment even half of those now seeking for an opportunity of working but who are unable to obtain that opportunity.  I think much more could have been done in the matter of ensuring that our industries provided more employment if the Government had the courage to face up to their responsibility in the matter of trying by legislation to reduce the hours of work in those industries.  It seems to me to be nothing short of economic lunacy to see the employed section of the community working long hours while other persons, willing and anxious to work, are denied an opportunity of working. Ordinary sane economics would suggest that if you have one section of the community working 56 or 60 hours a week, as happens in many of these small industries and in commercial <Col N="1361" /> establishments and shops of one kind or another, while at the same time you have people looking for an opportunity of working, the obvious policy of the State to work for is the regulation of hours in industry, so as to ensure that we should not have long hours worked by employed people side by side with unemployment amongst people able and willing to do the same kind of work if given the opportunity.</P>
    <P>We can pass from the industrial to the agricultural position and it requires no words to emphasise the fact that the agricultural industry in this and in every other country in the world is passing through a period of acute depression.  It is a paradox, but it is nevertheless visible for all to see, that the production of human food goes hand in hand with cycles of depression and with an intolerably low standard of living in the industry.  In respect of our main agricultural activity, the raising and the export of cattle, everybody knows that that industry is in a serious position.  That unsatisfactory position is ascribed to various causes. It is sought to suggest that the economic war is wholly responsible for the position of the cattle industry to-day.  But, even in countries which have no economic war, it has been found quite impossible to export cattle on the scale that we knew ten years ago, and quite impossible to obtain the prices for cattle which were obtained even two years ago.</P>
    <P>If anybody wants an example of that he has only to take the case of Holland, where cattle are being bought for slaughter by the State in order to prevent the cattle being a drug on the market and forcing down prices in respect of other cattle which have to be sold.  Much as we may lament the fact that farmers are unable to get a reasonable price for their cattle, the plain fact remains that, with the cattle trade of the world in the position that it is to-day, it is extremely difficult for this nation and for the other nations facing the same problem to be able to legislate for the difficulty into which they have been so suddenly precipitated by the collapse of meat and cattle prices the world over.  That depression in the cattle industry in this country&mdash;an industry <Col N="1362" /> which was the chief source of wealth and livelihood for our agricultural population&mdash;has inevitably caused unemployment.  While the development of the tillage policy will give hope that that unemployment may be relieved by intensification of tillage, at the same time we have to realise the fact that the tillage policy is in a very undeveloped state to-day.  It gives hope that it will develop rapidly, but in the meantime agricultural workers cannot live merely on hopes, cannot live on mere assurances that times will brighten.  These people are entitled to expect that, until such time as the State can develop its policy, it will do something in a tangible and constructive way to provide them with employment until they can be absorbed into productive employment in the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>With our industrial and agricultural industries in the position in which, I think, I have fairly described them, the State has to ask itself what it proposes to do in such circumstances to absorb into employment the large contingent of people who are registered at the employment exchanges.  The live register for 5th March last shows that there are 100,279 persons registered as unemployed.  I agree that the introduction of the Unemployment Assistance Act has probably, to some extent, inflated that figure.  Even if we take 20,000 off that figure, the fact remains that we have then an unemployed population of 80,000 people.  Those are 80,000 people who come within the scope of registration at the exchanges. That figure does not include persons who are normally housewives and also adolescents who have not yet registered as unemployed.  Let us say, for the purpose of agreement, that the number is 80,000, because we might get agreement on that figure.  Seeing that we have that number of people registered as unemployed, and bearing in mind those dependent upon them, we have to realise that virtually we have here an unemployment problem which can best be described by saying that the unemployed of the country are a State within the State itself.</P>
    <P>The State has to ask itself what it <Col N="1363" /> proposes to do in circumstances of that kind.  It cannot clearly continue telling the unemployed agricultural labourers that there is hope when the tillage policy develops.  It is unreasonable to tell the unemployed industrial workers that ultimately there may be hope for employment when our industries develop further.  It is no use telling them what they are told now, with disconcerting and painful frequency, that Rome was not built in a day.  The unemployed are not concerned as to whether Rome was built in a day or a year or ten years.  The unemployed want an opportunity to work, an opportunity to enrich the nation by operating upon its abundant and sadly-neglected resources, and, over and above all, an opportunity to provide a frugal living for their wives and dependent children.  The State has got to ask itself what it proposes to do to supply an obvious need of that kind. This motion seeks to provide the State with suggestions by which the problem of unemployment might to some extent be combated until such time as our agricultural and industrial position can be expanded sufficiently to absorb into productive employment large numbers of those who are unemployed. The motion, therefore, standing in the names of certain Labour Deputies, seeks to induce the Government to make money available so as to secure the carrying out of large scale schemes of public works in order that the distress caused by unemployment could be relieved.  When we refer to public works as a means of employing unemployed persons, I think it will be generally agreed that there is need in this relatively undeveloped country for a comprehensive public works policy such as the country has never known during the lifetime of any person now living.</P>
    <P>Our public amenities have been largely neglected; our people have been taught to accept a low standard of life, and a low standard of comfort; they have been taught to have a feeling of resignation, and that they have no right to expect those amenities which are the rights and the heritage of <Col N="1364" /> persons in enlightened countries of the world to-day.  We suggest in this motion that large scale schemes of public works will not only help to provide employment pending further industrial and agricultural expansion, but that the carrying out of large scale schemes of public works will do something to improve the standard of comfort of our people, especially in rural areas; that such works if carried out will improve the amenities of living, especially in rural areas; but over and above raising the standard of living of our people, improving their amenities of life and providing them with employment, the motion suggests that the provision of large scale schemes of public works would put into the hands of our unemployed people a new purchasing power, which is vitally needed to assist industrial and agricultural expansion to-day.</P>
    <P>It is generally recognised by enlightened economists that one of the evils of the world to-day is the contraction of purchasing power, and it has been suggested by economists in many countries that one of the best ways by which the State could contribute to deadening the worst effects of unemployment is the creation of new purchasing power, and the placing of it in the hands of the people, so that they may not only be saved from the miseries of unemployment, but that they may, in addition, be able, with the new purchasing power thus created, to sustain a demand for industrial and agricultural goods.  The provision of large scale schemes of public works in this country would stimulate purchasing power, by placing in the hands of our people large sums of money with which they could serve demands on industry and agriculture to provide new goods.  In that way not only would they be providing employment for themselves, but they would be improving the standard of life for themselves and for the nation as a whole, and they would be contributing their quota towards the solution of the unemployment problem in agriculture and in industry.  If we assume that there are 80,000 unemployed people, or 100,000 unemployed people, the loss per <Col N="1365" /> week to industry and agriculture by reason of the enforced idleness of those people will be apparent to everybody. If we could put into productive employment the 80,000 or 100,000 unemployed workers, and provide them with decent rates of wages per week, the demand which they would serve on industry and agriculture for the supply of industrial products and agricultural goods would be such as to bring a large measure of relief from depression to industry and to agriculture.  The large scale schemes of public works which this motion contemplates are large scale schemes of work which may be considered to be not only necessary from a social point of view, but, as I said, necessary in order to raise the standard of living of the people of the country.</P>
    <P>We suggest, in support of this motion, that there are abundant opportunities for carrying out a comprehensive drainage policy in the country, so as to ensure that the depressed lands and the ill-drained lands of the country can be drained, and their potential wealth consequently exploited to the fullest.  The carrying on of large scale drainage schemes would not only make life in rural areas much more enjoyable than it is, but it would improve the land in rural areas enormously.  It would prevent flooding; it would prevent losses by flooding; it would prevent the social inconvenience which annual flooding inevitably causes to the residents in badly drained areas.  With the new concentration on turf production in the country, a drainage scheme has enormous possibilities for exploiting the latent wealth of the bogs.  If a comprehensive drainage scheme were carried out, it would make the winning of turf a much easier proposition than it is to-day; it would make the winning of turf a much more economic proposition than it is to-day.  If the State were to embark upon a scheme of drainage in rural areas, especially in bog areas, then, by making the bogs more accessible, the State would be helping by that very fact alone to encourage the local people to exploit the bogs to a much greater extent than it is possible to exploit them to-day by <Col N="1366" /> reason of the ill-drained condition of the bogs themselves.</P>
    <P>Another useful scheme of public works that might be carried out would be the replacement of defective schools and the building of decent ones.  Any Deputy who goes through the country will realise that in many cases there are schools in existence which are a disgrace, not merely structurally, but because they are in a frightfully insanitary condition as well.  One marvels how, in such dreary, drab, insanitary and unhealthy surroundings, it is possible to brighten the minds of the children sufficiently to enable them to absorb the education which the unfortunate teachers seek to impart to them in those frightful circumstances.  In many areas throughout the country&mdash;I suppose in pretty well every area outside the cities and towns&mdash;the condition of our schools is something which calls for remedy.  Those structures are in many cases not edifices in which we can take any great pride.  The replacement of defective schools by the erection of modern, hygienic and sanitary schools would not only be a work of national importance, but I venture to suggest that the substitution of bright, sanitary, hygienic accommodation in the form of improved schools would do much to ensure that the children of the country would be able to absorb education in a much better way than it is possible for them to absorb such education in the circumstances under which it is imparted to them to-day, in dreary, drab schools, which would not make good cells much less good schools in which the citizens of to-morrow should receive their education.</P>
    <P>Passing from the replacement of defective schools, we come to the necessity for water supply schemes throughout the country.  Annually this City of Dublin seems to have a water problem.  Annually the Dublin Corporation makes an appeal to the people which, in effect, is an appeal not to wash themselves.  We get an annual appeal in Dublin in the form of printed red notices to the effect that there is a water shortage; be careful with the bath; do not waste any water, and do everything you can possibly do to avoid using water.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The printing of the notices, as Deputy Kelly says, gives employment, but Deputy Kelly must remember that if printing the notices gives employment there is quite a considerable amount of unemployment caused by reason of the fact that people cannot use the soap that would usually be used if the Dublin Corporation would stop appealing to the people not to wash themselves.  This annual appeal from the Dublin Corporation is an appeal to the people not to wash themselves, and while it is more forcibly impressed upon the people of Dublin by reason of the publicity service of the Dublin Corporation, everybody knows that water shortages are common affairs in the matter of our municipal activities.</P>
      <P>The provision of a water supply scheme in every town is not only a hygienic necessity but one can hardly visualise modern life without having at one's disposal a water supply not merely for sanitary purposes, not merely for hygienic purposes, but in order to prevent periodic epidemics of diseases, which are caused almost entirely by the absence of a water supply.  Without such a supply, a sewerage scheme is quite impossible and impracticable.  Sewerage might be referred to in that connection.  And here one finds it difficult to understand the go-slow policy on the part of the local authorities and the State in the matter of taking all the necessary steps to equip towns with adequate sewerage schemes.  In 1934 we find towns where there is no sewerage scheme whatever.  We find in other towns sewerage schemes which are called sewerage schemes more by tradition than by reason of the fact that they are sewerage schemes.  The State could do much in the way of encouraging the local authorities to carry out sewerage schemes and to assist effectively the carrying out of such schemes so as to improve the amenities of life in these areas, and, again, to provide necessary employment through these schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Land distribution is another matter <Col N="1368" /> which opens up a wide opportunity for work.  I think much more could be done than has been done in the way of acquiring and distributing land.  I will probably be told that it was necessary to pass the Land Bond Bill in order to ensure that the owners would be compensated for the land taken from them.  That is a strong defence perhaps.  At all events now that the Land Bond Bill has passed the Dáil and that we are assured that the Government is anxious to speed up the distribution of land, I hope the Government will give attention to that particular problem and speed up this acquisition and distribution of land.</P>
    <P>A settlement of persons in rural areas on economic holdings not merely takes such persons off the unemployment market but, in addition, it will possibly assist other people being taken off the unemployment market by reason of the employment that can be obtained by the full exploitation of the latent wealth of the country.  Land improvement, subsequent to its acquisition and distribution, should provide additional employment and here there are abundant opportunities for assisting in the alleviation of the unemployment problems if the State would attack the thing vigorously and not merely in the routine manner in which it is being tackled to-day.  The whole problem of land distribution will ensure a solution of the problem of unemployment. It will create agricultural holdings in the country which will provide some of our people especially in rural areas with an opportunity of working out their own salvation in the exploitation of their own holdings.</P>
    <P>While much has been done in respect of housing activities much more could be done.  In reply to a question recently the Minister for Local Government and Public Health stated that since the 1932 Housing Act was passed, about 17 months ago, there had been erected or there were in course of erection or under consideration for erection 30,700 houses.  While that is very commendable house building activity, and represents a substantial advance on the housing attainments of the previous years, there is still scope for further intensification of housing <Col N="1369" /> activities.  In my own constituency I come across cases where the local authorities place contracts with small builders who are only able to put up one or perhaps two houses at a time, whereas if the matter were on an organised basis there would be less delay in starting the work, and the starting of such housing schemes would be in a big and comprehensive way.  It would not merely provide additional employment, but it would ensure that a bigger and more effective impression was being made on the housing problem as we know it to exist to-day.</P>
    <P>Apart from these matters which offer scope for constructive work and opportunity for employment there is the question of the cleaning up of our towns.  One passes through towns and villages and finds a few nice houses, then some tumbled-down ruin which is allowed to produce all kinds of weeds and foreign grasses and provides a general dumping ground for the refuse of the neighbourhood.  Such a ruin is allowed to obtrude on the main road of the town or village, with nobody, apparently, having any power to compel the owners to remove it, or nobody likely to avail of the powers that exist to ensure the removal of that kind of structure.  If the Government would take in hand the question of compelling local authorities to clean up towns and villages much good could be done in providing work, and much could be done in the way of eliminating those eyesores which are all too ubiquitous in our towns and villages.</P>
    <P>Burial grounds provide another opportunity for improvement and for the provision of work.  The manner in which we keep our cemeteries is not an indication of our reverence for the dead.  If it were, then there would be little reverence for the dead.  Many of the burial grounds in the country might as well be lakes, because they are allowed to get into a flooded and overcrowded condition.  The attempt to plan cemeteries in the country, to construct decent cemeteries is a most lamentable exposition of our want of foresight, and shows an incompetence that makes one wonder.  Everybody seems to imagine that the ideal cemetery is a little small spot with railings <Col N="1370" /> round it.  Let it get into a swampy condition or into a lake, and nobody does anything to ensure that it is cleaned up.  This blot on the manner in which we bury our dead should be removed completely.</P>
    <P>This being an island country, the problem of coast erosion is an ever-present one.  Coast erosion in many counties is a very serious matter for the local authorities.  The present position in law, I understand, is that the local authority are responsible for the maintenance of sea defences. That means that the local authorities, let us say the Wicklow, the Wexford or the Donegal County Council, are responsible for waging a constant war against the sea so as to ensure that coast erosion is effectively combated. All local authorities are not in a position to undertake the defences of their boundaries against the sea, to defend the land against the sea, because of their limited resources.  In any case, the maintenance of the whole island against sea attack is surely not the responsibility of the local authorities around the coast.  Surely the inland people have some responsibility for financing the work of coast defences. It is as much the concern of the inland residents as it is of the coast dwellers to ensure that the land army wages a successful battle against the attacks of the sea.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to hear the Minister develop that point.  The defence of the land against the sea is not the problem of the local authorities. In any case, if the local authorities are negligent and do not carry out their duties, or are unable to discharge their duties because of the crippling financial burdens they have to bear and which <Col N="1371" /> the defence of the land against the sea imposes on them, then there is an obvious obligation on the State to ensure that effective steps are taken to combat coast erosion.  The State cannot sit idly by while the local authorities are either carrying out their duties inefficiently or accelerating coast erosion by these undesirable steps which the Minister for Industry and Commerce suggests they take, or who become undesirable because of their failure to undertake the duty.  At all events, there is a problem in defending the land against the sea, and in providing adequate defences against the incoming sea there would be involved the kind of work which the State could carry out and that would offer opportunities of constant employment. It would also be extremely useful work.</P>
      <P>As regards the cleaning and deepening of rivers, that is a matter which conjures up pictures of enormous opportunities for providing work. Many of the rivers and streams are allowed to get into a very neglected condition and they collect all kinds of trees and obstacles.  Sand is allowed to accumulate and the river is rendered impossible of navigation.  Eventually the streams and rivers degenerate into the position that they cease to be effective for draining the surrounding land.  There is an enormous amount of work which could be done in the way of cleaning and deepening the rivers. If one traces the Liffey from its source, even that river we all know so well will be found at various points in a choked condition, and in some places, because of the choked condition, the river has been allowed to run out of its course, to undermine roads and bridges and cause quite a considerable amount of destruction by reason of the fact that no effective attention is paid to the drainage except on the portions of the river commercially operated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another problem, and perhaps I am not as sweet on that as is the Deputy.  Here in Dublin City is an unrivalled opportunity <Col N="1372" /> to do something to improve its architecture.  Government Departments are scattered all over the city, north, south, east and west.  They are housed in this and that kind of building and very few civil servants seem to be satisfied with their location. Perhaps the Government Buildings in Merrion Street are the most comfortable of all.  Many Departments are compelled to carry out work under very unsatisfactory conditions and in very unsuitable places and inevitably there must be loss of efficiency where branches of the one Department are scattered all over the city.  The provision of a decent set of public buildings would not merely effectively stimulate Government work, but it would ensure efficient and smoother administration and at the same time give the city a block of buildings that it might well feel proud of.  The present scheme of establishing Departments in any old building that can be got merely because it happens to be vacant or cheap is very unwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a classic example of what the State will do in the central sorting and delivery offices in Dublin.  In our capital city the central sorting and delivery office of the Post Office, which in every other country is something worthy of admiration, is situated in the vaults of a disused distillery. It has been there for the last 12 years.  Year after year Ministers have made promises that the work of reconstruction would shortly commence, but so far no progress has been made.  The existing sorting and delivery office is in a building that is hopelessly insanitary and unsuitable.  Anybody who has seen the interior of the place can scarcely understand why it should be used as a sorting and delivery centre.  The work of erecting a new building to house the staff would provide a great deal of employment for building employees now unemployed and it would remove a reproach on the Post Office administration. I might mention that some cross-channel firms that came over here when tariffs were imposed inspected this disused distillery with a view to acquiring it, but they decided it was in such a shocking condition they <Col N="1373" /> would not dare to go into it and they could see no hope of being able to reconstruct it so as to meet their requirements.  Yet the State allows men to carry on very important work in this insanitary building which is an eyesore and ought to be removed. Many foreigners, post office people, who visit Ireland, have expressed a desire to see the central sorting and delivery office, but really one would be too ashamed to bring them down to that insanitary building.</P>
    <P>One would be ashamed to take them to the place, because not only is it structurally bad, but it is a hideous eyesore, and the interior of the place resembles a shambles more than it does an efficient post office.  That gives an idea of the necessity for the Government undertaking a policy of erecting public buildings for the discharge of Government work in the city.  I agree that that cannot all be put up in a year, two years, or three years, but there should be some thought-out policy in the matter of providing buildings for Government work in Dublin, and efforts should be made to work to a plan which would eventually give the city a suitable scheme of public buildings.</P>
    <P>At present there seems to be no policy and no vision, and if one can judge by the permanence in which certain Departments are located in certain unsuitable buildings, it looks as if the whole policy of the State in the matter of the provision of suitable Government buildings is: &ldquo;Oh, carry on as you are. We will not be here very much longer, and we will leave the problem to our successors.&rdquo;  Somebody ought to sit down and think out a sound policy in this matter and try to work to a programme of that kind, because I am afraid that, as Government Departments are expanding, due to new legislation, and as suitable buildings are shrinking, the position in that respect will ultimately become worse instead of better.</P>
    <P>Traffic congestion is a problem which, with the development of the motor car and mechanised locomotion generally, will have to be dealt with by local authorities.  This city is an example of the evils which can <Col N="1374" /> develop because of the inability of local authorities, through want of powers, want of money, or want of zeal, to obviate the traffic congestion which not only exists at the moment but which tends to grow worse with the passage of time.  There is enormous scope for activity in the matter of widening streets, rounding corners&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee) Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a couple that could be done still.  There is, however, abundant scope for widening streets, making it possible for traffic to move more smoothly and making it possible to avoid traffic congestion.  General work of that kind helps to beautify a city and to provide employment.  I have indicated a list of schemes which might be carried out.  I doubt if any Deputy in the House will suggest that there is an unnecessary scheme in the list I have quoted.  That work is necessary, and if it were carried out, not only would it provide employment for the unemployed until such time as they can be absorbed into industry or agriculture, or maintained on a decent scale by the State, but it would give hope to tens of thousands of unemployed people who to-day are driven to despair because of long-continued unemployment.  If the work were carried out, it would not only raise the enthusiasm of the people, but the execution of the work would raise the standard of their lives and help to beautify their lives by providing improved amenities and an improved standard of living and comfort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be said that the existence of unemployment is admitted, and that the problem is of such serious dimensions that it must be met by the adoption of an emergency policy of this kind; it may be said that these schemes are admittedly necessary, but that the necessary money or the raising of the necessary money for the financing of these schemes presents a problem which requires solution.  I regard the fact that unemployment exists on such a large scale and that the work is necessary as the paramount consideration in a matter of this kind, and it should not be difficult for the <Col N="1375" /> State to raise the necessary money to finance useful schemes of public work of that character.  The credit of the State is high.  Nobody will question the credit of this State to-day, and its capacity to raise money is unquestioned. The standing of its securities in the public market is the best guarantee that not only is the State solvent, but its credit is as high as the credit of any Government in Europe, and higher than the credit of most Governments in Europe to-day.  If the nation's credit is high, and its securities stand at such an enviable price, from commercial standards, in the public market, there should be no great difficulty in raising the necessary capital to finance a scheme of public works of that kind.</P>
    <P>Relatively this is the wealthiest creditor nation in the world to-day. The three great creditor nations in the world are the United States, Britain and the Irish Free State, but, taking our population here in proportion to our foreign investments, this country is relatively a much wealthier creditor nation than either the United States or Great Britain to-day.  When we make allowance for the foreign money invested here and for certain income in the form of pensions received by our people here, this is a creditor nation to the extent of, approximately, £220,000,000.  A nation which has £220,000,000 in foreign investments is a nation which must inevitably have high credit, and that £220,000,000, in proportion to our own resources at home and our population, is the best guarantee that money can be raised to finance schemes of that kind from the point of view of guarantees that the State which borrows the money is solvent.  If the State wished, it could borrow money at a low rate of interest, but, in any case, money could be borrowed on terms which would satisfy those who have the lending of money in their power.  Quite apart, however, from the need for raising money in the ordinary commercial way, the State could do what many other States have been forced, in periods of emergency, to do, namely, to create credit and capital for the purpose of financing a public works policy of that <Col N="1376" /> kind.  The State is quite entitled to create capital and to create credit and to use that credit for the financing of such activities.</P>
    <P>It may be urged, of course, that this is not orthodox finance.  Possibly, it is not orthodox finance, but there are very few people in the world to-day who can make a case even for the orthodox finance we know of.  It is difficult to talk about orthodox finance when you are presented with a situation in which you have 80,000 unemployed men and women, able and willing to work, and yet condemned to hunger because it is not possible for the State or private industry to provide them with work.  If we are going to have any orthodoxy, we ought to have it in respect of our responsibility to human beings.  If we want to be orthodox at all, let us be orthodox in relation to them and let us have less regard for orthodoxy as applied to modern commercial conceptions of orthodox finance.</P>
    <P>During the European War, Britain was driven to all kinds of extremes in order to maintain a credit and currency policy at home.  Britain created capital and Britain came through the war.  Many of the old Conservatives in Britain, who, pre-war, would have looked on a proposal to create State capital as something akin to anarchy, were compelled during the war years to endorse a policy of that kind and those of them who have since taken to writing their memoirs have paid tribute to the wisdom of adopting such a policy and to the difficulties which were avoided by Britain in making use of emergency powers of that type in order to finance her war-time activities.  Not only is the State financially solvent, but its standing in the European market is high and its foreign investments, approximately £220,000,000, invested outside the country and yielding annual dividends to our people here, are the surest guarantee of the solvency of the State.  Quite apart from that, the State has a solvency in respect of the credit of its people and the character of its people, as well as in respect of the industry of its people and the wealth of the country, both actual and potential.  All these factors are security for the raising of finances <Col N="1377" /> for a scheme of this kind, and there should be no difficulty, and there could not possibly be any great difficulty experienced, in a country like this in raising finances for public works of that kind, especially in an unemployment crisis such as that through which we are passing.</P>
    <P>Recently I observed that the President exchanged congratulations with President Roosevelt and congratulated the latter on the courageous policy he had adopted in America.  That was quite a kindly thing to do.  But I hope that President de Valera did not intend that his congratulations to President Roosevelt were just in the form of a kindly greeting.  Congratulating President Roosevelt seemed to me to imply an admiration of some of the methods adopted by President Roosevelt, and one would only wish that the President here would do some of the pioneering that the President of the United States has felt it necessary to do in a similar unemployment crisis that exists in that State.</P>

      <P>Well, that would be a spectacular gesture; but when the Minister for Industry and Commerce introduces a Bill to provide a 30-hour working week and to compel employers to pay decent wages and prevent children from being exploited in industry, then I shall be glad to congratulate the Minister for Industry and Commerce on being first, and I shall sympathise with President Roosevelt on being second.  However, so far, I can see no reason to think that the Minister is first in the race, and in many respects, if he does not accelerate, he probably will be last in the race of those responsible for industry and commerce in various countries who are still holding on to old methods in the hope that something will happen to revivify confidence in those methods.  I was saying that the President was congratulating <Col N="1378" /> President Roosevelt on his policy in America, and I noticed that on St. Patrick's Day, in the course of conveying further greetings on that festive day, the President again stated his admiration of the methods adopted in America and suggested&mdash;and the <i>Irish Press</i> underlined it&mdash;that the President here was endeavouring to follow the methods adopted in America of solving our problems in the same way as America had been forced to try to solve hers.  I suggest that the President is not trying to solve our problems with the same courage as they are being tackled in that economic madhouse of capitalism across the Atlantic. I hope that when the President comes to congratulate the President of the United States in future he will be able to say accurately that, in fact, we are adopting methods which are not merely as courageous as the experiments being tried in America but more courageous than the methods that have been adopted elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion is one that ought to commend itself to the Government. They have professed a wish to put an end to unemployment.  There is a greater reason why effective war should be made on unemployment than ever before, because for some time the outflow of population by way of the emigrant ship that took from 25,000 to 30,000 of our people each year, has been stopped, and instead we are faced with a new problem of immigration.  We are now faced with the fact that 30,000 people whom we exported annually are remaining at home, and that we are getting back some of those whom we exported in other years.  That makes it more necessary than ever for the Government to face up to its responsibilities and to make war on unemployment. There is no more effective way of doing that than in the provision of large scale schemes of public works which will not only end unemployment but will improve the standard of life in the country.  I hope the Government will see their way to accept this motion, and that its acceptance will be accompanied by a declaration on the part of the Government that they propose to provide money for large scale schemes of public works which, in the interval <Col N="1379" /> between now and the time when industry and agriculture can absorb the greater number of our people, will give some hope to the people that, at least in an emergency of the kind through which we are passing, the State will organise its resources to their uttermost limits in order to provide productive employment for the people.</P>

      <P>This has been a great week, Sir, in some places.  We have had the big black cat in Dublin, and then we burned the Hoodoo, and now, from nine o'clock, we have been blowing up the big balloon.  It is almost a pity not to leave it at that and to go home.  We could leave it at that and go home if the problem that Deputy Norton started to speak about was not there, and if there were not people looking for work and suffering because they had not employment. Deputy Norton has run through such a list of things that might be done by putting people on public works that I do not propose to add to them.  However, I would ask the Deputy and his colleagues, who ought to be close up against the people that are unemployed and the people that are wanting work, now that the big balloon has been blown up with schemes, to turn around and face the question as to what they are doing to help to get employment for the people.  If there is unemployment throughout the country at the present time, and if there is a falling off, as the Deputy says, in the purchasing power of the people, leading to a tremendous amount of unemployment, I suggest that the Labour Party are themselves more responsible for it than any other section of the country.  Instead of turning around and seeing what are the principles they stand for in the matter of government and in the matter of applying themselves and applying the resources of the State to developing and fostering industry here, I suggest that they should turn around and ask themselves what exactly their fundamental principles are.  Assume that to-morrow the Executive Council put all these men to work on the filling in of the Liffey or the deepening of the <Col N="1380" /> Liffey, or on keeping back the tide on the Wicklow coast or on rounding corners and putting up buildings, are we going to have a call from the Labour Party for a one day strike on the 1st May?</P>

      <P>I suggest that the Labour Party, who through their spokesman here to-night have talked for an hour and five minutes on all kinds of work that the State might pay workers for doing, are co-operating on their part to have a one-day strike on 1st. May for the purpose of obscuring the responsibility they have at the present moment for the condition of unemployment in the country.</P>

      <P>I am getting nearer to the point and nearer to the bone of the matter than Deputy Norton did.  The Deputies know very well what they are at in this matter.  I should like to quote as further information for Deputies on the matter an extract from <i>The International Press Correspondence</i>, which is the principal Communist organ disseminating news and information to the country.  I shall quote from the issue of the 16th March:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Since the inception of the Fascist Blue Shirts, with their adoption of the &lsquo;Corporate State&rsquo; and open threat to destroy the working-class movement, the Labour and trade union leaders have remained silent on the whole question of Fascism, except to urge the workers to rely on the de Valera Government.  Suddenly they have realised that the workers have not adopted the same ostrich pose, and on March 6, the District Council of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union placed a resolution on Fascism before the Dublin Trades Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The resolution urged the trade unions to protect themselves from &lsquo;the contamination of Fascist propaganda and the confiscation of their funds,&rsquo; and instructed the Executive to send a deputation to the National Executive of the Irish Trade Union Congress and the Administrative Council of the Irish Labour Party with a view to &lsquo;organising a national demonstration against Fascism.&rsquo;  The officials had thought to make speeches on these measures, to have the resolution mechanically accepted, and to pass on.  Instead, a militant <Col N="1383" /> delegate set the Council alight with enthusiasm by proposing immediately an addendum: that in addition to the demonstration the Trades Council call for a one-day general strike on May 1 against Fascism, and that it co-operates with all anti-Fascist organisations in a national campaign against the Blue Shirts.  So surprised were the Executive by the immediate response of the delegates, that they dared not openly oppose the addendum, but could only insert the proviso that the union executives' endorsement be got first.  The addendum was then passed unanimously.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Already trade union branches in Dublin and Cork have unanimously adopted the proposal for a general strike all over the country.  That the Dublin Trades Council&mdash;the decisive organ in the country&mdash;has taken this tremendously important step is in large measure due to the consistent exposure of Fascism by the Irish Communist Party and the Labour League Against Fascism, and the campaign waged in the Press, workplace and T.U. branches.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is essential now that every Irish Communist and militant worker realises the great class advance that this decision marks, and that all active forces be mobilised around the general strike.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The attitude of Labour Deputies to the previous Administration just before the general election of 1932 was that they should be cleared out; firstly, because of their general record as an anti-working-class Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and secondly that until they were cleared out the people would never realise that the Anglo-Irish Treaty could remain without them.  At the same time they said that there was another popular belief which was sedulously fostered in the people of the country by another Party &mdash;the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;that President de Valera and his colleagues were the only real friends of the working people in industry and agriculture. They said that until President de Valera and his colleague were put into office and the people had an opportunity of seeing what they were capable of, the belief would still prevail that the real Party which was going to benefit the workers here was the Fianna Fáil Party, but that when <Col N="1385" /> President de Valera had a term of office, with all the responsibilities of office, the best minds of the country would, the Labour Party were then sure, come to the definite conclusion that the only Party in which political and social salvation was to be found, was the Labour Party.  They said they would get into the Dáil at that particular time with a very small Party, but their influence would be very great, and their responsibility would be very great.  As far as the smallness of their Party was concerned, as far as their influence was concerned and as far as their responsibility was concerned, I think that their prophecy was fairly true.  Their prophecy was also fairly true that after a short time in office, with the responsibilities of office on them, the Fianna Fáil Party would show that the workers of this country had nothing to expect from the Fianna Fáil Party.  Conditions have been brought about in this country that were so undreamt of, from the point of view of badness, and the responsibility of the Labour Party is so great for having supported the policies that have brought those conditions about, that the members of the Labour Party are unable to admit to themselves now that the situation is what it is.  When attempts were made by this Party during the years 1932 and 1933 to discuss public affairs on public platforms in the country they stood still while the Government endeavoured, through their followers, to bludgeon the Opposition Party off public platforms in the country, and prevent those discussions being carried on.</P>

      <P>Members of the Labour Party had occasion, even before the Fianna Fáil Government came into office, to protest at the treatment which they got at some of their meetings from what Deputy Murphy called the Fianna Fáil-Communist combine.  I ask them at this late hour, when they have this proposal before this House, to look back to some of what they call their fundamental principles and to see whether they can get back to some of them, as a contribution on their part to helping people who are looking for work in this country to get work. Deputy Norton talks of giving this public assistance and public works until such time as our agriculture and industry can be expanded so as to absorb the unemployed.  The policy of the Labour Party has been to wipe out the market for the product of our agricultural industry&mdash;a market which was three times as great as the market that was here.  How long does he think persons looking for employment are going to continue looking for it while we are developing here, for our farmers alone, a market which will be equivalent to that tremendous market which they have practically crushed out?  The Labour Party pride themselves in having put down in black and white in a little book their objects and their policy and their principles.  Part of what they stand over in their book and in their speeches is shown in paragraph 45 of their policy: &ldquo;We believe that a failure to improve the position of Free State produce in the British markets, relative to that of competing countries, would mean rapid retrogression involving enormous loss, and all possible efforts should be made to place our goods at the head of the market.&rdquo;</P>

Instead of having that long and rambling list of things which the State might do for the people of this country who have no work, I put it up to the Labour Party that there are things which they thought they could do, and which they said they would do.  While they may be small in numbers here they could at least try to stand over some of the principles and some of the fundamental things they advocated.  One of the things they did realise was that Irish agriculture had a market in Great Britain which was three times the home market here.  They realised that our position in that market had to be expanded and improved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertEDavitt" hpid="Dr. Davitt Dr. Davitt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Davitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister a question to-day in connection with the <Col N="1388" /> employment grant for Mornington.  I would not bring up this question on the adjournment if I did not know that there is, and has been for some time, a very unsatisfactory state of affairs with regard to the administration of the relief grant in Mornington, County Meath.  At the outset, I should like to say that this is not a question of Party politics.  The people in Morning ton from whom I received complaints were representative of all shades of political opinion.</P>
      <P>It is necessary for me, with the permission of the Chair, to run briefly over the developments in Mornington in the past few years.  The means of livelihood for nearly all the people in that district lie between mussel raising in the winter and salmon fishing in the spring and later.  Some years ago when quite a brisk export trade was done in mussels between Mornington and Bristol, complaints were received from the public health authorities as to the pollution of the mussels.  These complaints were investigated and were found in the main to be correct.  On representations being made the Department of Fisheries considered the construction of a purifying tank and it was agreed that the tank should be at a place in Howth.  I may say in passing that the purifying tank has not yet been completed.</P>
      <P>At the same time a certain section of the Nanny waters was passed as being a suitable place to re-lay mussels lifted from the Boyne.  The public health authorities agreed that this would suffice to satisfy the British public health authorities.  This section of the river has been recently purchased by a man to whom I will refer as Mr. X.  He is a conservator of fisheries.  The purifying tank in Howth has not yet been constructed.  Because of that delay the mussel fishers had no opportunity of rendering their mussels marketable and the only way in which they could dispose of them was by selling them to Mr. X.  This made the mussel fishermen dependent for their livelihood upon a monopoly.  They were confined to selling to Mr. X.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The economic war then started and the mussel industry was affected like every other industry.  A heavy import <Col N="1389" /> duty was imposed on mussels and this brought about a state of affairs which led the Government to allocate a sum of £300 for the relief of unemployment in that district.  This grant was allocated in 1932-33 and also in 1933-34.  The foreman appointed to superintend the work and distribute the grant was Mr. X.  The complaints that we are making now are not new. They have been going on for a number of years.  These are the grievances of which they complain:&mdash;(1) that Mr. X. a fishery conservator, is the foreman in charge of the relief grant; (2) that Mr. X., doubtless a keen businessman, got a monopoly of this business of the mussel trade; (3) unfair discrimination has been used in taking on the men for the relief work to the partial exclusion of other men more entitled to the work.  Examples are as follow:&mdash;(a) a man employed by the British and Irish Steamship Company gets work on the grant and is a relative of the foreman; (b) another relative who lives in Laytown, three miles away, has been employed on the grant; (c) another relative who works on the foreman's land and is employed as a carrier for him has been employed on this grant; (d) a brother-in-law of Mr. X. has also been employed on the relief grant in Mornington.</P>
    <P>The work finishes each year about February 12th.  Last year certain men were kept on for a further three weeks or more, and many of these were relatives of Mr. X., and some of the men while actually engaged in salmon fishing were working for a limited number of weeks on the grant.  A memorial was signed by nine people and sent on to us.  I investigated it, and my information is that there are several others affected who are unwilling to come forward for obvious reasons.  The case has been made by the Minister that his inspector reported that four of them lived at Donnycarney; two others had relatives who got work on the relief scheme, and one was sorry he signed the memorial.  The motive for the latter statement is quite obvious.  My reason for raising the matter is because an injustice has been done.  Even though the grant is over and finished with now.  I suggest that <Col N="1390" /> it is necessary in the interests of justice that an inquiry should be instituted in order to ascertain the facts.  If there is no truth in the memorial, which is extremely unlikely, Mr. X. will be vindicated, and I am ready to apologise to him for being led into a wrong attitude. I have no desire to cause trouble to anybody, but the situation has been represented to me in such a way that I had no alternative but to urge an investigation.  I appeal to the Minister to institute an inquiry into these grants.  As a last word I would ask him and urge on him to expedite the construction of the purifying tank at Howth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This scheme, as Deputy Davitt has said, was instituted in order to relieve distress among the mussel fishermen in that area whose livelihood as far as mussels was concerned was taken away from them on account of the disease that broke out there amongst the mussels.  In passing, as Deputy Davitt referred to the tank, I hope that matter will be made right before next season comes along.  I mentioned to-day in answer to the Deputy that with regard to those who signed the memorial which came to me, I sent down an inspector to examine the claims of these men.  It did not appear that any of these nine men had any better claim than some of those employed.  It is true that complaints were made against certain men who were employed.  There were a brother and a brother-in-law of the foreman, and they were at the same time employed in unloading boats at Drogheda.  I believe that to a certain extent they are casual labourers.  It was stated to the inspector from my Department that the work was very casual and that the men would only earn about 10/- a week at that business. One of them had a wife and two children, and another a wife and three children.  The inspector could not find any great objection to these men being employed by the foreman.  The fact that a deserving person is a brother-in-law of the foreman should not necessarily debar him from employment.  It should not, either, be used unduly in his favour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1391" /> There is another person mentioned in that memorial, as being only 15½ years of age, and that his brother is employed by the county council.  In that particular case it was his father who was employed by the county council.  The father lost his job and this boy is the eldest of a family of nine children so that the earnings of this boy went to maintain a man and wife and nine children.  I know it did look peculiar that this boy should be taken on.  In the case of the second brother it did appear to be unjustifiable, because he was employed on the farm and as a carter working for the foreman and he appeared to be in regular employment.  He was taken on the job.  From the reading of the inspector's report I could not say that the thing was justifiable.</P>
    <P>I will have to ask the Deputy to realise that this report from the inspector reached me only a few days <Col N="1392" /> ago.  It was certainly considerably delayed, and I had not time to go into that point.  I would like very much to have that point further investigated, because the employment of this brother who was in the foreman's employment looks at least a little bit shady.  I mean to have the case investigated further and, if the facts are in any way as stated by the Deputy, I think it would be only right that the Department should be told that this man should not be employed again as a foreman.  I do appreciate the spirit in which the Deputy raised this question.  I can quite see there was no capital to be made out of it from the point of view of the Deputy's credit in the constituency and I shall take every step to have the thing fully investigated.  I will let the Deputy know the result of that investigation.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.43 p.m. until Thursday, 22nd March, at 3 p.m.</P>
