      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>

He asked about the persons who organised the armed party which invaded Mohill; I have no information as to who organised this attack except to get the evidence of people as to who composed this unlawful party.  The people who have been identified have been prosecuted. If further evidence can be obtained by the Guards as to any other people who composed the party, those people will be dealt with in the same way.</P>

I heard of one case where it was granted at once.  In other cases a request was made to have the car examined.  It was examined, and after two months the rebate was made.  My case is that, first of all, the citizen is out of his money, even though it is only £5 or £10; and, in the second place, there is the matter of the filling up of a number of forms, the going through a number of hands, and wasting time generally, and eventually giving the rebate.</P>

      <P>That where a vehicle (in this Resolution referred to as the first-mentioned vehicle) has another vehicle or an attachment in the nature of a vehicle attached to and partly superimposed upon it, the first-mentioned vehicle and the said other vehicle or attachment shall, for the purposes of the Third Schedule of the Finance Act, 1926 (No. 35 of 1926), be deemed to form and be a single vehicle and the first-mentioned vehicle shall not, by reason merely of the attachment thereto of the said other vehicle or attachment, be deemed to be a tractor or a vehicle drawing a trailer, and the amount of the duty chargeable under Section 13 of the Finance Act, 1920, in respect of the first-mentioned vehicle and the said other vehicle or attachment shall be determined, and the said Third Schedule shall be construed and applied accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Resolution is designed to safeguard the existing revenue for the Road Fund. Under the Finance Act of 1926, tractors used for general haulage purposes were charged at £21 per annum and no duty was charged on trailers drawn by tractors. Formerly, these tractors and trailers were connected only by a drawbar, but for some time past there has been adopted a method of superimposing the front portion of the trailer on the tractor, so that they both form part of the one machine, of which the tractive portion it detachable.  As I say, that would mean that we would have a vehicle, capable of transporting very heavy loads and capable therefore of doing, under the theory that has governed this matters up to the present, a considerable amount of damage to the roads getting off with a comparatively low rate of duty, whereas I should be subject to a high tax.  The consequence is that the proper revenue of the Road Fund I diminished thereby, and every inducement is given to adopt the particular combination of tractor trailer for motor cars with one pa of the vehicular structure superimpose <Col N="1515" /> on the other part.  It is considered that that is not desirable, and the purpose of this Resolution is to ensure that that combination will be taxed as if it were a complete vehicle.</P>

I do not know whether the Minister knows it or not, but the roads are not particularly suitable at present for horses going to and from meets, and similarly in the case of shows.  Horses are jumped at shows and they are sometimes driven to the shows by road for a distance of 20 or 30 miles in trailers.

The Deputy talked about a motor car, but under the existing Act trailers are not taxable if they are attached to a complete unitary vehicle consisting of the engine and the body for the conveyance of either passengers or goods.

So far as I can gather from the Minister, he has not identified in any way for what part of the commercial or economic life of the country anything is being used such as he wishes to cover here.

      <P>I am afraid that if Deputies do not understand what a tractor is and if they are not familiar with recent developments in road transport, I cannot convey exactly what is meant by a verbal description. The Deputy no doubt has seen lorries going around, consisting, first of all, of a tractor portion which is a separate unit generally mounted upon four wheels&mdash;it may sometimes be mounted on two wheels&mdash;and secondly, of a carrying portion consisting of a lorry or platform generally, and almost always mounted on two wheels and, in the case dealt with in the Resolution mounted on two wheels.  The front part of the carrying portion is superimposed on the tractive unit and has hitherto been regarded as a trailer and not subject to duty.  Though the total weight of the complete vehicle consisting of the carrying portion, which cannot move of its own accord and the tractor portion which draws it may be considerable and such as would bring it within the higher ranges of duty which we have here of £75 and £105, nevertheless, because the tractor portion is comparatively light, the whole unit only pays duty at a very much smaller rate.  It is to catch that sort of case that this section is intended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say, in connection with this Resolution, if any account is being taken of recent valuations of houses in the City of Dublin and in the City of Cork where rebuilding is taking place and where the valuations far exceed the valuations of other property in the district? Perhaps it is more notable in the case of Cork City than Dublin because Dublin was revalued 16 or 18 years ago.  In the case of Cork, a large number of buildings in the centre of the city were demolished about 1920 and these have been rebuilt during the last ten years.  The valuation of these new premises far exceeds the valuation of property in the immediate neighbourhood.  I should like to know whether, in the calculation of the one-sixth in this case, the Minister has been definitely informed by the Valuation Office that the one-sixth has been allowed off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In that connection, I would refer the Deputy to the relevant section of the Valuation (Ireland) Act, 1852, which required that the valuation of houses and buildings shall be made on the estimated net value thereof, that is to say, the rent at which they might reasonably be expected to let from year to year, the probable average cost of repairs, insurance and other expenses being paid by the tenant.  The commissioner of valuation, therefore&mdash;I have not consulted him upon that specific point &mdash;is bound, in striking a valuation, to make an allowance for repairs.  I presume that he exercises his functions in accordance with the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what I asked the Minister, I asked him if any advertence had been made to the <Col N="1521" /> difference in the valuation of those premises as compared with other premises in the district, and whether one-sixth was a sufficient allowance in the circumstances.  In that district let us assume a valuation of £20,000. There are 100 houses in it.  The average valuation is £200.  Twenty of those houses are destroyed.  On revaluation the value of the 20 houses is taken at £500, as against the old £200.  It may seem to be an unusual or an extravagant estimate, but it is the fact.  In those cases, even though there has been an allowance of one-sixth, there is not a corresponding annual difference in value between one of those new houses and another house in that district.  Let us assume that number 29 was destroyed and rebuilt, and number 30 was not destroyed and consequently was not rebuilt; the valuation of number 30 is £200 and the new valuation of number 29 is £500.  Obviously it is an injustice to charge a person who is in occupation of number 29 at £500 in respect of income tax whereas the other is at only £200.  The general question is as to whether this one-sixth should come off at all or not; the particular question is in respect of revaluations which have taken place during a certain number of years past, that is to say, in the case of an old city such as Cork or Limerick.  My impression is that Waterford was revalued; Dublin certainly was revalued.  In those cases there is not the same steep difference in the recent valuations as compared with the old, but, in the case of a certain street such as Patrick Street in Cork, there is an extraordinary anomaly, and one which certainly imposes injustice upon people who have had their premises rebuilt, and in respect of which very big charges now remain for rates, once the remission is removed, as against income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know exactly the point which the Deputy wishes to make, but it seems to me that what he has said is really directed rather to the point that a revaluation of the country is overdue, because if it were not for the fact <Col N="1522" /> that a big number of valuations are out of date the anomaly to which he refers would not exist&mdash;that is, we should not have a house valued at £200 existing side by side with a house valued at £500 assuming&mdash;and this is the only thing that would constitute an anomaly&mdash;that the structure of the houses was, more or less, the same, and that they were both capable of being let at the same rent.  If that condition were fulfilled, then there would be an anomaly if one house were valued at £200 and the other at £500. That has got nothing to do with the point which we are now considering, because whether the house is valued at £200 or £500 the Commissioner of Valuation in striking the valuation for the house has already made allowance for the full amount&mdash;not one-sixth or one-eighth of the valuation but for the full amount which, in his opinion, would have to be spent on those premises year by year in order to keep them in repair.  It is because we feel it is not right that, over and above the allowance already made by the Commissioner in his valuation, an additional allowance should be granted, that this proposal is now before the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's explanation is a very poor one.  First of all, when he says a revaluation is overdue he ought to make enquiries as to what a revaluation is going to entail, and how long it is going to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said that the Deputy's argument would go to show that a revaluation is overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That is only one of the points.  A revaluation of the whole country would, I suppose, mean 20 years' work, if it would be possible to do it in 20 years, and certainly it would mean increasing the staff very considerably.  I should like the Minister to enquire how long it took to revalue the City of Dublin.  Whether or not that allowance has been made in certain cases, the fact of the matter is that in the case of a person whose valuation is £500 as against a person <Col N="1523" /> whose valuation is £200, the person whose valuation is £500 is liable for heavier rates at some period or other. Secondly, there is the point as regards the one-sixth allowance.  It is simply a problematical matter.  The Valuation Office is not more infallible than any other institution when it estimates what is a fair rent.  It is within the knowledge of many people who have had to deal with property of one sort or another that if you employ an auctioneer or valuer on behalf of the landlord he will give you, let us say, £150 as a fair rent.  If you employ him on behalf of the tenant he will most likely give you £100.  It has happened that most reputable firms employed in the case of, perhaps, the largest landlord in the City of Dublin, the Dublin Corporation, will give as a fair value, say, £150.  The tenant gets another firm, equally reputable, and they put it at £100. They are not more and they are not less fallible than the Commissioner of Valuation.  They simply take the mean, and in the mean it is quite possible that somebody will say, at some time or other, &ldquo;he has got one-sixth off for repairs; what he loses on one he will gain on the other.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the general question, this is an imposition on income-tax payers.  It is a thing that has not been borne before.  If the Minister read up the history of this country, its over-taxation and all the rest of it, he would find that the major case in connection with over-taxation was in respect of income tax.  He very easily forgets that sort of thing when dealing with these cases, but the one-sixth allowance has been the rule, I suppose, practically during the whole of the period of the running of the income tax code here.  This is a new imposition; it is an unfair imposition.  It is particularly unfair in the case of persons whose property has been revalued, even for the smallest possible extension of the premises.  Take a person in the City of Dublin in a single room, and you will find that the valuation has gone up 30 per cent or 40 per cent.  While you may seek to justify it on the grounds that it has already <Col N="1524" /> been allowed, it is simply humbugging yourself to say that.  Secondly, it has no reference or relation whatever to the unfairness of the incidence of this tax in the case of persons whose premises have been revalued at a later period than the whole of the district in which they live.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether any part of this discussion is relevant to the motion, but let me deal with the points raised by Deputy Cosgrave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing relevant is the question of the allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been told that, first of all, valuations are, after all, matters of opinion; that one person will value property as being worth one figure, and another as being worth a different figure; and, generally, that it is a matter of great doubt as to whether any of those opinions is justified. That seems to me to be an argument against having any valuation at all.  It is as strong an argument against the old valuations as against the new valuations.  I do not know how Deputy Cosgrave thinks it advances his case in the slightest to make that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then he said, of course, that there are great anomalies being created, I presume the case which he wishes to make is that of two premises, side by side, let at exactly the same rent, and, therefore, indicating that the general public feel that they have the one annual value, but, by reason of the fact that one was valued some years ago and the other one was recently revalued, the valuation of one is fixed at £200 and the valuation of the other at £500.  If the argument has any application at all, it is an argument in favour of having a revaluation.  I am not saying that a revaluation is necessary; I am not even saying that it is desirable.  I am merely pointing out what is the application of the argument which Deputy Cosgrave has used.  He said this would create an injustice as between one individual and another.  My answer to that is that, so far as repairs are concerned, a full allowance has been made for the <Col N="1525" /> cost of repairs to the owner or occupier, as the case may be, before the valuation has been struck.  The only thing is whether, the allowance having once been made, we are justified in making it a second time.  I say we are not.</P>
    <P>If there were any substance at all in the argument Deputy Cosgrave has used, that because of this anomaly we should allow the person whose premises are valued at £500 to have it on the double, then I say that a much greater injustice exists in regard to local rates, because they are based on the valuation.  In some cases they are over 20/- in the £ and the person who has to pay 20/- in the £ on a valuation of £500 as compared with his neighbour next door who pays 20/- in the £ on a valuation of £200, is in a much worse position from the point of view of local rates than he is in regard to income tax.  But if the person whose premises are valued at £500 has to pay local rates on that valuation, that valuation is struck after making due allowance for all repairs, insurance and such charges and public charges.  So that, so far as he is concerned, as regards income tax, the element of compensation has already entered into his valuation.  I say that the anomaly is thereby minimised. The real cure for the condition which Deputy Cosgrave has adverted to in the course of his speech is to allow this Resolution to go through, to withdraw the exemption on the double and, if it is considered desirable from a public point of view, and in order to see that every person is justly dealt with, advocate a revaluation of the whole country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will admit that this is not a question of valuation or revaluation or anything else like that; that it is a decision on his part to extract additional taxation from the owners of property.  In finding out how he would get additional taxation from the owners of property he hangs on to the only basis upon which he apparently can get it&mdash;that is some expression of the valuation.  This question of one-sixth or any other figure like that has nothing whatever <Col N="1526" /> to do with the case.  The Minister says, &ldquo;I have to get a certain amount of money from the owners of property and I am going to take it.&rdquo;  As I say, this one-sixth or even the valuation has nothing to do with it, good, bad or indifferent.  It is simply that he has no other way of getting additional taxation from the owners of property except by relating it to the valuation and the Minister in doing that becomes discriminatory and he takes the people who own houses as distinct from people who own shops or factories.  I should like to hear the Minister get away, as I think he ought to get away, from fractions or anything else like that, and explain why he attacks, by over-taxation, people who own houses, and why property used for commercial, or at any rate, industrial enterprises, does not come under this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say if one-sixth is an arbitrary figure or if it has been the experience of the Valuation Office that that is the exact figure required for repairs?  It certainly has not been my experience that one-sixth would cover the cost of repairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave asked me&mdash;I wish to repeat the question&mdash;whether one-sixth was an arbitrary figure.  One-sixth is an arbitrary figure under the English statute for the purpose of computing the allowance that should be made for repairs in making an income tax assessment where the repairs are assumed to be made by the owner.  But in the case of Irish valuations there is no arbitrary figure taken at all.  It is the Commissioner of Valuation who determines what allowance should be made in the valuation to cover the cost of the repairs.  If the owner of the property should feel aggrieved by that he has the right to appeal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not enter into it at all, so far as valuations are concerned, for income tax purposes. As I pointed out, if was an allowance on the double.  An allowance for repairs has already been made by the <Col N="1527" /> Commissioner of Valuation before he struck his valuation, and owing, I think, more or less to a clerical error under that Act, it was forgotten that the valuations in Ireland made allowance for repairs before they were struck.  In England they do not.  In England the valuation is the full rack-rental valuation, and the landlord is supposed to bear the cost of repairs.  This figure of one-sixth was, therefore, as I said, due to a misapprehension.  This allowance of one-sixth was given, and it only applies to certain privileged people among the property owners. Those who enjoy it, enjoy it at the expense not merely of their fellow property owners, but of every one else in the State, and the question is whether an inequitable position like that should be allowed to continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Minister to say that this only referred to a privileged class.  So far as I can learn from the information I gained, the privilege is that of paying income tax.  If any person belonging to the privileged class paying income tax happens to own the house in which he lives, he comes under the change proposed in this Resolution.  I think I am right in saying that that is the only limitation. It is limited to those who pay income tax.  I suggest to the Minister that he has not sufficiently considered the reactions of this proposal.  It is a definite blow at thrifty people who have tried to buy their own houses, and who have paid a certain price for the house after a careful calculation as to what return they are likely to get on the money, and as to whether it is likely to pay them better to buy their house or not.  This change will be a definite loss in capital value to those people.  Once this change has been brought in, a certain definite change in the capital value of the house they have bought will take place.  In fact, the return on the money invested in the house will be less, because people have considered this point&mdash;a point which has been in force for so long that it is almost taken for granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A change of this kind will indicate that it is in the power of future Ministers for Finance to make further <Col N="1530" /> changes and to say that the valuation is not sufficient, and that he must get some other way of finding out what rent such and such a person would be paying if he were renting a house.  I am only indicating that as a possible line of extension.  If the Minister will reflect on it, I think that he will come to the conclusion that the game is not worth the candle, that this blow at capital is not worth the gain to the State which is likely to accrue from this alteration.  The stability of an investment of this kind is an important feature for the ordinary citizen who was careful to purchase the house in which he lives.  I hope the Minister will take that point seriously into consideration, because I think it is a very vital one in the stability of house investment as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>What interests me in connection with this Resolution is the extension which the Minister has made of the term &ldquo;privileged class.&rdquo;  There was, before the present Government took office, never a definition made of &ldquo;privileged class&rdquo; in this country. The Minister first referred to certain classes of people with large incomes as a &ldquo;privileged class.&rdquo;  There were added, at various times, those classes whom some people style &ldquo;ranchers.&rdquo; The term &ldquo;privileged class&rdquo; is now to be extended to people who buy even Corporation houses.  There is to be no limitation apparently on the definition of &ldquo;privileged class&rdquo; or on the various people to whom it is to apply. The definition is now to be extended to people of moderate means in order that the Minister may be able to make further extractions from them.  People who might have saved enough to purchase their houses, as Deputy Thrift said, are definitely to be included in the privileged classes, and the Minister by this Resolution is out to extract some portion of their savings from them.  The Minister might as well call the kettle black and definitely say in simple terms that he requires a certain amount of money as house tax instead of introducing a camouflaged Resolution such as this; in other words, to extract a tax from the people that they do not really understand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It was apparently with <Col N="1531" /> reluctance that the Minister defined the meaning of this Resolution.  I would not go so far as to say that he moved a Resolution which he did not understand, but by degrees there has been extracted from him and his advisers the meaning of this Resolution. He opened by saying that in assessing the valuation the Commissioners of Valuation allow for repairs. If that is so, those who have been in the saddle before the Minister's Party took office have grievously offended against this State when they did not discover that the owners of property were getting away with a double allowance for repairs.</P>
      <P>The Minister should throw over camouflage.  I have not the least doubt that he approached it in this way, that he wanted to wave aloft his reduction of 6d. in the £ on income tax, but he discovered this trick to get it in another way.  Taking a house of £30 valuation, at 5/- on £25, it paid £6 5s. income tax last year.  Now, we are going to have the valuation of a £30 house at 4/6 amounting to £6 15s. Notwithstanding the fact that the Minister could swell his chest and tell the householder that he was reducing income tax by 6d., in reality the owner of the house will have to pay 10/- more in future.  If any clause of an Act has been recognised as a dead letter the Minister cannot come now after 20, 30 or 40 years, and say that it has been worked throughout the intervening years, that in assessing the valuation allowance was made for repairs, and that, roughly speaking, a house valued at £30 should be really valued at £35 or a fraction more.  For the purpose of conveying my idea that meets the case. That is really the Minister's argument, that that has been the practice and was in the minds of the Commissioners of Valuation.  I accept the Minister's statement that it was in the original Valuation Act, but the clause had become a dead-letter.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister sees the point very well, and that it is only a question of saying &ldquo;No&rdquo; to my &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, or vice versa.  We will leave it at that.  The privileged class that the Minister speaks of as owning houses, consists of 6,000 persons.  It is a pity the Minister was not here yesterday to hear his colleague, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, boasting that in the last year over 3,000 houses were built in the City of Dublin alone by private enterprise.  I guarantee that 99.9 per cent. of these houses are occupied by <Col N="1533" /> the people who own them.  The Minister is going to tax them.  What kind of people own these houses?  In order to help thrifty people who accumulated little savings the Dublin Corporation within the last year and a half advanced £650,000, every penny of which is to-day either used up or applied for.  The Corporation have refused further applications, hundreds of which are waiting because there is no money available.  The Finance Committee of the Corporation has authorised the spending of another £200,000.  Will the Minister think of how the new imposition is going to affect people who have saved from £60, or £70 up to £150 or £200 to buy their houses, and who are to be helped by the Corporation?  Will he think of the position these people will find themselves in, when a new tax is going to be put on their bit of property when they get it?  Will the Minister consider further the problem that confronts the Dublin Corporation that has advanced £650,000 in a year and a half, and that has decided to advance another £200,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Corporation was told by the Minister for Local Government that advances were not being made fast enough.  The credit of the citizens has been pledged to repay that £850,000. When that sum is swallowed up, in a month or two, there will be a clamour for more money.  After the credit of the citizens has been put behind that £850,000 for the repayment of instalments, the Minister comes along and the valuation is appreciated by one-sixth. That is really what this proposal amounts to.  To put it in another way, the Minister proposes to increase the valuation by one-sixth, and to put an annual charge of 4/6 in the £. on the increase.  The Corporation cannot then advance the same percentage. Quite recently the Finance Committee of Dublin Corporation agreed to increase the percentage advanced on houses.  It would facilitate thrifty working people and tradesmen to increase the advance by five per cent. to 85 per cent.  The Act provides for 90 per cent.  The City of Dublin is able to float a loan of £1,000,000 and to get the money.  That may be useful knowledge <Col N="1534" /> for the Minister to keep in mind. The city, within the next year, will have to float another £1,000,000 or perhaps more to carry out the present housing programme.  Its credit is now going to be curtailed.  The Minister made the deliberate statement that only 6,000 persons were affected.  Is not every man and woman in the City of Dublin and in the Free State, who owns a house, affected, with a few exceptions including manufacturing establishments?  The others are not exempt, so that out of the produce of income tax during the coming year, following the operation of this Resolution, and a similar amount on national income, the return at 4/6 will be far higher than it was last year when the tax was 5/-.</P>
    <P>This is the reduction in income tax that we are receiving.  I am sure that Deputy Thrift was not making a pun when he said that the thrifty people are going to be taxed under this proposal. The thrifty people in this city who have been proposing to buy houses for themselves will now turn back and clamour at the doors of the City Hall for houses which will be a big loss to the ratepayers.  I cannot agree with the Minister that everybody in charge of the public finances during the period when this country was part of the United Kingdom and during the period that it has been on its own made a mistake and did not see what the hawk-eye of the Minister has just seen-that the owner of his house, was getting away twice with the allowance for repairs and that, in fact, it was a swindle on the rates.  Will the Minister develop that argument?  How could it be a swindle on the rates?  Let us say that houses are valued at £20 each.  The Minister argues that the valuation should have been £23 6s. 8d.  A local authority wants to raise a certain sum.  It is immaterial to that authority whether the valuation of the property on which that sum is to be assessed is high or low.  If the valuation is high, the rates will be low.  If the valuation is low, the rates will be high.  The people have to pay the same amount in either case. The only inequality would arise if one house was valued on a lower basis than <Col N="1535" /> another.  The Minister's sympathy with the local authority is an empty formula.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that this double allowance is not made in England&mdash;that the Commissioners of Valuation there do not allow for repairs.  I question that.  I doubt if the valuation of houses in a city in Great Britain similar to this city is higher than the valuation here. I have not figures in respect of that. If the Minister says the valuation is higher in Great Britain I cannot contradict him.  But if he makes that positive statement, it is up to him to prove it, and it is not for me to prove the opposite.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody will agree that this is a most unfortunate proposal, brought forward at a most unfortunate time.  Every local authority is building houses at present and is trying to sell those houses.  If I know anything of the effects of this proposal, it will have very depressing results so far as the sale of houses is concerned.  The Minister may be correct when he says that it will not affect all houses, but it will affect the majority of houses.  The allowance of one-sixth for repairs was an inducement to people to become owners of their houses, and it is only the unfortunate people who own their own houses to whom this proposal refers.</P>
      <P>The Minister has told us that this allowance is already taken into account in arriving at the valuation.  I have been a party to a number of applications for revision of valuation, and I never heard that point raised in a single case.  Theoretically, the Minister's assertion may apply, but it does not apply in practice.  According to his Budget statement, the Minister will, this year, get the meagre sum of £25,000 from this proposal.  I do not know what it would mean in an ordinary year.  Perhaps the Minister would be good enough to tell us what the produce of this item would be in an ordinary year.  He proposed to get £25,000 from this tax in the current year.  I do not think that that amount justifies the injury the Minister is going to do, and I ask him to reconsider his proposal.</P>

      <P>If houses are built by local authorities and are let to tenants, the local authorities have already to pay tax in respect of the income from them.  If the houses are sold to tenants, then, in the great majority of cases, those tenants are, by virtue of other allowances, exempt altogether from payment of income tax.  The owner-occupiers of Corporation houses do not enter into this matter save in the very exceptional cases where they are persons with substantial incomes. Such a person might have to pay to the extent possibly that his income might be increased for the purpose of the Schedule A assessment which is a comparatively unimportant item.  So far as isolated individuals are concerned it might be increased slightly, and that is only in the very exceptional cases.  So far as these thousands of people for whom Deputy Belton was concerned or about whom he was speaking, they are not affected at all.</P>

      <P>But there are exemptions in the income tax code.  The Deputy knows as much about the income tax code as he does about the valuation code in England, about which he has admitted here he knows nothing. But the Deputy wishes Deputies to presume that the Minister is misleading the House when he says that in England, when striking the valuation, no allowance is made for repairs and that it is only equitable, when the income tax assessment comes to be struck, that allowances should be made.  But here, when a man has his valuation struck, the Commissioner has made allowance for repairs <Col N="1537" /> but for all other rates and taxes and other charges.  That allowance has to be made here.  Yet the Deputy gets up here and says that that law is a dead letter and, in fact, he has accused the Commissioner of Valuation in this country of not doing his duty by the State.</P>

      <P>As I have already endeavoured to explain, the point is that the Commissioner of Valuation having made allowance for repairs in the first instance, it is not equitable that the Commissioners of Revenue should make that allowance again in the case of a select number of individuals.  When I say select number of individuals, I mean those who enjoy the privilege at present of paying income tax upon less than their income.  That is what I meant when I referred to privileged classes.  I do not regard income tax payers as being privileged classes any more than other citizens; but any man who has an income and by an anomaly of the law pays less than the appropriate amount of tax upon his income, is a privileged person as compared with the rest of the community and with the class of income tax payers in general. That is the position in which we are placed here.  Deputy Thrift said that this was penalising thrift because we were asking people who owned their houses to pay at a proper rate.  I do not know which is the more thrifty person, the person who saves £800 and invests it in a house in which to live, or the person who has saved £800 and puts it into the National Loan.  Both of them enjoy a real income.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Why penalise, or at least why make a person who invests in the National Loan pay income tax upon the full income which he derives from that investment in the National Loan or from any similar investment in <Col N="1539" /> any productive enterprise in the State and not make the owner of a house pay income tax?  Supposing a person has £1,000 saved, and instead of investing it in the National Loan he invests it in another house, which he lets.  Say that house is one with a valuation of £60 per annum.  A house of that sort would probably let for £120&mdash;the tenant paying rates and the owner doing the repairs.  The rates borne on a house of that sort would probably be, in Dublin, £40 to £45 a year.  The annual cost to the occupier of that house, as distinct from the owner, would be about £165 a year.  If that house were let by its owner, the landlord would be paying on a net assessment of £60. That is what he gets out of it.  But if the tenant were being charged for income tax upon £165 he would pay on whatever might be the appropriate rate after making provision for allowances. The point is that the person who lives in the house as tenant as distinct from the person who lives in the house as owner, will pay full income tax upon that portion of his income which goes to pay for the rent and taxes upon the house, but the person who lives in the house as owner only pays income tax on a £60 valuation, less one-sixth; that is £50.  That would be the actual income at which he would be assessed for the house.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the point I made at all.  May I point out to the Minister that the point I was making was where a man 12 months ago or ten years ago paid a certain price for a house.  He calculated that price as meaning a certain return on the capital investment.  Making an allowance for what he had invested, he was allowing for the fact that he would have to pay income tax upon a smaller sum than he would get by investment, say, in the National Loan.  Taking all that into consideration, the house in which he invested was worth a certain capital sum to the man.  In future that house will be worth less, and if he sells it, that man will get a much lower price than he paid for it.  You have there a definite depreciation of the capital value of the house.</P>

      <P>There is the question of a vested interest in regard to any taxation imposed by the State.  The natural consequence to that line of argument would be that no taxation at all should be imposed by the State.  We are to have no taxes imposed, because all taxes touch some vested interest. One cannot argue that the creation of a vested interest should mean total exemption from taxation.  In any event, the effect of this concession upon the value of property is very much exaggerated.  The matter is not a new one.  So far as the houses which have been bought within the last ten years are concerned, I think the purchasers ought to have adverted to what took place here in 1924.  Deputy Belton has made the point that this thing was overlooked for the last ten years.  The fact of the matter is that if Deputy Belton had consulted his Leader he would have found that the Government of which he was President introduced a proposal of this sort, and the proposal was adopted by the Dáil and embodied in a Finance Bill.  In 1924, ten years ago, the Government under President Cosgrave submitted the same sort of proposal as this.  It was embodied in a Finance Bill, and it went to the Seanad and was rejected by the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Dáil agree with the Committee in Resolution No. 3.&rdquo;  The necessity for this Resolution is that the assessments on State employees for income tax purposes are computed normally on the basis of their income for the preceding year.  In the normal course, therefore, civil servants and other State employees who suffered cuts in their salaries under the Public Services (Temporary Economics) Act, 1933 would have been assessed for income tax for the year 1933-34 on the basis of their full salaries for the year 1932-33.  To obviate the hardships which this would involve, Section 3 of the Finance Act of last year was passed.  It is necessary now to interpolate a converse provision in this year's Finance Act, as otherwise the result would be that the cuts of last year would be taken into account in computing income tax assessments for two years.</P>

      <P>In order that we may be able to deal adequately with these matters on the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, I think we should hear something about the Resolution now.  For instance, it would appear that there is a wiping out of certain preferential rates that existed on some of these articles up to the present and that, apart altogether from that, there are certain increases in customs duties on certain articles, and that there is a large number of articles in respect of which the Minister takes power to issue licences for import.  I only instance these as some of the matters that, on the face of it, would seem to make it necessary for the Minister to tell us something as to what is behind the Resolution generally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Reference No. 1 imposes a duty upon articles intended for use as holders of paper or twine.  These articles at present are dutiable when made of certain materials and it is intended to make them dutiable no matter what materials they are manufactured from.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a duty of 50 per cent. on wooden containers for twine or paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A preferential rate of 33? per cent.  The effect of the duty is to make the 50 per cent. operative on all containers for paper or twine, no <Col N="1545" /> matter what materials they are made of, without a preferential rate. No. 2 imposes a duty upon fire extinguishers. There is at present a duty of 45 per cent. with a preferential rate of 30 per cent. on fire extinguishers made wholly or mainly of tin, tin plate, tinned plate or a combination of any of them. Fire extinguishers which are made of tern plate have been free of duty.  Tern plate is iron coated with lead, and the dutiable articles are those of iron coated with tin.  The effect of the change made here is to bring articles of tern plate subject to this duty and to change the duty from 45 per cent. maximum and 30 per cent. preferential to 40 per cent. flat. No. 3 merely increases the duty on coffin mountings from 50 to 66? per cent.  No. 4 imposes a duty on copper boilers of 25 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a new duty. No. 5 extends the existing duty upon galvanised hollow ware and brings subject to duty the articles set out in the list. The existing duties are on domestic hollow ware of galvanised wrought iron or steel, including galvanised coppers, gutters, pipes and ridgings which are, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, primarily intended for carrying off rain-water.  The articles being brought in are buckets, cans and pails, watering-pots, dust, ash or refuse bins or boxes, articles which are intended for use in feeding or watering animals or birds and storage bins.</P>

      <P>In connection with No. 5, might I ask the Minister a question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the Minister is not going to answer any question until he is finished.  No. 6 extends the duty upon cast iron articles.  A number of these articles are at present dutiable under Emergency Orders.  These Orders have been repealed and various duties have been brought into one list so that they will be easier of enforcement and understanding, and obviate confusion in administration.  Under the old duty, payment light frames, skylights and dead lights were subject <Col N="1546" /> to duty.  These articles fall more properly under the heading of metal window frames and they are now being brought subject to that particular duty. No. 7 imposes a duty on metal plates for motor cars and their component parts.  This is a new duty.  No. 8 makes specific the duty at present operating on manufactures of wire. There is, under a previous Finance Act, a duty upon all wire manufacturers, That duty has been repealed and, in future, a duty of 33? per cent. will operate only upon the articles set out in reference No. 8 when made of wire.</P>
      <P>No. 9 imposes a duty upon spades and shovels and parts thereof.  It is intended in the Finance Bill to insert, in connection with that duty, a licensing clause.  There are certain small workshops throughout the country where spades and shovels are manufactured from imported blanks and, although it will become necessary for these workshops to procure their blanks from Saorstát firms in future, it is necessary to provide some little time to enable the change to be made, and in the interval to license the importation free of duty of limited quantities of these blanks by these small manufacturers.  No. 10 increases the duty on horse shoes.  No. 11 effects certain changes in respect of riddles and sieves, which are at present liable to duty when made wholly or mainly of wood.  The component parts were not subject to duty, and the effect of the change is to make these articles, together with the component parts, liable to duty whether made of metal or wood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Finance Act, 1932, imposed a duty of 22½ per cent., with a 15 per cent. preferential rate, on articles of the nature of a disinfectant, insecticide, verminicide, vermicide or fungicide, which pass in commerce under the designation of proprietary or protected trade names.  It has been found very difficult to administer the duty, on account of that qualification.  The only articles subject to duty were those which passed in commerce under the designation of a proprietary or protected trade name.  During the discussion which took place with the Revenue Commissioners in that connection, <Col N="1547" /> it was mentioned also that there was extreme difficulty in determining what is a germicide for purposes of customs administration.  The change, therefore, which is being effected here is, firstly, to remove the qualification of articles which pass in commerce under the designation of a proprietary or protected trade name and, secondly, to insert the words &ldquo;which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, is a disinfectant, vermicide, verminicide, or fungicide.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>No. 13 extends and increases the duty on photographic prints.  No. 14 imposes a duty upon complete dentures of any material and bases for dentures. No. 15 increases to 50 per cent. the duty in operation upon certain sports implements.  No. 16 imposes a new duty of 20 per cent. on certain articles manufactured of leather, which are set out, that is, fancy leather goods of various kinds, such as handbags, notecases and so forth.  In respect of No. 17, the position at present is that there is a duty of 1 1-5d. per lb., with 1d. preferential rate, on canned fruits and syrups.  That duty has been repealed and, instead, a duty of 4d. per lb. has been imposed on certain fruits named in the reference which are imported in sealed tins or cans, and of 1d. per lb. on other fruits.</P>
    <P>It is an increase of duty upon the fruits named and a slight decrease in the full rate on the other fruits. No. 18 imposes a duty upon filled shot cartridges.  The new duty is designed to revive the business of filling those cartridges in the country. No. 19 increases and extends, as I have already explained, the duty upon metal window frames.  No. 20 imposes a duty of 33? per cent. on badges, medals, medallions and the like, made wholly or mainly of silver, copper, bronze, brass, gunmetal, tin, zinc or aluminium, or a combination of any of those metals.  No. 21 imposes the duty mentioned upon certain articles manufactured of cotton, linen or union cloth, that is table cloths, table covers, all other table equipment, towels, domestic cloths and tarpaulins; also bags and sacks made wholly or mainly of cotton, and also component parts made <Col N="1548" /> wholly or mainly of such bags or sacks. The principal type of sack to which that duty applies is the ordinary flour sack, the manufacture of which is to be undertaken here in future.</P>
    <P>No. 22 increases and extends the existing duty upon linen and cotton goods.  It is proposed in the Finance Bill to exempt from duty cotton goods which have been subject to a process of proofing.  The present duty exempts cotton goods which have been subject to the process of printing or painting, or both printing and painting, and it is proposed to insert there the word &ldquo;proofing&rdquo; also. The manufacture of linen goods has of course been a substantial industry in this country for a long time.  Cotton goods have also been manufactured. The manufacture of cotton piece goods over 4½ ozs. to the square yard is being undertaken, and consequently this duty is being imposed in order to afford the necessary protection.  No. 23 imposes a duty upon bias bindings.  It is a new duty.  No. 24 imposes a duty upon the component parts of sparking plugs. There is a duty on sparking plugs, but the practice of importing them unassembled has been going on.  Of course anyone could assemble a sparking plug, and in order to make the duty effective it is necessary to make it apply to the component parts of those articles as well as to the complete article.  It is proposed to amend that reference slightly in the Finance Bill, to make it clear that the duty applies only to metal parts other than copper washers.  There is a certain porcelain fitting which is used in some types of sparking plugs and which is not yet manufactured here. No. 25 imposes a duty upon boot and shoe lasts.  Those are not yet being manufactured here; consequently there is a licence provision. Proposals for their manufacture have been made, and it is expected that production will be commenced in a short time.  It is necessary to impose the duty now in order to prevent forestalling, but until production is commenced importation under licence will be permitted. No. 26 imposes a duty on washing soda.  Again there is a licence provision inserted there, because production <Col N="1549" /> is only beginning, and until the concerns here are able to supply the full requirements of the country some importation under licence will be permitted. No. 27 increases the duty on bedding, and removes the preferential rates of duty which operated heretofore.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Articles of rubber are excluded.  No. 28 makes the same change in respect of rugs. No. 29 imposes a duty upon live domestic fowls, turkeys, geese and ducks. There has been a duty in operation upon those articles already.  The duty has been repealed, and certain emergency orders have also been repealed. That duty is now being confirmed. No. 30 imposes a new duty on soups of all descriptions, whether in liquid, solid, powder or any other form.  Certain soups were subject to duty under an emergency order which has been repealed.  No. 31 imposes, in lieu of the duty at present operating under an emergency order, a duty of one shilling per pound on honey. No. 32 is also a replacement of duty imposed under an emergency order. No. 33 is in the same category.  Those duties have been in operation already under emergency orders.  No. 34 is the same.  The duty has been in operation under an emergency order, and is being confirmed under this Resolution. No. 35 is also a replacement of duty at present in operation under an emergency order by the duty imposed under this Resolution.</P>

      <P>What did the Minister say about No. 34?  Is it a new tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The same thing applies there.  It is a duty imposed on glazed articles by an emergency order some time towards the end of last year in anticipation of forestalling taking place following the announcement of an intention to erect a factory here.  Imports are at present taking place under licence, and will have to take place under licence for a considerable time. No. 36 increases the duty on cordage, cables, ropes and twines, which has been in operation for the past two <Col N="1550" /> years.  No. 37 is a substitution of Budget duty for the duty at present in operation under an emergency order upon bolts and nuts.  The manufacture of bolts and nuts was commenced at the beginning of the year, and it was necessary to impose a duty at that time in order to afford protection and prevent forestalling.  That duty is now being confirmed under this Resolution. No. 38 imposes a duty upon prepared liquid or quasi-liquid sauces and condiments. No. 39 imposes a new duty of 1/- per cwt. on whiting or whitening. The manufacture of whiting and whitening has been in progress at Ennis for some time past, and the industry is now being protected for the first time.  No. 40 imposes a duty on aluminium goods.  Deputies will have seen in the papers that the manufacture of these goods is about to commence at Nenagh.  It was considered necessary to impose a duty in advance of production, in order to prevent forestalling. There is a licence provision under which ordinary requirements will be imported free of duty for some time to come.</P>
      <P>No. 41 imposes a duty on lubricating oil imported in containers under 40 gallons.  The purpose of the duty is obviously to get the work of packing the oil in small containers and the manufacture of the containers undertaken here.  One company, as Deputies are aware, has been doing that for some time past, and considerable employment has been afforded in the manufacturing of containers and the cases for the containers.  It is proposed to make all the oil companies operate in the same way.  Following the imposition of the duty and the experience gained by the Revenue Commissioners in its operation, it has been decided to reduce in the Finance Bill the 40 gallons to 35 gallons.  The large drums or barrels in which the oil is imported normally contain 41 gallons.  It appears that a certain shrinkage or leakage takes place in transit and they contain less than 40 gallons when they reach the port of destination.  It will simplify matters to have the 40 gallons reduced to 35 gallons.  It will not affect in any additional way either the oil companies or the intention of the duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1551" /> No. 42 imposes a duty on wire-bound hose tubing.  Deputies will remember that wire-bound hose tubing was manufactured in this country for a number of years.  The firm engaged in the business was acquired by an English firm and the works in Dublin were closed down some time last year.  One of the persons associated with the former firm is now about to commence the manufacture of these articles in the Saorstát again, and so a duty has been imposed for the purpose of affording protection.</P>
    <P>No. 43 imposes a duty upon tinned or canned fish of all kinds.  Where the container and the contents thereof do not together exceed 1 lb. in weight, the duty is one penny on each container; where the container and the contents together exceed 1 lb. in weight the duty is 1d. per lb. or part of a lb. weight of each container.</P>
    <P>No. 44 imposes a duty of 2d. per lb. on fish kippered or smoked.  No. 45 imposes a duty of 3d. per lb. on fish filleted and parts thereof.  These duties are being imposed for the obvious purpose of securing that the work of canning, kippering or filleting of fish will be undertaken in the Saorstát.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to give Deputies all the information that they may desire concerning any of these proposed duties. It is difficult to do so without knowing in advance the information that is desired, and I shall be only too glad to clear up, if possible, any points raised in the discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has placed a Resolution before us which very substantially increases a large number of taxes, and as one particular part of that raising of taxes it does away with the preferential rate that existed up to the present.  The Minister did not address himself to that particular aspect of the matter, and the House will be interested to hear what effect doing away with the preferential rate in respect of all these items is going to have on the direction of our trade outside, if any.  As I say, the increase is very substantial in many ways.  The first item increases the duties on a list of articles of a <Col N="1552" /> particular kind from 31½ to 50 per cent.</P>
      <P>In the case of a third item, coffin mountings of metal, the Minister stated that there was an increase in the tariff from 50 per cent. to 66? per cent. In fact, I think that the increase is from a preferential rate of 33? per cent. to 66? per cent.  In reference No. 5, in regard to one item, hollow ware of domestic or household use, the Minister seemed to imply that that meant an increase in the tax, but I should like to hear from him whether it is not a new tax entirely, whether this is not putting 30 per cent. duty on certain articles that have not been dutiable heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is only in regard to certain parts of that reference. Hollow ware of domestic or household use has been dutiable.  That duty is being repealed, and is being re-enacted under this reference.  Some of the other articles set out have not been dutiable heretofore.</P>

      <P>In reference No. 6, the Minister puts an appreciable increase on articles very much used in house building.  We have had statements made before the Prices Commission in the last couple of months that the cost of building materials is very much above what some people, at any rate, think it should be.  Here we have the tariff increased from a preferential rate of 15 per cent. to a flat rate of 25 per cent. on such things as external water pipes, sash weights, gully traps, fire bars, smoke pipes, and articles of that kind.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister will find from the publication giving the customs duties as revised and up-to-date, in January 1934. that <Col N="1553" /> there is some discrepancy between what he says now and what I say. From the information published there, I suggest that in respect to quite a number of these items&mdash;they may have been items on which the preferential rate has been wiped out&mdash;there is a substantial increase in the tariff. There was a preferential rate of 15 per cent. in respect to these items formerly.  The original duties on the items indicated under reference No. 6 were, I take it, imposed for the purpose of stimulating the manufacture of these articles here.  If, as I suggest, the duties are now being increased by 10 per cent., I should like to hear the Minister explain why that increase is being imposed and what the position is generally with regard to development of the manufacture of these items.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to a number of these items the Minister takes power to issue licences.  The position with regard to the issue of licences, generally, is of such great importance, and the issue of licences being the kind of thing that should be avoided as far as possible, I think it would be well if the Minister would give us some information as to the way in which these licences are being worked generally. There appear to be different cases in which the Minister takes power to issue licences.  He indicates one of these in regard to reference No. 34 and another in regard to reference No. 40, where he imposes a tariff for the purpose of enabling him to shut down on the import of certain articles if he sees dumping beginning or for the reason that steps are being taken to begin the manufacture of these articles here. That is one class of case.  Then reference No. 12, in which the Minister takes similar powers, deals with a different class of article entirely.  There is a licence clause attached to that reference, although the articles enumerated there are not of the class the manufacture of which is actually beginning to be developed here.  I should like to hear why, in the case of disinfectants, insecticides and ointments, it is necessary for the Minister to take powers to allow certain of these articles in on licence.  Is it that there are certain classes of disinfectants <Col N="1554" /> that are of vital necessity and that no attempt is being made to manufacture these articles in this country?  It certainly seems to me a different case for the control of imports by licence, to that of the Arklow or the Nenagh cases.</P>
    <P>Reference No. 15 is very interesting, because a tax is being put on tennis racquets, which are completely or substantially manufactured, golf clubs, and things like that.  There has, up to the present, I understand, been a tariff of 15 per cent. with a preferential rate of ten per cent. on these articles.  A tariff of 50 per cent. is now being imposed.  The Minister, apparently, is developing another sports tax.  If this is not intended to be another sports tax, I should like to hear from the Minister what is the position with regard to the development of the manufacture of these articles here. With reference to the statement that the increased tariff under paragraphs (a) and (b) refers to articles wholly or substantially manufactured, I should like to ask the Minister whether there is a tariff on parts of these sports articles which are imported for assembly?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister then contemplate that the increase in this tariff will develop an assembly industry here in respect to these sports articles?  I should like to ask the Minister whether the tax imposed in reference No. 16, on articles made wholly or mainly of leather or skin, is intended to be a revenue tax or a protective tax.  If it is intended to be a protective tax, when we compare the 20 per cent. imposed under reference No. 16 with the 50 per cent. imposed on sports articles under reference No. 15, the difference in the amount of the two tariffs is not understandable, particularly when we remember that reference No. 16 imposes a tariff of 20 per cent. on cash bags made wholly or mainly of leather or skin or a combination of leather and skin.  We should remember in that connection the calf skins that will be made available in the country and the fact that no use can be made of our calf skins in connection <Col N="1555" /> with the boot industry.  Under reference No. 17 the Minister provides that we can have preserved peaches, pears and apples at a tariff of 1d. per lb., but if we want to have blackberries or gooseberries, preserved in the same way, we shall have to pay a tariff of 4d. per lb.  I should like to hear from the Minister why it is necessary to double the tariff in respect of gooseberries and raspberries, increase it four times in respect to damsons and plums, and to put a tariff on blackberries which did not exist before.  The Minister does not take any licensing powers in connection with these matters.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that a new tariff is to be imposed on filled shot cartridges. I thought there was a tariff on these already and I should like to hear the Minister explain whether he intends this to be a prohibitive tariff. The Minister made certain references to the tariff on cotton piece goods and indicated that the manufacture of some of the articles mentioned in the Schedule was going to be undertaken here.  I have heard it stated by people engaged in the shirt manufacturing industry that the tariff imposed, and which is in operation now, on some of the cotton goods mentioned here will seriously interfere with the shirt industry.  I have been told that some of these articles are essential for collars and stiff shirt fronts and that the shirt industry is being interfered with owing to the difficulty in getting some of the stuff at the present moment because of the tariff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of an article like honey, in reference to which the Minister takes power to allow the article in free of duty on licence, I should like to know whether it is intended to apply that power in a seasonable way.  The Minister has a Prices Commission operating at the present time and I should like to ask him whether in a case such as that covered by reference No. 41, where he is imposing a tariff of 1/- per gallon on lubricating oil brought in otherwise than in containers of a certain kind, he asks the Prices Commission to consider whether the <Col N="1556" /> price that will be charged in future for this commodity is a price above that which would be warranted. Does he ask whether the cost of the oils will not be unduly increased by this tariff or whether the increase in cost is in any way equable to the amount of employment that will be given?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to get some information from the Minister regarding items what are mentioned in reference Nos. 5 and 6 dealing with gutters, pipes, ridgings, external water and soil pipes.  The information I want to get might be applicable to other items on which there are tariffs.  I want to know whether in all cases where these things are manufactured here, or are about to be manufactured will the Minister take steps to protect the public against people who are now exploiting them?  I will give a definite case.  This week a prominent builder in Cork gave me figures dealing with gutters and pipes which require explanation.  This man communicated with Irish firms who manufacture gutter pipes and make them I understand in lengths of six feet.  There is a tariff already on imported gutters. A Scotch firm quoted at 6/6 delivered, while a Dublin firm for the same quality, wanted 6/7 although they had the advantage of the tariff.  That is a glaring case of exploitation, although we hear a good deal from time to time about inquiries being set up in the Free State to find out the ratio between the paper cost and the finished product for materials for houses.  It has been frequently stated at these inquiries that the cost of labour amounted to almost half of the cost of housing, and that that was why the cost of building material was altogether out of proportion to other costs in this country.  Here is a definite case.  I should like to know what protection will be given to the general public, or if you wish, to the consumer.  My own experience in connection with reference No. 18 may be of interest.  I remember when it was possible to get good filled shot cartridges of the very best kind for 10/- a 100.  As good quality cannot be got now for from 15/- to £1.  I make this forecast, that when the extra tariff goes on the <Col N="1557" /> cost of filled shot cartridges will go up by at least 50 or 60 per cent., and Irish manufacturers will pocket the difference they get from exploiting the consumer. That is a position that I would like the Minister to inquire into, particularly with regard to gutters and pipes, which I feel are of more importance to the community than filled cartridges. The experience of the general public is that these tariffs, while they may have done something to help struggling industries, such help is more than counter-balanced by the increased cost of living of the working classes. That is a matter the Labour Party should take into consideration.  The cost of housing is going to be increased very considerably.  No matter what is said about Irish manufacturers, and the protection they are getting in these commodities, they are going to charge more than persons outside the Free State charge.  I can verify the figures I gave, that an outside firm could supply at 6/6 as against 6/7 from a Dublin source.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>In reference No. 34, dealing with articles of domestic or household use, I notice that the rate of duty is 30/- per cwt.  Tea-pots or similar articles are not made here at present, except common tea-pots, which are made in a small factory at Carrigaline, County Cork.  I am given to understand that other types of tea-pots have to bear as much as 100 or 120 per cent., in some instances, <i>ad valorem</i>, and that it is eventually passed on to the consumer.  I understand this <Col N="1558" /> tariff has been put on in order to protect an industry which is about to be started in Arklow.  If one could reasonably hope to see that industry started in the immediate future, one could understand the proposal. But it has been spoken of for a considerable time.  If the industry was reasonably near starting, one could understand affording it undue protection, but to give it a long time in advance to a rather shadowy industry is different.  I understand that licences are being given to enable these articles to be imported, and I would like to draw attention to the manner in which they are issued.  Four or five firms have been engaged in this trade for many years, and they are entitled to get a limited number of licences.  If my information is correct a couple of agents with offices in Dublin, who employ only typists in their offices, can get licences <i>ad lib.,</i> and it is necessary for some of the firms who are in the trade and who give employment to go to these agents and to make purchases through a particular channel.  That is an unfair restriction on firms who may wish to purchase where they like.  That is the information I got from the trade. As the tariff is a very heavy one, if licences are to be issued they should be given to people in the trade.  These people should be given the right of a free market, to bring goods from Staffordshire or any other place without being compelled to deal with agents who inflict themselves on the trade in an unfair manner.  The Minister might look into that matter and see if it could be remedied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three circumstances in which power to permit imports free of duty under licence is taken&mdash;(1) where certain industrial developments are pending, and it is necessary to secure that the market will not be flooded out with imported products during the stage when the plans become known and the date upon which production commences; (2) where it is desired to give protection to an industry which has been already established, but which is not yet in a position to supply full requirements; where importation must obviously take place, and where it is desirable that the importation <Col N="1559" /> should not be subject to duty, and (3) where difficulties of definition make it impossible to provide the protection required, without, at the same time, imposing a duty on articles which it is not desired should be subject to duty, but which cannot be excluded by legal definition, and where consequently discretion is given to the Revenue Commissioners to permit the importation of such articles free of duty after consultation with the Minister. All these circumstances operate in determining the duties imposed by this Resolution, in respect of which licensing powers have been taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To deal with the other general points raised, namely, the abolition of preferential rates, it has to be remembered that the Preferential Rates Bill, which was recently discussed in the Dáil, has now passed through the Oireachtas.  In future the position will be, that when a duty is indicated with a preferential rate attached, no country will get the benefit of that preferential rate until an order has been made by the Executive Council extending it to some country or countries named in that order.  The possibility of such an order being made in respect of any of the new duties imposed by this Resolution was considered, and it was not thought likely that such an order would arise in the near future.  Consequently no provision for preferential rate was made.  If circumstances should arise in which it is considered desirable that a preferential rate in respect of any of these duties should be given to a particular country or to countries, then the necessary financial resolutions can be introduced.  It is obviously much better, from the point of view of administration, that the number of preferential rates should be as few as possible and that a flat rate duty should apply to articles of a certain description irrespective of origin, so that no obligation to produce proof of origin will rest upon the importers.  In respect of a number of the duties set out in the Schedule to this Resolution, the position has been that although the original duties provided for the application of preferential rates to articles originating in the British Commonwealth, <Col N="1560" /> these preferential rates had been superseded by Emergency Order and had not been operative for a considerable time.  That position is being merely regularised by the inclusion of these duties in this Resolution.</P>
    <P>To deal with the matters which have been raised, the position in regard to Resolution No. 6 is that no change has, in fact, taken place.  A number of duties were imposed on cast-iron goods of this class by different Finance Acts and Emergency Orders.  The preferential rates provided for in the Finance Acts were repealed by Emergency Orders and a position arose in which it was not easy to ascertain what articles were dutiable and to what extent. The effect of reference No. 6 is really to codify the duties imposed upon these articles, so that there will be a single list with a flat rate of duty applicable&mdash;25 per cent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy made reference to the Customs and Excise tariff.  I think that he omitted to notice the note which appears at the foot of reference No. 72, which relates to cast-iron manufactures. It is in smaller print than the rest of the reference, and it states:</P>
    <P>United Kingdom goods of these descriptions other than pile shoes, smoke pipes, ventilation pipes and other similar pipes are ineligible for admission at the preferential rate of duty.</P>
    <P>Deputy Anthony referred to some complaint he had received that a quotation had been given for cast-iron rain-water goods by a Scottish firm, which was slightly lower than a quotation for similar goods from an Irish firm.  He built on that a sweeping condemnation of Irish manufacturers of all kinds.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mulcahy raised a question concerning reference No. 12 and the necessity for a licensing provision in that connection.  The reason is that difficulties in respect of the definition were anticipated.  The definition is necessarily a wide one.  It could not have been made any more specific than it was.  It was anticipated that certain articles not intended to be covered would be deemed by the Revenue Commissioners to be legally liable to that duty under this definition. It was considered desirable, in that event, to have power to remit the duty and admit free goods of a class that it was not desired should be subject to the duty.  That situation would inevitably arise under a wide definition of that kind.  After a period, during which experience of the operation of the duty will have been obtained, it <Col N="1563" /> may be possible to amend the definition and, at the same time, abolish the licensing clause.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy raised a question concerning reference No. 15&mdash;the duty imposed upon assembled or substantially assembled or manufactured sports goods.  These articles were liable to duty under the general duty upon sports goods of all kinds which has been in operation for some years.  An increase is now being made because their manufacture on an extensive scale has been undertaken by a number of firms in this country.  Of course there are associated with sports clubs, golf clubs and other clubs professionals whose livelihood comes from the manufacture of these goods.  The duty was raised to 50 per cent. to make it prohibitive, so that the business of manufacturing these articles from imported parts would be entirely done here. There is no duty upon the parts.</P>
      <P>Reference No. 16 is a new duty which operates upon certain articles manufactured of leather.  The duty has been fixed at 20 per cent. because the manufacture of these goods here is only commencing. One firm has already commenced the manufacture of ladies' handbags and articles of leather of that kind, and is producing goods of very good quality.  Certain plans for the manufacture of other fancy-leather articles have been made and will fructify in due course.  It was felt that no particular hardship would be imposed by making the duty extend to all articles of that kind, manufactured of leather, which are luxury articles in every sense of the word.  Consequently the duty, to some extent, may be considered a revenue duty, but it is hoped, by the end of the year, that articles covered by the duty will be manufactured here, and that revenue will cease to accrue from that particular duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy raised some question in reference to Article 17&mdash;soft fruit. A duty is put upon that because it is supposed that the canning of these fruits will be undertaken here, and then it will not be necessary for people to pay 4d. per in dearer if they got <Col N="1564" /> them from Irish factories engaged in the canning industry.  They are all grown in the country, and that growth it is desired to cultivate.  The other fruits are not packed in cans here, or grown at the moment, and, consequently, the higher duty does not apply.  In fact, a lower duty will apply, and instead of a duty of one penny one-fifth the new duty will be one penny.  In respect of No. 18&mdash;filled shot cartridges&mdash;these were liable to a duty as sports goods.  They are not going to be removed from that duty, and they are to be submitted to a duty of 33? per cent. in order to encourage their manufacture here at home. Deputy Mulcahy also raised a question as to the effect of the duty on foreign cloth upon the shirt industry. It will be noticed that printed and pained cotton cloth is not subject to the duty.  Nowadays most of the shirts worn are manufactured from printed cloth.  In so far as shirts of plain colour are used or shirts with the woven patterns, this cloth is liable to duty if it exceeds 4½ ozs. to the square yard.  If in excess of that weight it is hoped that it will be available for many of the weaving mills in the Saorstát.  I do not want to leave Deputies under the impression that the full requirements of the country, in respect of cotton cloth of that kind, could be supplied at home. Some parts could be supplied, but until there are some further extensions, which are likely to take place in the way of building new premises and installing additional machinery, the full requirements of cotton cloth cannot be woven here, but the position is that the main classes of cloth covered by that duty are being manufactured in considerable quantities here.  We have, in respect of some cotton cloth, an export trade not of considerable dimensions.  In due course, all other cloths will be produced here. We hope, at a later stage, to extend that duty to all cotton cloths when new machinery is installed and other manufactures are brought into existence. With regard to No. 31&mdash; honey, including artificial honey.  This duty is intended to be seasonal in its operation.  It is the Minister for <Col N="1565" /> Agriculture who is responsible for the operation of the duty, and if Deputies desire to raise any query as to his intention, they might do so on the Finance Bill, but the reason for the licensing provision is as I have said.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy also asked if the price of lubricating oil will be increased in connection with the duty mentioned in reference No. 41.  It is not anticipated that it will.  I mention one oil company&mdash;the Irish-American Oil Company&mdash;which showed very considerable initiative in arranging for the manufacture of all its oil containers in this country.  It did so at considerable inconvenience, at the time, but it gave considerable employment here, and I am not aware that it felt under any obligation to increase its price on that account.  The effect of this duty will be that other oil companies will be compelled to arrange for the packing of their oil, in small containers, in the country, and, consequently, for the manufacture of those containers in the country.  It is not anticipated that any increase in price will result.  In any event the information at my disposal indicates that there is sufficient profit to absorb any additional cost that may arise without the necessity of passing on the increased price to the public.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keyes raised a query in connection with the increase in Article, reference No. 34.  I have no recollection of having received any complaint concerning the manner in which the licensing clause has been operating in respect of that duty.  If there is any such complaint I would be glad to consider it, to investigate it, and see if any changes in the present method of administration are necessary.  The position was that the duty was imposed by an Emergency Order early in December, 1933, when we had evidence that, following a Press announcement of the intention to establish the pottery industry here, very large quantities of pottery were being imported.  As pottery goods would keep indefinitely, and as it was very necessary to move before the market was filled up entirely, it was decided to allow imports under licence of the normal goods until the new <Col N="1566" /> works were established.  That did not apply to glazed teapots.  There was a duty on teapots to protect the articles made in Cork where some excellent work prevails, though not in sufficient quantity to supply the requirements of the country, but the quality of which is as good as any available.  The position in regard to the new pottery works is that all arrangements in connection with the business, and its finances are complete, and that a definite move for the establishment of the factory will take place in the next three or four weeks.  Until the works are started, and until they begin to produce, the present licensing provisions will operate.  I should be very anxious to remove and eliminate any causes of complaint as to the manner in which these licences are operating and to receive any such complaints from people who think they have any grievance.</P>
    <P>These are the only matters, I think, that were raised.  I do not think that any Deputies desire to raise any other question.  Another occasion will arise on the Bill itself.  I mentioned that it is proposed to make four changes and, in order to avoid confusion, I shall reiterate them.  First, it is proposed to take licensing powers in respect of the articles mentioned in reference No. 9 so as to permit of the importation, for a short period, of a limited quantity, of spade and shovel blanks, to certain small firms to which these blanks are raw material, until they make arrangements to get supplies from Saorstát factories; secondly, to exempt from the duty imposed under reference No. 22 proofed cloth of cotton; thirdly, in respect to reference No. 24 to make the duty apply only to metal articles, that is, to the metal parts of sparking plugs, and fourthly, in respect to reference No. 41 to reduce the size of the container from 40 gallons to 35 gallons for the reasons which I have stated&mdash;that is, merely for the convenience of administration.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the <Col N="1567" /> Dáil agree with the Committee in Resolution No. 5.&rdquo;  The effect of this Resolution is really to consolidate all the duties which have been in operation on boots and shoes and which were imposed either by previous Finance Acts or by Emergency Orders.  There is only one outstanding modification in the existing position and that is set out in paragraph 2 of the Resolution.  The effect of it is that there shall be a minimum duty at the rate of 6d. per boot and shoe chargeable in respect of second-hand boots and shoes.  The necessity for that provision is the same as that which occasioned the imposition of a flat rate duty on second-hand clothing.  It has been represented that there has been wholesale evasion of the existing duty by false statements of values of imported articles, and consequently the imposition of a flat rate duty is necessary in order to enable the Revenue Commissioners to do their work properly.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that they have resulted in any increase in the price of boots and shoes.  On the contrary, I think the general public are commenting very favourably on the fact that a very high standard of quality has been secured by the Irish boot factories without any increase in price.  In fact, in some cases, there has been a reduction in price, due to various causes, since the duty was raised some few years ago.</P>

      <P>That is a long story. I have already explained to the Deputy that this is not a new duty.  There is no new tariff except on second-hand boots and shoes.  The effect of this Resolution is merely to codify the existing tariffs on boots and shoes which were imposed, over a number of years, on different classes of boots and shoes either by previous Finance Acts or by Emergency Orders.  They are all being simplified and brought down to six separate classes of boots and shoes subject to tariffs of varying amounts, but no change is being made.  There may be a necessity at some time in the future for a change in the tariffs on boots and shoes, but it is not being effected here and now.</P>

I put a question to the Minister, and I would like to have a more serious statement from him than merely to say that the prospects are excellent, particularly in view of the fact that we made some boots and shoes a few years ago.  The Minister is better at promising than, perhaps, at constructive work as regards the future of the bootmaking industry.  The rosiest picture he can paint of the position is that we are making 50 per cent. of our requirements. The fact that the other 50 per cent. has to be tariffed heavily results in a very large direct personal tax on people other than those engaged in the manufacture of boots and shoes.</P>

      <P>I do not want to speak in criticism of this.  I simply want to get information from the Minister.  The Minister has chosen this time to impose tariffs, and yet he tells us that these tariffs are to help industry.  In what was, to a large extent, a political pronouncement in Kilkenny yesterday, the Minister said that we are now making 50 per cent. of our requirements. That means that we have to pay high tariffs on the other 50 per cent. that we import.  That, I suggest, is a very big tax on the people of this State during a period of depression. It is a very easy thing to lend money at 2½ per cent., but you cannot borrow money at 2½ per cent. and throw it into factories to make boots.  We are told <Col N="1570" /> now that these factories, after two years, have not got beyond the point of being able to supply more than 50 per cent. of our requirements.  The people who have to pay a high tax on the other 50 per cent. that is imported cannot get a guaranteed market or a guaranteed price for their produce as the boot and shoe manufacturers can. They cannot get State money at 2½ per cent. to carry on their industry, nor can the State itself get money at that price.</P>

      <P>Not in yours, I hope; they would not fit me.  If ever I want to stand up in shoes I will stand up in a man's shoes not in yours.  There was a time when people, who knew something about this policy of protection, considered that protection was never to be put on any necessary article of consumption when that article was not produced in this country either in sufficient quantities, or in very nearly sufficient quantities, for the country's requirements.  To argue that it is helping industrial expansion to impose a tariff that after two years is only giving us 50 per cent. of our requirements is not using the tariff weapon to help industrial development or expansion.  It is only a tariff to help the Minister for Finance to get money.  It is a tax on the people during a period of depression, a tax at a time when those people are least able to bear it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask Deputies to look at the returns of customs duties in the year just ended.  These duties for the year ending the 31st March last were <Col N="1572" /> £1,500,000 more than was collected in the year ending 31st March, 1932.  And that, notwithstanding the fact that more goods were imported in the year 1931-32.  We have the fact that £1,500,000 more were handed to the Minister for Finance in customs duties in the last year. This money is taken from the people of the country in direct tax, and still we are only able to produce half of our requirements of this article.  It is no wonder then that the economic conditions and the economic credit of this country is at the low ebb at which it is.  Yet the Minister for Industry and Commerce can tell us that the position is rosy.  After two years of his big push and all that was built up before, all the Minister can boast of now is that we are producing 50 per cent. of our boots and shoes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing and I would not have mentioned it if it were not for the interruption of the Deputy sitting behind the Minister.  The only point that would require a business explanation is that the very theory and conception of protection is to help industry.  But the Minister is using that pretence to collect revenue and the only information he can give us is <Col N="1573" /> that the position is rosy.  That is not satisfactory.  There are many people in this House and particularly in the Party to which I belong who think that the Minister should not have the power to apply tariffs by order. Personally, I think he should, but I think he should use these powers very cautiously because if we are going to have a protective policy it should be efficient.  The Minister who is given those powers should use them cautiously, carefully and judiciously. He should employ them for the development of industry and not for the increase of revenue.</P>
      <P>I will be glad if the Minister will give us an indication of his industrial policy.  I am not speaking in any sense in hostile criticism.  I certainly cannot agree that applying prohibitive tariffs is the best method in this case. If we were near the margin, and if we were in the position that we could by a slightly increased effort produce all we want, then I would agree that the Minister would be justified in seeking the authority of this House for a prohibitive tariff but a prohibitive tariff is no good now, unless to put a prohibitive tax on the consumer.</P>

      <P>Give a little consideration to the men who are practically in their bare feet.  The Minister's explanation as to why he pursues this policy of tariffs, when we are so far <Col N="1574" /> from supplying our own requirements, is not satisfactory.  It has been given in a flippant manner.  He should give some indication to the House when this tax of 50 per cent. on our boots and shoes will cease.  It can only cease the day we are able to provide all our requirements.  The Minister should have some definite plan in mind.  This imposition is unjust when it is applied as a tax and not as a protective tariff.  If it were a protective tariff, and if we had people here producing 50 per cent. of what we import, it would help to take a considerable number off the dole, off unemployment assistance.  The people would have more spending power and there would be less of a waste on industrial production.  If the Minister has no plan in mind, then he is merely riding this policy of protection to death and there will be reactions. Those of us who believe in protection do not want reactions.  We want the programme to go on steadily until it reaches the goal we all visualise, the supplying of our entire requirements by Irish labour.  If you go too fast on that road it is probable you will sour people against the policy of protection. People will resent paying a direct tax during the periods of stress.  I hold we are at that period now.  I would like the Minister to give us some indication as to when he hopes we will be able to produce all our requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to assure the Minister in advance that I am heartily with him and the Government in their policy of developing our native industries.  If he makes any inquiries he will find that I have been a member of the Irish Industrial Development Association since its inception.  It is not the Minister's fault if he was not born soon enough, but I may as well as tell him that I have done a lot more than he has ever done in the interests of the Irish industrial movement.  I want to emphasise points made by Deputy Belton. Speaking some time ago at the annual dinner of the National Agricultural and Industrial Development Association held in Dublin, and responding to the toast of &ldquo;The Development of <Col N="1575" /> Irish Industry,&rdquo; the Minister for Industry and Commerce said, amongst other things:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every boot factory in the country is working to the maximum of its capacity, yet they have that substantial leeway to make up.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The leeway referred to there is that, notwithstanding all the development, &ldquo;we imported last year 445,000 dozen pairs of leather boots and shoes valued at £970,000.&rdquo;  I am interested in those tariffs in a double-barrelled way, so to speak.  I am interested to see that Irish capitalists who have the courage to invest in Irish industry will get a fair crack of the whip and will be encouraged to put more money into Irish Industry.  I am also interested in the welfare of the workers in those industries.  I am anxious that they will participate in any of the advantages to be brought about by an industrial revival.</P>
      <P>What do I find in relation to the boot factories?  We have the Minister making quite a true statement; but I wonder how much the factory owners are contributing towards building up the industry.  are they making the response that they should make?  Are they responding adequately in view of the very great measure of protection that they get?  I do not want to pass serious strictures on them in regard to their want of enterprise in not catering for the full requirements of our people. In the <i>Irish Independent</i> on the 12th April last a letter appeared arising out of the statement I have quoted from the Minister.  The letter was written by Mr. H. Dale, General Secretary of the Irish National Union of Boot, Shoe and Leather Workers, 33 Cook Street, Dublin.  He wrote:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Under the heading of &lsquo;The Minister on Boot Industry&rsquo; you state that the Minister, speaking at the annual dinner of the Free State boot manufacturers, said that there were 1,000 additional hands employed in the industry.  Where those are is a puzzle, as we don't know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Where those are is a puzzle, as we don't know, but we do know that at present there are about 30 fully skilled hands with from 12 to 30 years' knowledge of the industry signing up at the labour exchange, whilst half the factories in the Free State are full of boys at the smallest rate of wages.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Any responsible newspaper usually makes inquiries beforehand as to the <i>bona fides</i> of people who sign their names; and newspapers, as a rule, take jolly good care not to publish a letter with a <i>nom de plume</i> unless they know who the writer is. At any rate, that statement appeared and it has not been contradicted.  I have seen no contradication of it.  I want the Minister to understand that, and not to be so flurried and not to use the kind of argument he uses against me and other people who stand up to criticise in a fair way his policy and who want to help the industry. When I stand up to criticise the Minister's policy, I think he should not say that I am only speaking in the sense that, to quote his own words, &ldquo;any stick is good enough with which to beat Irish industry.&rdquo;  I have always stood for the development of Irish industry.</P>

      <P>It is not only lip sympathy so far as I am concerned. Here is what the Minister is up against. This industry has been heavily tariffed and every inducement is held out to our people to manufacture enough to fulfil our own requirements.  If the Minister thinks that the 50 per cent. he is putting on now will be an impetus to the industry and to the industrialists engaged in it, then, by all means, let us support it; but he has given no indication to the House or to the people that this is going to be the last word in this industry or in other industries. We know that there are hundreds of people unemployed in the ready-made clothing industry.  Here we have the boot industry.  If the Minister says that we can supply 100 per cent of our own requirements I will support him, because I have always stood for Irish manufacture, but he gets childish and flurried, and uses childish arguments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always looked with a certain amount of suspicion on the effects of the tariff policy of this Government.  Of course, I cannot claim to have anything like the intimate knowledge of the development of industry and of the conditions of the new industries that are being established that the Minister has or that anybody associated with the Ministry has.  I have made up my mind quite definitely, however, that this is one industry which, in my opinion, has justified the tariff policy of the present Government.  I believe that the tariff policy of the Government has been more justified in this industry than in other industries.  It is quite clear that the material which is available for sale in this country by the boot manufacturers is as good, and, in many cases, better than the imported article, and that the price has not been prohibitive or excessive so far as one can see.  The Minister, in the course of the past few days&mdash;I think it was yesterday&mdash;speaking at Kilkenny, said that we are now supplying 50 per cent, of the requirements of our people so far as boots are concerned, and that he hoped that shortly we would be able to supply 100 per cent, of our requirements.  Once you reach or pass that figure, however, it is almost certain that the firms that are sending boots into this country in competition with our own manufacturers will sell them at a price that is competitive to say the least of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know the name of the gentleman whom Deputy Anthony quoted, but I think it is known even to him that the conditions enjoyed by the people who work in these factories in the Free State are comparatively better than the conditions of those engaged in any other new industry established by this Government or their predecessors.  I could say a great deal about the rotten conditions of the workers in some of our clothing factories, and such employers require to be very carefully and closely watched by the present Government. Personally, I do not think that this country is going to gain a great deal by the establishment of industries that will provide labour for girls, if you <Col N="1579" /> like, under such conditions, and I am not going to congratulate this Government or any other Government on the establishment of any industries which will give additional employment to girl labour or woman labour if that labour is under un-Irish conditions. When I heard Deputy Anthony speaking I was wondering whether he was supporting this part of the Minister's policy.  So far as I am concerned, I want to make it quite clear&mdash;from examination of the conditions existing in the factories already established in this country&mdash;that I am whole-heartedly and without any qualification supporting the Minister in his policy in so far as he has helped, and in so far as he will help in the future, in the establishing of more boot factories in the country.  I look forward with confidence to the time when the Minister's policy will succeed in supplying the demands of our people so far as boots are concerned.  I think there is something in the suggestion, or insinuation, if you like, in Deputy Anthony's speech, that in some of these factories the owners are disposed, if they are allowed, to bring in semi-skilled labour to do what, in some cases, is regarded as the job of skilled workers.  Whether or not the Minister receives complaints of that kind, I hope that he will put his foot down on people who attempt to operate under those conditions.  This is an industry which has given a good deal of employment to male labour and, generally, most trade unions in the country would be in favour of it.</P>

Before coming to that, however, I should like to express disapproval of the particular line the Minister took in dealing with the letter which Deputy Anthony quoted.  Deputy Anthony read a letter from an official of a union giving that man's position.  The Minister's glib response to that was&mdash; did he know the individual personally, and did he know the Minister?</P>

      <P>I might reply along the same lines, and say that, knowing the Minister as well as I do, that is the reason I would not rely on anything that comes from the Minister's mouth, because time and again he has proved himself the most inaccurate and incautious spokesman that ever stood up from a Government front bench in this country.  Time and again the Minister has been caught out in inaccuracies and in statements that were not in accordance with the facts and figures.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is the last man that should challenge the <i>bona fides</i> of anyone who puts his name to paper. When the Minister is caught out here in the House, it is by word of mouth; but here is an official who signs his name, who is not afraid to put his name to paper, and because he is not personally known to Deputies, the Minister, in a left-handed way, insinuates that what he says is false. If it is false, the Minister, who has all the information and time at his disposal, can come back here at a later date and prove that the statement is inaccurate.  In the meantime, let him give fair-play to a person who has the courage to sign his name to the statements he makes.  We have heard the Minister's statement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may get an answer before he is finished.  There were people on this side of the House who advocated tariffs as a trial, and when tariffs were being tried by the late Government, at least we got figures and facts and finance from time to time, and not a mixture of fairy tales and Coueism.  There is no good in any perky Minister standing up to tell us that the outlook is rosy, that it is as bright as could be, and refusing time after time to give any figures with regard to the numbers of people employed, the conditions of labour or the rates of wages.  Tariffs are implements which every Government is more or less bound to use and equally bound to reckon up results as arising from experience, results in respect of numbers of people employed, wages paid by way of employment, financial infliction on the community and in respect of the community as a whole getting value for the imposition of the tariffs, and the increased price of the home product.  We have had tariffs on footwear for a certain number of years, altered from year to year and increased in the Minister's time, and behind that tariff wall we have certain factories growing up, certain employment given in those factories and certain wages paid in those factories. There is an income on the one hand from tariffs on the foreign goods coming into the country.  That is so much money, and the Minister is in a position to tell the House exactly what it is from year to year.  We have a certain increase in the price of the home commodity which can be calculated <Col N="1582" /> in terms of money too, and adding that to the income from tariffs, I want to know from the Minister what is the tariff income for the last two years.  What is the number of people employed and what are the wages paid to the people employed.  I am not a person to believe every tale I hear, but I hear tales, and I hear them from the Leader of the Labour Party with regard to conditions in our factories, and I think that no Deputy and nobody interested in the people of this country could stand for conditions if the conditions are anything like they are said to be in the tales we hear.  Deputy Norton, your own ally, referred to conditions in other industries as being baby-farming.</P>

      <P>The Minister instead of being in the Chair should be in the dock.  What I want from the Minister, and before this particular Resolution is passed, is the income from <Col N="1584" /> tariffs on footwear, let us say, in the 12 months ending 31st March, the amount of extra employment given during that 12 months, the amount of wages paid during that 12 months, and the conditions of labour during that 12 months, and what his Department reckons, during the same 12 months, was the increased cost to the community of the home produced article as against the cost before that.  The Minister has got to recognise that you can protect any industry and force production behind that protection&mdash;give a monopoly to the home market, if you like, behind that protected wall&mdash;but the justice of doing that has got to be gauged by the capacity of the public to pay the prices demanded.  With decreased incomes throughout the Twenty-Six Counties, with wages shrinking, and with the main industry of the country toppling, the capacity of the people to pay enhanced or increased prices is not there.  I believe there would have been a bright future, a rosy future, to use the Minister's own words, for something like a whole-hog tariff policy if it were not associated and linked up with the economic lunacy of the economic war.</P>

      <P>The position, as far as I can see, is simply that the Opposition stands for Irish industry, with a big &ldquo;but&rdquo; always inserted somewhere. If they want Irish industry to move forward in any respect whatever they ought to cease the type of speech that has been coming from the benches opposite.  The American nation was built up on tariffs.  The growth of the American nation was effected through the medium of tariffs.  This nation will probably grow through the medium of tariffs as well.  We do not want it to become a second American nation. None of us hopes for that; none of us would desire it, but we do want to see produced in this country the goods that the people require.  I would say it is about time that the people on the opposite side lost a little of their inferiority complex, and got down to helping the policy of the present Government rather than impeding it.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins began his last speech on this subject exactly as he began one here the other <Col N="1586" /> day&mdash;the usual abuse, the usual tirade against the Minister.  No accuracy, no importance, no hope or sign of anything that is good could be attributed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. He went on to say that this Government was not the first Government that discovered the virtues of and the need for tariffs.  We know that; neither were our predecessors the first people in this country who discovered the need for tariffs and preached the virtues of tariffs.  If the Minister for Industry and Commerce were allowed to carry on, as Deputy Traynor suggests, or if there were patriotism enough on those benches to enable him to secure the co-operation of this entire House, as Deputy Belton admitted a short time ago, he is on the right road. He is on the right road to make this country what it ought to be.  Surely to goodness, co-operation should be forthcoming from intelligent Deputies instead of abuse and the type of speeches we have got to listen to. Tariffs are tariffs.  Tariffs are imposed for the purpose of helping native industry.  That is what I always thought tariffs were.</P>

I am sure the Minister for Industry and Commerce will only be too glad to tell Deputy O'Higgins the amount of money that has been received by way of tariff on those articles.  Protection is a good thing.  It was the greatest principle preached by Arthur Griffith. I might quote a little extract from his pamphlet, &ldquo;Economic Salvation,&rdquo; published in 1914.  I would commend this to Deputies of this House.  It is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is by buying Irish manufactures and by manufacturing those goods for which there is a domestic market that the population can be retained, and this country can be prevented from degenerating into a cross between a grazing ranch and a workhouse.&rdquo;</P>

Deputy Traynor's contribution to the debate on this particular boot tariff was to accuse us of being consistently in opposition. Perhaps we are.

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been pretty near boots all the time.  The tariff on boots was one of the tariffs mentioned here the other day in reply to a question of Deputy Mulcahy's when we were trying to illustrate what particular items composed the £1,500,000 revenue which the Minister got beyond his expectations last year.  One of the items was boots.  There has been a tariff on boots for a considerable period before this Government came into office, as Deputy Donnelly was good enough to admit.  If there is a use in tariffs, if tariffs are going to set any industry on its feet, the boot and <Col N="1589" /> shoe industry is one that ought by this time to be fairly well on its feet.  Even before tariffs were imposed by the late Government we had boot and shoe factories in this country, in Cork, Carlow and elsewhere, manufacturing in competition with English, American and other manufacturers.  The late Government came to their aid with a tariff, believing that the industry would spread.  I believe that it has spread to a certain extent.  The main extension has been that the existing factories expanded and certain individuals enriched themselves at the expense of the community.  We have now arrived at a condition of affairs when the revenue from the tariff on boots and shoes has increased beyond the Minister's expectations.  It is generally held that if the revenue from a tariff continues to increase and bring in greater sums to the Exchequer it is a proof that the tariff has failed in its original purpose.  To me it seems anyhow that the increase during the last 12 months or so in the amount received from the tariffs is a matter that requires explanation.  World prices for boots and shoes have fallen. If there was only the ordinary import of boots and shoes the amount received from the tariff would not expand so much.  But we have an expanding revenue from the import of boots and kindred articles, even though prices have fallen.  That is a proof to me that the tariff has not altogether produced what it was intended to produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of this question of the tariff on boots and shoes.  At the present time, when people, prosperous and otherwise, from the exclusive section that the Minister for Finance referred to to-day to the very down-and-outs, try to provide themselves with boots or shoes, there are a number of people in the country who find it increasingly difficult to provide themselves with boots or shoes &mdash;in fact, there are some who go without either.  It is in that particular class that I am chiefly interested.  If this particular tariff had the effect of increasing employment to a tremendous extent, so far increasing it that it would make an inroad on the number <Col N="1590" /> unemployed without inflicting a terrible hardship on the remainder of the community, or even if it did inflict a certain amount of hardship on a particular section of the community, provided it produced the other result, it might be justified.  But, apparently, judging form the increasing revenue from it, it has not been justified.  I think the argument put forward by Deputy Donnelly could not be accepted by this House: that even if it only put six or eight men into employment it would be justified.  I do not think any member of the Labour Party would back the statement made by Deputy Donnelly that the imposition of a tariff on boots and shoes, which brought six or eight additional men or women into employment, even at the expense of an increase in the price of boots and shoes for every man, woman and child, would be justified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the extent of the increase?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the figures, but the Minsiter in reply to a question a day or two ago stated that boots and shoes were one of the articles from which the Minister got a portion of the £1,500,000 in excess of his expectations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not prove that prices have gone up at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>The proof that prices have gone up at home is that the tariff imposed on boots and shoes by the late Government, and increased by the present Government, has not been sufficient to keep boots and shoes from being imported from other countries. It is obvious, even to a blind man, that the manufacturers put up their prices to the extent of the tariff imposed, yet they have not reached the mark when they are self-supporting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Give us the figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know exactly the figure of the present tariff on boots and shoes, but there is a very high tariff.  If the Deputy takes off the amount of the tariff from the import price of the British goods he will see what the price of boots and shoes <Col N="1591" /> would be without the tariff.  There are no philanthropists amongst the boot and shoe manufacturers here. They are taking advantage of every halfpenny of the tariff that the Minister imposes.  This is one of the tariffs that I do not want to see extended.  No case can be made for the extension of it.  I should like to hear Deputy Davin justify this particular tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly the speeches I heard since I came into the House have not changed my opposition to any extension of this particular tariff.  I cannot see that the general public are reaping any fruitful results from it. In fact, all the evidence is the other way&mdash;that it is an imposition on the very class who can least afford it.  I do not think any extension whatever of this tax is desirable.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins said that he does not believe all the tales he hears round the country concerning the conditions in Irish factories in general, or in Irish boot factories in particular.  The fact that he does not believe the tales does not prevent him from repeating them.  He keeps these tales in continuous circulation by his own efforts both outside and inside the House and supports them by innuendoes and suggestions about unnamed females who get very low wages in some unnamed factory.  I want to make an appeal to Deputies opposite, if there is any value in making an appeal to them at any time, to stop for a little while slandering their own country and countrymen and the industries of this State.  It is an ill bird that fouls its own nest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputies opposite had any sincerity whatever behind <Col N="1592" /> their oft-professed desire to see industrial development here, they would give to Irish industry the assistance of their silence for at least a couple of years until somebody made an effort to do what they did not do during the ten years they were in control.  When I heard Deputy Anthony say that all his life he had worn Irish clothes and that he had been a member of Irish industrial associations, I knew that we were going to get a speech from him slandering Irish industries and industrialists. That is the orthodox beginning to all speeches attacking the policy of industrial development here, or the activities of Irish industrialists.</P>
      <P>We had the same orthodox beginning in Deputy Belton's speech.  He had always been a supporter of the policy of industrial development but&mdash;and then after the &ldquo;but&rdquo; we got the usual attack upon the industrial policy of the Government because it is going too fast and the usual innuendoes, suggestions and lying tales about conditions in Irish factories.  Deputy Anthony carefully cut out of a newspaper a letter written by somebody of whom he never heard, who described himself as secretary of a union that he did not know even existed.  He carefully carried it around in his pocket for a month so that he could base on it an attack on those engaged in an Irish industry and during the course of that month he made no effort to see if the allegations contained in that letter had any truth whatever in them.  He did not want to find out the truth.  He merely wanted to have a handful of mud to throw at those engaged in industrial enterprise in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We had Deputy Belton on the same lines.  The speech of Deputy O'Higgins was an answer to Deputy Belton because he mentioned that the tariff upon boots and shoes was initiated by our predecessors. Deputy Bennett forgets that also.  The tariff on boots and shoes was imposed by our predecessors in the year 1924.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It was imposed in 1924. Seven years after that tariff was imposed this Government came into office.  During the whole of that period, that tariff was bringing in revenue and nothing but revenue to the Exchequer of the State.  There was no protest during that time from Deputy Bennett.  There was no question down by Deputy O'Higgins. There were no elaborate theories by Deputy Belton.  At the end of seven years, seven long years during which that industry might have been developed, the industry succeeded in 1931 in supplying 12 per cent. of the requirements of this country in boots and shoes.  In 1931 its production was declining.  The tariff was imposed in 1924 and was imposed for revenue.  Certainly, if it had any protective design behind it, it failed in that.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins, I think it was, or Deputy Belton, said that this Government was getting more co-operation in its policy in relation to industry than our predecessors got from the Fianna Fáil Party when we were in Opposition. There was not a single Bill introduced into this Dáil, a single measure proposed here for development of the industrial possibilities of this country, that was not opposed by the Party opposite.  Of course, in Opposition they made the usual speeches about how long they had been associated with the industrial revival movement and they gave the usual demonstrations of lip sympathy but at the same time they flung out the usual slanders against Irish industry and in the end voted against the proposition. Deputy O'Higgins made a suggestion about child labour.  Deputy Bennett makes his attack upon the inability of the boot manufacturers to supply the requirements of the country.  Deputy Anthony makes his insinuations about the low wages and the bad conditions in the boot factories.</P>

I have been at the opening of a number of these factories, and at all of them the United Ireland Deputy present was bleating about how pleased he was to see that factory coming into existence and how much he agreed with the policy of the Government that brought it into existence. He did not tell the people working in the factory or the crowds present there that he voted against the measures which resulted in bringing these factories into existence.  He did not tell them that on every occasion on which the members of his Party could, they had slandered Irish industrialists, <Col N="1595" /> even the particular industrialist at the opening of whose factory he was present.</P>

      <P>Twelve per cent. of the requirements of the Free State was being supplied by home factories after seven years of the protective policy of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  I do not say that we are capable of supplying our full requirements at the present time, but I do say that we supplied 50 per cent. of them in 1933. That does not represent the uniform production during that period, but it represents a continuously increasing production during the period.  50 per cent. was the average for the year. We oppened a new factory in Kilkenny yesterday, and we hope to open other factories in the near future.  There has been a rate of progress in that industry which would seem almost incredible to anybody who, in 1931, had surveyed the development of seven years of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party's régime. I would ask Deputies opposite in all decency to stop making speeches about their interest in Irish industry.  I would ask Deputy Belton, in particular, to try to keep his mouth shut on that subject, because some day it will be necessary to tell the people the truth about the matter, and the truth is that every single measure introduced into this House to assist Irish industry was opposed by him.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan never did anything of the kind.  I put it to Deputy O'Higgins if what he says is true all he has to do is read some of the speeches Deputy McGilligan made, and to repeat them here.  That requires no mental effort on his part, and it will not give him a headche. In 1931, after seven years of Cumann na nGaedheal protection policy, the boot industry was able to supply only 12 per cent. of the requirements of this country in boots and leather. I say that in 1933, after one and a half years of Fianna Fáil policy, that industry supplied 50 per cent. of the requirements of this country.  I say that the number of concerns engaged and the persons employed in the industry have doubled during that period.  I say that <Col N="1597" /> over 1,000 additional hands have been placed in employment in the industry. That is no fairy tale.  That statement is based on the certified return submitted by a firm of chartered accountants that represents the Boot and Shoe Manufacturers' Association.  Deputy Anthony can take that statement, no matter what an unknown secretary of an unknown trade union may say to the contrary.  Development did not stop in 1933.  It is still going on.  The Deputies have evidence of that yesterday, and will have further evidence in the near future.  We are going to get to the position where 100 per cent. of our requirements will be supplied by Irish workers from Irish workshops. We will not stop there either.</P>

We will be told that we are running a baby farm; that we are paying sweated wages; that we are exploiting consumers, and we will have the speeches Deputy O'Higgins made about other factories.&rdquo;  Do you think anyone is going to go near Edenderry as long as Deputy O'Higgins has anything <Col N="1598" /> to do with it?  I want to put it to Deputies opposite who made speeches that it was revealed in these speeches that they knew nothing about this matter.  This is not a change of duty.  We are not imposing a new duty on boots and shoes.  This merely codifies the existing duties and simplifies the administration of the duties.  The only duty being imposed is that on second-hand boots and shoes.  That would have to be imposed in any case.

      <P>The Minister is aware that the granting of the rebate of 7d. originally resulted in driving out of existence here a tobacco manufacturing company which gave employment to 300 persons.  The 300 persons who were driven out of employment were described by the Minister for Industry and Commerce as &ldquo;casualties.&rdquo; He implied that they were casualties of the Irish industrial development movement.  We were given to understand, at that time, that this differentiation amongst tobacco manufacturing companies was necessary to assist Irish industry.  What circumstances have arisen as regards the establishment of a purely Irish manufacturing tobacco industry here to enable the Minister now to reduce the differential preference which he gave these companies?  I do not know whether the Minister has come up against difficulties with other tobacco manufacturing concerns in the country <Col N="1603" /> which are being prejudiced by this differntiation in taxation.  I should like to hear from the Minister his reasons for bringing about this change now.  Have the manufacturing industries which were given the assistance of this differential taxation been more firmly established so that they do not want this assistance as much as they did before?  Or is the position that other tobacco manufacturing establishments with a considerable number of employees are having their stable foundations in this country shaken by reason of the differential taxation?  When we take into consideration the effects which the Minister's former action had in throwing 300 persons out of employment&mdash; many of them are still out of employment in spite of the protestations and promises made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;it is due to the House that it should be explained whether or not this change is being made to avoid other casualties.  If that is not the fact, then the House would be glad to know that the manufacturing concerns that got the benefit of this differential taxation are more firmly established now than they were.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>When this tobacco duty was originally under consideration in 1932, the Minister, in the course of his examination as to the probable effect of the duties, came to the conclusion that, after nine years of Cumann na nGaedheal administration, the tobacco concerns owned and controlled by citizens and natives of the Saorstát were in such a position that it would be extremely hazardous to impose upon them an additional duty, that they had been faced with very fierce competition, competition of such a sort that those responsible for it had <Col N="1604" /> the temerity to tell tobacco retailers in this State that they should not display in their shop windows the goods of native concerns.  I say that the campaign was carried on to such an extent that certain concerns had the temerity to do this.  I know that that action outraged the sensibilities of many people in this country, not only supporters of Fianna Fáil, but members of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party as well.  Deputy O'Higgins raised the matter in this House and questioned the propriety of a campaign of that sort being allowed to go on. As a consequence of competitive methods of this kind, I say that Irish tobacco concerns were very badly shaken, were in such a position that I felt that if we were to impose the full weight of the duty upon them it was a question of whether some of them would not have to close down.  Therefore, since the imposition of the duty was inevitable, I had to consider whether I should not lighten the burden so as to enable them to remain in existence and, if possible, to gain in strength.  It was decided, in the special circumstances of this time, when we came into office and found no less than over £1,000,000 deficit left to us by our predecessors in the first year, and towards the next year, such a decline in the revenue that we found we would possibly be faced with a deficit of £3,000,000, that&mdash;as must be clear now to every right-minded person&mdash;we could not avoid additional taxation.  And the question was whether we were to impose that taxation upon concerns that might not be able to bear it.  We decided&mdash;and Deputy Mulcahy, who raised this question, does not now choose to listen, and does not want to hear what I have to say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was saying we had to impose taxation, and we were not going, in imposing that taxation, to act, as our predecessors had done, wholly regardless of the consequence of such taxation to Irish manufacturers. We granted this rebate. In granting it we made it quite clear what the circumstances were which made it necessary to take that course. We emphasised, time and again, when the matter was being made an issue in this House for Party purposes; that we were doing it not because we wanted this firm or that firm to leave the country, but because we wanted to make certain that Irish concerns, at any rate, were not going to go down, and that as soon as the position changed and we felt we were in the position to do so, the question of the rebate would be reconsidered.</P>

      <P>At any rate, they did not fulfil the essential conditions.  If they were only a Belfast firm why did the Deputy, when he was a member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, impose a tax against their goods manufactured in Belfast?  We did not impose any tax upon their goods manufactured here.  I had several interviews with the members of Gallaher's firm.  I endeavoured to convince them that the exemption which we were granting to Irish manufacturers was a temporary exemption.  I pointed out to them what I thought the position was.  I told them that in my view there was no reason, having examined the figures put before me, why they should close down here; at least, that it would not be necessary for them to close down here if we granted a rebate to the Irish manufacturers. But, apparently, Gallahers had other advisers.  There were some people anxious for a political catchery, who thought it necessary to be able to talk of casualties, and of factories closing <Col N="1606" /> down, and of people being thrown out of employment.  They did not care, so long as they made that point, whether they stampeded Gallahers or anyone else to close their doors, and to put workers out into the street.  All they were concerned about was to make a political point against us.  That was why Gallahers closed.  Gallahers closed because of the agitation carried on by Cumann na nGaedheal with the intention of stampeding them to close their doors.</P>

      <P>I do not say that Deputies opposite induced Gallahers to close down; I say that they stampeded them.  People were led to believe that this was going to be such a strong point against the Fianna Fáil Government which came into office in March, 1932, that they would be unable to stand up to the Opposition.  People were led to believe that Deputy Mulcahy, who was the Samson in this matter, was going to bring us down. Well the people who were induced to believe that have seen their mistake to-day.  We are revising this exemption, not because of any representations made to us from any quarter.  No tobacco interest has approached us in the matter.  We are revising the exemption because from the examination of the figures for the clearance of tobacco from bond, and an examination of the turnover by Irish tobacco concerns, we are satisfied that they can stand now upon their feet, and <Col N="1607" /> can bear the reduction in the rebate which we granted to them.</P>
      <P>We are satisfied that just as in the case of the boot and shoe industry the policy of the Government has been justified by results, so, too, in the case of the Irish tobacco industry the policy of the Government has been justified by results.  On the part of those manufacturers who have gone out, got busy and developed their industry there has been a phenomenal extension.</P>

In any event, what I said is true, that we are withdrawing this not because of any representation made to us, but because we feel now that Irish tobacco concerns are strong enough to bear a greater proportion of the tobacco duty than they were in March, 1932.  As I have said those concerns that have been conducted with energy and enterprise have experienced a phenomenal expansion. There have been one or two concerns that lay on their oars, and refused to do anything.  I do not know what their fate is to be in the future.  There is only one thing I have to say and it is this: that this Government and people have no use for any manufacturer in receipt of special facilities and privileges from the people of the country who fails to take advantage of them.  We do not care whether such a manufacturer closes his doors and folds his tent and departs like Gallahers.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Dáil agree with the Committee on Resolution No. 15.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1608" /> This is the Resolution which fixes the new Excise duty on Irish-grown tobacco.  In order to interest people who are farmers in the cultivation of tobacco, the Government decided during the last two years to free home-grown tobacco wholly from the burden of duty.  The success of that policy was beyond all our expectations, with the consequence that during the last six or seven months it has been necessary to further consider the matter, having regard first of all, to the necessity for introducing Irish tobacco to the public so that their tastes might be gradually accustomed to it and thereby the safety of the revenue from tobacco assured.  Owing to this we have had to reconsider the problem, and a new method has now been adopted which, briefly, consists of: (1) control of the growing, curing, importation and manufacture of tobacco and its exportation; (2) making it compulsory on manufacturers to purchase all marketable tobacco grown; (3) fixing an average price at which the tobacco will be so purchased; and (4) putting the imported and the home-grown leaf on a level as regards duty, due regard being had to the relative cost of production. It will be remembered that, in an announcement made by the Minister for Agriculture in March last the average price of the native tobacco was fixed at 1/3 per lb., the rate of Excise duty at 8/8 per lb., the Customs duty remaining at 9/4 per lb.  It is felt, however, that we might in this year permit of the price to be increased somewhat.  Accordingly, as was announced in the Budget statement, we are now proposing to fix a duty at such a rate as will permit the home-grown tobacco to realise an average price of 1/5 per lb.  This entails a reduction in the Customs duty to 8/6, and this Resolution proposes to make this reduction accordingly.</P>

      <P>I noticed that the Minister was not as fluent as he usually is when explaining this particular Resolution to the House. That, of course, is understandable, because the Government have had again to break the very definite promise made not only to the people of this country, but in particular to the last Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis by the Minister for Agriculture when he talked about growing 10,000 acres.  Perhaps the Minister for Finance does not remember that, or was not present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike many of the proposals which the Government have introduced for the development of industry and for making this country self-sufficient, the Minister's case in regard to this is that it was such an overwhelming success that he has had to reduce the price and to limit the acreage.  The real fact, of course, is that this Resolution has been introduced because the scheme was going to cost a certain amount of money.  If the old conditions were to be continued there was going to be a loss in duty. I think the Minister is not so much concerned about cultivating a taste for the use of Irish tobacco.  What are the facts?  The first is that there is going to be a very definite limitation of the quantity of tobacco which can be grown here, whether the growers pay full duty or not.  As a matter of fact, if the people of this country desired to grow tobacco and thought it feasible to do so, even at the full rate of duty, they are not to be allowed to do that by the present Government.  The Minister has admitted that the quantity of tobacco grown last year was beyond all expectations.  That was because the people were getting a fairly good price.  This year the proposal is that if all the conditions laid down are complied with, and the tobacco must be in first-class condition to comply with the conditions set out in the resolution, the maximum price paid will be 1/3.  The average would be about 1/-.  I am informed by those in my own county who grew tobacco last year, and who claim to know something <Col N="1610" /> about its cultivation, that it would be impossible to make tobacco-growing a paying proposition at 1/- or 1/3 per lb.  Apparently, that view has been borne in on the Ministry because the Minister has decided to increase the price to 1/5.</P>
      <P>Since the Minister made that announcement I have gone to the trouble of consulting people who are supposed to know something about this, and I am informed that even at 1/5 tobacco-growing is not going to be a paying proposition.  I suggest to the Minister that if the tobacco scheme here was meeting with the response alluded to, if there were so much of it being grown&mdash;I assume that unless the amount grown last year found a ready market that it was not going to be grown this year or next year&mdash; the Government would find it difficult to make a case for restricting the development of such an important industry except on the one plea, namely, loss of revenue.  I am doubtful if the Minister will put that point though, I admit, it is an important one, but loss of revenue would be a serious matter against the Minister's well-known urge for a self-sufficient country.</P>
      <P>There is another point that I want to make and it is this: the Minister who is primarily concerned in this, the Minister for Agriculture, if my information is correct, was asked before he made the announcement in March last to which the Minister for Finance has referred, to receive a deputation of the Tobacco Growers' Association.  He refused to do so.  He received a deputation from the Imperial Tobacco Company afterwards.  That is the information given to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>What Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture.  I said the Minister for Agriculture refused to receive a deputation from the Tobacco Growers' Association.  Subsequently within a couple of days he received a deputation from the Imperial Tobacco Company.  It was after that deputation had been received that the announcement was made by the Minister regarding the limitation of <Col N="1611" /> the acreage to be grown and regarding the duty which was to be imposed upon Irish grown tobacco.  That is the information with which I have been supplied by those interested in the tobacco growing industry in this country.  I would like to know from the Minister if that is so and I would like the Minister to explain to the House that it was in order to allow the people to acquire a taste for Irish-grown tobacco that this brake was put on the growing and manufacture of tobacco in this country.  It seems to me that unless the tobacco grown was treated by the Government in the way in which it had been treated up to this the farmers would not be able to find a ready market for it.</P>
      <P>Surely we ought to have some explanation as to why there are to be regulations whereby the 3/- per lb. obtained by the growers last year is to be reduced by more than 50 per cent.  In some cases there is more than 3/- per lb. given but I think 3/- per lb. would be the average last year. The Minister has not attempted to make a case why that sum should be reduced.  In a matter of great importance to the country the position should be made clear by the Minister, particularly in view of the fact that tobacco-growing gives a great deal of employment and a good return to those engaged in it.  The growing of tobacco so far as the farmers' part of the process goes entails a great deal of labour. Handling the crop entails a great deal of care and attention and the farmer is entitled to a good return for all the labour that the curing and handling of the crop entails.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to get from the Minister whether it is definitely settled that Irish tobacco growing will not be allowed to develop beyond the point now laid down in this Resolution and that this limitation of the acreage to be grown is going to be the last word in the matter.  It is a very important matter.  I freely admit that I have no practical knowledge of tobacco growing or tobacco curing myself&mdash;beyond seeing it growing&mdash;but I have gone to the trouble of consulting those who have grown it and handled it in Cashel <Col N="1612" /> and in other places.  If the Minister can give us now, or later on, on the Finance Bill when he has an opportunity of consulting his advisers a statement as to the policy of the Government on this matter it would be very important for the House to have it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>In extension of the line taken by Deputy Morrissey, I want to say that to me it sounds very peculiar that a Government which is carrying out a policy of self-sufficiency should limit the amount of Irish smokes we are to have.  It seems all the more peculiar in view of the little hesitation they have shown in imposing, under other Resolutions, very high tariffs.  When there was opposition by Deputies to the magnitude of some of these tariffs one Minister went into hysterics and told us that we should shut our mouths.  He was angry because we had dared to question whether it was good policy or good business in the carrying out of a particular policy, to impose high tariffs when the extent of home production of the commodity tariffed was only 50 per cent. of our requirements.  If shoemakers and bootmakers are to be protected to such a heavy extent why are not those same bootmakers and shoemakers made to smoke Irish tobacco and so give Irish agricultural workers a chance?  The fact that they are not shows the narrow city mind of the front bench opposite, and particularly the minds of the two Ministers concerned with those two Resolutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were told a couple of years ago that this country would be covered with the smoke of factory chimneys and with the smoke of Irish tobacco. We were told the tobacco growing was going to be a new departure in Irish agriculture.  It was nothing new to the people of this country to know that we could grow tobacco here. Some of us, Deputies, here had already grown it and smoked it.  It was altogether a question of the price to be paid the farmer for growing it.  In the words of the Minister for Finance, the Ministry have come in now and have had to make up for 20 years' want of experience.  I am afraid they will have to make up for more.  We <Col N="1613" /> gathered some time ago from the Minister that tobacco was to be grown to meet the requirements of the country, but the Government never set out on essential lines.  I have had experience of growing tobacco for some time.  I will not say how long, because the Minister for Finance might institute an inquiry.  I was speaking recently to one man who grew tobacco in Cavan, a man of much experience and travel.  He was interested in the culture of tobacco in many countries. I was speaking to another man who worked for a number of years in tobacco plantations in Australia. Like all cultivated crops, tobacco, as the Minister for Agriculture ought to know, is one that entails much employment. But giving the Irish people a taste for Irish tobacco and then after two years stopping the growth of it would put the people properly in the soup.  Tobacco was originally a farm weed, but when cultivated it becomes a cultivated crop.  Like every other plant, a strain has to be found suitable to our climate and with that strain a flavour should be found that would suit the palate of the people for whom its use is intended.  No effort has been made in that direction. We just get the haphazard policy of growing it one year and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In my opinion, tobacco cultivation here is not, and will not, be economic unless we pay the price by a large cut in the revenue.  That price was reduced to 1/3, but the Minister tells us now that it is going back to 1/5.  The growers will not get the subsidy that was given heretofore and consequently it is not going to be a paying proposition.  It should be a paying proposition for us just as it is in other countries, and we should want no special facilities any more than the people from whom we buy the imported leaf.  We are labouring under the disadvantage of not having the strain that would give us those results.  The Minister is, in effect, choking off the growing of tobacco by <Col N="1615" /> depriving the growers of the facilities that they had last year, and the continuance of which they were promised. We are in the position that the Minister is converted, I think wrongly, to a certain line of policy which will altimately end the growing of tobacco in this country unless the Minister learns a little more about it.</P>

      <P>I expect we shall be discussing this matter again on the Finance Bill.  I understand from a public statement made by the Minister for Agriculture that he is introducing legislation to deal with this matter. Therefore, it is not necessary to go into detail at the moment.  I regret very much that the Minister has seen fit to increase the duty.  He is, I am afraid, treating the tobacco growers worse than they were treated by the British Government.  In former years the British Government gave bounties and subsidies for the growing of tobacco which far exceeded any difference between the Excise duty which we had to pay on home-grown tobacco and the imported leaf.  However, all that can be discussed on the Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have protested almost continuously during the last seven or eight years since the late Government set up a Commission to investigate the question of tobacco growing, against the erratic policy adopted by the present Government and their predecessors.  Nothing is more likely to delay the development of tobacco growing than this constant chopping and changing in regard to the amount of duty imposed by the Government. I will urge on the Government once again to try to make up their minds as to what their policy will be, so that those who intend to go into the growing of tobacco may have a fair idea, not only for one season but for several seasons ahead, as to the prospects and the intentions of the Government.  The Government announcement was made this year at the very last moment when the question of planting tobacco was a matter of very vital importance.  The Government should have consideration for those who seriously intend to grow <Col N="1616" /> tobacco and they should have a policy which is likely to be carried on for a number of years and will not leave the unfortunate growers in a constant state of doubt as to what their prospects will be.</P>

      <P>The excuse the Minister makes now is that they must wait until the people cultivate a taste for Irish tobacco.  The real reason in my opinion is because of a possible loss of revenue to the State.  Last year we grew 750 acres of tobacco and the Revenue Commissioners declared that there was a heavy loss in revenue.  If the policy of the Minister for Agriculture were persisted in and if we grew 10,000 acres it would mean a loss of revenue to the extent of £5,500,000.  Is not that the real reason why the Government does not continue their policy in relation to tobacco?  They ought to be honest with the people. The time will come when the subsidy cannot be found.  There are a great many people in my constituency who cannot grow potatoes and it is unfair to compel these people to make up subsidies for people who have got good land.</P>

      <P>On the general question some two years ago a general proposal was introduced by the then Government to allow Irish tobacco to be grown free of duty, or practically free of duty.  In last year's Finance Bill there were two rates specified in the Schedule to be charged in respect of home-grown tobacco.  One was at the rate of 5/6 per lb. for tobacco grown before 1st January, 1934.  After that date the price was at the rate of 6/8.  Now the proposal is to have it at the rate of 8/6 per lb.  The rebate, if my recollection is correct, was at the rate of 5/6 per lb. during the first year &mdash;or was there any duty at all the first year?</P>

They were almost invited to grow sufficient tobacco for all our needs if the tastes of the people were in agreement with the tobacco that would be grown.  There was considerable activity in connection with the growing of tobacco.  It is an industry that entails considerable costs.  In certain cases people put up small sheds or drying houses, or other things of that sort, and I am informed by one grower in the County Wexford that some people spent £200 or £300 and, in some cases, up to £1,000, in the expectation that the growing of tobacco was going to be one of the industries of this country or, at least, an arm of our industrial activity, whichever you like to call it.  In the second year the duty was raised from zero to 5/6.  In the third year it was raised to 6/8, and in the fourth year to 8/6.  That is rather a steep rise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1618" /> The question which the Government ought to consider definitely is, what is their own policy with regard to this question of the growing of tobacco? This afternoon we had before us a proposal to put an extra income tax, or what amounted to an extra income tax, upon certain people.  Those people were called and styled by the the Minister a privileged class.  Some of those who are not growing tobacco in the country and who did not grow it in the first year or the second year might be inclined to regard the growers of the first year as a privileged class in this instance.  Those people who went to considerable expense&mdash; whatever class they belong to, whether privileged or otherwise&mdash;ought not to have these small sheds or drying houses, or other institutions of that sort left on their hands at a loss by reason of having banked upon the Government's promise, or undertaking, that this industry, or this development, of agricultural industry was going to go on.  It appears to me that what the Government should do is to take particular cases, or to take the whole case if they wish, of those who have engaged in this industry from the beginning, make up the cost of the employment given in the growing of the tobacco, the value of the tobacco grown and the cost of the State, and see whether or not it is an economic proposition.</P>
    <P>When I examined those papers some ten years ago in connection with the growing of Irish tobacco, my recollection is that it would have paid the State, if it had agreed to give every person engaged in the production of tobacco £1 per week and let them off rather than give the rebates which they were asked&mdash;that the loss to the Exchequer would have been much less than the loss of £1 per week, per person.  I should like to know whether or not this question has been examined from the point of view of its useful economy.  Is there going to be in the Government policy a limitation in respect of the acreage grown?  Has the Government given any advice to people as to the particular seeds to be grown?  Have they given time to people to get the necessary seeds and <Col N="1619" /> have they given them time to acquire the necessary information with regard to planting?  As I say, the grower from Wexford, who approached me in March last, informed me that unless information were available to people immediately, the period for planting would be too late.  While it is quite true that there is nothing in this motion respecting the acreage, the fact is that there are terms in it which are almost equivalent to that, where the Resolution refers to &ldquo;Tobacco which is grown in Saorstát Eireann and which is not shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners to have been grown before the 1st day of January, 1934,&rdquo; and so on.</P>

      <P>I will tell you, Sir. In March last, when questioning the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture on this subject, I learned that it was customary for the Revenue Commissioners to provide a licence, or at least that it was a condition that the Revenue Commissioners should indicate their willingness to provide a licence, when such legislation was passed, in order to qualify people for these terms to be shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners.  The licence, or the equivalent of the licence, is a condition precedent to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It was stated at that time that there were provisional licences.  The Minister stated, in reply to me, that several of these provisional licences had been issued.  I <Col N="1620" /> stated that this grower had applied for the licence and had not got it.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Agriculture deals with the growing of tobacco, which is within his province. I have already prevented Deputy Belton from pursuing the line that the Leader of the Opposition is now following. The Deputy has not shown to the satisfaction of the Chair that the reference covers the granting of licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to proceed to do that now, Sir.  It will not suit to deliver the tobacco in November or December next to the Revenue Commissioners. They must be informed beforehand of its growth and the place where it is grown.  That was one of the reasons why the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Agriculture mentioned those licences or provisional licences.  However, the question has not a very important bearing on what I am referring to.  The fact is that licences were mentioned and it raises the question as to whether or not a certain limited quantity of tobacco is going to be allowed to be grown.  If that is so, the sooner an announcement to that effect is made the better it will be, because it is not fair to allow people to engage in the growing of tobacco if, subsequently, the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners will not be expressed in their regard. I can see no other reasons for the employment of these terms in that particular Resolution.  The few points that I mentioned were, first, is it an economic proposition, and the Government has certainly got sufficient information and sufficient figures at its disposal to show whether it is or not; secondly, that it was more successful than they anticipated is shown by the fact that they have gradually increased the duty on tobacco; and, thirdly, that <Col N="1621" /> it is now at the point where the people consider it is scarcely worth their while growing it.  That is one of the reasons why I propose to divide the House on this Resolution.</P>

      <P>It is all tobacco, anyway, and I will not be very long.  I just want to bring under the notice of the Minister for Finance the peculiar position of a man in my constituency. I am sure the Minister and a good many of the Deputies have got sheaves of correspondence in connection with the problem.  This man, as I am aware, owing to the Government's promise that 10,000 acres of tobacco would be grown in the Saorstát, when approached by farmers with a view to his making provision for the necessary amount of plant for them, in order to oblige the farmers, so he says, and I suppose to oblige himself, embarked upon this expenditure necessary to provide the necessary plants for the farmers.  He grew a certain number of acres, and I am now informed that he has got the plants but has nobody to take them from him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know anything about the duty, but duty or no duty, he seems to be in a very bad way.  In view of the restricted acreage which is now allowed, the least the Minister for Finance ought to do is to see that that man, who was put to considerable expense, is compensated in some manner for the disappointment he has suffered by reason of Government policy.  He took the words of Ministers at their face value that so many plants would be required and he set about growing them.  Although I do not know much about the growing of tobacco, I understand that it is a very slow process and it is necessary to nurse the plants more tenderly than one would nurse a baby.  Now, this man finds that he cannot sell them at <Col N="1622" /> all.  I desire to put his position before the Minister, as we are on the subject of tobacco, and I hope the Minister will see his way to recompense him for the loss he has been put to.  Now, I was not long.</P>

      <P>There was no undertaking given that we would encourage the growth of 10,000 acres of tobacco this year.  What we did say was that we should induce the people to take an interest in the cultivation of tobacco, that we would offer them substanial inducements to do that and that when they had satisfied themselves that they could grow it at a minimum of cost to themselves, that their land was suitable for growing it and that they could produce saleable tobacco, we would ensure that there would be an expanding market for that tobacco up to the point at which all the needs of our people with regard to tobacco would be met.  It is necessary to make that clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear!  It is very clear now.  It is about as clear as mud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that it is necessary to make that clear because once it is understood, I think a large part of the loose and ill-founded talk which we have listened to in this debate will not be repeated.  I am rather sorry that I should have to deal with some of the speeches in this way.  I would rather deal with speeches such as that made by the Leader of the Opposition which, although its arguments, too, were vitiated by a number of errors, did present a case in a reasonable way. It is quite true that people were enticed to grow tobacco and the reason why it was necessary to entice them was that, during the ten years which preceded our advent to office, there had been a continuous discouragement manifested by the former Government towards the cultivation of tobacco in this country.  The former British Government had offered certain inducements to our farmers to cultivate tobacco and one of the first acts of the preceding Administration was to withdraw those inducements altogether and to create the impression in <Col N="1624" /> this country that tobacco could not be grown here and that any tobacco that was grown was unsmokeable. Consequently, about this whole question of tobacco, there existed a feeling of prejudice which extended even to the farmers themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was manifested by the fact that even though we did offer substantial inducements in the first year by allowing tobacco to be grown duty free, very few people availed themselves of it in the first year.  In the second year, there was a remarkable increase and people began to consider it seriously and those who did take it seriously made very substantial profits indeed.  Deputy Cosgrave referred to the hardship imposed upon people by the fact that some of them had invested money in drying sheds and other necessary appurtenances to the cultivation of tobacco.  He said that in one case the amount was, I think, £200 and in another case £1,000.  I cannot accept those figures without having an opportunity of verifying them for myself, because I do not know of any case in which for the cultivation of an acre or two acres of tobacco it would be necessary to incur such a substantial expenditure.  If one person did expend £200 in providing drying sheds we must assume that he went in for the cultivation of the crop upon a somewhat extended scale.  If he did, we must also assume that he had some prior experience of it, and that, therefore, he was able to produce a crop which would be saleable at a fair price.  The fact is that there are people in this country who, out of one acre of tobacco, have secured as much as a net profit of over £200.  If the grower to whom the Leader of the Opposition referred was an experienced grower and a prudent man&mdash;no prudent man would invest £200 or £1,000 unless he was certain of getting a return&mdash;he must out of the profits of two years' tobacco crop have cleared any capital expenditure which he undertook, and he is now in a position to cultivate tobacco with the assurance that all his overhead charges have been wiped out by the profits of the first two years, and that he will be able to sell his crop, <Col N="1625" /> if it is a marketable one at all, at a remunerative price.</P>
    <P>It is true that quite a large number of people went in for tobacco growing, but securing the cultivation of the crop is only one part of our problem; we have to ensure its sale.  While I know of numerous cases where very substantial prices have been secured for home-grown tobacco, I know also that there are other cases where tobacco was not sold at all, for the reason that the crop was of such poor quality that no manufacturer would purchase it.  One of the innovations in the new scheme is that we propose to secure for the person who grows marketable tobacco a real market for his crop.  He will no longer be in the to secure for the person who grows marketable tobacco a real market for his crop.  He will no longer be in the position in which he was in the old British days when he got a rebate of duty if he grew tobacco, but the tobacco might lie on his hands for years, and he might never be able to dispose of it.  Under our scheme, he will get such a rebate in the duty as will enable him to reap a secure profit from his crop&mdash;I put the profit in some cases at almost as much as 1/- a lb.&mdash;if he produces a smokeable article at all, as the manufacturers will be compelled to take that crop from him.  That is where this proposal which is now before the House represents a real advance upon the proposals of last year.  Under the proposals of last year tobacco was grown free.  Large quantities of tobacco were produced, most of which we believe will be sold fairly readily, but some of which will not be sold at all.  This year, under the scheme which we are now considering, any tobacco which is produced and which <Col N="1626" /> is smokeable will have to be disposed of.  Every year the acreage under tobacco will be extended, until the 10,000 acres are reached.  The concession in this year in respect of the tobacco duty here is going to cost us £70,000.  That is a very substantial subsidy indeed to the Irish tobacco grower.  Next year it will cost us more, and so on, until, as I say, we have 10,000 acres of marketable tobacco grown in this country, able to bear, I hope, a reasonable duty to produce the revenue which will enable us to provide for the numerous Government services, including the social services in which Deputy Morrissey and others are so greatly interested.  I regret to hear that Deputy Cosgrave proposes to divide the House on this Resolution.  Possibly that may be due to the fact that I did not make it sufficiently clear, though I did mention it in my introductory remarks, that one of the features of this scheme would be the compulsion which it would impose on manufacturers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Dáil agree with the Committee in Financial Resolution No. 16.&rdquo;  This is the Resolution which exempts all outdoor games and sports from entertainments duty as from the 10th May of this year.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make briefly a plea which I made to the Minister last year with regard to greyhounds. The Minister gave us a very small concession last year.  I want to point out to the House that this is one of, if not the only outdoor sport, which now has to pay tax.  I want to repeat just a few of the statements which I made last year with regard to greyhound racing.  The first matter I should like to impress on the House is that greyhounds are largely bred and reared by small farmers and labourers and that in many cases they bring in a fairly considerable revenue to small farmers and labourers in the rural parts of Ireland.  Again, I think it might be said, and said with a great deal of truth, that greyhound racing is the poor man's sport.  It is sport in the real sense of the word.  It might also be said that the greyhound racing tracks are, so to speak, the show grounds for the dogs.  The Minister knows quite well that greyhounds have been sold within the last few years in this country at prices ranging from £20 to as much as £1,200 and £1,400 each.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1629" /> I grant you that the number of dogs that will be sold at £1,000 is not many, but a great number of dogs have been sold at handsome prices as many members of the House know.  Some members on both sides of the House know a great deal more about the matter than I do and have personal experience of it.  I know members of the House who have themselves got very substantial prices for greyhounds. The first preliminary to the sale of a dog is that he must, so to speak, be able to show his paces and be timed. I have not the figures by me at the moment, but speaking from recollection I think I was able to show the House last year that, prior to the start of what is called the economic war, the value of greyhounds exported from this country amounted to as much as £500,000.  The Minister I think was not prepared to admit the accuracy of that figure, but the figure which I quoted was the figure which had been given and which was submitted to the Minister's Department by the Irish Greyhound Club or at least&mdash;I forget the exact title at the moment&mdash;the body in charge of the Greyhound Stud Book in this country.  I am satisfied from the information which was supplied to me that that figure is approximately correct.  I also quoted last year prices which had been obtained for individual greyhounds and I gave the names of these greyhounds and the places at which they were sold.</P>
    <P>The real point I want to stress in this matter is that greyhound racing is a clean, outdoor sport.  It is essentially a poor man's sport, and I want to submit that it is not a sport that should be taxed, particularly in view of the fact, as I have already stated, that the Minister has remitted the tax on practically all other forms of outdoor sport, the only other exception being horse racing.  I am not quite sure whether the tax on horse racing remains.  I do not think it does.  I think the Minister has remitted that also.  I should like to hear from the Minister the case for the retention of the tax on greyhound racing.  I do not exactly know what it would cost the revenue to remit the tax in full, but I do not think <Col N="1630" /> it would be very great.  I think the Minister ought to meet the House in the matter.  I am satisfied that if there were a free vote on this matter, the tax would be remitted.  Seeing, as I say, that it is practically the only outdoor sport that is being penalised in this way, I think if the Minister cannot see his way to a remission of the tax, he might at least consider leaving the question to a free vote of the House, that is, unless it is going to make a very great difference to the revenue and I do not suppose it is.  I do not want to repeat all the arguments I put forward last year.  I think the Minister knows the various points much better than I do because they were submitted to him by the representatives of the Greyhound Association.</P>

      <P>I should like to second Deputy Morrissey's appeal in regard to the remission of this tax on greyhound racing.  As Deputy Morrissey pointed out, this is now the only form of outdoor sport on which the tax remains. Deputy Morrissey referred to greyhound racing as the poor man's amusement. I should like to go further and say that it is not alone the poor man's amusement, but that it is the only way of exhibiting what is the product of the poor man's only industry, as far as livestock racing is concerned.  It is essential to the poor man because just as horse racing is indispensable for the sale and exhibition of racehorses, modern greyhound racing has become indispensable to the breeder of greyhounds in this country for the sale and exhibition of his dogs.  As an example of what greyhound racing has done in that respect, I might mention that it has been recently stated as a fact that the two best greyhounds in the world were produced in Ireland.  If it had not been for the chance afforded of exhibiting these greyhounds on racing tracks in this country, they would probably never have been known or heard of.  Apart from its affording an exhibition place for the breeders of greyhounds, I can class greyhound racing, as Deputy Morrissey did, as the amusement mainly of the poor man.  I do not very often attend racing tracks, but whenever I did, I observed it was the poorer class mainly who attended <Col N="1631" /> these fixtures.  They are mainly, as far as my experience goes, interested in the breeding of greyhounds.</P>
      <P>I will admit that people other than greyhound breeders attend these races and that they are impelled by the gambling instinct that is natural to all of us.  It is that particular attraction perhaps that helps to swell the attendance there, but if it were not for the large attendance, the racing could not continue and no opportunity would be afforded the poor man to exhibit his dogs.  Anything that will help this industry is to be lauded.  We have had considerable debate on various resolutions brought before the House to help industries. The remission of the tax on this particular industry will certainly help a live-stock industry which is mainly in the hands of the poorer people of the State.  I would ask the Minister carefully to bear in mind what Deputy Morrissey has stated, all of which I very wholeheartedly commend to him.</P>

      <P>I should like to impress upon the Minister the absolute necessity of relieving greyhound racing of any tax.  I do so especially, because I am aware that in provincial towns those who are promoting this racing find great difficulty in carrying on.  It might surprise a good many people to know that, although I live within 12 miles of a greyhound racing track in my own constituency, I have never been there yet.</P>

      <P>I do know this much about it, however, that there are 40 people engaged in various ways in the industry in that particular town.  I know that the promoters find it very difficult to keep it going at the present time.  Mind you, I do not associate greyhound racing very much with sport.  I would say it is more of a business than a sport in so far as the people connected with it&mdash;the small farmers, labourers and everybody else who breed dogs&mdash;have only these places to exhibit their dogs in the hope of getting a remunerative price for them.  I know it confers great benefit on the town I mentioned. <Col N="1632" /> As everyone seems to be sympathetic when an effort is made to deal with the unemployment problem, it is well to mention that a good many people are employed in this business, and I am sure it would not be the desire of the Minister or of any Deputy to do anything that would injure that employment.  As the tax has been taken off horse racing and most other outdoor sports and amusements, I see no reason why an exception should be made in the case of greyhound racing. I am sure the Minister will agree that it is the unanimous voice of the House that he should accede to the request to allow this sport to be carried on without being taxed.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to leave this form of sport, greyhound racing and open coursing, free of tax.  In winter there is open coursing at which young dogs are tried out.  It is a form of sport that is enjoyed by large numbers of people who cannot follow more expensive forms of amusement.  In summer greyhound racing is a popular form of sport.  It is much cheaper than horse racing, and it caters for people who are in a small way financially.  In villages in which there were two or three dogs five or six years ago, there are now 15 or 16 greyhounds, so that it is a promising industry.  All these dogs have a value and this form of sport means a good deal for people who follow it.  Where there are race tracks amusement is provided in the evenings for followers of these dogs. That is the case in the West of Ireland and in Galway where there are events on two evenings a week.  In the interests of those who derive pleasure from this sport and in the interest of business, I ask the Minister to relieve it from this tax.  The same people are to be seen at open coursing as are seen on racing tracks in the summer.</P>

      <P>Everything that could be said in support of the appeal for the exclusion of greyhound racing from this tax has been said.  I put it to the Minister that he should discriminate between open coursing meetings, which are annual fixtures in different districts and got up by public subscriptions <Col N="1633" /> from persons who patronise them and other gatherings.  People should not be called upon to put their hands in their pockets again by paying taxes in order to keep local events going. The same thing applies to local horse-racing, where it is an annual event. The Minister might discriminate between what are voluntary or local events and commercial events.  The latter are carried on as a business, and if they are of such a nature as would appeal from the revenue raising point of view, perhaps a raid might be made upon them.  Local events that are not run on commercial lines should be exempt from this tax.  That applies particularly to coursing matches and local point-to-point race meetings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I feel that most of them are almost completely exempt from tax, thanks to the concession given last year.  It was a very substantial concession, and cost us a good deal of money, so much, in any event, that we could not contemplate extending it this year.  In this discussion <Col N="1634" /> we have been told that this was the poor man's only way of exhibiting his greyhound.  I suppose at least 70 per cent. of the tracks pay no tax, or very little tax, so that, so far as they are concerned, and so far as any track within any reasonable distance of Deputy Bennett's constituency is concerned there is no barrier placed in the way of the poor man who wishes to exhibit greyhounds on tracks.  As for the other tracks, they are mainly those which are making substantial profits.  Notwithstanding the imposition of the entertainments tax the attendance at any of them has not appreciably diminished.  In view of that fact, I would like Deputies, when this matter comes to be debated again, to show me how the tax is preventing the poor man from exhibiting greyhounds.  The meetings that are being held are more numerous than ever, the same stakes are being offered, and owners continued to run dogs at them in considerable numbers.  Any poor man with dogs worth exhibiting is certainly not debarred from exhibiting them by this tax.  The problem Deputies ought to address themselves to is: if we remit this tax, and give a further concession, how are we going to make up for the loss of revenue? Deputies cannot come to the House and say that if this were left to a free vote they are sure the concession would be carried unanimously, as also would a proposal to do away with the entertainments tax altogether. There is not a single proposal, in this or any other Budget, that would not be rejected with the same unanimity if it were left to the free vote of the House, because Deputies who vote in that way could vote in quite an irresponsible manner. It is quite easy to get up here and to make speeches asking us to forego revenue, but it is a much more difficult and unpopular thing to tell us how to make up the revenue which we forego.</P>

As I have said, the greater portion of this revenue comes from the tracks in the big cities, where there is considerable <Col N="1635" /> attendance at the greyhound racing, where there has been no noticeable decrease in that attendance consequent on the imposition of the tax and where, once more, substantial profits are being made or should be made.  I think that there is less ground for granting a concession of this sort in the present year than there is for granting other concessions.  There are many other things which I should like to do in the Budget&mdash;things which, I think, would commend themselves to a much larger proportion of the population than this concession would.  We are not able to do these things for the simple reason that we have to make ends meet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The changes made by this Resolution are easily explained. Reference No. 1 imposes a minimum duty of 2d. on Rosaries.  That is designed to make good the protection given to the industry a number of years ago, which protection has been undermined by the importation of very cheap products from certain Continental countries.  Reference Nos. 2 and 3 are consequential on the duty imposed by Resolution No. 4 in respect of fruits imported in syrup. Reference No. 4 effects a reduction in the duty on component parts of pianos.  That is designed to encourage the assembling of pianos in the Saorstát.  Reference No. 5 makes glue and size subject to the package tax. In a subsequent Resolution the duty imposed upon glue and size, as such, is repealed.  That duty was imposed in 1932 in the hope that it would be possible to revive the glue-manufacturing industry, which formerly existed here.  The industry was, in the main, dependent on export markets, particularly certain Continental markets.  It has not been found possible to regain entry to these markets, and the prospects of restoring the industry at present <Col N="1636" /> appear to be remote.  The operation of the duty did encourage a minor industry in the packing of glue and size imported in bulk.  The effect of this reference will be to maintain that packing industry, even though the prospects of securing the re-establishment of the main industry are not so good.</P>
      <P>As regards reference No. 6, paragraph (a) is really a minor definition for the purpose of clarifying the meaning of &ldquo;stationery.&rdquo;  Paragraph (b) extends the scope of the duty on stationery to the articles mentioned there.  Certain classes of post cards were previously liable to duty as photographic prints, but they are now being exempted from that duty.  The articles which now become dutiable for the first time are being produced in sufficient quantity and variety to meet the Saorstát demand.  Paragraph (c) increases the duty by abolishing the preferential rate on manuscript books, which are also being manufactured in the Saorstát in sufficient quantity and variety to meet the total demand.  Reference No. 7 effects no change, save in so far as it confirms the duty upon compression joints and couplings imposed by Emergency Order some time ago, following the establishment of the industry in the Saorstát. As regards reference No. 8, paragraph (a) reduces from 1/- to 9d. the exemption limit in respect of wooden toys. Previously, toys value 1/- or under were exempt from duty.  There has been some development of the wooden toy industry and some evasion of the duty.  It is proposed to facilitate one and prevent the other by reducing the exemption limit from 1/- to 9d.</P>

      <P>By reduction of the price so as to come within the exemption limit.  Paragraph (b) cancels the duty on riddles, sieves and containers for paper and twine which are being reimposed by Resolution 4.  Paragraph (c) extends the duty by bringing in handles and sections of handles for chimney or sewer scrapers.  That is being done mainly because handles for tools, brushes and so forth, which were dutiable, sometimes escaped duty by <Col N="1637" /> being consigned as these other articles. To prevent that evasion of duty, the definition is being extended.  Bungs, plugs, spiles and shives for casks or barrels are also being made subject to duty.</P>
      <P>Reference No. 9 increases the rate of duty upon dried eggs from 6d. to 9d. Reference No. 10 increases the duty from 6d. per lb. to 9d. per lb. on vegetable soups and preparations consisting mainly of vegetables.  Reference No. 11 is merely consequential on the rearrangement of the duty on fire extinguishers and other articles.  Reference No. 12 is designed to make all imports of cherries preserved in water or raw liable to duty regardless of the period of importation and to extend the period in which preserved or raw strawberries become liable to duty.  The changes effected by this Resolution are of a minor nature and most of them are consequential on the Resolution already passed.</P>

      <P>Section 1 of the Finance Act, 1894, provides for estate duty being charged on all property &ldquo;which passes on the death&rdquo; of a person dying after the 1st August, 1894.  Section 2 (1) provides that property passing on the death of the deceased shall be deemed to include <i>inter alia</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(d)  Any annuity or other interest purchased or provided by the deceased, either by himself alone or in concert or by arrangement with any other person, to the extent of the beneficial interest accruing or <Col N="1638" /> arising by survivorship or otherwise on the death of the deceased.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The object of this sub-section is to prevent a person enabling his estate to avoid payment of estate duty by subtracting from his means during life, monies or money's worth, which, when he dies, are to reappear in the form of a beneficial interest accruing or arising on his death.  The commonest types of case which come within the scope of the sub-section are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  cases of annuities in favour of the widow and/or children of a deceased person which are payable by certain institutions e.g. some of the banks and in respect of which contributions have been made by the deceased in his lifetime;</P>
    <P>(b)  policies of assurance included in a marriage settlement which have been taken out by the deceased on his life and on which he pays the premiums and the moneys payable in respect of which pass to his widow on his death under the trusts of the marriage settlement;</P>
    <P>(c)  cases in which a person transfers securities to trustees to be held on trust for his children during his life in such shares as he directs and in which the securities are to be divided amongst the children on his death in such shares as he directs and in default in certain specified shares.</P>
    <P>In a case of the last-named type which came before the House of Lords recently, in England, the British Estate Duty Office claimed estate duty under the provisions of Section 1 of the Finance Act, 1894, on the entire of the securities which passed to the children on the deceased's death. The House of Lords held that the securities did not pass under Section 1 at all&mdash;they having effectively passed on the execution of the deed&mdash; but they held that under sub-section 2 (1), paragraph (d), the beneficial interest of each child in the settled funds, to the extent to which the principal value of such interest on the death of the deceased exceeded the actual value, if any, of the expectant beneficial interest of each <Col N="1639" /> child before such death, was an interest accruing or arising on his death and was, therefore, liable to estate duty under sub-section (2) 1, paragraph (d). The effect of this decision is that, in assessing estate duty, an allowance must be made against the value of the securities of the value of the expectant beneficial interest of each child and duty taken only on the value after making such allowance.  A Resolution drafted so as to have retrospective effect has been passed by the House of Commons in England prohibiting the making of any such allowance in cases of the kind.</P>
    <P>As regards cases coming within (a) above, while they are fairly numerous the amount of duty involved is not large.  Cases within (b) are more common and substantial amounts of duty are involved.  A typical example would be where A, having insured his life for £1,000 and, on the occasion of his marriage, having assigned the policy to the trustees of his marriage settlement and having covenanted to pay the premiums thereon directed that the trustees should receive the moneys payable under the policy on his death and pay them over to his widow absolutely or hold them on trust for her for life and on her death divide them amongst the children of the marriage.  The policy moneys would be liable to estate duty under sub-section 2 (1), paragraph (d), but, if, as is anticipated, the courts here took the same view as the House of Lords, the parties would have to be given an allowance for the value of the widow's expectant interest in these moneys.</P>
    <P>The contention put forward on behalf of the taxpayer in the English case has never been put forward in Saorstát Eireann up to the present, and the Resolution merely provides for maintaining the existing practice.  As I say, no such case has arisen but we wish to take time by the forelock.</P>

If there is a <Col N="1640" /> transfer made by a person to trustees for his children though the transfer was made in the lifetime of the person does it mean that when he dies the duties would be charged upon the stock so transferred.</P>

Cases such as that in which a person transfers securities to trustees to be held in trust for his children during his life in such shares as he directs to be divided among his children on his death in such shares as he may direct are liable. If that is the point the Deputy is making it has always been the case here and always was the case in England up to the decision given by the House of Lords to which I have referred.  Property of that sort was always liable to death duties.  That was never challenged here in our courts.  It was challenged in Great Britain and a decision to a certain effect was given.  We wish to ensure that the existing law&mdash;the law as it was always understood to be here shall remain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Dáil agree with the Committee in the said Resolution.&rdquo;  It will be remembered that Section 26, Part III, of the Finance Act, 1931, was designed to check the loss of estate duty in the case of &ldquo;settled property,&rdquo; that is to say property in which the holder has a life interest only, transferred to a &ldquo;private&rdquo; company under such conditions that the property does not &ldquo;pass&rdquo; on the death of the life tenant; but, at the same time, the life tenant has not, in fact, divested himself wholly of an interest in it or an equivalent thereof. Possibly I might explain this better by an example.  Property settled on A for life, passes to B finally on A's death.  A and B form a private company, to which they both transfer their respective interests.  A receives from the company an annuity virtually equal to his present income from the property and practically all the shares in the company are allotted to B. <Col N="1641" /> Before the 1931 Finance Act became law the property in such a case did not &ldquo;pass&rdquo; on A's death and no estate duty was payable accordingly.  Section 26 of that Act provided that where property in which the deceased had an estate or interest limited to cease at his death had been transferred by the deceased and the person interested in the remainder or reversion to or for the benefit of a company to which the section applied, such property should be deemed to &ldquo;pass&rdquo; on the death of the life tenant and so become liable to estate duty, subject to certain conditions prescribed by the section&mdash;with which conditions we are not interfering.</P>
      <P>Cases involving a very large amount of duty have recently arisen in which only the life tenant and an expectant life tenant have transferred their interests to a company, the ultimate remainder man not having transferred his interest.  In these the property was settled on A for life, to pass on his death to B for life, and on B's death to C, the ultimate remainder man, who did not transfer his interest to the company, so that a continuous chain of evasion might be constituted.  We have been advised that in such cases the revenue claim for duty could not be pursued with any reasonable chance of success under the existing legislation, the view being taken that it is only where the whole property, inclusive of all interests&mdash;inclusive not merely of A and B's interests, but of C's interest and of the interest of any other person who might succeed to an interest in the estate&mdash;has been transferred to a company that Section 26 of the 1931 Act becomes operative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of duty lost in cases of this kind may be very large.  Furthermore, it would be possible, as I have indicated, to effect arrangements with a view to further and continuous legal evasion in the future.  It is, therefore, intended to legislate as in this Resolution to stop evasion of that kind.  The effect of the Resolution will be to provide that where the estate or interest of the deceased in any property limited to cease at his death&mdash;that is on the death of the life tenant&mdash;and the estate or interest in such property of the person entitled <Col N="1642" /> expectantly on the death of the deceased limited to cease at the death of such person (the expectant life tenant) are transferred to a company the property shall, subject to certain conditions, be deemed for the purposes of estate duty to pass on the death of the deceased.  That is to say that where there are only one or two interests or more of the existing interests&mdash;in short whether or not all the interests are transferred to this company&mdash;the property will be deemed to pass at the death of the person who has a first interest or, subsequently, of a person who has any remaining interest in turn on his death, and so that the property will be made subject to estate duty as if passed in the ordinary way.</P>

      <P>That so much of sub-section (4) of Section 26 of the Finance Act, 1931, as requires the duty or any part thereof to be repaid by the company to the executor shall not apply where property is, by virtue only of the extension of the said Section 26 indicated in the foregoing paragraph of this Resolution, deemed for the purposes of estate duty to pass on the death</P>
      <P>This is necessary because in the type of case to which I have referred the company will not have any control over the property itself.  It will only have the life interest in the property, and therefore it could not be compelled to repay to the executor the duty on the property if such duty has been paid by the executor as it would have no means of raising the duty out of the property.  In the normal case, however, where the duty is paid by the company it is given express power by sub-section (4) of Section 26 of the Finance Act of 1931 to raise the amount of it out of the property by means of a charge or otherwise.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Dáil agree with the Committee in Resolution No. 21.&rdquo;  There is another type of case to which Section 1 of the Finance Act of 1931 applies in which the danger of loss of duty arises: that is to say, where A, a life tenant, receives payment not out of the funds of the company, but from some other source&mdash; for instance, directly from B, the remainder man.  It is thought that as the section stands at present the words &ldquo;by such company&rdquo; and &ldquo;from the company&rdquo; where they occur in paragraph (c) and paragraph (d) (iii), respectively, might make it possible for an evasion of the sort to which I have referred to take place &mdash;that is, that the payment would not be received by the company but, in fact, would be made by some other person having an ultimate interest in the estate, and that therefore because of that they might be able to evade the section.  The alteration proposed in the Resolution is designed to ensure that where the payment received by the life tenant is, in fact, part of the same transaction as that whereby the property is transferred to the company that the estate will be deemed to pass on death in exactly the same way as before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Dáil agree with the Committee in said Resolution.&rdquo;  This Resolution <Col N="1644" /> is designed to ensure that all the powers of the former Commissioners of Inland Revenue and the former Commissioners of Customs and Excise in relation to taxation were effectively transferred to the Revenue Commissioners in 1923. The Resolution also remedies a defect in paragraph 13 of the Revenue Commissioners' Order of 1923 which was intended to enable one Commissioner to act for the Board, but which did not fully effect its purpose.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the House is familiar with the circumstances which attended the transfer to the members of the Revenue Commissioners of the functions of the Commissioners of Customs and Excise and of the Inland Revenue Commissioners in 1923.  These functions were transferred, or at least it was intended to transfer them by Order No. 2 of 1923.  This order, the Revenue Commissioners Order (No. 2 of 1923) provided amongst other things as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;A Board of Commissioners to be called and known as the Revenue Commissioners is hereby established to exercise in Saorstát Eireann (a) all the functions which were on the 6th day of December, 1921, exercisable in the area now comprised in Saorstát Eireann by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue, and (b) all the functions which were on the 6th day of December, 1921, exercisable in the area now comprised in Saorstát Eireann by the Commissioners of Customs and Excise.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Paragraph 8 of the same order provided that &ldquo;All the jurisdictions, powers and duties which on the 6th day of December, 1921, were conferred or imposed by law on the Commissioners of Customs and Excise, are hereby respectively conferred and imposed on the Revenue Commissioners.&rdquo;  Owing, it is understood, to a clerical error in copying, the words providing for the express transfer of the powers of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue were omitted from this paragraph.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph 8 of the Inland Revenue (Adaptation of Taxing Acts Order) (No. 4 of 1923) provided as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;All the jurisdictions, powers and duties which on the 6th day of December, 1921, were conferred or imposed by law <Col N="1645" /> on the Commissioners of Inland Revenue are hereby respectively conferred and imposed on the Revenue Commissioners.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Some doubts, however, have been raised as to whether the powers and duties were effectively transferred, and it is considered better to put the matter beyond doubt by express legislation. Paragraph (1) of the Resolution is designed accordingly.  Paragraph (1) recites that all the jurisdictions, powers and duties which were on the 6th December, 1921, vested in, exercisable by or incumbent on the Commissioners of Inland Revenue in relation to taxes and duties placed under their care and management or the Commissioners of Customs and Excise in relation to taxes and duties placed under their care and management became and were, on the 21st day of February, 1923, vested in, exercisable by, or incumbent on the Revenue Commissioners.  That, in fact, is merely to copper-fasten the procedure which existed up to the present. When these arrangements were made they were made rather hurriedly.  The words providing for the transfer of the jurisdictions, powers and duties of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue were omitted from paragraph 8 of the Revenue Commissioners Order, 1923.</P>
    <P>When the Revenue Commissioners were constituted arrangements were made that a board of three commissioners should take over and discharge all the duties previously discharged by two boards, each consisting of five commissioners.  It was realised at the time that with only three commissioners it would, in practice, be impossible to arrange that two should always be in attendance and the following paragraph was therefore inserted in the Revenue Commissioners Order (paragraph 13):&mdash;</P>
    <P>In every case in which any order, decision, instrument or document is required by law to be signed by or to be under the hand of two or more Commissioners of Inland Revenue it shall be sufficient if such order, decision, instrument or document is signed by one Revenue Commissioner.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 16 contains similar provisions as regards powers previously <Col N="1646" /> exercised by the Board of Customs and Excise.  It was intended by means of these paragraphs to provide that one commissioner could act on behalf of the board or in effect constitute a quorum of the board.  There was nothing particularly unusual in the provision.  Section 2 of the Inland Revenue Regulation Act of 1890 enables the Board of Inland Revenue in England, consisting of five commissioners, to act by any two of their number and two commissioners constitute a board.</P>
    <P>In a case recently before the courts it was held that assessments to excess profits duty made by one commissioner were not valid.  Broadly speaking, the court decided that paragraph 13 of the Revenue Commissioners Order merely provided for orders or documents being signed by one commissioner but did not enable the formal acts of the Revenue Commissioners to be done by one commissioner.  I should like at this stage to say that this is not intended to validate any of the assessments which were quashed by the court.  That is clear from the terms of the Resolution.  Furthermore, no attempt has been made since the date of the High Court decision to enforce payment of any excess profits duty assessment which had been made by one commissioner and in which duty was outstanding at the date of that decision.  Where it was necessary to proceed on an assessment, that is, where settlement by agreement was not promptly reached, the original assessments were vacated and fresh assessments were made and signed by two commissioners. Numbers of formal acts required to be done by the commissioners, such as prescribing forms, ordering proceedings, etc., have been done by one commissioner, during the last 11 years and it is necessary to validate these acts.  It is also considered necessary to validate excess profits assessments on which duty had been paid before the court decision mentioned above was given, so as to prevent taxpayers attempting to claim repayment of such duty.</P>
    <P>On the general principle involved in the Resolution, it should be borne in <Col N="1647" /> mind that assessments by the Revenue Commissioners are subject to appeal; and that the Government that was in power in 1929 legislated to enable income tax assessments to be made not by the Revenue Commissioners, but by the inspector of taxes acting alone and to enable appeals to be heard by one special commissioner, that is, appeals from the assessments of such inspector of taxes.  What was reasonable in the case of income tax is equally reasonable in the case of excess profits duty.  That is the purport of the Resolution now before the House.  The provisions are in fact designed to validate a practice which has prevailed for the past 11 years and to repair, where necessary, or where necessary to remedy the effects of the omission of certain words which it is understood, owing to a clerical error in copying, were omitted from the original Order of 1923.</P>

      <P>There is a point arising out of paragraph 3 of this Resolution.  I understood from the Minister that assessments that were made by one commissioner in respect of profits were not enforced, but that new assessments were made.  On the Resolution as it stands at the moment paragraph 3 provides for the validation of the first assessments, so that you will have double assessments if this legislation goes through as it is drafted at the moment.  I do not know that you can have double assessments of that nature.  It may be an interesting case for some of us in court.</P>

The clause proposed to be added to the Bill is intended to provide additional machinery to enable a planning authority to get the necessary particulars of the various interests in property to which either a scheme proposed to be made or a scheme already in force will relate.

    <P>This amendment is substituted for an amendment proposed on Report Stage. A planning authority may declare that planning authority may declare that any contravention of a special prohibition in respect of any work proposed to be undertaken before the coming into operation of a planning scheme shall be unlawful.  Should the work be proceeded with, every person who does so shall be guilty of an offence under the section now proposed and be liable on summary conviction to the penalties therein contained.  This power is without prejudice to any civil remedy, and the planning authority, or any other person interested, may seek an injunction.</P>

      <P>There is just one point I should like to mention in reference to amendment No. 26.  The amendment proposes to delete certain words and to put certain other words in their stead.  The question arises in my mind whether the first word &ldquo;or&rdquo; should or should not be &ldquo;on.&rdquo;  As it stands at the present moment the paragraph would read:&mdash;&ldquo;Prohibiting, restricting, or controlling, either generally or in particular places, the exhibition, whether on the ground, on any structure, or any temporary erection, on any vehicle, boat or other movable object...&rdquo; I do not know whether having the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; there <Col N="1658" /> before the words &ldquo;any temporary erection&rdquo; instead of the word &ldquo;on&rdquo; might mean that the Act may prejudice the position with regard to advertisements on a boat.  I do not know if it makes any difference, but perhaps the Minister would say whether the section, as proposed to be amended, would actually give powers to control advertisements put on a boat no matter in what circumstances, temporary or otherwise, the structure was affixed to the boat.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £205,191 be granted to complete the <Col N="1660" /> sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1935, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health in connection with the Administration of the National Health Insurance Acts, 1911 to 1933, and for sundry Contributions and Grants, including certain Grants-in-Aid in respect of the Cost of Benefits and Expenses of Administration under the said Acts.</P>
    <P>The total Estimate of £307,787 compares with £305,084 for the preceding year, the increase being attributable mainly to an apparent increased estimate for salaries and to an increase in State grant.  The increased Estimate for salaries is, however, due to the fact that on the introduction of the Supplementary Estimate in January last the Estimate for 1933-34 was reduced by £4,305 principally through reduction in bonus and salary cuts.  In reality the Estimate for salaries for this year is less by £806 than the original Estimate for last year.  The increase in State grant is due to increased expenditure on benefits and to the increased number of contributions which, it is estimated, will be paid in 1934.  There has been a steady increase in the annual contribution income of the Health Insurance Fund, which in 1933 is estimated to have reached £602,000.</P>
    <P>The expenditure on benefits has, however, also increased and in 1933 is estimated to be £760,969.  The average number of persons in receipt of benefits weekly through the year was 26,000.  Complaints by insured persons against their treatment by Approved societies number about 120 a week only, that is, one dissatisfied benefit claimant out of every 220.  Under the provisions of the National Health Insurance Act, 1929, during the 11 months ending February, 1934, sums totalling over £400 were recovered for insured persons by the Department from employers in respect of benefits lost through neglect to pay contributions. The number of medical certificates issued in 1933 was 1,338,828.  The accumulated funds forming the assets <Col N="1661" /> of National Health Insurance amounted to £3,551,780 at the end of 1933, indicating an increase of £50,390 during the year.  As the annual income derived from dividends and interest, however, is £135,970 it is evident that the income from other sources, i.e., contribution and State Grant is about £85,500 short of the expenditure.</P>
    <P>The National Health Insurance Act, 1933, made provision for the Unification of Approved Societies.  The Minister appointed three members of the staff of the Department of Local Government and Public Health to be the Provisional Committee and Trustees of the Unified Society.  The Committee are proceeding with the work of unification which will be completed within three years of the passing of the Act of 1933.  On the 1st January, 1934, 14 approved societies, with a total membership of 157,000 were transferred to the Unified Society.  Another batch of societies consisting of approximately 123,000 members will be transferred as at the 30th June, 1934.  The dates of transfer <Col N="1662" /> of the remaining societies have not yet been fixed.</P>
    <P>The staff of the Unified Society is recruited as far as possible from the staffs of the Transferred and Untransferred Societies.  The majority of the staff at present employed have been appointed on a probationary basis. Permanent appointments are restricted until there has been a complete survey of all existing staffs so that the mere fact that a particular society has not been transferred will in no way prejudice the prospects of any member of the staff of that society.  Members of the probationary staff who were previously employees of approved societies and who will not eventually be placed on the permanent staff of the Unified Society will be entitled to compensation. So far, a sum of £25,229 has been paid in compensation to the indoor staffs of Transferred Societies.</P>
