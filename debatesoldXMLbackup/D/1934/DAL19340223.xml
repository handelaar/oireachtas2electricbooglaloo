      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that the proposals which are to be embodied in <Col N="2120" /> this Bill would be quite clean from the long title, and I am surprised that any Deputy should see fit to oppose this Bill getting to a stage where the proposals, as set out, could be made clear to the House.  We are all aware that there have been, for many months past, grave breaches of the peace throughout the country.  Hardly a day passes in this House that the Ministry is not approached by Deputies opposite with regard to those breaches of the peace. We assert that those breaches of the peace are associated, and closely associated, with what we call militarisation in politics.  To end those evils we are introducing this Bill.  The objects of this Bill are to preserve the peace and to maintain order in the country; to assist, as far as this Bill can assist us, in attaining those objects.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is to be observed, first of all, that the Minister was extremely reluctant to make this explanatory introduction.  Eventually, however, he thought it well to overcome his reluctance, and, having heard what the Standing Orders were, Deputies opposite know that I was within my rights in raising the point that I raised.  The Minister states that this Bill is being introduced with a view to preserving order.  The long title discloses a perfectly innocent description of what the measure is, but the newspaper placards this morning give an entirely different complexion to the measure.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the President, last night, in informing the Whip of this Party about a new Bill to be introduced, said that it was a Bill dealing with the Blue Shirts.  There is no mention of the Blue Shirts in the long title of the Bill, but the organ of the Ministry has a placard this morning which reads &ldquo;Ban on Blue Shirts&rdquo; and the <i>Irish Times</i> has &ldquo;Blue Shirts to be Banned.&rdquo; So that, while the Minister has not committed himself to a single observation regarding the regulations as to the shirts we are to wear or the blouses the women are to year in the future the Parliamentary Secretary to the President was much more candid with <Col N="2121" /> the House in regard to them.  The Minister says that it is for the purpose of preserving order.  Within the last fortnight we have listened to and read very weighty pronouncements from the Hicrarchy on that subject.  We have also read of a perfectly orderly procession of Blue Shirts being attacked in the streets of one of the important cities in this country, and that they did not break their ranks or commit any overt act, and that they did nothing to disturb the peace.  The Minister says that that is to be banned altogether, but the blackguards and ruffians of the country can attack and interfere with individuals who choose to wear a particular type of shirt, which is inoffensive, and which is in perfect, traditional, national accord with our history and in close association with the most revered and venerated memory of our patron Saint &mdash;St. Patrick's blue&mdash;and that is objected to&mdash;<i>(Interruption).</i>  And that is a matter for joking among Deputies opposite.  There is no gainsaying, however, what I have already stated that public attention has been directed towards breaches of public order and that the Hierarchy have stated that people have the right to express their political opinions.  That is, a perfectly lawful political organisation and it has a right which may not be in any way <Col N="2122" /> interfered with by the Ministry or even by this Oireachtas because it is a God-given right to the dignity of liberty which has been a right of the people of this country for at least 12 years. Therefore, I oppose this measure.  I oppose it, in the first place, because it is a negation of what the Minister has stated; in the second place, because it is against what we have heard in the last fortnight from the Hierarchy; and, in the third place, because it is an attempt to interfere with the liberty of this country.</P>

      <P>The purpose of that long title was to create an impression in the public mind that the purpose of the Bill was to preserve public peace, but when we take up the Government official organ, which is controlled by the President, we find in heavy leaded type that the true title of the Bill, the confidential title of the Bill, is &ldquo;A Ban on Blue Shirts.&rdquo;  That is the real name of this Bill.  I say this, that it is a prostitution of the powers of this House to introduce a Bill with a false title.</P>

      <P>I was concerned with the fact that the custodian of the rights of members of this House occupies that Chair; that that is the authority in this House&mdash;not the Government, not Parties, not combinations of Parties, but the occupant of the Chair for the time being.  He alone can measure any restriction upon statements that are made in this House.  No other person has got the right to take on himself any authority in regard to interference with, stoppage or other restriction of statements made.  There is no means of keeping order in this Dáil except by that means.  In the heat of discussion, when words are being bandied and so on, it may so happen that people will lose their tempers.  It is inadvisable; it is certainly wrong for Ministers, and, perhaps, on reflection the Minister for Industry and Commerce will reconsider what he said.  There are other places for making statements if one wishes to make them, but not here, not in any way in disrespect of the Chair, and I submit that above all persons in this House Ministers ought to bow before the Chair.  It is upon them to give example in that respect, and I mention that, sir, for the purpose of emphasising that point here in this House.</P>

      <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1934, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including the Rates Advisory Committee and sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed to ask the Dáil to vote a Supplementary Estimate of £10 for the Department of Industry and Commerce. The amount required, in fact, is £8,754, but savings on other subheads are estimated, and the total additional amount required is £10. There are two main purposes for which this money is required.  The first is the establishment in Saorstát Eireann of an industrial research council. Within recent years rapid progress has been made in other countries in the encouragement and organisation of industrial research.  In some cases <Col N="2135" /> special departments of State have been established, and in others the work is centred in the Department of Trade and Commerce.  There is, however, in this country, no co-ordinated effort to direct the scientific investigation of industrial problems.  A few of the larger concerns maintain their own research establishment, and the Royal Dublin Society, the universities and the county councils have taken some practical interest in the encouragement of work of that nature.  There is, however, no central body charged with the responsibility of co-ordinating the results of those various efforts.  Under the estimate for miscellaneous expenses, there is a provision of £650 for research grants to students, but I understand that scientific industrial research is not undertaken by students who receive those grants.  In some countries, such as Canada, research work in connection with industrial problems is conducted by the same organisation that carries out research work for the improvement of agricultural conditions.  It is not intended here, however, to interfere with the existing practice by which certain sums borne on the Vote for the Department of Agriculture are utilised for research work in connection with agriculture.  The industrial problems of this State make it necessary that an intelligently planned system of industrial research must be initiated, and must form a definite part of the Government's programme.  Under ordinary circumstances the cost of such research work would be borne by those engaged in industrial enterprise, but in existing conditions in the Saorstát it is regarded as inevitable that the Government should take the initiative and should provide from public funds the expenditure involved.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to set up an industrial research council, composed of persons who, because of their association with the universities or with industry, are in a position to bring specialised knowledge to bear upon the country's problems, to act in an advisory capacity to the Government and direct certain activities which I will outline. The research council will be financed <Col N="2136" /> by an annual vote in the Dáil.  We have invited certain persons to act upon the council and have received their assent.  Membership of the council is honorary.  Those who become members will receive only necessary travelling and incidental expenses in connection with the work of the council. We have asked Mr. Laurence J. Kettle to act as chairman, and the membership will include the following:&mdash;Dr. Kenneth Bailey, Professor J. Bayley Butler, Professor Lillon, John J. Dowling, Esq., M.A., of University College, Dublin; Dr. Drumm, D. Feighery, Sir John P. Griffith, Professor Hackett, Mr. T. Hallissey, Dr. H. Kennedy, Dr. T.A. McLoughlin, Mr. T.J. Monaghan, Professor John J. Nolan, Professor T.J. Nolan, Mr. Thomas O'Keeffe Kinsella, Mr. John O'Neill, Professor A. O'Rahilly, Professor O'Reilly, Professor Pierce Purcell, Professor Rickworth, Miss Phyllis Ryan, Professor Taylor and Comdt. J.F. Kinneen, of the Department of Defence.  The council will have a permanent secretary, a small staff, and a library.  The secretary and the staff will be recruited from the existing service. The functions of the council will relate to the following activities: first of all, intelligence; the study and recording of the results of scientific industrial investigation in other countries and their bearing upon Saorstát industries, and the bringing to the attention of the Government and interested industrial parties of the results of such investigations as appear to have a direct bearing on the industrial situation in the Saorstát; secondly, special investigations; that is arranging for the carrying out of special investigations either at the request of the Government or on the initiative of the council, directed to the development of Saorstát resources; a specialised study of the more extensive use of native materials in the home industries, and the making of reports following these investigations; also the organisation of research work in connection with the establishment of new industries or the extension of existing industries in the Saorstát and research work in connection with the improvement of technical <Col N="2137" /> processes and methods of production. In addition, it is proposed to have the council advise the Government on the granting of financial assistance to Saorstát inventors, whose investigations appear to the council to be likely to have beneficial national results.  In addition to these activities, the council will arrange, at the request of particular industrialists and, subject to payment by them, for the carrying out of particular investigations into the utilisation of waste products, improvements of technical processes and so forth.  It is proposed also to secure the advice of this council upon the most effective method of utilising the money provided under the Miscellaneous Vote for research scholarships.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that the total annual cost of the council will not exceed £5,500, including £1,000 for the secretariat; £1,000 for records, including a technical library; £2,500 for special investigations; £500 for aids to inventors, and £500 travelling expenses to members of the Council.  The amount which we can provide for industrial research work is, of course, very small in comparison with the huge sums spent on similar work in other countries, but we are satisfied that it is desirable to start the establishment of any such research organisation on a small scale, and that, even when started on that small scale, it will be possible for it to do very useful work in the co-ordination of efforts at present being made and in pursuing, with a view to commercial exploitation, certain investigations which have been undertaken in recent years on the initiative of individuals associated either with the Universities or with particular industries.</P>
    <P>The second main item covered by this Vote is the provision of £8,000 in connection with the production of industrial alcohol in the Saorstát.  Some time ago the Government adverted to the fact that in a large number of continental countries, legislation required the compulsory admixture with petrol offered for sale for transport purposes of industrial alcohol produced within those countries.  Having regard to that fact, we examined the possibility and <Col N="2138" /> the advisability of initiating the production of industrial alcohol here, with a view to its utilisation in a similar manner.  These investigations, while they brought in a considerable amount of information, were not, however, in any sense, conclusive.  Industrial alcohol is made, or can be made, from a number of agricultural products&mdash; from beet, from potatoes, from cereals, and it can also be made from peat. There can be no question that it is possible for us to grow in this country the products from which the alcohol is made and the processes of distillation, as practised in other countries are, of course, well beyond the experimental stage.  Our problem did not relate to the possibility of growing the products or the utilisation of the processes, but to the extent to which these could be done in this country with anything like the same efficiency and the same cost as elsewhere.  It was decided finally that we should undertake, under Government auspices, and not in any sense as a commercial proposition, an experimental development.  It was provisionally fixed that that experimental development should take the form of the establishment, in a particular part of the country, of a number of small distilleries utilising potatoes as their raw material and producing about 120,000 gallons of industrial alcohol in the year and centring around a central refinery to which the spirit produced in the distilleries would be brought for the finishing processes.</P>
    <P>It is clear, of course, that a development upon that scale alone will not involve any substantial dislocation in the petrol business, nor will it involve any very great heavy expenditure.  The annual consumption of petrol in this country is about 40 million gallons and the total production of alcohol from this experimental development, taking into account the quantity of it that might be sold for industrial processes in the ordinary way, and for which industrial alcohol is now imported, would not exceed 500,000 or 600,000 gallons, or slightly less than 2 per cent. of the petrol used for fuel purposes.  In so far as we have been able to arrive at conclusive estimates, the cost of erecting the five small distilleries <Col N="2139" /> and the central refinery should not exceed £100,000 and may be less.  The distilleries would utilise approximately 25,000 tons of potatoes in the course of the campaign.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>25,000 tons for each distillery?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, a total of 25,000 tons.  There is some difficulty in ascertaining what would be found to be the average starch content of different varieties of potatoes.  It is obvious that the higher the starch content of the variety of potatoes used, the more economic the production of alcohol becomes.  Our calculations were made on the basis of an 18 per cent. starch content, but those who have been advising us believe that it will be possible to introduce and secure the development of potatoes with a starch content of 21 or 22 per cent.  Our calculations were also based on a price for potatoes of 35/- per ton.  It is true, Deputies will say, that potatoes are at present selling at a higher price than that, but, having regard to the fact that prolific varieties can be utilised, and that everything that is taken out of the ground can be utilised in the distilleries, we are informed by those who are in a position to express an opinion, and I have been personally informed by a number of individual farmers, whom I have consulted, that at 35/- a ton, potatoes produced and sold under such a system would pay the farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed that the amount required for the construction of distilleries should be provided by vote in the Dáil and the distilleries will be erected by the Minister for Industry and Commerce or through a committee acting on his behalf.  It will, of course, be necessary to introduce legislation at a later stage, if the distilleries are constructed, to enable them to be operated, because the Minister for Industry and Commerce without such legislation could not engage in the business of trading in alcohol.  It is also proposed that for a period, at any rate, the by-product of the alcohol which is a cattle feed of considerable value should be purchased from the <Col N="2140" /> distilleries at a commercial price by the Government and distributed to the farmers for use in cattle feeding.</P>
    <P>One of the matters upon which we want to get information and for which this experiment was initiated is the extent to which it will be possible to secure a commercial market for the by-products of the distillery.  There are 90 gallons of this by-product for every ten gallons of alcohol.  In a number of European countries where grass is scarce these distilleries are operated for the production of cattle food with alcohol as a by-product.  This cattle food is supposed to have considerable value.  Whether it would be possible to secure a sale for it in a manner which will prove remunerative must be sought afterwards because the by-product is of most value when fed hot to the cattle.  That involves the organisation of a system by which it can be drawn away from the distilleries and utilised on the farm in the course of a day or two.  The by-product could be dried and sold otherwise but&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The by-product is worth more as food than the potatoes themselves?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No. A large commercial value applies to it.  It is roughly worth a ½d. a gallon.  That is the value put on it by those who have studied the market.  There are other matters in connection with it on which it is not possible to get definite information without experimenting.  The first is the possibility of introducing a class of potatoes with a high starch content and also a high yield per acre; the second is the possibility of securing a market for this wash or by-product, and the third is the period over which the campaign can be continued in this country.  In other countries, distilleries work on an average for 200 days in a year.  Those who have looked into the problem, however, are of opinion that a much longer period of operation should be possible here, taking into account the period of the year in which potatoes are marketed and the period during which they can be kept in pits without sprouting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say at this stage <Col N="2141" /> that if we take this Vote we have not yet made any final arrangements which will insure the erection of the distilleries and their operating in the present year.  I do not contemplate that any exceptional difficulty will arise in that connection but there is always the possibility that some unforeseen development will take place which would make it impossible to proceed with the experiment during the present year having regard to the fact that there is a time element in operation. Certain negotiations are in progress with a view to the provision of expert advice, the purchasing of the necessary plant and so on, but these negotiations have not been concluded and before they are concluded some difficulty, which we may not see at the moment, may arise.  It is our hope that we may be able to secure the erection of distilleries in the present year and that next year the experiment will be able to be operated under circumstances which will give us conclusive evidence as to whether it would be advisable or not to proceed with the wider development of the industry.</P>
    <P>The intention is to erect the first experimental group of distilleries in the district of North Louth, Cavan and Monaghan.  The sole reason why that district was selected was because of the fact that in the Cooley area where potato growing has been the main occupation of the people there are, as Deputies are aware, considerable difficulties at the moment.  Those potatoes are grown in what is known as the black scab area and they cannot be marketed in the Saorstát.  The growers are not permitted to sell the potatoes in the Saorstát.  Heretofore they depended entirely upon the export market, but now that export markets are being subject to quotas and restrictions of one kind or another, there is an increasing difficulty in disposing of potatoes grown in the Cooley area.  That difficulty is being experienced.</P>
    <P>The total production in the Cooley area would be substantially less than would meet the requirements even for these experimental distilleries.  Consequently, it will be necessary to put <Col N="2142" /> two or three of the distilleries in the adjoining areas in the neighbouring counties.  Various representations have been made in favour of the initiation of the scheme in Donegal, Mayo, Kerry and other counties.  For many reasons we would have liked to have done so, but the special circumstances existing in the Cooley area determined us finally to proceed in that locality rather than in the others.  If, however, the experiment should prove to be a success these other areas would have the first consideration in the preparation of any plans.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should explain that.  Probably the best product to use in the production of industrial alcohol in the existing circumstances would be beet.  We, however, decided that for a number of reasons it was not desirable that we should organise an increased production of beet for this purpose, having regard to the fact that the extension of the beet area for sugar is proceeding and that the benefits of that production are, in a measure, confined to particular localities.  There are people who claim that in the particular counties I have mentioned, Monaghan and Cavan, and around that district, beet cannot be as successfully grown as it is grown in other counties.  Whether that is true I cannot say.  Potatoes can be grown also in Donegal, where it would not be possible to grow beet with the same success.  A number of products can be used for industrial alcohol, apart from beet and potatoes, including turf or, as it is called, peat.  It has been tried out in other countries.</P>

      <P>In France.  As a matter of fact particulars of that process were recently submitted to my Department, and I propose to refer them to the industrial research council with a view to having them examined. The economy of the process appeared very largely to depend on the ability to find a sale at the price stated for the other products which came from the process as well as alcohol.  Having regard to the fact that potatoes are grown so extensively here and can be grown in all parts of the country, the fact that they are used for industrial alcohol purposes elsewhere with success, and that industrial alcohol from potatoes can be used for a number of industrial processes, in connection with which industrial alcohol produced from other products is not equally suitable, we decided to concentrate upon potatoes at any rate for the initial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The price at which the industrial alcohol will be available is not easy to determine in advance.  It depends upon a number of factors.  It depends, first of all, upon the average starch content of the potatoes received over the whole season.  It depends upon the length of the season and upon the price at which barley and coal can be procured at the distilleries.  We have, however, examined the provisional figures which we worked out for ourselves on the basis of an 18 per cent. yield of starch from potatoes, and satisfied ourselves that, taking into account the particular method of financing which is proposed, the price at which alcohol can be sold will be substantially less than it is being sold at present in other countries.  That, however, is not a fair comparison, first, because in certain of those other countries the alcohol is used much more extensively for industrial purposes, and consequently there is a demand for it which would not exist here.  Secondly, because in some cases the figures which are published in different returns provide for certain revenue out of the selling price for the Exchequer, and it is very difficult to find out exactly in each case what that revenue is.  Thirdly, because, of course, the price on which we have been basing our calculation does not take into <Col N="2144" /> account any capital charges in the experimental scheme.  As I have said, the amount required will be provided by Vote of the Dáil.  It is, however, anticipated that there will be no increase in the price of petrol to consumers when mixed with this spirit. There will, however, be a certain loss of revenue, in so far as the importation of petrol may be reduced and consequently the yield from the petrol tax may diminish.  That is something that will be difficult to ascertain, because the annual importation of petrol is increasing and it will not be very easy to say to what extent at any stage the increase in imports has been affected by considerations of this kind.</P>

The intention, however, at the moment is to provide a flat price irrespective of starch content, certainly in the first year until certain experiments with different varieties of potatoes which are being conducted at the moment have yielded results.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>On resuming the debate, on the last day, on this motion, I had the decided advantage of the presence of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, but as soon as he got through he left.  I presume he will do the same to-day.  Before he goes I would like him, if he would be pleased&mdash; and I shall give way to him if he wishes &mdash;to develop the point he was making by way of an interruption which I welcomed at the time.  He was comparing the produce of the British tariffs, to the British, with our tariffs to us.  I think he said the produce of our retaliatory tariffs, on British goods coming in <Col N="2148" /> here, imposed not primarily or immediately for the purpose of helping industry here, had the effect of returning blow for blow.  I believe he made that statement.  I have not seen it yet in print, and I want to be perfectly fair, but I understood him to say that what we get from our tariffs, for the purposes I have said, equates with the revenue collected by the British from tariffs imposed by them in order to collect this £5,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that the amount, in each case, was the same, but I presume the economic laws that operate against us in the one instance must operate against the British in the other.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>So that we are in this position: the British declare publicly to the world that they have collected where we have defaulted.  Now we have the statement from the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the retaliatory tariffs that we have collected here are greater than the amount of the tariffs which the British have collected on their side.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.  The Deputy is arguing the British case, but, in calculating the amount collected in tariffs by them for the amounts that we withheld, he cannot leave out of account the amount the British have paid on British goods coming in here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>At the start of this fight there was £5,000,000 due.  They did not fall due always at the end of the <Col N="2149" /> financial year, but let us take it that £5,000,000 was due at the end of the financial year.  The Government said: &ldquo;We will not pay,&rdquo; and the British said: &ldquo;We will collect the money.  We will hit back by operations on this side similar to the operations that are going on on the other side.&rdquo;  The Government decided to hold the £5,000,000.  The British imposed taxes on our goods and we imposed taxes on their goods.  Are we holding our own? They are extracting £5,000,000 from us; they have acknowledged that they have extracted it.  Can the Minister get up and say we have extracted a similar amount?</P>

I am not now disputing their right or questioning their policy.  I am only trying to find out what the position is. The British say they are collecting it. The Minister for Industry and Commerce said we are hitting back and imposing tariffs to counter balance the British tariffs.

      <P>If I understood the Minister aright on the last day&mdash;and I think he stated it to-day&mdash;we were getting from our tariffs more than £5,000,000.  I understood him to say that we were getting as much as the British were getting.  If we are not getting £5,000,000, are we not losing in the game, and is it not time to devise some method to counterbalance the British operations on the other side? The Minister sees the danger of answering the direct question.  He says that we are getting £5,000,000 or less.  Will the Minister say how much we are getting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should not want notice of it, because when opposing this motion, the substance of his speech, which I can quote from memory &mdash;and which I am sure he will accept&mdash; he asked where were we to get the money to restore this grant.  The British imposed a tariff to get £5,000,000.  They got the money but the farming community paid it.  We imposed tariffs here to hit back at the British.  The Minister says the British paid all of them.  I will not dispute that point at the moment, because it would not help my argument.  The Minister claims that, and I give him the benefit of it.  But the Government pocketed the proceeds of tariffs here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is dealing with another matter.  I will come to that.  I am dealing with the financing of both operations.  The British got the finance they collected at the other side.  The Minister cannot dispute the statement that the British got out of agricultural produce the whole of the £5,000,000 or whatever the amount was. For the sake of convenience we will call it £5,000,000 in round figures, retaliatory duties.  I am differentiating between tariffs imposed here for industrial purposes and tariffs imposed merely to retaliate on the British.  The counter blow is not sufficient if it did not bring in £5,000,000.  The Minister <Col N="2151" /> is afraid to say it did; he is afraid to say it did not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

He would have thumped the table with both hands in support of the motion if he had a conscience.

      <P>The Deputy is condemning the action of the Government for reducing the grant.  He should have referred to the fact that within <Col N="2152" /> the last two weeks we have increased the grant; and secondly he seems to have been turned down by his own Party, at the convention, when he proposed a similar motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Minister is not getting away with that.  When the Minister thumped the table and asked where were they to get the money, portion of the grant had not been restored. Only half of it had been restored.  At that time it had not been restored, and the Minister could not say if the whole of it would be restored. I hope the Minister will not take it that I am throwing bouquets at myself, because it was after I started to reply to the irrelevant statements of the Minister and his colleagues that the grant was restored, this night week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no reason why the Deputy should not throw bouquets at himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing certain, that if this motion had not been on the Order Paper there would be no restoration of the grant.  The Minister wants to get away with an oblique answer and will not tell for what purpose the money collected by tariffs will be used.  If there had been no row with England, England would only get £5,000,000, but the Minister's Government would not get the nest-egg they got out of retaliatory tariffs.  As there is a row the agricultural producers have to pay the £5,000,000 to England, but when Ministers put tariffs on goods here and get the money they claim that the British are paying it.  If the British take money from the farmers on the other side, and if we take it from the British in retaliation, surely the money got here should be transferred to the farmers.  There is no answer to that.  No one knows that better than the Minister.  Perhaps we might have another surprise to-morrow morning, and the remaining portion of the grant, which was withheld, may be restored.  Apart from that the Minister asked where is the money to come from.  The Minister knows that in 1931 his Party stood for an increase of £1,000,000 in the agricultural grant.  He <Col N="2153" /> will not deny that.  I have the statement of his Party to support that, as set out in the speech of the then Deputy de Valera.  The Minister knows, and I know, what Deputy de Valera and the whole Party did.</P>

The Minister knows that when I put it to the other side that we should meet here, I was nearly mobbed for thinking of coming into the atmosphere of Leinster House.  Deputy Belton always knows the way he is going.  He will not let anyone else speak for him.  He will not be led by the nose.  He is not a de Valerian gramophone, a Cosgravian gramophone or an O'Duffy gramophone, but one who will stand on his own legs.  I will come to deal with the Minister for Education later.  I have all your measures taken, and I have gowns that will fit the whole of you.

      <P>No.  You had not responsibility <Col N="2154" /> then, and you said that the other people should get the money, no matter where they got it.  The agricultural grant originally, under the Local Government Act of 1898, amounted to £600,000.  Out of the surplus from tariffs in 1924 and 1925&mdash;I am not sure of the year&mdash;the previous Government doubled the agricultural grant, bringing the total up to £1,200,000.  That was the position when the Minister for Industry and Commerce supported his leader in the early months of 1931 for an increase of £1,000,000 in the grant. The motion was not carried.  When the Budget was introduced that year by Mr. Blythe, then Minister for Finance, Deputy de Valera, as he then was, spoke against it.  I am not going to weary the Minister with what his chief said on that occasion, but Mr. Blythe provided for an increase in the agricultural grant of £750,000.  He said in order to do that it would be necessary to put 4d. a gallon on petrol and ½d. per lb. on sugar, and he did.  The imports of sugar that year were slightly over 80,000 tons, and the imports of petrol 45,000,000 gallons. These taxes, operating over a whole year, would give about £1,000,000.  Mr. Blythe pointed out that as they would only be operating for nine or ten months of that year he could not safely provide for a grant greater than £750,000.  That was his explanation. There was a good deal of reason in it; reason, too, that was then accepted by those pressing for complete derating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's Party came into power in the following year.  They introduced the Budget with a great flourish of trumpets, and said they would increase the agricultural grant to the original figure of £1,000,000 by giving another £250,000.  In fact, they were giving nothing because, as I have already pointed out, the taxes imposed in the previous year did not operate for a full year.  In the year 1931-32 these taxes produced approximately £750,000, but in 1932-33, when the Minister's Party came into power, they produced over £1,000,000 for the reason that they were in operation over the full year.  The figures relating to imports published by the present Government and issued not long ago <Col N="2155" /> substantiate that statement.  Therefore, there was nothing to thank the Minister or his Government for.  Last year, when these taxes were producing a total that should give us an agricultural grant of practically £2,200,000, the grant was reduced by £450,000, speaking in round figures.  These taxes that were imposed to give an agricultural grant to that amount are still functioning, and when the grant was reduced why were not the taxes wiped out?  The tax of ½d. per lb. on sugar was changed into a tax of 4d. a per lb. on tea.  That, with the 4d. a gallon on petrol, was estimated to provide £1,000,000 a year for the relief of agricultural rates.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, in opposing this motion, asked where was the money to come from.  I answer that it is to come from the taxes levied to yield it, and that did, in fact, yield it. I put it to the Minister that no local authority dare act as the Government have in connection with taxes levied specially to produce money for the relief of agricultural rates.  A local authority dare not strike a special rate of a penny in the pound for a special service and then apply it to some other purpose.  I hold that the Government have not acted fairly.  I am not talking politics now.  I am talking facts and the Minister cannot controvert them.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has the sums that he is getting from tariffs.  We are fighting the British now, and if I quote I am not talking politics. When the Minister and members of his Party go down the country they say: &ldquo;We are doing the British more harm than they are doing us,&rdquo; but the Minister here acknowledges that the British are giving us a black eye every time: we cannot see that they are hitting us!  we cannot hit back and if we do it is only a very weak punch that we give, with no force behind it because we are not extracting from the British, according to the Minister, what they are extracting from us.  Of course the Minister is afraid to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; to that.  He knows that I have him whether he says <Col N="2156" />&ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no.&rdquo;  If he says &ldquo;yes&rdquo;: that we are getting as much from the British as they are getting from us, then I ask why not relieve agricultural land of the rates?  He has no answer to that.  If he says we are not getting as much from the British as they are getting from us, then of course he is admitting that we are losing in the economic fight.  In this instance the Minister cannot have it both ways. Will the Minister venture to answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no?&rdquo;  I would like the Minister to have a little recreation in reading over his own speeches, and that he should not be so truculent when trying to put a face on a bad case here.  The Minister for Finance has got the money.  I have put a question to him and I would be glad to have a reply, but the Minister for Finance has not been here to reply since I got on my feet.  The Minister for Education is here.  I do not know how he was bilked to remain here. The Minister for Industry and Commerce cannot answer or will not answer.  I remember being in the House of Commons about twenty-five years ago on a famous occasion when the late Tim Healy got up to speak. He was very anxious to get at the late Mr. Asquith, afterwards Lord Oxford, who had been briefed in the Parnell Commission.  Tim Healy started like this: Gladstone is dead, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman is on a sick bed, and now we will deal with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, so he got after Mr. Asquith.  We will have to deal with the Minister for Education.  All the rest of them have flown.  Now the Minister for Education, in not a very educative correspondence, some years ago, down in his constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny, took up a farmer correspondent, and in three-quarters of a letter to the <i>Carlow Nationalist,</i> published on 30th August, 1930, and signed T. Derrig, he lets fly with both hands at the correspondent, Mr. Cogan, and your humble servant.  I will not go over all the letter because if I read all the letter it would perhaps expose the Minister for Education and show that in matters of education he was nearly as lacking as he is in matters of agriculture.  I will just read a <Col N="2157" /> sentence or two of the last and the penultimate paragraph.  Here is the tit-bit of it, anyway: &ldquo;The Fianna Fáil Party has consistently pressed for derating and I challenge Mr. Cogan (that was the correspondent) to show otherwise.  I have already referred to the recent by-election which Mr. Cogan wisely ignored.&rdquo;  The recent by-election referred to was the by-election in Longford-Westmeath in which Deputy Geoghegan was returned; and he was returned to the slogan of derating.  He was not returned to act as Crown Prosecutor for claims for rates, on people who were not able to pay them, at 20 guineas a day.</P>
    <P>That was the Minister for Education, Deputy Derrig, in 1930; but in 1934 he brushes derating aside.  Now, let us have a proper setting of the Ministers. When Mr. Blythe, the previous Minister for Finance, moved Financial Resolution No. 1, on 6th May, 1931&mdash; page 785, volume 3 of the Official Records of this House&mdash;Mr. de Valera arose to speak after him and said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is usual for us at this stage simply to comment in a formal way on the Budget statement made by the Minister for Finance.  Every Deputy probably came into the House as I did, expecting one principal item, namely, the item which would indicate the extent of the immediate relief which the Minister proposed for the farmers.  I am sure that most of us, whether we express it by our votes or not, are genuinely disappointed ...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Genuinely disappointed!  And that Party that was then genuinely disappointed has only three representatives on the benches now, and none of them even remotely connected with agriculture.</P>

      <P>Let us have the spectacle anyway, and perhaps we will be able to get some artists to paint it for us. Mr. de Valera continued as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am sure that most of us, whether we express it by our votes or not, are genuinely disappointed &mdash;disappointed that after all the promises that have been made by the Government of relief for the farming community, the £1,000,000 which was specifically mentioned on previous occasions should now be cut down by one quarter.  When certain elections were on and the Executive Council wanted the support of the farming community they told the electors that they realised the depressed condition of agriculture and that it was their intention in this Budget to come to the relief of the farmers.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>You can really apply this to the present Executive Government although it was delivered to the last one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It was admitted by members of the Executive Council that our farmers were severely handicapped in competition with the farmers of Great Britain and Northern Ireland by the fact that derating operated in Great Britain and Northern Ireland while our farmers had to pay to the full all the local rates. A million pounds was promised, and now they propose to give £750,000. We have had the Derating Commission Report before us, and some of us, at any rate, expected that <Col N="2159" /> the one important suggestion in that report might have been adopted, and that in so far as relief was being given by way of derating a system of distribution would have been chosen by which there would have been relief given, in particular, to the smaller farmers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then I come on to the next paragraph which reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As to the manner in which he proposes to raise the money, with the petrol tax as a whole we have not much fault to find&mdash;at least I have not.  But when it comes to the tax on sugar the position is quite different.  Already, the percentage of indirect taxation, as compared with direct taxation, is very high here, much higher, I think, than in most other countries.  Yet, just as when he wants economy he thinks of the old age pensions and cuts them down, so too when he wants to get £300,000 he proceeds to filch it out of the pockets of the poorer section of the community, including, of course, the farmers, particularly the small farmers.  The suggestion, with which we agreed, which came from the Labour Benches when my motion was put forward in the House, that in whatever manner the money for the relief of agriculture was to be found it should not be found in a manner which would impose a burden upon the small farmer, whom it was ostensibly intended to relieve, has not been adopted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister opposite has it been adopted since?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig) Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>The beet sugar industry, as the Deputy knows very well, has created an entirely new situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It has.  The Deputy knows it well, and the Minister knows it well too, for he knows the perambulations of his Party around his constituency, subsequent to the period I am quoting now, when the farmers were organised not to take 48/- a ton for sugar beet with a sugar content of 15½ per cent., whereas now they are forced <Col N="2160" /> to take 35/- a ton for beet with a sugar content of 17½ per cent.  That created a new situation in the beet growing districts of Leix-Offaly, Wexford, Carlow-Kilkenny, and the other beet growing districts, and it was a situation which was much to the detriment of the farming community.  The Sugar Act put through by the Minister's Party last year provided for 17½ per cent. sugar content, and reduced the comparative return to the farmer. Surely the Minister does not argue that the farmer was compensated for that in the price of sugar.  At 9/- a ton the loss worked out roughly at £5 a statute acre.  For precisely the same operation the farmer will get £5 a statute acre less.  An acre of beet was worth £x in 1930 or 1931, the time of which I am speaking.  It is now worth £x minus £5.  If there was need for £1,000,000 for relief of rates on agricultural land either in the year 1930, when the Minister wrote in the <i>Carlow Nationalist</i>, or in 1931, when President de Valera said in this House that Mr. Blythe's Budget, providing for £750,000 additional relief of agricultural rates, was &ldquo;disappointing, genuinely disappointing,&rdquo; how much more disappointing is it when beet yields £5 per acre less, and there is no hope of getting any more?  That is the standard set by the Government of which the Minister is a member, and he says it has changed the whole situation.  It has changed it for the worse.</P>

Will she not have to pay the price that was condemned by Deputy de Valera three years ago? That woman probably had her husband working three years ago and now he is probably on the dole or on home help. Is her position not worse than it was? In addition, she has to pay the equivalent of the tax condemned by Deputy de Valera three years ago in the form of 4d. per lb. on tea.  I am sure the Minister will not say that tea or sugar is a luxury.  I think I shall leave President de Valera now.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education, when speaking against this motion, struck me as a man who really had no heart in what he was saying.  It appeared to me that he had been rushed in here to speak.  He made not a Dáil speech but a platform speech.  He spoke in very general terms.  In a very different way did the Minister for Finance attempt to speak on this subject&mdash;I emphasise the word &ldquo;attempt.&rdquo;  When he was getting it hard to keep his four-and-a-half-hours' oration going, he introduced a new feature into the debate.  Just as he quoted figures that were accurate in their true setting but inaccurate in the setting in which they were used by him, so he introduced quotations, figures and opinions from a journal of first-class reputation.  In speaking of this journal he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No one will accuse a great English financial periodical like the <i>Economist</i> of being unduly biassed in favour of the present Government.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He went on to say that he would quote what that journal had to say.  I suggested that what he was quoting was the contribution of a correspondent, which he denied.  He went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I am perfectly certain that a journal with the prestige and status of the <i>Economist</i>, is not going to <Col N="2162" /> publish its considered judgment on a matter like this merely in order to conduct propaganda on behalf of one or other interest in this country or outside it.  The interruption is silly and ridiculous&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>He was referring to my interruption, that this was the production of a correspondent. The Minister continued&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;even more silly and ridiculous than most of the interruptions that come from Deputy Belton.  I was saying that the <i>Economist</i>, having pointed out that the excess of the banks' external assets over their external liabilities provided an exact measure of the net flow of funds into or out of the Free State, went on to stress that from the first quarter of 1932 to the first quarter of 1933 there was a steady net inflow of funds to the Free State amounting to more han £8,500,000.  A roughly comparable figure for the United Kingdom, the <i>Economist</i> observer went on to say, would be £200,000,000. Then, he went further and said that the Irish balance of payments in 1933 was, therefore, strongly favourable, and he ended his examination of this position by remarking that the accumulated reserves of the Irish banks are such as to make the financial position of the country manifestly strong.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That statement, because it is the unbiassed opinion of a competent observer, is much more important than all the vapourings of Deputy Belton or the flippancies of Deputy Dillon or the frenzies of Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney. It is the judgment, as I have said, the deliberately expressed judgment, of a competent impartial observer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We shall see what he did say, and it is not as quoted by the Minister for Finance.  First of all, there was an interruption by me on a point of order to ask &ldquo;is not the statement referred to by the Minister the statement of an individual who is paid for his job&mdash;the Irish correspondent of the <i>Economist?&rdquo;</i> Now the heading to which I have referred already, over this information, is &ldquo;Banking in the Irish Free State, by a correspondent.&rdquo;  Correspondents <Col N="2163" /> do not write for papers of this kind without being well paid for it.  This is the relevant portion from the Minister's speech:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;He went on to stress that from the first quarter of 1932 to the first quarter of 1933 there was a steady net inflow of funds to the Free State, amounting to more than £8½ million.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>With that I agree.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A roughly comparable figure for the United Kingdom, the <i>Economist</i> observer went on to say, would be £200,000,000.  Then he went further and said that the Irish balance of payments in 1933 was, therefore, strongly favourable, and he ended his examination of this position by remarking that the accumulated reserves of the Irish banks are so much as to make the financial position of the country manifestly strong.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He ended his examination there, it is true, but there was a gap in between which the Minister did not quote, but which I shall quote:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It will be seen that from the first quarter of 1932 to the first quarter of 1933 there was a steady inflow of funds into the Free State amounting to more than 8½ million pounds.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is what the Minister has stated.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A roughly comparable figure for the United Kingdom would be £200,000,000.  The Irish balance of payments in 1932 was, therefore, strongly favourable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here is what the Minister left out:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The last return shows that this movement has now been reversed and the general belief is that the outflow has continued in the third quarter.  This outflow is partly due to the direct effects of the economic war upon the balance of payments and partly, no doubt, to political factors.  There is nothing, however, to show that the outflow of 1933 is at a more rapid rate than the inflow of 1932, and in any case the accumulated sterling reserves of the Irish banks are so large as to make the <Col N="2164" /> financial position of the country immensely strong.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Yes, the reserves accumulated before the present Government came into office which had no relevancy, I believe, to the point made by the Minister for Finance.  If the Minister for Finance wanted to make a point he should have made the point that we were economically strong, not financially strong.  We can be financially strong through accumulated reserves, but we can be economically weak through bad administration, and we are.  The Minister quoted from a journal of world-wide repute in matters of economics and finance, but he misquoted it by leaving out of his quotation a very relevant and up-to-date matter.  I might take him over another piece of it to show him the exact condition of the matters that count.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The business of the Irish Free State banks has been subject, in the past 12 months, to influences very similar to those which have affected the Joint Stock Banks of Great Britain, with the added complications arising out of the economic war.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the article in the banking supplement of the <i>Economist</i> for the 14th October, that the Minister for Finance introduced into the House in opposing the motion, but he only quoted a few fragments to help his own case.  I hope, with your permission, to give the whole of this report by the correspondent over whom the Minister for Finance stands as an authority on the condition of this country.  I intend, with the permission of the Chair, to give the whole article in order that it will appear on the records of the House, even though it can only be read in the hearing of four Fianna Fáil Deputies or three on the benches. The Minister is going now.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Since these banks maintain their reserves mainly in London they have fallen under the influence of the Bank of England's &lsquo;expansionary&rsquo; policy and, as will be seen from the customary tables printed herewith, their holdings of cash have risen for the second year in succession.

      <P>&ldquo;As was only to be expected, these conditions have been reflected in a decline of the profits earned by all but one of the banks.  Dividends have been correspondingly reduced, that of the Bank of Ireland falling from 17½ per cent. to 14½ per cent., while the other banks have reduced their distributions by ½ per cent. or 1 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A valuable new source of information on Irish Free State banking has become available in the last 18 months in the form of &lsquo;Banking Returns&rsquo; published by the Currency Commission.  These returns refer to the eight banks holding shares in the Commission&mdash;that is, the six Free State Banks and the Ulster Bank and the Northern Banking Company&mdash; and also the National City Bank, which is a subsidiary of the Bank of <Col N="2166" /> Ireland.  The returns are issued quarterly, and represent an average of monthly returns furnished by the banks to the Commission.  Their particular interest resides in the fact that they show the chief items of assets and liabilities divided according to their location in the Free State or &lsquo;elsewhere&rsquo; (which, of course, includes Northern Ireland as well as Great Britain).  Six of these returns have now been published and are summarised....  It is obvious that capital and reserves and also the internal accounts of the banks must have been distributed on some conventional basis which has not been revealed.  Apart from these items, the returns illustrate the dual nature of Irish banking in a striking manner.  It will be noticed, for example, that, roughly, a quarter of the deposits of the nine banks included in the returns are situated out of the Free State;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;Deputy Tom Kelly, who is Chairman of the Housing Committee of the Dublin Corporation, and who knows the need for houses in the City.  He knows also that the one problem in order to get those houses is money.  Now, a quarter of the deposits of the nine banks that are the member banks of our Currency Commission under this Republican Government&mdash;the people's Government&mdash;are situated outside the Free State.  How does that go?</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Nor is this due solely to the inclusion of two Belfast banks, as every one of the other banks (with the exception of the National City Bank) does business in the United Kingdom, and one of them, the National Bank, has an extensive business in England.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>&ldquo;Cash is held as to one-third in the Free State and as to two-thirds elsewhere.&rdquo;<Col N="2167" /> These are our Irish banks under a Republican Government, and the Republican Minister for Finance had the temerity to quote from this article spicy little bits that had no meaning, or the reverse meaning from their original intent, when divorced from the context.</P>

      <P>On a point of order. This is the first time in the history of this House when the Government Benches were left vacant.  A previous Ceann Comhairle ruled the House out at least on one occasion because of the failure of Ministers to have the courtesy to remain in the House in order to reply.  From the point of view of the dignity of the House, and out of respect for the members of the House, I think this House ought now to stand adjourned.  I think it is an unheard of proceeding in any assembly in the world that the Government Benches should be left unoccupied.  I think it is unheard of that the Fianna Fáil Benches at 1 o'clock on a Friday should be left with only a lady member.  There is not another member of the Party present on that side of the House.</P>

      <P>They laugh at that. There was no Minister present.  I do not see what use there is in going on with this debate when Ministers show so much discourtesy and so much disrespect to the House.  This motion was handed in by me on 23rd March last. It appeared on the Order Paper on 24th March last.  It has been on the Order Paper since.  During last year Private Members' time was taken and used for Government business, and we did not get an opportunity of disposing of this motion.  Now when it did come before this House we had Ministers rambling for four or five hours speaking on this motion, showing their disrespect and contempt of the largest section of the people in this country&mdash;the agricultural community.  Then when it came to replying the Ministers again showed their disrespect and left the House. Some Deputies have come in, though they have been elected by farmers' votes, to laugh at the idea of this motion.  I do not know whether we have such a freak in public representation as this, that it is not worth while for anybody to trouble about the events as they come along, only let the events proceed on their course, and let the people get the full force of the adversity of those events.  As a result of the injustice that this motion was put down to repair&mdash;and which the Government has within the last week half repaired because of the force of the case made for it&mdash;Deputies, while being paid to represent their constituents, this day week left this House and went and bought the cattle of the farmers, cattle seized as a result of the injustice which this motion wants to remedy. They come into this House now and laugh at this motion, and their consciences will not prick them.  For an hour afterwards they were trying to get their money out of them but they did not get it.

      <P>&ldquo;It may be assumed that the one-third held in the Free State is &lsquo;till money,&rsquo; and that an equivalent amount is held in cash at external branches.  In this case, slightly more than half of the total will represent balances in London.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Half the cash in the Irish banks is held in London under a Republican Government !  Now, up the Republic!</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Money at call and short notice, as might be expected, is almost entirely external.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is why we cannot get money to build houses for the Dublin working classes.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;One of the more surprising revelations of the return is that Free State bills are more than twice the total of external bills.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Where is the financial buoyancy?</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Free State bills are probably mainly accommodation paper rather than trade bills.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Not trade bills!  It is the hard-ups that have bills from the Irish banks.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;And the external bills probably arise in a similar way from the Ulster business of the banks.  It is evident, however, that the Irish banks are not at present purchasers of bills in the London market, although the returns suggest that they may have done so on a small scale in the past, when rates were more remunerative.  Loans and advances are lower proportionately in the Free State than the ratio of internal and external deposits might have suggested&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance did not read all this matter, which shows the depressed conditions of this country</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;this is doubtless due to the more industrial character of the Ulster business.  Finally, investments are preponderantly outside the Free <Col N="2172" /> State, as is inevitable in view of the lack of Free State securities of a type suitable for banking investments.  It is noticeable, however, that the Free State investments have shown a steady tendency to increase.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance quoted a couple of sentences out of that which he thought would suit his book.  He did not quote it all, but I have read it all, and it is the most effective reply that could be given, especially in view of the setting in which the Minister gave the quotations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The position has been well and forcibly put by speakers on this side who have gone before me. There are, in fact, two cases.  There is the irrefutable case for the continuance of a grant of £2,200,000 every year for the relief of rates on agricultural land, even if no dispute ever arose with England, because the £600,000, the original agricultural grant, was part of the title which our fathers and grandfathers had to the land.  The landlord contracted to pay half the rates on agricultural land.  That was made a statutory obligation on the Government by the Local Government Act of 1898 and that accounts for £600,000 of the agricultural grant.  The next step, when we had a Government in this country and when tariffs were imposed which increased the price of certain commodities to the agricultural community, was that the then Minister for Finance, in 1924 or 1925, increased the agricultural grant by doubling it, out of moneys made available by the proceeds of those tariffs.  That accounted for £1,200,000 of the then agricultural grant.  In 1931, taxes were <Col N="2174" /> imposed, ½d per lb. on sugar and 4d a gallon on petrol, to produce £1,000,000. These taxes are there still with the difference that the tax of ½d per lb. on sugar has been changed to 4d per lb. on tea.  That placed on the Government an obligation to produce every year, £2,200,000 for the relief of rates on agricultural land and if, in the wisdom of this or any other Government, it was considered that agriculture was not entitled to so much or any relief, nobody could question the right of the Government to reduce that relief but if they do want to reduce that relief, why not reduce the taxes that were imposed to produce this money for the Exchequer?  They do not reduce any of these taxes.  They are still functioning, still producing and yet the grant was cut.</P>
      <P>That is the case for the agricultural grant if nothing had happened.  That is the case if no economic war with England had happened and that is the case made by President de Valera in this House on the 6th May, 1931, when urging that the farmers of this country were entitled to £1,000,000 increase in the agricultural grant to make it £2,200,000.  That was when there was no economic war with Britain; when there was no curtailment of our exports to Britain or anywhere else; when Britain was on the gold standard and when our money could buy in any market in the world, which it cannot do to-day.  We get fewer pounds for our stock to-day than we got in 1931, and super-imposed on that, we have the English import tariffs and again, on top of that, the pounds that we get are worth only 12/- in gold money. We have to use these paper pounds worth 12/- to buy in gold-using countries like Germany and France.  We import German coal with paper money worth only 12/- out of 20/- of its face value.  That is the unanswerable case which is staring anybody who applies himself to a study of the position at all in the face.  It cannot be controverted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You have an economic war and its consequences.  I do not want to go into consequences or into the matter of what we are losing here or anything like that at all.  In summarising I <Col N="2175" /> just want to deal with the points that the Minister for Finance admitted and later refused to admit.  He refused to-day to answer a question that I put to him relevant to this matter.  The payment of the annuities was discontinued by our Government.  British tariffs were imposed for the purpose of collecting those withheld payments. It is not denied by the British or by our Government that the British are collecting the entire of those payments. The Minister for Industry and Commerce could not contradict that and he had to admit its truth here to-day. The British said &ldquo;we have got the full payment of these moneys from the Free State.&rdquo;  None of our Ministers could get up and say &ldquo;no, you have not, you have got something less.&rdquo;  To-day the Minister for Industry and Commerce in respect to the retaliatory tariffs imposed by our Government as a return blow to the tariffs imposed by the British owing to the non-collection of the annuities, agreed first that these were a full set-off and had produced as much for us as the British tariffs had produced for Britain. Then, afterwards, he said the tariffs imposed by us on British goods had produced something less. However, they must have produced something anyway and that something is a further amount of available money that should go really not alone for the restoration of the part of the agricultural grant that has been withheld but that the farmers ought to get further relief on agricultural land.</P>
    <P>From any angle from which the matter is viewed there is no reason why any Deputy in this House should vote against this motion.  None whatever. This money is due to the farmers according to legislation and, secondly, it is due in respect of the taxes that have been imposed on the farmers to provide these grants.  Deputies and Parties in this House should, according to their wisdom vote for or against the motion to give relief of rates on agricultural land.  Some of them have voted to withdraw all relief of rates. But to be consistent they should say that before they would give their vote <Col N="2176" /> for such a motion, the taxation imposed on the people of this country to provide the money which is being raised by these tariffs, should be repealed also.</P>
    <P>Here you have the position that though the grant is reduced the taxation to provide £2,200,000 is still functioning.  Last year that sum was reduced to £1,750,000.  This year the county councils got instructions from the Minister for Local Government and Public Health that a similar grant would be given this year and no more, while, at the same time, the taxation imposed to provide these grants is still operating.  People are still paying 4d. a lb. duty on tea and 4d. a gallon extra on petrol and they are paying tariffs on all sorts of imported goods.  The original £600,000 given as an agricultural grant was a statutory obligation on the Government so as to provide half the rates on agricultural land.  Now we have the extraordinary position that in addition to those moneys the £5,000,000 that our Government is collecting, she is using every avenue and every source of revenue that the previous Government used in collecting the annuities and, in addition, there are the £2,000,000 over and above due to Britain and withheld. Britain has acknowledged that she has extracted all that money. She is extracting it from the agricultural community.  That is a further reason why this agricultural grant should be restored and the whole of the rates on agricultural land discontinued during the operation of this economic war.</P>
    <P>It would take me a week to answer all the points raised by the Ministers, who apparently spoke on this motion because they did not know their subject. I do not want to follow the Ministers into their irrelevancies.  I do, however, want to answer the Minister for Finance in what was not an irrelevancy or something that he misunderstood or misrepresented but something that he invented.  The Minister for Finance stated that Deputy Belton was responsible for what he alleges.  I will give his words. They are in Volume 50, No. 6, columns 1726-7&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2177" />&ldquo;Mr. MacEntee: I want to say further that any reduction that exists in bank profits has been due almost entirely to the increased taxation which those undertakings have had to bear and not to any difficulty they have experienced in collecting amounts due to them by their debtors.  I was talking about the rates of agricultural wages in this country.  I was saying that if there was any reduction in agricultural wages, it was only part of the deliberate and organised ramp that has been undertaken by members of the Opposition Party, a ramp similar to that which was set on foot as a result of a conference here of leading supporters of Deputy Belton and his associates, who came together and began to consider what elements in agricultural production at the present moment were showing a substantial return to the farmer and who arrived at the conclusion that amongst them was milk.  They decided that the price of milk in certain areas must be brought down to an uneconomic level and approached certain large dairying undertakings in the vicinity of the city to get them to reduce the price of milk in order that they might be able to turn round and say that the farmer is not getting in 1933-4 the price for milk that he was getting in 1931-32.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a deliberate and obnoxious concoction by the Minister for Finance.  I challenge the Minister on the matter.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Belton: Will the Minister name the date of this conference. Will he name the time and place that the conference took place? Will he name a solitary individual that was at the conference?</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. MacEntee: I am going to say this that Deputy Belton was the mover in the whole thing&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Belton: Deputy Belton denies that he knows anything about such conference.  I never attended a milk conference in my life.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is true, but there is this qualification:&mdash;After the Fianna Fáil Party came into power, that was in 1932, <Col N="2178" /> milk depots were introduced by them into this city at which milk was sold at a price subsidised by the Government. It was sold at a price that was below the wholesale price of milk and below the cost of production.</P>

      <P>Neither would I, and neither would anybody.  We can give charity if we can afford it, but in trade we sell nothing below the cost of the article.  We could give an article away for nothing if we could afford it.  In lots of cases it is the duty of a person to give away something in charity, but you cannot have charity connected with business in that way.  If you are running a business it must be run as a business, and if you want to give charity you give charity away from and apart from your business.  You cannot help the poor in business.  If you are selling an article across the counter, rich and poor must pay the same for it.  No trader has one schedule of prices for the poor and another for the rich.  This institution was set up to sell milk below the cost of production.</P>

      <P>To sell milk below the cost of production subsidised by the State.  The poor, who are the showboards of so many Deputies, were working people and their families who could not get work; and these were increased by the setting up of these milk depôts, because the people who were making a living out of selling milk in Dublin at a reasonable cost were <Col N="2179" /> driven out of business.  I was not one of these.  The Minister for Finance accused me of being responsible for a conference which was held. What I said here is quite true, that I was never at a milk conference as such.  What I meant when I said that here was that I was never at a milk conference in my private capacity. This matter was taken up by the milk producers of Dublin and the vendors of milk came into it.  The vendors said to the producers: &ldquo;We will co-operate with you if you want us, but if you do not we will get out; we do not care whether milk is 1½d. or 1/- per pint across the counter.  If it is 1/- per pint we can pay such-and-such a price for it; if it is only 1½d. a pint we will pay a less price for it and have our profits all the time; but you lose as producers if you do not get a good initial price for your milk.&rdquo;  A considerable number of the milk producers live in the County Dublin and the land for grazing that the milk producers take in the summer is situated in the county.  The County Dublin Committee of Agriculture, therefore, was asked to co-operate in this conference, and, as Chairman of that Committee I was selected to represent them at the conference. That is how I came to be at the conference.  As far as my statement denying ever having been at a conference is concerned, it was inaccurate to the extent that I went there in a public capacity.  What I had in mind, and what the accusation of the Minister for Finance conveyed to me was, that I was at a milk conference in a private capacity.  I was not.  The Minister for Finance said that I went around to people to cut down the price of milk.  The Minister was trying to queer my pitch, not with the poor but with the producers, and said that I went around to get milk vendors to reduce the price of milk, but I did not.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will decide when it suits him.  This conference did take place.  Before I was sent there by the Committee of Agriculture deputations waited on the Minister for Agriculture and had consultations with him. I am informed that he denied that the Government was behind the Newmarket Dairy people in underselling and undercutting milk producers in Dublin who were paying trades union wages to their employees.  Now it is well to remind the Minister for Finance that this terrible milk conference that took place, that was organised by me to create such havoc among milk producers, was not in fact organised by me.  I have no practical interest whatever in milk.  I only possess one cow, so that the price of milk does not matter very much to me.  But it did matter to the Chairman of that conference, Mr. Peter Reilly, Newtown, St. Margaret's, who is a strong supporter, in Co. Dublin, of the Minister for Finance. If there was any villain of the piece, and I am not saying there was, Peter Reilly was the villain of the piece.  I know Mr. Peter Reilly for a number of years, and I do not think that he would be guilty of any piece of villainy or anything of that kind.  He is the Vice-Chairman of the local Cumann of Fianna Fáil, and he is the man who organised all this terrible business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only going to read a quotation from the statement of the Minister in which he said: &ldquo;They decided the price of milk, in certain areas, must be brought down to an uneconomic level, and approached certain large dairy undertakings in the vicinity of the city to get them to reduce the price of milk, in order that they might be able to turn round and say that the farmer is not getting in 1933-34 the price he was getting in 1931-32.&rdquo;  I think I am in order in answering that, and I say that that is absolutely false.  What did happen is this.  This supporter of Fianna Fáil got fed up with Fianna Fáil over the way they were handling the milk question. He was supplying to a large milk undertaking in Dublin 90 gallons of milk per day.  The buyer of that milk was got at by Fianna Fáil and he was told one evening when he came in with his milk not to deliver it any more. That man telephoned me, and I telephoned a friend and told him what Fianna Fáil was at, and I am glad to say that I got that man to take the milk, and that the milk is still being supplied to that customer, in spite of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is terribly afraid of anyone appearing on the scene, but he will not succeed in <Col N="2182" /> keeping people off the grass in County Dublin.  The Minister made many attempts to get in in County Dublin, but he never got in there until he got in on my back.  I hope at another time to help to keep him out.  He made a statement about a strike, and he chopped and changed in his charge as to whether I bought, or brought, guns into the County Dublin in order to settle the strike, which was absolutely untrue.  Of course, his object in that was a political one, to sour the Labour Party, which forms a very large population in County Dublin.  What are the facts?  That strike was engineered and planned by two gentlemen who were on the Minister's platform at the last election.  They are both personal friends of mine and very decent men&mdash; Jimmy Cuffe and Paddy Kettle.  That causes a smile on the other side.  When I said they are decent men, I mean they are decent men as far as Fianna Fáil men go.  One must qualify the statement in that way.  No matter what they are, and Deputies opposite can classify them as they like, they were responsible for that strike or lockout or whatever it was, and they were on the Fianna Fáil platforms at the last election.  I am not saying anything against these men; they are personal friends of mine still.  I never had any transactions with them, but I do resent the Minister for Finance putting me into other people's shoes.  I will not be put in that position for anybody.  When that strike was taking place three men came into my yard and said if I did not lock out my men, and if I put my horses on the road on the following Monday they would be shot.  &ldquo;That settles it,&rdquo; said I.  I put my horses on the road&mdash;16 of them&mdash;on Monday and brought manure from Drumcondra, and before the week was out the whole bubble was burst.  Any time the Minister for Finance wants to take that up with me, in the Dáil or on the spot where the scene was enacted, I shall be ready to meet him.  I shall repeat that statement to-night in Balbriggan inside a blue shirt.  Another point made by the Minister for Finance, in going through his theatrical display, was to describe, in his fertile imagination, a scene at the Fine Gael Ard Fheis.  I <Col N="2183" /> am going through the gamut of his policy.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2184" /> Debate adjourned.</P>
