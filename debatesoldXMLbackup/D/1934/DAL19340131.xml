    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that the site chosen for the new hospital in Roscommon adjoins the local cemetery; and whether sanction has been given for such a location for a hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward) Francis Constantine (Dr.) Ward">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to each part of the question is in the affirmative.</P>
      <P>The proximity of the site to the cemetery was fully considered but was held not to constitute a serious objection. The cemetery will be at the rere of the hospital buildings and will be effectively screened from view by the existing hedge and plantation. Furthermore, according to the plans the patients' rooms will be in the front of the buildings.</P>
      <P>The Engineering Inspector of the Department who reported on the site stated that it was the best of the sites offered to the Board of Health in response to advertisement.</P>
      <P>He reported that it was an excellent building site, with a pleasing aspect looking out on the nicely wooded slopes of Carrowroe; that there was plenty of scope to secure the most suitable orientation of the buildings and that there would be privacy to an extent not possible in the case of the other sites.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the graveyard in question directly adjoins the hospital grounds, is on a higher level than the hospital ground, is a notoriously wet graveyard creating seepage and does he consider that the immediate <Col N="878" /> proximity of such a place from a psychological or sanitary point of view is desirable? Are we to understand that it is the Government's intention to reduce this country to such a condition that the graveyard will be looked upon by the patients in Roscommon as the only place in this country where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest?</P>
      <P>
        <i>No answer.</i>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state what price per statute acre has been sanctioned or submitted by the local authority for sanction for the site of the proposed new hospital in Roscommon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis of the area of land acquired the price per statute acre which has been sanctioned is £115.</P>
      <P>The area acquired was 7.369 statute acres at a cost of £847 8s. 8d. It was proposed originally to acquire 15 acres at £120 per acre. This price was considered excessive and the Board of Health and Public Assistance were informed that the land should be purchased at a more reasonable figure. The vendor then agreed to reduce the price to £115 per acre.</P>
      <P>The land is held in fee simple and is of good quality. Its value to the vendor as an accommodation park for cattle was enhanced by its proximity to the town of Roscommon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that two other sites were offered, both of which are nearer to the town of Roscommon than the one which was chosen? Is he aware that the Local Government Department have rejected as too expensive land of a much more convenient character for labourers' cottages for which £85 an acre was asked? Is he further aware that the gentleman who sold this land to the Department is one of the most notorious supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party in the town of Roscommon?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health <Col N="879" /> if he is aware that the operation of the School Meals (Gaeltacht) Act, 1930, in Beara is at present confined to schools situated within the District Electoral Divisions of Adrigole and Kilcaskan; and, if in view of the necessitous condition of children attending schools outside these divisions he will take steps to have the School Meals Scheme put into operation, by amendment of the Principal Act if necessary, throughout the whole of the schools of the Beara Peninsula, wherever there is evidence of the children attending such schools being underfed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative. I am not satisfied as to the necessity or desirability of introducing legislation as suggested in the second part of the Deputy's question.</P>
      <P>Existing legislation empowers the provision of meals in two District Electoral Divisions in this county but in only one of these have steps been taken to provide such meals, i.e., the Adrigole Division in which meals are provided in five schools.</P>
      <P>In the Kilcaskan Division the school manager has, it is understood, objected to the provision of meals in these schools and it is stated that in the principal school the teacher did not consider that the children were in need of such meals.</P>
      <P>The County Medical Officer of Health in a report to the Department, dated 10th October, 1932, stated that &ldquo;in my opinion, and with the information available, I do not consider that there is a definite necessity for the extension of the provision of the School Meals (Gaeltacht) Act, 1930, to embrace all the Gaeltacht district in this county.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that of the moneys voted for the supply during the current year of native fuel for necessitous households, the sum of £13,000 has been allocated to the Dublin Board of Public Assistance since December last; that under the scheme the Board require the delivery of 450 tons of turf weekly; that none of this turf has yet been made available to the persons for whom it was intended; that the Board are offered by the distributors no hope of having their weekly requirements fully met; and if he will say what steps he proposes to take to assist the Board to get delivery of the required amount.</P>

      <P>The facts are generally as stated in the question. The substantial demand for turf created by the Government's scheme for encouraging its use has produced the position that the only source from which large quantities can at present be obtained for regular delivery in the City of Dublin is the Turraun Peat Works in Offaly, from which the only effective method of transport is the canal. The Canal Company did not find themselves in a position to guarantee to carry regularly 450 tons weekly. The Company, however, have undertaken to provide for the purpose as many boats as possible, and deliveries of turf in Dublin under the scheme have begun.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already explained that the success which has met the Government's scheme has been so substantial that there is only one source of supply left unexhausted, and that is the Turraun Peat Works in Offaly. From that area turf can only be transported by canal. The volume of supply is determined by the carrying capacity of the Canal Company's equipment. The Canal Company are not in a position at the moment to deliver 450 tons per week. They are, however, delivering a very large quantity and they have undertaken to provide as many boats as possible for the purpose of delivering turf in the city. Deliveries under the scheme have begun.</P>

      <P>While that is very satisfactory, if correct, from one point of view, from another point of view it is not so satisfactory. For instance, it is not satisfactory to those people living in the City of Dublin for whom the Oireachtas provided money so as to enable them to receive supplies of turf free. I am now referring to those poor people who are sadly in need of material to build a fire. The Dublin Board of Public Assistance calculate that they require a weekly supply of 450 tons. Will the Minister, in view of what he now says, consult with the Minister for Local Government and Public Health with the object of doing what I asked that Minister to do to-day&mdash;that is, to allow the Board of Assistance to supply coal instead of turf in view of the fact that the Government scheme in respect of turf is not sufficiently effective to supply the needs of the poor people?</P>

      <P>The only turf available in large quantities, for delivery in Dublin in connection with the free fuel scheme, is machine turf, the source of supply of which is outside the limit to which the canal freight of 6/- per ton, arranged under the peat development scheme, applies. As a result of steps taken by my Department the price of this turf ex-works and the cost of canal transport have been substantially reduced. The price of machine turf at the wharf in Dublin of the Turraun Peat Company is 26/8 per ton. This figure is made up as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>This figure is to be compared with the former charge of 34/-. The difference between this figure and those quoted for turf delivered in Dublin under the free fuel scheme is occasioned by merchants' <Col N="890" /> charges for delivery. Representations have been made to merchants regarding the cost of delivery of turf and it has been explained by the merchants that owing to the small unit quantity of delivery (1 cwt.) and the difficulty in many cases of locating and reaching the consignee, the expense of delivery is necessarily higher than in the case of delivery in the ordinary course of trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands and Fisheries (Mr. O'Grady)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take together the Deputy's three questions relative to the estate of G. McK. O'Rorke, County Roscommon:</P>
      <P>The division scheme which has been prepared in this case involves the re-arrangement of some 30 vested (registered) holdings and their enlargement by the division of 680 acres of the adjoining untenanted lands of Curraghdoon and Toghboy. A sum of about £3,000 has already been spent on general improvements (roads, fences and drains) and the draft scheme provides for the expenditure of a further considerable sum on similar works which will be put in hand when the scheme is approved of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="903" /> As regards the Deputy's first two questions, the scheme for the re-arrangement of the holdings and the division of the untenanted land on this estate not having yet received the approval of the Commissioners, particulars as to the fixing of annuities on new holdings and the substitution of annuities for grazing rents cannot be given at the moment.</P>
    <P>I may say, however, that it is intended to give tenants generally, to the fullest possible extent, the benefits of the revision provided for in Part III of the Land Act, 1933, of annual payments which are in the nature of prospective purchase annuities and the Deputy may take it that the tenants on this estate will be given every reduction provided for by the Act.</P>
    <P>As to the concluding question, it is expected that the scheme will be completed and approved at an early date and it is then intended to resume work in respect of the division of the lands. A certain amount of disturbance to tenants in the matter of making roads and fences is inevitable in the rearrangement of holdings, but I am not aware that any undue inconvenience has been caused to the tenants on this estate. The rearrangement of holdings will, of course, be for their benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that two of those tenants&mdash;a man named Kelly and the other man named Kennedy&mdash;have had their holdings pointed out to them as far back as 1931, and since then they have been working these holdings, and that they have been informed as far back as 1931 the amount of the annuities they would have to pay on these holdings? Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware of that? If he is I would like to ask him, with regard to the present charges on these lands as grazing lands, does he know that one of these tenants&mdash;Kennedy&mdash;was informed that the annuity would be £9 1s. 0d., on which he would be entitled to a 50 per cent. reduction, making the yearly annuity £4 10s. 6d., and he would be only liable for half of this for the half year, that would be <Col N="904" /> £2 5s. 3d.? Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that that man has been charged £16 by the Land Commission for the past half year for the grazing of these lands when he should only have been charged £2 5s. 3d. if the allocation was complete? I have a letter here from the Land Commission setting out that no reduction could be made to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was just coming to the supplementary question. I must be excused, because of the grouping of the three questions into one answer. Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that these two men have been unjustly treated in this matter? Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware of these things, that one of these men who should be charged only £2 5s. 3d. is being charged £16, and that the other, who should be charged £3 13s. 3d., has been charged £15?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not picked them out as being differently treated to anybody else, but I want to know from the Parliamentary Secretary does the Land Commission think it is just and fair to charge a man £16 when he should only be charged £2 5s. 3d., and to charge another man £15 when he should be only charged £3 13s. 3d.? Is he aware that were it not for the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary failed to complete the allocation properly in the last three years these men would not have been penalised in this way?</P>

      <P>Up to date, the area acquired for State afforestation in County Donegal is 1,208 acres, of which 496 acres have already been planted. A considerable number of offers from land owners in the county to sell additional lands are under consideration at the moment. State afforestation is not organised on a county basis, and the matter of acquiring and planting land in County Donegal is dealt with exactly as in other counties. It is the practice to acquire suitable blocks of land with the funds available wherever they are offered at reasonable terms. The whole question of large scale expansion of reafforestation throughout the State is at present being examined but it will be some time yet before the plans for such expansion are fully formulated.</P>

I want to know if, in fact, these lands have been in the hands of the Forestry Department for more than two years and that, in fact, no acquisition of land has taken place in Donegal during the period for which the Parliamentary Secretary is responsible. Would he inform us if, during his period in the Land Commission, no land has been acquired in Donegal or no progress has been made with the acquisition of land in Donegal with a view to the extending forestry?

      <P>Order of Business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps you would allow me, before I announce the Order of Business, to refer to an incident that occurred in the House a while ago. I think it is due to the honour of the House that a suggestion that any Party or that any Deputies to-day laughed at the death of any Irishman should not be allowed to pass. I think it would be a disgrace if that were allowed to go out uncontradicted. It is a falsehood. I suggested that the Chair might ask the Deputy who made the suggestion to withdraw it, but the Chair did not do so. I now ask the Chair to permit me to read the official record of the question and the reply which at the time gave rise to this misrepresentation. I have the official report in my hands of the question and the reply which gave rise to this incident.</P>
      <P>Here it is. This occurred at the end of questions:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Burke: Owing to the unsatisfactory nature of the Minister's reply, I beg to give notice that I intend to raise this, and kindred matters, on the Motion for the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;An Ceann Comhairle: This matter only.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Burke: I would like to raise kindred matters; perhaps the phrase &lsquo;matters pertaining thereto&rsquo; would be more appropriate.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Everybody who knows the rules of the House knows that is why there was a smile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>A smile?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. When he asked to raise &ldquo;kindred matters&rdquo; there was <Col N="911" /> a smile&mdash;it was more of a smile than a laugh, in any case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that it was the Deputy's naïveté in pretending that he could raise kindred matters that caused the laugh. Everyone knows that that is the fact.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I call the attention of the President to the fact that recent developments lead us to believe that the cattle quota will come up for revision from time to time. It would seem, so far as the public can see, that our Minister seems to take very little interest in what the revision is going to be. He seems to do very little to try to influence the Government in making the revision to revise it in our favour. It is necessary that at the earliest possible opportunity the Government's position with regard to the matter should be fully explained to the House and the country, and whether they are prepared to enter into trade negotiations with Great Britain in order to secure an adequate quota for our cattle exports, so that the earlier this discussion takes place the better. I respectfully submit that the President ought to give us time to question the Minister for Agriculture on that matter and to afford the Minister for Agriculture an opportunity of answering questions directed to get that information.</P>

      <P>On the Money Resolution, has the Minister anything to say arising out of the submission of the Bill, after the Second Reading, to local authorities? The suggestion was made in the House that what was really wanted was some kind of Bill that the local authorities would make some sort of an objective attempt to use and it was pointed out that it would be only after some actual attempt in the direction of town planning that we would get some idea as to what purpose a Bill of this sort would serve. We would then have some idea what it was going to cost and whether the legislation was sufficient to carry out the objects that a Town Planning Bill should perform. Will the Minister say whether he has referred the Bill in its complete form to local authorities or any other bodies and has he had any recommendations or communications expressing approval of the lines of the Bill? Has he succeeded in getting information <Col N="922" /> that local authorities are going to endeavour to do something when this Bill becomes an Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this Town Planning Bill there are general powers of acquisition and entry vested in the Minister or in the planning authority for the carrying out of schemes. In that connection, I want to raise a matter about which I had some discussion with the Minister at an earlier date. I want to know if it is the policy of the Government to use the powers of this Bill for the purpose of facilitating large housing schemes for tenement dwellers outside the city on virgin soils. I remember I once asked the Minister to express his own opinion as to the comparative desirability of building large blocks of flats within the city boundaries for the accommodation of tenement dwellers as compared with the building of individual houses with very small gardens in the outlying districts. I remember the Minister saying that he agreed with me that the latter remedy was the one that he preferred. Nevertheless, at the present moment we are all aware that very comprehensive schemes are under consideration by local authorities that may afterwards become town planning authorities for the erection of large blocks of flats within city boundaries, and we are aware the expenditure involved in these new schemes may be so great as to make it extremely difficult to promote other schemes for the accommodation of town dwellers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to know if the Minister agrees with me or not in the belief that if we attempt to solve the tenement problem by the erection of large blocks of flats in the city we shall be face to face in twenty or twentyfive years' time with a problem, if not as bad, at least very similar to the problem we have to face to-day? In support of that contention I invite the Minister to consider the Dublin Corporation blocks of flats in Upper Dominick Street. I may add that when these were first built they were admirable and they looked splendid, but the conditions inevitably attendant on tenement surroundings have resulted <Col N="923" /> in these large blocks of flats degenerating into something that is very little better than ordinary tenement houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasKelly" hpid="Mr. T. Kelly Mr. T. Kelly">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know who built them, but they are obviously on a modern scale. There are open staircases and they are in the nature of flats rather than tenement houses. I am very concerned to hear from the Minister what his own view is as a responsible Minister on the respective merits of the extra urban schemes and blocks of flats for the relief of tenement congestion. I believe he is in agreement with me, and the object of my raising the question now is to urge him to take a strong stand for his own convictions. If the experts disagree with him, before he yields to the experts, I ask him to set up a Commission who will examine his own viewpoint and see if, perhaps, it may not be true that the Minister is right and that the so-called experts are wrong. He has in his hands the spending of great sums of money. He is charged with the solution of a great social problem. It will largely depend on him personally whether this job is going to be done in the right way or not. What I am asking him to do is, not to give way to his Departmental experts unless and until he has been convinced by unanswerable evidence and by an insurmountable consensus of opinion that his view and my view as to the correct method of relieving tenement conditions are wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the question of Deputy Mulcahy, I wish to say that after the Bill was introduced it was circulated to quite a large number of public authorities and bodies who, it <Col N="924" /> was thought, would be probably interested in the subject matter of the Bill. As a matter of fact, the Second Reading of the Bill was postponed for a considerable time at the request of some of these bodies&mdash;county councils and other bodies&mdash;so as to give them adequate time to consider the Bill and formulate amendments. I am sorry to say that in the lapse of time since the Bill was first introduced the amount of constructive suggestions we have received has been at a minimum. They were very few indeed. The Bill was submitted, as I say, to a variety of bodies. The Association of Municipal Authorities, as far as I am aware, has not yet replied. We asked them specially to give consideration to the subject matter of the Bill. We have had replies from the Dublin Corporation, the Cork Corporation and the General Council of County Councils. Some few amendments were submitted by these three bodies&mdash;nothing of a very substantial kind, but still helpful suggestions were made. Some suggestions were made by professional organisations like the Institute of Architects and the Builders Societies in Dublin. Some useful suggestions were made which were considered by the Department.</P>
      <P>Outside of these very little interest&mdash; to my thinking, too little interest&mdash;has been displayed in the Bill so far by public authorities. However, it is true that the Bill deals with a matter that is new. Its subject matter is new in this country and, although bodies like the architects and engineers, and some of the premier public authorities in the country give careful consideration to the matter, there has been no practical experience of the working of a Bill of this kind. Therefore, what we are doing this time is trying to get power in law to do a thing about which we have no experience. Probably it will require three or four years working of this Bill, such as it will be when it is put through the House, to enable local authorities to say what advantage it will be to them and to the country as a whole. Then, I am sure that after three or four years working and experience of it, amending legislation of some kind is bound to be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="925" /> On the point raised by Deputy Dillon, I do not think this is the time or place to enter into a discussion on the solution of the housing problem. That is a big problem in itself. It is unquestionably associated with the idea of town planning, but it is not directly touched on in this Bill. The Deputy knows what my own views on the matter are, and I think the House does also. How far I shall be able to make my views prevail with the local authorities, I do not know. I shall do my best with them to try to find a proper solution of the housing problem. However, that is another day's work, and I do not think it would be of any particular advantage in a discussion of this Bill to initiate a discussion on the type of houses to be built in Dublin or in other areas where the slum problem requires an early solution.</P>

      <P>Before Section 11, but in Part I of the Bill, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) No provision contained in a planning scheme shall apply to any land or to any structure on, in, or under any land which is at the relevant date occupied by a statutory undertaker for the purpose of his undertaking so long as such land or structure continues to be so occupied, unless or save in so far as either such statutory undertaker consents under this section to the application of such provision to such land or structure or the Minister by order made under this section directs that such provision shall apply to such land or structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) A planning authority by whom a planning scheme has been or is being made or the responsible authority under a planning scheme may request any statutory undertaker, who on the relevant date occupies for the purposes of his undertaking any land in the area to which <Col N="931" /> such planning scheme relates or is intended to relate, to consent to the application of any provision in such planning scheme to such land or to any structure on, in, or under such land.</P>
    <P>(3) Where any such request as is mentioned in the next preceding sub-section of this section has been made by a planning authority or a responsible authority to a statutory undertaker and such statutory undertaker does not, within two months after the making of such request, either give or refuse the consent mentioned in such request, such statutory undertaker shall be deemed for the purposes of this section to have given such consent at the expiration of the said period of two months.</P>
    <P>(4) Where any such request as aforesaid made by a planning authority or a responsible authority to a statutory undertaker is refused by such statutory undertaker within two months after the making of such request, such planning authority or such responsible authority (as the case may be) may appeal to the Minister against such refusal, and on such appeal the Minister may, if he is of opinion that such refusal is unreasonable, by order declare that the provision the subject of such request shall apply to the land or structure mentioned in such request either, as the Minister shall think proper, without restriction or to such limited extent or subject to such conditions as the Minister shall think proper to specify in such order.</P>
    <P>(5) Before making an order under this section in relation to any land or to any structure on, in, or under any land occupied for the purposes of a railway, canal, inland navigation, dock, harbour, tramway, gas, or electricity undertaking, the Minister shall consult with the Minister for Industry and Commerce in regard to such order.</P>
    <P>This is an amendment to introduce before Section 11 a new section for the protection of statutory undertakings. <Col N="932" /> Statutory undertakers are in a different position from other industrial and commercial concerns. The services which they provide for the public are carried on in pursuance of statutory authority. Where powers have been expressly obtained in that way their rights and interests should be safeguarded. The clause now proposed will afford the necessary protection.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 11, but in Part I of the Bill, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) Any Minister or statutory board having control of land to which this section applies may, if and so far as he or they so thinks or think proper have regard to the purposes for which such land is under his or their control and to his or their primary duty in regard thereto, co-operate with a planning authority or a responsible authority with a view to securing that such land shall be so used and maintained as to conform with the general objects or any particular object of a planning scheme, and may, where he or they so thinks or think proper, enter into an agreement with such planning authority or responsible authority for the purpose of providing for such co-operation and for financial and other matters consequential thereon or incidental there-to.</P>
      <P>(2) Where, in the case of land to which Article 11 of the Constitution applies, the making of leases of such land or, in the case of any other land to which this section applies, the alienation of such land by a Minister or a statutory board is subject to the sanction, consent, or approval of the Minister for Finance, no agreement shall be made under this section in regard to such land without the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3) This section applies to all land which belongs to Saorstát Eireann <Col N="933" /> by virtue of Article 11 of the Constitution and to all land which for the time being is State property or is vested in any Minister or statutory board whether by statute, purchase, gift, or otherwise.</P>
    <P>(4) In this section the word &ldquo;land&rdquo; includes structure, and the expression &ldquo;statutory board&rdquo; means a board of commissioners or other board or body established by statute or statutory order and exercising any function of government or discharging any public duties in relation to public administration.</P>
    <P>Property owned by the State or under the control of any Minister or statutory board would not be subject to any provisions in a planning scheme. The section is intended to provide machinery that where it is deemed proper to do so, having regard to the purposes for which the property is used, an agreement may be made with a planning authority or a responsible authority to secure that the property will be used and maintained so as to conform with the general objects or any particular object of a planning scheme.</P>

    <P>(1) The respective district planning authorities for any two adjoining planning districts or for any three or more planning districts each of which adjoins another or others of such districts may, by a resolution under this section passed by each of such authorities, determine that all such planning districts or specified portions thereof shall become and be a planning region for the purposes of this Act.</P>
    <P>(2) A resolution under this section shall define the area and boundaries of the planning region to be constituted thereby and the name by which such planning region is to be known, and may impose restrictions on the matters to be contained in or dealt with by a regional planning scheme for such planning region or any part <Col N="934" /> thereof, either to secure that any such scheme shall deal only with matters affecting the common interests of the whole of such planning region or for any other purpose.</P>
    <P>(3) A resolution under this section shall not be passed by a district planning authority unless or until the prescribed notice of the intention to propose such resolution has been given.</P>
    <P>(4) A resolution under this section shall not have any force or effect unless or until similar resolutions have been duly passed by all the district planning authorities concerned and all such resolutions have been approved of by the Minister.</P>
    <P>(5) When resolutions under this section have been duly passed by all the district planning authorities concerned and have been approved of by the Minister, the area specified and defined in that behalf in such resolutions shall become and be a planning region for the purpose of this Act, and the regional planning authority for such planning region shall be a joint committee of the said district planning authorities consisting of such number of persons (whether members or not members of any of the said authorities) appointed by the said authorities in such proportions as shall be agreed by the said authorities or, in default of such agreement, shall be fixed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>(6) The Minister may prescribe the time of appointment (including the first appointment) of the members of a joint committee which is a regional planning authority for a planning region constituted under this section, the period for which such members shall hold office, the method of filling casual vacancies in the membership of such committee, the disqualification of members of such committee to cease to be or become disqualified for being members of the district planning authority by whom they were appointed, and the conduct of the business of such committee.</P>
    <P>(7) The expenses incurred by a regional planning authority constituted under this section in the exercise <Col N="935" /> of their powers and the performance of their duties as such authority shall be defrayed by the several district planning authorities by whom such regional planning authority is appointed in such proportions as shall be agreed upon by such authorities or, in default of such agreement, shall be fixed by the Minister.</P>

      <P>This amendment seeks to provide that where the majority of a number of adjoining district planning authorities are prepared to co-operate in setting up a regional planning authority, their efforts shall not be frustrated by one dissenting body refusing to co-operate in any scheme of planning being carried into operation. There is a danger that one of several district authorities, lacking in a proper conception of its duties, might thwart the efforts of progressing neighbouring authorities. There is that danger under the section as it stands. I would ask the Minister, if he cannot accept the amendment, to clarify the section in such a way that any dissenting authority could not have their way as against the majority in deciding on a certain action.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Doyle knows that the whole principle of this Bill is permissive. There is nothing in it, so far as planning schemes are concerned, of a mandatory nature. The Deputy's suggestion would mean changing the whole principle of the Bill. We cannot do that. It may be that, after some years of experience of the operation of this machinery which we are now asking the House to provide for the country, we may be in a position to make mandatory certain sections of this Bill, or certain principles which underlie them. It may be wise to do that, but I would suggest that we have not arrived at that stage yet. Another point is that if we adopt the amendment or an amendment similar to that suggested by the Deputy we might easily put ourselves in the position where we would have a small and relatively unimportant local authority in a position to force a greater body like, say, the Dublin Council, the Cork Council or the Dun Laoghaire Borough Council. Smaller bodies might be in a position to force the greater body to go ahead with a scheme which it did not think wise to adopt. That, I suggest, would not be a wise procedure. The principle, at any rate, is one which is not within the scope of the present Bill, and one which we cannot adopt.</P>

      <P>As the Minister is not accepting the amendment, I assume that he has given it more careful consideration than I have. Does he not see the possibility of the case being reversed? The Minister has given the case of the smaller bodies. Suppose in the case of the Dublin authority they were embarking on some scheme which would be of general benefit in the way of town planning, and they were obstructed by a smaller neighbouring body, what action would the Minister then take? It is not provided for here.</P>

      <P>This is a proposition to insert a new sub-section. Where a contiguous area is added to a planning district and the planning authority for that district does not proceed to make a scheme for its contiguous area or an area including the contiguous area, it is desirable that the contiguous area should be restored to the county health district for planning purposes.

Under the Bill, as introduced, only one publication is required and this is to be in two daily newspapers. The amendment requires three publications in three papers in successive weeks, and also enables two of the newspapers chosen to be local <Col N="940" /> weekly papers so that better publicity can be got in that way.</P>

      <P>A resolution under this section shall not be invalidated by the making of an amendment therein after the giving and publication of notice of such resolution in accordance with this section and before the passing of such resolution, unless the effect of such amendment is to include in the area to which such resolution relates an area which was not so included when notice of such resolution was so given and published.</P>
      <P>This amendment is intended to secure that the resolution as published may be amended at the meeting of the planning authority at which it comes up for publication. It might be found desirable to proceed with a planning scheme for an area less than that specified in the public notice, and if it were so decided the planning authority could pass the resolution with the necessary amendment. The resolution could not be varied so as to include any area not specified in the published notice.</P>

      <P>Where the planning authority by whom a planning scheme (in this sub-section referred to as the existing scheme) was made pass a resolution for the making of a planning scheme revoking, amending, or varying the existing scheme, the Minister may by order revoke such resolution unless the area to which such resolution relates includes an area to which the existing scheme does not relate or in which the existing scheme is not in force.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="941" /> This amendment is moved as it is necessary that the Minister should have the power to revoke a resolution of a planning authority for the making of a planning scheme, revoking, amending or varying an existing scheme where no adequate reasons exist for the action proposed to be taken by the planning authority. The Minister's power to revoke is confined to the case where there is already a planning scheme in force and does not extend to a resolution to make a scheme for an area where no scheme is yet in force. Section 28 of the Bill provides that a planning scheme may be revoked in whole or in part, or amended or varied by a subsequent planning scheme, and Sections 29 and 30 deal with the revocation, or modification of a planning scheme at the request of the responsible authority on the grounds set out in sub-section (1) of Section 29.</P>

    <P>Under the section as it stands a planning authority when it receives an application from a responsible authority for the revocation or modification of a planning scheme could not without due notice pass a resolution for the making of a scheme revoking or amending the existing scheme because <Col N="946" /> Section 20 requires that not less than one month's notice of the intention to pass a resolution deciding to make a planning scheme must be given. An application from a responsible authority based on either of the grounds specified in sub-section (1) of Section 29 would require to be dealt with as expeditiously as possible, and the amendment proposes to make it mandatory on the chief executive officer of the planning authority to give the same notices as are required by Section 20 of the Bill as if the application were a resolution for the making of a planning scheme. After the expiration of at least one month from the publication of the notices the planning authority can be summoned to a meeting to consider the application and decide either to refuse the application or pass a resolution for the making of a revoking or amending scheme as the case may require.</P>

      <Col N="949" /> Before Section 33, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Every planning scheme shall provide for the establishment and maintenance by one specified responsible authority of a register (in this Act referred to as the register) of all such things as are required by this Act to be entered in the register in relation to or for the purposes of such scheme, and shall also provide for the keeping of such register open to public inspection free of charge in a convenient place at all reasonable times, and, where appropriate, for the making of entries in such register by responsible authorities who are not the responsible authority charged with the duty of maintaining such register.</P>
    <P>This amendment is difficult to discuss separately as its object is not clear without reference to other later amendments. It is obviously necessary that claims by a responsible authority either for betterment arising out of particular property or for expenses incurred by them in doing works on property which under the Act are to be done at the owner's cost should be charged on the property. At the same time it would not be equitable that the subsequent purchaser of the property should be made liable for such claim unless he is given an opportunity of knowing of the claim before he completes his purchase. I am introducing a group of amendments, of which this is the first, for this purpose. This amendment provides for the establishment of a register in which such claims must be registered and which will be open to public inspection.</P>

We will have to take it for granted that all people who purchase property will have their attention called to the fact that the planning of the scheme was made according to the rules laid down so that people proposing to purchase the property would examine the register kept in the public office of the local authority for their own safeguard, so that there would be no necessity for any waiver, but that they will take the property as it is.</P>

An amendment to the Second Schedule will be proposed dealing with the matter, and also a new clause which will permit of an appeal from a decision of a responsible authority regarding the design, colour or materials to be used in the erection of buildings and other structures.

      <P>(a) where the land is required for the improvement, in accordance with such scheme, of the frontage of any road or for controlling, in accordance with such scheme, the development of the frontage of any road, or</P>
      <P>(b) where the land is held in separate plots and, by reason of either the inconvenient arrangement or shape of such plots or the multiplicity of interests in such land, it is not reasonably practicable for such land to be developed in accordance with such scheme unless such land is acquired by the responsible authority, or</P>
      <P>(c) where the land is part of the site of a road which has been closed in pursuance of a provision contained in such scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) For the purpose of the acquisition of land by a responsible authority under this section, Sections 203, 214, and 215 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, as amended by Section 8 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1896, and Section 68 of the Local Government Act, 1925 (No. 5 of 1925), shall apply as if those sections as so amended were herein re-enacted and made applicable to such responsible <Col N="954" /> authority with and subject to the modifications made by this Act in the procedure under the said sections.</P>
    <P>(3) A responsible authority may at any time, with the consent of the Minister, sell or let by public auction or private treaty in suitable lots any land acquired by such authority under this section.</P>
    <P>This section will give a very necessary power to a local authority for the acquisition of land in an area to which a planning scheme relates, where such acquisition is necessary for the purpose of securing proper road frontages, or for the proper development of separate plots of land which by reason of either the inconvenient arrangement or shape of such plots, or the multiplicity of interests in such land, cannot be properly developed in accordance with the planning scheme. It will enable a local authority to deal with land which is the site of a road that has been closed in pursuance of a scheme. These are the only additional powers conferred by the Bill on local bodies for the acquisition of land. They are necessary for the proper planning of an area. In all other respects the local authority will rely on their existing statutory powers. Section 32 of the Bill, as amended, makes this position clear. It is therein laid down that a planning scheme shall not assign to a local authority named therein as a responsible authority, the duty of executing any work, undertaking a public service or acquiring any land for any purpose unless such local authority already possess or can be given the necessary powers for the purpose under existing law and the special powers now proposed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 39:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 35 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) Where a responsible authority proposes to acquire (otherwise than by agreement) land for the purposes of a planning scheme, whether in exercise of a power conferred by a statute other than this Act or of a power expressly conferred by this Act, the advertisements mentioned in sub-section (2) of Section 203 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, may be published in any month and, in such case, the notices mentioned in the said sub-section shall be served in the month next succeeding the month in which the said advertisements are published.</P>
      <P>(2) Any enactment, whereby a local authority acquiring land under the Lands Clauses Acts is required to obtain a provisional order or to carry out any other preliminary procedure before putting into force in relation to such land the powers conferred by the said Acts for taking land otherwise than by agreement, shall not have effect in relation to the acquisition by a local authority of any particular land in pursuance of a provision in a planning scheme expressly requiring that land to be acquired by such local authority for the purposes of such scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment proposes to effect a modification in the procedure for the compulsory acquisition of land which I referred to when dealing with the last new section added to the Bill. Under the Public Health Act of 1878 the initial advertisements in connection with the compulsory acquisition of land under that Act can only be issued in the months of September, October or November. Where land is required for the purposes of a planning scheme these advertisements may, if this section is added to the Bill, be issued in any month, and the statutory notices to be served on owners, lessees and occupiers issued in the following month. Sub-section (2) of the section proposes that in the case of land which a provision in a planning scheme <Col N="956" /> expressly requires to be acquired for the purposes of a scheme, the provisional order procedure shall not be necessary. The land shall be definitely acquired by the scheme, and the amount of compensation shall be determined by arbitration in the usual manner. It will be only on rare occasions that a scheme would contain any provision expressly requiring lands to be acquired by a local authority. In most cases land required for any public purpose would only be reserved by the scheme for such purpose as is specified in the scheme, and the duty of acquiring it would devolve upon the appropriate responsible authority in the usual manner. In the event of a scheme definitely acquiring any land, the usual formalities would have to be observed as regards service of notices and the owners, lessees and occupiers would be afforded the same facilities of making objections as they would have if the land were being acquired under the provisional order procedure. The provisions of a scheme will be subject to close examination at all stages of its preparation, and be also subject to the Minister's approval and be laid before the House, and it is considered that the section proposed may be added to the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 40:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 36, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1) Where a planning scheme contains a provision conferring on the responsible authority power to regulate and control (whether generally or in particular areas) the design, colour or materials of structures, any person aggrieved by a decision of the responsible authority made in exercise of such power may appeal from such decision to the justice of the District Court having jurisdiction in the district in which is situate the structure to which such decision relates, and on such appeal such justice may, as he shall think proper, <Col N="957" /> affirm, vary, reverse, or annul such decision.</P>
    <P>(2) A planning scheme which contains any such provision as is mentioned in the next preceding sub-section of this section may contain a provision that the appeal under that sub-section shall lie to a special tribunal constituted in such manner as may be stated in such provision in lieu of the justice of the District Court, but in such case an appeal shall lie from every decision of such special tribunal to the judge of the Circuit Court having jurisdiction in the circuit in which is situate the structure to which such decision relates, and the decision of such judge shall be final.</P>
    <P>(3) The grounds on which an appeal under this section may be brought shall include the ground that carrying into effect the decision the subject of such appeal would involve unreasonable expense having regard to the character of the locality in which is situate the structure to which such decision relates and to the character of the neighbouring structures.</P>
    <P>This section is being introduced in connection with an amendment to the Second Schedule to enable a provision to be inserted in a planning scheme enabling a responsible authority to regulate and control the design, colour and materials of buildings and other structures. Details of this nature could not readily be embodied in a planning scheme. Besides it would be well to have a good deal of latitude in settling questions of this kind on which different points of view are likely to arise, especially in the case of buildings to be erected after the scheme comes into operation. It is, therefore, proposed to allow a scheme to make provision enabling the appropriate responsible authority under the scheme to regulate and control the design, colour, or materials of buildings, subject to an appeal either to the justice of the District Court, or to a special tribunal constituted by a scheme, with a further appeal therefrom to a judge of the Circuit Court. I think the <Col N="958" /> section now proposed will improve the machinery of the Bill and should fully safeguard the interests of all parties concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarSeanDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>This section gives a right of appeal from an order dealing with design, colour, materials, etc. The person aggrieved has the right to appeal to a justice of the District Court. I should like to ask why an appeal to the District Court is provided for. Sub-section (2) states that a planning scheme may contain a provision that the appeal under that sub-section shall lie to a special tribunal constituted in such manner as may be stated in such provision in lieu of the justice of the District Court, but in such case an appeal shall lie from every decision of such special tribunal to the judge of the Circuit Court. I think that in either case an appeal should not be allowed to the district justice or the Circuit Court. An appeal of this kind will not be on a question of law. The Minister himself should have the decision in such cases as he has an expert staff and these are the people who will have the technical knowledge in such a case as that. I think I might go so far as to say that the amendment I have put down would have the support of district justices and Circuit Court judges. Whatever their work may be, I have yet to be told that they are endowed with a knowledge of town planning and that is the duty which you are putting on these justices and judges under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like if the Minister would give us some explanation of this section. The Minister is taking very wide powers under the Bill and in this particular section. The person who is about to erect buildings may be disposed to erect them in brick. The town planning authority may be against brick and in favour of stone. While I have great respect for the District Courts, I do not think that the District Courts are at all a competent authority in such questions as this. I would rather have a special court set up to deal with this special question. It is a very wide power to give to a local authority, but I am not <Col N="959" /> against it. Under this section a local authority can say to a person about to build, &ldquo;You shall erect in stone.&rdquo; That may add considerably to the expense of the building. If the person desires to appeal, the appeal should be to a competent authority and not, with all respect, to a justice of the District Court. He would not be a competent authority to deal with the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Good, if the Bill goes through, the local authority will have power to decide, as the Deputy rightly said, whether a scheme should be in brick, stone, cement or timber, or whatever else they think right or proper. There is a provision in sub-section (2) for a special tribunal, if the planning authorities so decide, and then there is an appeal from that special tribunal to the district justice. This matter, as perhaps Deputy Doyle and Deputy Good are aware, has been discussed with a number of people interested, professionally and otherwise. We have had considerable discussions with them as to the provisions of this particular section, as well as others. We have given it careful consideration and I have gone into it very thoroughly with a number of Deputy Good's colleagues in the building trade and in the architectural profession. I am not quite certain, but I think they were satisfied with this amendment to the Bill. I am not certain that we quite agreed eventually as to whether it should be the Minister or the district justice. As the Minister will have to have the final say in the scheme, he would be in a way prejudging his final opinion on a planning scheme if he were to be the appeal authority on the details of the scheme. Therefore, I think it would not be well for the Minister to be the appeal authority on the details when he would have to be the appeal authority on the final scheme as put up by the planning authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We talked of different ways of meeting the problem. Finally we resolved that the most expert opinion that could be got by the people concerned&mdash;the planning authority, the <Col N="960" /> local authority, and wherever there might be an aggrieved party&mdash;would come before the district justice. They would bring experts&mdash;artists, engineers and architects&mdash;and lay before the district justice all the information that would be naturally at their disposal. District justices may not be highly skilled in art, but I do not see that the Minister would be either, or that he would be any better authority than the district justice, if he had put before him the different points of view of whatever experts might be available. I think the district justices are commonsense individuals with a good deal of experience. The opinion of the average district justice, I think, would be as valuable as the opinion of any other tribunal, taking into account that he would get all the expert evidence that would be available. However, in case there is disagreement there is a further appeal to the Circuit Court. I think it would not be wise to make the Minister the final authority, for the reason I have stated. We are providing sufficiently for an appeal court to make it reasonable to believe that a commonsense decision will be arrived at.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">

      <P>Will the district justice have power to call in an assessor?

To guide him, would you give him power to call in an assessor to advise him on such questions?</P>

      <P>I am not an authority on the courts. I do not know what power the District Court judge has to get an assessor, but I imagine that he could get any expert information that he might require. At any rate, would it not be most likely that the parties to the case before the district justice would each of them submit the best expert evidence they could fee and in that way the district justice, having heard the best authorities they could produce, could give quite as good an opinion as a Minister or anybody else? You might have a Minister who would be colour blind and you might have a <Col N="961" /> district justice just the same. If they have expert evidence, as they are likely to have, they will, I feel sure, give a commonsense decision. If the district justice considered it necessary to get an assessor on a matter requiring expert opinion, I do not know that he would be precluded from employing one; I doubt if he would be.</P>

      <P>Deputy Good's difficulty is not clear at all. Under the provision that is made in this amendment the Deputy's difficulty does not seem to be very clear. Where a local authority has decided that in a certain area brick shall be used in the <Col N="962" /> putting up of buildings, I do not think it is contemplated under this amendment that a person can get a decision from a district justice, from which there would be no appeal, that he can build in concrete or stone. We might have less difficulty in accepting the district justices if we knew what the difficulties are likely to be. I am not able to visualise what kind of difficulty is likely to arise. If difficulties arise which require arbitration it seems to me that the district justice would be put in as arbitrator between the local authority and somebody who feels that at some particular point in carrying out his work he is being wronged by the interference of the local body. I cannot imagine a person going to the District Court to protest against a colour scheme or against a particular material. When a tribunal is being provided for in connection with a special plan I would like to know whether that tribunal will be one suggested by the planning authority.</P>

I agree they have not that power at the moment. Any person can put up any building he likes, composed of any material, and the local authority cannot protest provided that the building conforms with the local by-laws. Under this Bill the local authority can indicate the particular type of materials for a building.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a wide and drastic power and it is essential that we should take precautions to protect the builder so that he will not be put to any heavy expense. In order to do that I am suggesting that the courts which are adequate for a particular purpose are inadequate for the purpose here laid down and I suggest they should be strengthened by giving them the independent advice of some architect who would be appointed as an assessor. <Col N="963" /> That is a way that will commend itself to most people as being fair and reasonable for the solution of the difficulty.</P>

      <P>May I point out that sub-section (3) of the proposed amendment to Section 36 sets out one type of ground on which an appeal may be brought? It says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;shall include the ground that carrying into effect the decision the subject of such appeal would involve unreasonable expense having regard to the character of the locality in which is situate the structure to which such decision relates and to the character of the neighbouring structures.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That kind of question is, I think, one that a district justice is as well qualified as any other man of intelligence or commonsense to give a decision upon, especially as he will have the evidence of very competent people on both sides and it will be largely a question of fact as to the type of structure. I think the district justice will be perfectly competent to give a decision.</P>

      <P>(1) Whenever the responsible authority has served under this Part of this Act a notice of their intention to exercise in relation to any structure or land a power conferred by this Part of this Act, any person occupying or having an estate or interest in such structure or such land may, before the date stated in such notice for the commencement of such exercise of such power, apply to the justice of the District Court having jurisdiction in the district in which such structure or land is situate and on notice to the responsible authority, for an order quashing such notice, and thereupon the justice, unless he is satisfied that circumstances exist entitling the responsible authority to exercise such power in relation to such structure or land in the manner indicated in such notice, may make an order quashing such notice.</P>
      <P>(2) When an application has been made to the District Court under this section, the responsible authority shall not exercise the power mentioned in such notice in relation to the structure or land mentioned in such notice either in the manner indicated in such notice or at all unless or until such application has been finally refused.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), lines 27 and 28, to delete the words &ldquo;justice of the District Court having jurisdiction in the district in which such structure or land is situate&rdquo; and to substitute in lieu thereof the word &ldquo;Minister,&rdquo; and in line 30 to delete the word &ldquo;justice&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we have much the same type of argument in this case. Section 42 provides the right of appeal to a justice of the District Court against an <Col N="965" /> order of a planning authority to exercise their powers under the Act against an owner who has done something in contravention of a planning scheme. The amendment is to substitute an appeal to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health instead of the appeal to the district justice. If the appeal were purely on a matter of law, as I have already pointed out, the latter authority would be the most appropriate to deal with it, but as has already been argued on the other amendments, it is quite the reverse. In the new section proposed by the Minister to be inserted before Section 11, but in Part I of the Bill, the right is given to a statutory undertaker&mdash;that is a gas company, a canal company, or a railway company&mdash;to appeal against a provision in the planning scheme. That is an appeal to the Minister. Therefore, the Minister has set a headline in his own amendment. I suggest that in the case of sub-section (1) of Section 42, the appeal should be to the Minister also, rather than to the district justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the questions the district justice will have to decide under this section will be questions of fact purely&mdash;whether the scheme has been contravened, whether the responsible authority's proposal goes further than what is necessary to remedy the contravention, and perhaps whether the notices have been properly served. These are matters more for the district justice than for the Minister. It is a type of question that the district justice has to decide every day in court. He has no discretion to go into the merits of the scheme or the merits of the provision laid down in the Act. These are purely matters of fact and nothing else&mdash;matters of compliance with the regulations or with the different sections.</P>

    <P>When a resolution for the making of a planning scheme has been passed, a planning authority may grant a general permission applicable to the whole or to a particular part of the area to be planned for the construction, demolition, alteration, extension, repair or renewal of structures of a particular class or classes. As the preparation of a scheme advances it might happen that the general permission given was too wide in character, and that certain structures which were being erected or were likely to be erected, in conformity with such permission, would contravene the provisions of the scheme when made. It is therefore desirable that a planning authority should be expressly empowered to revoke or to modify a general permission, as otherwise, <Col N="968" /> structures erected which did not conform to the scheme would have to be demolished at the expense of the planning authority.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 49:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 51, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) The responsible authority under a planning scheme may, within one month after the date of an award of compensation under the next preceding section of this Act to any person, give notice (in this section referred to as a suspensory notice) to such person of the intention of such authority to take steps to effect or obtain the revocation or amendment of the provision in such planning scheme on account of the coming into operation of which such compensation was awarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="971" /> (2) No award of compensation under the said next preceding section shall be enforceable until the happening of the event specified in whichever of the following paragraphs is applicable, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) if within one month from the date of such award the responsible authority has given a suspensory notice in relation to such award and within four months from the giving of such notice the appropriate planning authority has passed a resolution for the making of a planning scheme to revoke or amend the provision to which such notice relates:&mdash;the coming into operation of a planning scheme made in pursuance of such resolution or the revocation by the Minister of such resolution, as the case may be;</P>
    <P>(b) if within one month from the date of such award the responsible authority has given a suspensory notice in relation to such award and within four months after the giving of such notice the responsible authority has appealed to the Minister against a refusal by the appropriate planning authority of an application for a revocation or modification of the provision to which such notice relates:&mdash;the determination of such appeal by the Minister;</P>
    <P>(c) if, in the case mentioned in the next preceding paragraph of this sub-section, the Minister when determining the appeal requires the planning authority to make a revoking or amending planning scheme:&mdash;the coming into operation of such revoking or amending planning scheme;</P>
    <P>(d) in any other case in which the responsible authority has, within one month after the date of such award, given a suspensory notice in respect of such award:&mdash; the expiration of four months from the giving of such notice;</P>
    <P>(e) in any other case whatsoever:&mdash;the expiration of one month from the date of such award.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="972" /> (3) Notwithstanding anything contained in the foregoing sub-sections of this section, the right of any person to recover the amount of an award of compensation under the next preceding section of this Act on account of the coming into operation of a provision in a planning scheme shall cease on the coming into operation of a later planning scheme by which such provision is revoked or amended, but such cesser shall not prejudice or affect the right (if any) of such person to recover compensation under the said next preceding section on account of the coming into operation of a provision in such later planning scheme.</P>
    <P>This new section is consequential upon Section 29 under which a responsible authority may apply to the planning authority for the revocation or modification of a planning scheme on account of the amount of compensation which has been or is likely to be awarded under the Act, or otherwise in respect of provisions contained in the planning scheme. Where such an application is made on account of the amount of compensation awarded, the section provides that the award shall not be enforceable before the coming into operation of a revoking or amending planning scheme, where the responsible authority gives within one month of the date of the award a suspensory notice under the section to the person to whom the award was made, and within four months from the giving of such notice, the appropriate planning authority has passed a resolution for the making of an amending scheme. If the planning authority fails to consider and deal formally with the application of the responsible authority, and the latter appeals to the Minister under Section 30 of the Bill, within four months from the giving of the suspensory notice, the award shall not be enforceable until the determination of the appeal of the Minister, and where the Minister on determination of the appeal requires the planning authority to make a revoking or amending planning scheme, before the coming into operation of a revoking or amending scheme. If the planning authority fails to take <Col N="973" /> action, and there is no appeal by the responsible authority, the award would be enforceable on the expiration of four months from the giving of the suspensory notice; in any other case after the expiration of one month from the date of the award. If the provision in the planning scheme which gave rise to the award of compensation is revoked or amended, the right of the person to recover the award ceases on the coming into operation of the amending scheme, without prejudice to his right to recover any compensation he may become entitled to on account of the coming into operation of a provision in the later scheme. I recognise there is a certain amount of hardship involved where a person becomes entitled to compensation, and a responsible authority seeks to postpone payment until a revoking or an amending scheme has been approved. On the other hand, there is a danger that planning authorities will not undertake to prepare planning schemes if they are likely to involve the payment of heavy compensation. I feel that it is necessary in this respect to safeguard public funds, and I, therefore, recommend that the section be added to the Bill.</P>

      <P>The amendment contemplates, I think, sir, that a planning authority, having ascertained that the plan which it has adopted will involve such an amount of money and payment in compensation to different people, would wish to change their minds and not go on with it. I think it would be well to assure ourselves that, in accepting this amendment, it does not leave the danger that there will be persons who, because a particular plan was proposed, incurred, perhaps, considerable expense in seeing that they get their rights in the matter of any compensation that might be coming to them as a result of the plan being put into operation. That plan might be cancelled and an alternative plan made, leaving them subject to legal and other costs that they perhaps had incurred in defending their claim for compensation under the original scheme. I ask the Minister if there is a loophole <Col N="974" /> in the Act by which it is possible that persons would find themselves, after the operation of what is proposed by this amendment, liable to pay legal and other expenses that they had to incur in defending their original claim for compensation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 61:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In assessing the amount of any compensation payable under this Act the arbitrator shall have regard to the actual value of the property in respect of which same is claimed during the ten years previous to the date on which the planning authority passed the resolution for the making of the scheme under which the compensation is claimed, and shall not take into consideration any additional value accruing after that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks to save the planning authority from being mulcted in heavy expenses by way of compensation. Any grants that will be made will be conditioned by the costs to the responsible authority. I think the Minister will more or less agree that in Dublin we are accustomed in cases where people are making claims for compensation under these conditions to find that there is a tendency to magnify the amount of their claim. Furthermore, it should be laid down as a principle that compensation should be payable in respect of the actual value of the land and not in respect of its potential value and particularly so when the value when it arises is not the result of the efforts of the owners but is owing to development by the local authority. I would ask the Minister in the interests of the ratepayers to see that there should be some restriction in the Bill whereby the arbitrators could deal with this on the lines of the amendment. This amendment does not deprive any property owner of any value accruing up to the date of the arbitration, but it does prevent <Col N="983" /> them seeking to profit out of whatever development might be made by the local authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise what the Deputy seeks to achieve by this amendment. I know that it is often said that property in Dublin and elsewhere has been sold at too high a price to the local authority when clearing for housing purposes. Under the Bill compensation arising from restriction on control of property, or damage or loss sustained would be determined in accordance with the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, as amended by the Acquisition of Land (Reference Committee) Act, 1925. The principle therein laid down is that the value of the property is to be taken to be the amount which the land if sold in the open market by a willing seller might be expected to realise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Compensation arises not from the making of a scheme, but from the coming into operation of the particular provision in the scheme which imposes the restriction or control, or from which damage or loss arises. A considerable period of time would elapse between the passing of the resolution and the coming into operation of a scheme. I do not think the amendment is equitable. Besides it would be almost impossible to arrive at the actual value over a period of years. The property may have varying values in the period, and the Deputy's proposal would apparently be intended to arrive at an average value. The fairest arrangement is as laid down in the Act&mdash;to grant compensation on the basis of the value of the property as sold in the open market by a willing seller and the amount to be paid for it by a willing buyer. I do not know how we would get the machinery that would enable the arbitrator to discover what the value was five or ten years previously. If such property had been sold in the open market and there had been a record of that sale it would be possible to arrive at the value but such might not happen in very many cases. There is no way of recording the value of property at any particular time <Col N="984" /> except such records of sales. From the practical point of view it would not be possible to lay down general restrictions that the value should be what it was five or ten years anterior as Deputy Doyle suggests. There is no way of doing it except to leave it to the arbitrator to say what the value of the property is if offered for sale in the open market by a willing seller.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarSeanDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not appreciate the view that very often certain improvements are made in a particular area and in that area the owners very often have been keeping this land vacant for many years in the hope that some public development would take place? There are cases in which no attempt at development is made by the owner because he had in view that in a couple of years' time the local body might develop that area. Big bodies move slowly. Take, for instance, the Dublin Corporation. While a great deal of development has been done and is being done, still there are quite a number of sites and they are lying undeveloped for no other purpose than that of waiting to get an enhanced price for them from the Corporation. Though I admit that ten years is a long time to go back, and that it would be hard to know what the value of land was ten years previously, I trust the Minister will see his way to bring in a modified amendment containing the principle in my amendment. I wanted to bring this matter to the notice of the Minister.</P>

      <P>I do not recollect the case that Deputy Cosgrave refers to and I do not know whether the system he refers to is still in operation. I am inclined to think at present that there is no appeal from arbitration even under the Housing of the Working Classes Act. That is speaking from recollection. The present system is in operation for a good while and the system is that the arbitrator's decision is final. If we are to have a planning scheme I suppose there will be considerable delay, as things stand, but if we are to have appeal after appeal the delays will be very great indeed. Arbitrators with whom we are familiar in Dublin have given decisions that I think were as wise and as fair as any decisions given in any court whether High Court or any other. These are men who are experts on these matters and I think their decisions have been regarded, as far as Dublin is concerned, as being fair and just.</P>

      <P>Before Section 64, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Every sum of money payable under this Act to the responsible authority by way of payment for betterment shall, when the amount thereof has been determined by agreement or by arbitration in accordance with this Act, be recoverable by such authority as a civil debt in any court of competent jurisdiction and shall also become and be, as on and from the date on which the amount thereof is so determined, a charge on the estate or interest in property in respect of which it is payable.</P>

      <P>With all respect that is a new subject in Dublin. It is a very questionable thing to say what the value of land in the future may be. There may be a very wide difference of opinion between different authorities upon the subject and to say that any one man can come in and settle that question is, to my mind, going to inflict an injustice upon one side or the other. I think there should be <Col N="988" /> some appeal. Of course, in the past the Minister might argue that the land had been taken, but this is not a similar matter. Here the property owner is going to be assessed for betterment. It is entirely a new question and it is left to the decision of one man. If that decision is obviously unfair&mdash;I am taking an extreme case&mdash;I think the Minister would be well advised to have an appeal on the subject.</P>

      <P>To delete sub-sections (1) and (2) and substitute two new sub-sections as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) Whenever any sum of money becomes by virtue of this Act a charge on any land, structure, or other property, or on any estate or interest therein, the responsible authority shall enter the prescribed particulars of such charge in the register within one month after the date on which such sum so becomes such charge, and, if such responsible authority does not enter such particulars, such charge shall, at the expiration of the said month, be and be deemed always to have been unenforceable, but without prejudice to proceedings by way of action for debt for recovery of the said sum of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="989" /> (2) Whenever the Minister is satisfied, on the application of the responsible authority, that any charge created by this Act on any land, structure, or other property, or on any estate or interest therein cannot be enforced by legal proceedings by reason of uncertainty as to the ownership of such property or such estate or interest the Minister may by order empower such responsible authority to sell the property or the estate or interest therein affected by such charge.</P>
    <P>This amendment provides for the registration of all sums charged on property by virtue of the Act within one month of their becoming so charged. It provides that failure to register is to result in making the charge unenforceable, but such a failure will not prevent the recovery of the amount. The amendment also includes power for the Minister where the title to the property which is the subject of the charge is in doubt to have the property sold, the amount of the charge deducted from the proceeds and the remainder lodged in court.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy Doyle, I move amendment 78:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In Part III, paragraph 5, line 55, to add after the word &ldquo;advertisements&rdquo; the words &ldquo;or public announcements, or the use without the consent of the local authority of loud speakers, gramophones or such like apparatus audible in public parks, highways or places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is any necessity to explain this and the following amendment. They simply propose to add an addition to one of the sub-sections to this Part III of the Schedule. Similar action, I think, was taken on the other side by one of the county councils. The Middlesex County Council passed a by-law which was approved by the Home Secretary restricting the nuisance that is created by a number of loud speakers competing against each other. Anybody who goes about the streets in practically most countries will understand the nuisance that this is becoming. I am willing to admit that even Ministerial control will hardly solve the matter, because occasionally some of the worst offenders are the Government themselves in the noise they make in broadcasting some announcements. I think there should be some effort to limit the nuisance so created. It is not suggested that there should be a prohibition of the use of loud speakers, but that there should be some control. I doubt if the actual provision in Part III actually covers what is required because it seems to me that it is limited to advertisements. Very often there may be no actual formal advertisement, but certain <Col N="997" /> wares may be advertised from the mere noise they are making and may so compete against each other. I hope the Minister will not say that this is already met in the section, because I think the section is too limiting. It is restricted as far as I can see to advertisement, whereas a great deal of the nuisance complained of is not necessarily caused by what can be legally brought within the term &ldquo;advertisement.&rdquo; I hope the Minister will see his way to give it favourable consideration.</P>

      <P>I do not think this question of loudspeakers comes properly within this section or, in fact, within the Bill. Advertisements are in a different position. We have dealt with advertising matters. As to loudspeakers, I do not think you can deal with them here. I think that is a matter for the ordinary law. I do not see how we can bring it in or how it could properly come within a townplanning Bill.</P>

Why is one particular nuisance within the Bill and another kind of nuisance outside the Bill?

      <P>Knowing the Minister's own readiness to couch the lance on behalf of the fallen, I will give him an instance of the kind of thing that will be covered by this amendment. There was at one time in this country a touring van, the occupants of which were concerned to persuade us all to use a particular type of baking powder. It was their practice to go under my window in the square of Ballaghaderreen and play Yip-i-addyi-ay for about ten minutes. Then a gentleman roared through the town that this particular brand of baking powder was particularly suitable for making cakes. Then they played some other music hall numbers. I had no means of preventing them doing so except by way of a common law action to abate a public nuisance, as a result of which I was the sufferer in a peculiar degree. By the time I would have the writ issued the van would be in Norwich or Sutherland. I suggest the amendment would provide the Minister with power to make regulations prohibiting such a performance in the public street and authorising the Civic Guards to deter anyone from using the public streets for such a purpose. I can assure the Minister that a quiet evening is quite as much disfigured by Yip-i-addy-i-ay on a loudspeaker as is <Col N="999" /> a country road by a large advertisement for &ldquo;Oxo.&rdquo; I take it that amendment 79, which I understand we are discussing at the same time, is directed against the painting of signs on the roads or on buildings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to deal with any kind of announcement or advertisement or anything else with which it is necessary to deal. I am prepared to take power to prohibit and to put a stop to announcements on public buildings or hoardings or signs anywhere on the public road and in public places. I do not know about the type of ambulatory obstruction to which Deputy Dillon refers. I am afraid if we are to deal with promenading obstructions of that kind there are some members of the House who might come in for a bad time from the police. I think the nuisance that Deputy Dillon refers to can be dealt with summarily by a policeman. If the Deputy or any member of the public regarded it as a nuisance he could get it very quickly removed by appealing to the police. Personally I have no objection to taking power, but I do not know that it comes within the scope of the Bill. If it does so, I have no objection to taking the enabling power where it is necessary. Personally, I think there is power under the ordinary law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards not coming within the scope of the Bill so far as loudspeakers are concerned, what exactly would the Minister have in mind by audible advertisement? Taking modern conditions into consideration, I would say that the supreme type of audible advertisement is a loudspeaker. The suggestion now is to expand it beyond mere advertisement. Very often you have a bigger nuisance where you have not the express purpose of advertisement. Take, for instance, two neighbouring shops in Dublin competing to see which of their speakers can shout the loudest. That can become a nuisance. What precise form of advertisement has the Minister in mind? I expect that we may except public speaking; perhaps that may be a nuisance too. I would <Col N="1000" /> have thought that the principal form of audible advertisement is the loudspeaker.</P>

I would like to point out that there are such things as political advertisements, which are more disfiguring to the country than anything else.

      <P>So far as I am aware, we have no remedy under the existing police regulations to abate the nuisance to which I referred. Provided the Minister maintains his peripatetic character, he is free to burst into song whenever he pleases. It is only when he comes to a halt on the kerbstone and bursts into song and solicits subscriptions that he comes within the police regulations. I doubt if he sat inside his ministerial car and burst into song that he would come within the police regulations. It is for that reason that the contraptions to which I have referred are not amenable under the police regulations. I have no doubt the Minister, on consideration, will find it is desirable to add what I am suggesting. He has given us an undertaking that if the police regulations are not adequate he will take power.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move that the Bill be read a Second Time. The Bill proposes to effect temporary economies in local administration by the reduction of salaries of local officers on the same lines as the economies effected in the public services under the Public Services (Temporary Economies) Act, 1933, but its provisions will operate from the 1st January, 1934, to the 31st December, 1934, instead of in the current local financial year ending on the 31st March next. The Bill is introduced in response to demands for <Col N="1002" /> economies in the local services voiced by several local bodies. The necessity for the Bill also arises on account of the provisions of Section 11 of the Public Services (Temporary Economies) Act, 1933, which lays it down that deductions shall be made from grants payable to local bodies in the year 1933-34, such deductions to be proportionate to the extent to which monies paid by way of grant are ordinarily applied towards the payment of salaries. There is a further provision that no such deductions shall be made from local government grants where the local body itself makes deductions from salaries to the satisfaction of the Minister. The &ldquo;minimum&rdquo; deductions set out in the Bill are proposed as the deductions which shall be made to meet the requirements of the Act of 1933, and owing to the change in the period of operation of the Bill from that originally contemplated some slight amendments are made in the wording of Section 11 (2) of the Act of 1933.</P>
      <P>A large proportion of the expenditure on local government services and on vocational education and agricultural instruction is met out of Government Funds and the present Bill in effecting reductions in local salaries will secure some economies to the State in connection with the recoupment from Central Funds of the cost of certain local salaries. The terms of appointment and the conditions of service of local officials vary considerably and while the provisions of the Bill define the expression &ldquo;Officer&rdquo; as meaning any person in the employment of a local authority, the Bill contains different provisions to meet the cases of different classes of officers having due regard to the nature of the remuneration and tenure of offices peculiar to such classes. Local officers to whom the provisions of the Bill will apply might be classified as:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) Whole-time officers occupying pensionable positions.</P>
      <P>(b) Part-time officers occupying pensionable posts such as dispensary doctors.</P>
      <P>(c) Permanent part-time officers holding non-pensionable posts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1003" /> (d) Officers employed in a temporary capacity for considerable limited periods.</P>
    <P>(e) Persons employed to discharge occasional services.</P>
    <P>The salaries payable to local officers may be classified under the following headings:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1) Scale salaries with cost-of-living bonus varying half-yearly in accordance with variations in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>(2) Inclusive fixed salaries in many cases determined a number of years ago when the cost of living was much higher than at present and fixed at the time with due regard to the then cost of living. Such salaries may sometimes include a temporary allowance generally regarded as a bonus, but not varying and, as a rule, much less than a bonus calculated with reference to increase in cost of living. As such allowances are not subject to variation, they will be regarded under the Bill as part of the fixed salaries.</P>
    <P>(3) In some cases officers, with either salaries carrying cost-of-living bonus or inclusive salaries also enjoy other allowances or benefits given otherwise than in money.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, proposed to fix two scales of reductions in salary, one for officers with salary carrying bonus which has varied regularly in accordance with the cost of living, and another for officers on inclusive salaries. In the case of officers with salaries and bonus varying in accordance with the cost of living, the scale of reduction will be the same as that applicable to civil servants under the Public Services (Temporary Economies) Act, 1933. For local officers with inclusive salaries, the reductions will be on the scale laid down in Part II of the Schedule to the Bill. In these cases the amount of salary exempted from special reductions will be fixed at a lower figure than that fixed for officers whose emoluments have varied with the fall in the cost-of-living bonus, so as to secure a reduction that <Col N="1004" /> would correspond approximately with the reductions in salary caused by the fall in bonus, and by the special reduction in emoluments proposed in Part I of the Schedule.</P>
    <P>Special provision is made to meet the cases of officers with remuneration made up partly of a salary carrying a variable bonus or allowance, and partly of a fixed salary. In such cases that part of the remuneration which is variable, together with the salary upon which the variable amount is calculated, is subject to the lower rate of reduction set out in Part I of the Schedule, while the fixed portion of the salary which has hitherto suffered no reduction will be subject to the higher rate of reduction provided for in Part II of the Schedule. In the case of persons employed to discharge occasional services, such as engineers or architects employed for particular works, the scale of reduction is fixed at 5 per cent. Fees received by a local officer from whatever source are to be reckoned as salary, and for this purpose each local officer will be required to submit an estimate showing his total emoluments from all public sources, and where such emoluments consist partly of fees, an estimate of the probable amount of such fees or other remuneration received during the financial year. Where emoluments are payable by two or more local bodies the total ascertained deduction will be shared in proportion to amounts payable by each body. Any cases of dispute will be determined by the appropriate Minister, whose decision will be final and binding.</P>
    <P>In the case of dispensary doctors, a special provision is included in the Bill to the effect that £50 of their annual salary shall not be taken into account in the calculation of the deductions. The scales of deductions which I have now reviewed are set out in the Bill as the minimum deductions required to be made in the present year, but the Bill gives further power to the local authorities to make such deductions additional to the minimum deductions as they may in each case think proper, provided that any additional deduction so made shall be subject to the sanction of the Minister.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister one or two questions before we enter on the debate? The first is, can he indicate what proportion of the moneys that he expects to be saved by this Bill will go in relief of rates and what proportion will go in relief of the Treasury? Another question is: am I correct in understanding from what he said that if this Bill were not passed, certain deductions would be made from the grants to local bodies under the Public Services (Temporary Economies) Act that has already been passed and that consequently local bodies would have to find further moneys from the rates to take the place of those deductions and pay the extra salaries that would continue to exist if this Bill were not passed? Thirdly, it would interest me to hear what local authorities there are who have, as the Minister has said, put in a demand for a Bill of this character.</P>

I have read a good number of resolutions&mdash; perhaps copies could be obtained&mdash; passed by local authorities. In some cases the local authorities have actually proceeded to make deductions. In some cases the deductions they made were, in my opinion, too severe, and not fair to the officials concerned. That is one question. On the second question, the Exchequer pays quite a considerable sum of the expenses of local authorities under certain Acts. It provides a considerable amount of the salaries of officials under public health and other Acts. If this Bill were not passed and the local authority had to suffer the reduction that will be <Col N="1006" /> made under the Act passed last year, what proportion of that would fall on the local rates or on the Exchequer, I cannot tell you.</P>

      <P>That is not the question, sir, which I put. The Minister has put two of my questions together. The question I put was with regard to the savings expected to be made under this Act, if we pass it. What proportion of those savings would go to the relief of the ratepayers and what proportion to the relief of the Central Exchequer?</P>

      <P>And the other question that I asked I understood the Minister to reply to by a nod&mdash;that if we fail to pass this Bill the county councils would have to find from some source other than the Central Fund certain moneys which up to the present they have been getting from the Central Fund owing to the operation of the Public Services (Temporary Economies) Act which we passed last year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so. If we fail there will be certain deductions made under last year's Act. My belief is that in most of the cases the local authorities will save themselves from putting any further additional tax on the ratepayers by cutting, probably to a greater extent than proposed by this Bill, the salaries of the officials.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will, perhaps, excuse us when we say it is extremely difficult to understand what the exact operation will be. I should like to put a concrete question to the Minister, which, perhaps, he will be able to answer. Take a dispensary doctor who is a medical officer in a town in County Meath, with a total emolument from the public authority of £450 per annum. If the local authority takes £50 a year off that medical officer by way of economy under this Bill, how much of that £50 will go back to the Exchequer through <Col N="1008" /> one fund or another, and how much of that £50 will be applied to a reduction of the rates in County Meath?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all it is not proposed to take anything like £50 off the salary of a medical officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I took a round figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have to see what proportion of the salary of the medical officer comes out of the Central Fund. I think round about 50 per cent. of his salary comes from the Central Exchequer, but I cannot give you the exact figure at present. The amount of recoupment granted to a local authority under the various Acts differs. The percentage that would be saved to the Exchequer would be small in the case of a salary where 50 per cent. is paid by the Central Exchequer and 50 per cent. by the local authority. If the Deputy likes to leave the question over, I will get two or three examples; taking medical officers and any other officers whose salaries are paid partly by the Central Exchequer and partly by the local authority, I will get a few examples.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>So it will be about 50 per cent? For every £10 deducted £5 would go to the Exchequer and £5 to the relief of rates? In the case of agricultural committees and technical education committees, are we to understand that any reductions made in the salaries of officers are going back to the Exchequer in toto under Section 11 of the 1933 Act?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to utter a word of protest against the general features of this Bill and against some of the features that are most striking in it as compared with a somewhat similar Act that was carried last year. It seems to me that the House ought to consider very carefully the matter before it adopts any measure which tends to interfere with the security of public servants under local authorities. Anything which interferes with their security is bound to interfere with the efficiency of the service which we demand from these highly important officials. Next to the administration of <Col N="1010" /> the Civil Service, there is nothing more important to the public services of the country than the work of the officers of local bodies. The Minister will admit that one of the greatest attractions in the local service is the security which candidates obtain by entering that service. If there is anything interfering with that security it is likely to interfere with the efficiency of the service administered by the officials.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the Bill now before the Dáil has certain vicious points in it which make it a more dangerous measure from the public point of view than the Act which was carried last year. I merely wish to refer briefly to this now. No doubt there will be opportunities for a fuller discussion at a later stage of the Bill. In the first instance the maximum deduction is to be compulsory. The local authority must make a deduction of a certain amount plus any further deduction that they may think fit to vote subject only to the sanction of the Minister. In last year's Act certain scales were laid down and those affected by it knew at once what would be the amount of the deduction. But under the present Bill those affected will have no knowledge of how much they will have deducted from them by the local authority. They will not know it until the Minister and the local authority have made their deduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again not only is the maximum to be at the discretion of the local authority but the local authority is to deal with each individual case separately. There is no uniformity in dealing with the officials of the same class. The local authority may have an opportunity of picking out an unpopular official and penalising him specially, subject only to the sanction of the Minister. It is quite impossible for the Minister to be aware in every particular case of the considerations which weigh with the local authority. While one admits that the sanction of the Minister affords a certain control and while many officials would be quite satisfied with the sanction of the present Minister it is putting into the hands of an officer out of immediate touch with the officials concerned an <Col N="1011" /> immense power to make alterations in the conditions of service. This seems to me a vicious point in the Minister's Bill and I think it right to enter a protest against it at the first opportunity. I think it right to mention that the Minister has made special concessions to dispensary medical officers. We are grateful for that concession and I hope that when the Bill comes before us the Minister will go a little further. These are the classes in which I am particularly interested. I hope he will see his way to give some consideration to the equally deserving classes&mdash;the whole time medical officers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In reading this Bill and taking it in association with the recent legislation and the activities of the Government, the very first question that occurs to my mind is what is the idea or the intention behind it? It is called an Economies Bill and the House is called on to support it in the interests of economy. Now if there is any characteristic lamentably lacking in every Act of the present Government it is the absence of an honest or genuine attempt to economise. If this Bill were introduced as a sub-section or as portion of a genuine economy campaign I would be inclined in spite of its injustice to appreciate the actions of the Government that was genuinely standing for economy and in order to show that appreciation to support a Bill of this kind. But this Bill is merely so much humbug. It is merely participating in a big piece of hypocrisy for anybody to support this Bill as an economy measure and as any indication of a desire for economy on the part of the present Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While hardworking and not overpaid officials throughout the country are being victimised by this Bill we have a Government inflated in every Department. We have a Government starting new services&mdash;a political army, a political police force are being built up throughout the country and no breath or suggestion or one word about economy. There is no suggestion that the money is not there and is not there in plenty. With this rapid expansion <Col N="1012" /> of all the services of the State with political armies and political police&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister will allow me I am referring to the orgy of extravagance that has characterised this Government since it took over office as evidenced by the increased burden of taxation and the greatly swollen administration in their anxiety to please people throughout the country. That may be all very well and that may be very commendable but it does not show either a desire or an interest for economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we are asked to throw the cheap and tawdry mantle of economy over a Government whose main feature is extravagance. We are asked to do it by supporting a Bill such as this, and in a half-hearted fractional manner, the bribe is held out to the public that it is going to assist the local rates. If the Minister or his Government were the least bit concerned about the local rates they would not have filched £22,000 from each county council in this country. We know that the relief given by the agricultural grant was filched from the local bodies. That is ample evidence that the Government is not in the slightest extent concerned with the rights of the ratepayers. It is the other fraction the other half of this economy with which we are concerned. Officials are to be victimised right throughout the country in order to provide more funds for the central services, in order to swell the pool available for the inflation of services and for the creation of new services. This fund is to be contributed to by the local officials, by dispensary doctors <Col N="1013" /> and by the rate collectors throughout the country. It is to be made up by deductions from officials of county councils or boards of health. Before anybody supports a Bill of this kind they must support it as a just measure in its application to the individuals concerned. I admit that since the change of Government every action has been taken calculated to break and burst and bankrupt beyond any hope of recovery the farming community in this country.</P>
    <P>Admitting all that I do not think there is any farmer in the whole country who in effect is as hard hit as the dispensary doctor practising in the rural area. His main source of income from private patients, mostly farmers, is totally removed on account of the financial pressure which is hitting the farmers themselves. His income from his private practice has disappeared and now we are cutting the only thing that remains to him&mdash;his salary.</P>
    <P>If you take the individual rural doctor though his usual source of income has gone, that does not mean that he will have to travel a mile less. There is not one of them who has not by his action and practice over the last 18 months shown that the man with the softest heart and the most human make-up in the countryside is the doctor. The farmers are broken and none of them in a position to pay a fee. Still there is no case throughout the whole length and breadth of the country of the farmer or of his wife and children left unattended because they have no money to pay the doctor at the end of his journey. By every private patient that the unfortunate doctor gets to-day he is losing money. Yet men in this Assembly, knowing the circumstances and knowing in their hearts that what I say is true, are asked to attack the last source of living that these men have, and to lop it further, and to take the last ounce of blood from those individuals up and down the country, and for what? In order to keep a Fianna Fáil administration in this country; in order to throw the cloak of economy over a Government which has been reckless and extravagant in regard to the expenditure <Col N="1014" /> of public money. When sacrifices were demanded two years ago, when there were better times, the sacrifice was demanded for all. If sacrifices have to be made now let us at least consider the proper distribution and incidence of the sacrifices. There are big salaries, there are medium salaries and there are small salaries. There are people who lost more than the maximum amount of which they could be deprived under this Bill already. Normally the country doctor's source of income was about one-third salary and two-thirds practice. Two-thirds of his income has therefore gone already. Now he is to be cut as though his whole source of income came from his salary and he is asked to make his contribution. Deputies know there is no country doctor in Ireland who could afford to allow his salary to be cut by five shillings a year as things are. We have this allowance exemption of £50. These men if they have motor cars have to run them all over the place for the benefit of the poor. Fifty pounds spread over motor licence and compulsory insurance increased by 25 per cent. You find £34 is gone by way of taxes and insurance before the car goes out on the 1st January. Making allowances for depreciation that particular offer is either a tragedy or a joke. The least that should be done under this Bill is to exempt his class from every one of these.</P>
    <P>Then you have the position of the rate collector. His was a comparatively easy job when people were prosperous, and when no more than one visit was required to get the rates from each individual. But with the depression all over the country now, and, particularly the depression amongst the farming community, the rate collector has to call and call again on certain individuals before he can collect a fraction of his rate. Every one of his journeys cost him time and money. His income is reduced by virtue of the very expenses he has to incur by more work and more travel. His income is reduced by a quarter on the loss of poundage because less rates are coming in. Now under this Bill the amount of poundage will be further reduced. Even political medical <Col N="1015" /> officers of health that the Ministers called attention to have to pay their contribution to the Fianna Fáil Government under what is called the economic war. Medical officers of health are not exempt from income tax and from cuts and whatever contributions they make or are called upon to make. They are not calling for sacrifices at the other fellow's expense. Whatever economy is required in the national struggle will be contributed to as cheerfully by them as any other classes of the community, and more generously than any sacrifice that has ever been made by members of the Front Bench opposite. It is rather cheap for anyone carrying on a war from an armchair in Merrion Street to twit those in the trenches, or those who are casualties in the trenches. I accept that form of twitting from anybody who has made his contribution to what is called the national effort, and the national economic war, but it comes badly from people who are by legislation exempt from making any contribution to throw these things in the teeth of anybody else.</P>

It is a fact that under this Bill and its predecessors every person paid a salary over a certain figure is cut by the income tax he pays upon that salary. Every person paid a salary over a certain figure in this State has got to have his salary cut either under this Bill or the other Bill, with the exception of the 12 apostles of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <P>This Bill harps back in Section 20 to the previous Bill. If this Bill is introduced with a genuine desire to help local councils, the more manly way, the fairer and more reasonable way would be to restore the grant that has been withheld from these councils. If this Bill is introduced purely to cut the salaries of certain individuals, then we should satisfy ourselves that by cutting those salaries there is some return to the State commensurate with the suffering which we inflict on those individuals. This Bill will bring in to an ordinary county council possibly £1,000 per year, probably very much less. There will be some 30 or 40 individuals very harshly treated in order to secure that amount. Some 30 or 40 individuals will find it impossible to look their baker, their butcher, or any one else in the face if they are subjected to the economies required in this Bill. Some 30 or 40 individuals in different counties will have to take little children away from boarding schools.</P>
      <P>There are individuals in every county who will have to reduce the provision they have made for posterity, who will have to cash in or reduce their insurance premiums. A salaried man more than any other individual in any community has to make provision for posterity through the medium of life insurance. His salary comes with regularity. It is laid out with regularity; so much for school fees, so much for household expenses, so much for life insurance. When an unexpected bolt like this is hurled at him in one of those directions economy has got to be practised, and if it is not practised in one of those set directions a headline is taken from this type of Bill and economy is practised by going down to the kitchen and reducing the meagre wages of a servant girl; dismissing a servant lad who is merely pottering round the grounds; or doing with two servants instead of three, or one instead of two, or none instead of one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Remember that through this Bill we are heavily victimising, in the main, the <Col N="1018" /> dispensary doctors. If you remove the dispensary doctors from this Bill in any county what is left is not worth the paper the Bill is printed on. You are hitting every one of those doctors, and you have to justify your action in private before those individuals. There are none of them rogues. Any single one of them will show the way that his income has declined, will show you that he is hardly able to keep his motor on the road as it is. If that motor goes off the road it is not the dispensary doctor who will lose the most; it is the unfortunate poor people in that area. If the dispensary doctor takes his headline from this Bill and passes on the economy, it is some little maid or some young lad, with the great wave of financial depression that is rolling over the country, that is going to be docked or dismissed. And all this for the sake of £40,000 a year divided as between the central revenues of this State and 26 county councils and boards of health. It is an insult to the name of economy to bring in a Bill of that particular kind. It is an insult to the very name of war to pick out as your victims the most helpless and most defenceless people in the community. I sincerely hope that from all sides of the House there will be such a volume of disapproval of this Bill that the Minister will see the point in withdrawing it, and that instead of economy by way of victimization, by way of cuts, we shall have an attempt at or a plan for economy by means of retrenchment. When all is said and done, that is the only real economy possible in Government administration.</P>

      <P>I had occasion to criticise Fianna Fáil economics recently. I thought it was one of those qualified blessings of having a man who is admittedly a distinguished mathematician as President of the Executive Council that in the land annuity dispute we undertook the rather tricky task of subtracting £8,000,000 from £3,000,000. We are told that we kept at home here £3,000,000 per annum in respect of the land annuities. A conservative estimate of the cost of that operation to the people of this country would be <Col N="1019" /> £8,000,000. The answer to the sum of subtracting £8,000,000 from £3,000,000 is Fianna Fáil prosperity. To-day we are introduced to Fianna Fáil economy. I do not mind admitting openly that in 1932 I was fooled, like many another respectable citizen of the State, by Fianna Fáil orators going round the country declaring that the Cumann na nGaedheal Government were bleeding the farmers dry, and that they would reduce expenditure in this country, without interfering with the social services or the salaries of any men, by £2,000,000 per year without the slightest difficulty. In fact, the plan to do it had been all made out, and it was only necessary to give them a chance and they would produce the plan and economies would ensue. Instead of that we discovered that national expenditure rose by £6,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we find what calculation has to be made in order to arrive at what Fianna Fáil conceives to be economy. We can devote ourselves for the rest of the evening to the task of subtracting £6,000,000 from £40,000. Politicians who embark upon a task of that kind remind me of the gentleman that the Deputy for West Cork once spoke of who was quite sincere in the belief that he was the square root of minus one. A Government that tries to fool the people into believing that they are seriously engaged in the work of economy, when they increase national expenditure by £6,000,000 and dock the salaries of dispensary doctors and local officials to the tune of £40,000, are fit for the place which is at present inhabited by the gentleman who sincerely believes that he is the square root of minus one. The people of this country can be fooled, and it is something in their favour that they can be fooled once, but that there is a limit. When they have studied the figures of Fianna Fáil economy for a while they will come to realise that of all the hypocritical gestures that have been made since Fianna Fáil came into office, this Economy Bill is the most hypocritical of them all. There was a time, I believe, when, struggling with adversity, Fianna Fáil was doing its <Col N="1020" /> best at the same time to redeem some of its promises. Is there any honest man in this country who believes that the purpose of this Bill is economy? Is there any honest man who does not know that the tide of feeling in this country is rising, and that no Fianna Fáil Deputy can appear in his constituency without being upbraided&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The ratepayers are to be saved £40,000. Fianna Fáil, in the fulness of its heart, has decided that the contribution of about 1/6 a ratepayer per annum is to be made towards the relief of the farmers of this country. This economy will result in the saving to the individual ratepayers of about 1/6 per annum. This is from the Government that is exercising its benevolent attention on the trade of this country. The average ratepayer, the average man who is engaged in a small way in the agricultural industry is the type of man who is concerned with our everyday trade. He is going to be saved 1/6 per annum. As against this he can pick up the trade returns since Fianna Fáil came into office&mdash;they were published to-day. <Col N="1021" /> I am going to read them for the Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party. When Fianna Fáil came into office our total trade was £87,000,000 and the adverse trade balance was £13,386,000. After 12 months of Fianna Fáil blessings trade had declined to £69,000,000 and the adverse trade balance had risen to £15,633,000. After another 12 months Fianna Fáil was determined to be consistent in one thing, in any case. Our trade had fallen to £55,000,000 and the adverse trade balance was still rising. To-day we have reached the splendid position in which the adverse trade balance is coming within measurable distance of the total sum of our exports. If we have another 12 months of Fianna Fáil Government the adverse trade balance will be greater than the total sum of Irish exports to foreign markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government that is doing that is the Government that has the effrontery to come forward here and say that in the interests of economy and of the people they propose to reduce the salaries of the servants of public authorities by such a sum as will bring in approximately £40,000. There was a time when economies were called for on a different ground than that of the general principle of economy. Everyone was called upon to bear a share of the burdens until the economic war was over. A few of us were fooled by that plea. Not many members of the Fianna Fáil Party bore any share of the burden. Not many of the gentlemen who are concerned to-day to reduce the salaries of public servants bore much of the burden. But a great many people in the country, some willingly, some unwillingly, did bear their share of the burden in the belief that the economic war was going to be settled. What was their astonishment when they were told by President de Valera that he thanked God he had got rid of the British market? What was their astonishment to discover that what President de Valera was up to apparently was to get rid of the British market and he was glad it was gone? What was their further astonishment to hear from the Minister for Justice, speaking in the West of Ireland, that he did not want to <Col N="1022" /> end the economic war? Having persuaded large sections of the community to make material sacrifices in order to facilitate the Government to bring the economic war to an end, having fought an election campaign in 1932 on the cry &ldquo;Give us a clear majority and we will soon settle the economic war,&rdquo; we now discover the President of the Executive Council is glad to get rid of the British market and the Minister for Justice does not want to end the economic war. He wants to see it go on to the finish regardless of the effect it is having on the very people whom the Minister for Local Government says he is so solicitous about in connection with this Bill.</P>
    <P>Was there ever a more flagrant act of hypocrisy in the history of the public life of this country? You rob the people of everything they have got, you wreck their trade and deprive them of their means of livelihood, you reduce them to a condition in which many of them are unable to pay rates at all, and you come along with your beggarly 1/6 and offer that to them as compensation for the damage you have done. The Irish people are a patient people, and they are a humorous people. I trust to God their humour will overcome them before their patience gives out. I sincerely trust they will resort to the expedient of laughing Fianna Fáil Deputies out of their constituencies before their tempers encourage them to chase them out.</P>
    <P>We were told that Fianna Fáil was to usher in a time of peace and plenty. All Fianna Fáil has offered us, so far, is a growing certainty of bankruptcy, the promise of black bread, the promise of light beer, the promise of low wages. As the weeks roll by the prospect grows of the bread becoming blacker, the beer lighter and the wages lower. The prospect grows of our people being driven down to a lower and lower standard of living by the present Government. At the same time, the Government puts up the hypocritical defence that they are doing everything they can do in the cause of economy. The fact is that this Government is squandering the resources of <Col N="1023" /> the people in the prosecution of an imbecile campaign against Great Britain, not in the interests of Ireland, but for the glory of certain distinguished politicians. It is an insult to the people, under those circumstances, to introduce a Bill of this character which merely accentuates the rapidity with which our people are being driven down to a lower standard of living.</P>
    <P>If I am any judge of the Irish people, they will recognise it for what it is. They will realise that it is merely a fraudulent attempt on the part of the Fianna Fáil Government to cover up its true character, as the most extravagant Government that ever appeared in this country and they will endorse our action in doing what we can to prevent the passage of this Bill. Let me say that I agree with Deputy Dr. O'Higgins that if this Bill were part of a studied and honest scheme for the enforcement of economy throughout the public services, this Bill would deserve serious consideration. It would be a Bill which I believe might be modified and improved to become a useful instrument. I believe in economy in public administration. I believe in reasonably fair wages for a fair day's work. I believe it is the duty of any Government to conserve the resources of the State with even far greater care than they would conserve their own resources, but it is because I recognise that this Bill is nothing but an attempt to persuade the people that a Government is an economical Government which is in fact a wildly extravagant Government, which is in fact a Government that has absolutely no regard for the best interests of the people, that I am opposed to it. In my opinion, therefore, to support this Bill would be to help the Government to throw dust in the eyes of the people. I think the people should be shown that this is no more than hypocrisy and fraud and, as such, should be rejected by this House.</P>

      <P>I am rather amazed at some of the statements I have listened to for the last 20 minutes, coming from professional gentlemen. We are charged in this House with not knowing <Col N="1024" /> the conditions in the country. The people who make that charge have very short memories or think that we have very short memories if they expect us to forget the challenge that was issued by Deputy Dr. Ward to their leader within the past week or so, which they &ldquo;funked,&rdquo; and which they dare not accept. Listening to their speeches, it strikes me that they think more about the six months old calf than they do about a six months old child. It may be right that we cannot export cattle, but neither can we export children. They should seriously consider what we are doing for the country in trying to get people, who are at present unemployed, absorbed in employment. I heard Deputy Dillon deploring the cutting down of salaries, because public servants will not be able to use the luxurious motor cars to which they have been accustomed in the past. That was really what his speech amounted to. That is just in keeping with the ridicule I heard thrown on an Irish industry, the industry of turf production, in the interests of English coal. We are told that this will only mean a small saving to the country and that the people did not desire it. I, for one, at the General Election of 1932, and also at the last General Election, stated that the salaries that were being paid to local officials were more than the people could afford to pay, and I say I am here to-day to support the Bill just as I am prepared to support other pledges that I gave on that occasion. I say I have been attending meetings all over the country, and the only feeling that I could discover was that the people thought that the Government were not going fast enough. I say that we are palliating and conciliating our opponents more than we should. We should take our courage in our hands in dealing with such exhibitions of temper and such exhibitions of statesmanship as they offered us here to-day. I say that the Government should proceed with their programme in the interests of the people and refuse to tolerate in future any such scenes in the House or outside it.</P>

      <P>If this Bill were an honest attempt to economise, one <Col N="1025" /> might be tempted to support it, but, in reality, this Bill is an attempt to substitute a penny for the &ldquo;bob&rdquo; of which the Government has robbed the farmers and ratepayers in this country. It is an attempt to hoodwink the farmer into the belief that you are giving him something by reducing salaries throughout the State by £40,000, whereas, on the other hand, the Government did not shed a tear or show the slightest regret when they robbed the farmer of the £450,000 odd which they deducted from the agricultural grant last spring. I understand that they propose to do the same in the coming Budget. I do not believe that the people of this State will be hoodwinked by this sort of make-believe economy. Side by side with the introduction of this measure we had the exhibition the other day of the provisions of new jobs-lay commissioners at £1,500 or £1,600, together with new jobs for customs officials, untrained men, at £300 and £400 each. There are other jobs in the new services that the Ministry have created. There is no talk of economy in these cases. Because, forsooth, you propose to give the ratepayer a ½d. or a ¼d. reduction in rates, these economies in the salaries of local officers must take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one might say a word in favour of one particular type of servant, it is the country doctor. Not even the most ardent Fianna Fáil supporter will deny that the country doctor does his duty, or that the country doctor's income has fallen by 50 or 60 per cent. owing to the contraction of his private practice as a result of the legislation carried by the Party opposite. The country doctor's salary will scarce suffice to provide the method of transport which the Deputy who has just spoken derides. A motor car for a doctor! A doctor needs a motor car in these days of rapid transport, and their miserable salaries would not go very far with them if they had not some private practice to supplement them. That private practice is now strictly limited. If there was a general all-round attempt at economy, and if all sections of the people were asked to make a <Col N="1026" /> sacrifice, as the farmers and others are doing, something might be said for this measure. But in the guise of a temporary economy by this wildly extravagant Government there can be no argument for the Bill.</P>
    <P>A Government which has ruthlessly spent eight or ten million pounds of the taxpayers' money more than was spent in normal times, comes along now with a paltry Economy Bill to save £40,000. The farmers of the country are not going to be hoodwinked by such bluff as this. There are means by which this Government can economise. The methods of economy have been pointed out to them time after time, but it has fallen on deaf cars. There might be a restoration to the farmer of his market. If there was, the farmer would not need this 2½d. economy the Minister is proposing now. He would not grudge these salaries to the officials, or even increased salaries if his position were left as it was in 1932, not to speak of any improvement in it. I think that the real motive for the introduction of this measure, as other speakers have said, is to try and persuade the people of the country that this Government is at last getting a glimmer of sense, and that they are beginning to embark on a period of economy. If one were satisfied that that were so one might speak more kindly of this Bill, but there is no evidence that this extravagant Government is determined to embark on a new line. Rather is there evidence every day, in their speeches and elsewhere, that they are tending to the line of increased expenditure in every Department rather than to reduction. To come at such a time as this and ask the people of this House to vote for such a measure is an insult to the intelligence of Deputies in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is logically and inevitably connected with the Public Services (Temporary Economies) Bill which we dealt with in this House last year, and which I supported. I have no regrets about having supported that Bill, but the moral position of the Government, alike in introducing that Bill and this Bill, is extremely weak, for various reasons. The principal <Col N="1027" /> reason is that they have been, and continue to be, wildly extravagant, and it is very hard to expect any public servants to reconcile themselves to cuts of the character that are being imposed when they see the Government so extravagant in other directions. The second weakness in the Government's position is that they have failed to treat the members of the Oireachtas, and even&mdash;I would say in spite of what the Minister for Local Government said a few moments ago&mdash;the members of the Government themselves along the same lines as they were treating public servants.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to waste much time upon this particular aspect of the matter, but I should just like to say this. We heard a great deal of the sacrifices that the Ministers made in regard to the reduction of their remuneration, but a great deal of the impressiveness of their gesture in accepting that reduction disappears when you consider that they had pledged themselves to it in the course of their various election campaigns; that it was part of the means by which they got into power; that they had no way of escaping from doing something to carry out their pledges in that regard, and that in point of fact they did not go nearly as far in reducing the salaries of Ministers as might have been expected from a good deal of their propaganda, in which they asserted that no man was worth more to the country than £1,000 a year. Apart from the Ministers, I am not in favour, on the merits, of reducing the remuneration of the members of this House, but I did and I do say that the members of this House are in no position to start reducing the salaries of public servants with decency unless they suffer a proportionate reduction simultaneously themselves. The two things should have gone together. It was, therefore, with a very unfavourable background that the Government approached these economy measures. In addition to that, as Deputy Dillon has pointed out, they were destroying the trade of the country and causing unnecessary poverty everywhere by a perfectly ridiculous policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1028" /> Those objections apply to the Economy Bill that we passed last year, and I none the less supported that Bill. I supported it because I felt that any attempt at economy, however trivial, however paltry, however hypocritical&mdash; even if we are to take that view of it; it has been put forward by Deputy O'Higgins that the word hypocritical was not too strong to apply&mdash;even assuming the worst in regard to the motives of the Government, I felt that for a Government to bring in an Economy Bill at all is so rare that they ought to be supported in it if one could possibly justify one's conscience in supporting them. Therefore, I did support that Bill, and I would do it again under the same circumstances. As regards this Bill, it follows logically from the previous Bill, and was, in fact, foreshadowed by one of the sections of the previous Bill. How much is going to be saved by this Bill appears to be in dispute, because we have heard a figure of £40,000 mentioned by some of the speakers, whereas if I understood the Minister aright he anticipates saving altogether something in the neighbourhood of £80,000, part of which would go in relief of the rates and part of which would go to the relief of the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Whether it be £40,000 or £80,000 it must be admitted to be an utterly paltry matter in comparison with the vast expenditures in which the Government have been indulging. There have been expenditures in particular in the last few months that are very hard to stomach for anybody who is considering whether to give them support upon this particular Bill. I wonder how much money they have wasted to the State by their foolish and unjust use of the Public Safety Act in an attempt to crush out their political opponents. I wonder how much money they have wasted in supplying the golden rain that has descended upon members of the I.R.A. in the hope of buying them off from any activities that might be inconvenient to the Government. I wonder how much they are going to spend on the Minister for Defence's new force, which so far as I can see is again going to serve no useful purpose except to buy off a certain number of <Col N="1029" /> people who might be otherwise troublesome to the Government. There have been a great many events in recent months that make it an almost intolerable burden to put upon anybody that they should be asked to support the Government in such a measure as this which is now before us. I believe that certain officials of county councils are overpaid in relation to the poverty of the country. Some of them are; others are not. There are portions of this Bill, when we come to discuss it in Committee, that I shall probably feel myself compelled to oppose outright. On the Second Reading after thinking very carefully what I felt was the proper thing to do about it, I have come to the conclusion that I cannot oppose it. On the other hand, in view of the general policy of the Government and the extravagance to which I have referred and especially the recent very unbecoming and improper extravagances of the past few months, I cannot now bring myself to support them. I shall therefore stand out of the picture.</P>
    <P>But I wish, while saying that, to emphasise the fact that I realised from the beginning on coming into public life that there is no more unpopular thing to do than to support any individual economy. It always gets you cheers to get up on a platform and talk about economy in general, but, when it comes to any individual economy whatever, you are always told that this is false economy and that this is imposing unreasonable hardship on individuals, and that you ought not to do it. In every Parliament in the world there has been the greatest difficulty in getting private members into the lobby to vote for individual economies. Consequently, I made up my mind that that was a particular form of weakness I would not be guilty of, whatever other form of weakness I might be guilty of. It is therefore not because of any danger of unpopularity, but because of the Government's recent behaviour that I am not going to give this Bill active support. On the other hand, as I have said, I am not prepared to oppose it. I can only wish that there were some little ground for <Col N="1030" /> hazarding the hope that the views and ambitions which the Government desire us to attribute to them in the direction of economy, which the Government desires us to regard as crystallised in this Bill, might develop on a larger scale and in a more useful direction.</P>

      <P>I think the House will sympathise with the Minister in the loss of a very gallant ally this evening. Stripped of the veneer with which Deputy MacDermot spoke, I can only say that he has occupied the time of the House in order to explain to the Deputies why he is now going to face in an entirely different direction to the direction in which he was facing in this House last year in favour of the Economies Bill. On that occasion the Deputy was bubbling over in his support of the Economies Bill. He was endeavouring to support the Government in the &ldquo;cuts&rdquo; which were imposed under the economies axe. On that occasion the Deputy regretted that the Bill did not go further and that more savage &ldquo;cuts&rdquo; were not inflicted. Here, this evening, instead of lining up with the Government, as he did on the last occasion, he spends 15 minutes in telling us why he has changed his mind. The Deputy has changed his Party since, and that is the reason why he has changed his mind. I have scarcely ever heard in this House a more illogical speech than the speech delivered by Deputy MacDermot just now. When the Deputy sat on these benches he was keen on economy. Now that he has left these benches and has gone into the Cumann na nGaedheal Party re-christened, the Deputy has changed his mind on the matter of economies.</P>

      <P>He says he has not changed his mind, but on the last occasion he supported the Government in imposing &ldquo;cuts.&rdquo; Now he thinks that is not a change in attitude or outlook. Let the Deputy explain what it is. The Deputy says, in the course of his speech, that this is a logical corollary to the last &ldquo;Cuts&rdquo; Bill. On the last occasion the Deputy supported the &ldquo;Cuts&rdquo; Bill. On this <Col N="1031" /> occasion he is not prepared to support the &ldquo;Cuts&rdquo; Bill. On that occasion I took the view that this &ldquo;Cuts&rdquo; Bill was unjustifiable. There is no justification for specially cutting the people with whom this Bill deals. I said on the last occasion it was unfair because it involves imposing a special tax upon a special section of the community. It involves a further endorsement by this House that the salvation of this country lies in reducing the purchasing power of a section of the people.</P>
      <P>I do not think I can make myself anything richer by making my debtors anything poorer. It is because I believe that this is a wrong way to solve our financial difficulties that I am opposed to this Bill. This Bill, no matter what case can be made for it, involves a special tax upon a special section of the community. I think that is unfair. So far as it reduces the purchasing power of the people it will make no contribution whatever to the financial difficulties with which the country is faced. The Minister mentioned that £40,000 will accrue to the Exchequer as a result of this Bill. What is £40,000 in a Budget of £26,000,000? It is quite negligible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If our financial difficulties are to be measured by this saving then the State is in no financial difficulty whatever. This Bill has been brought in by the Government, who are asking us to save £40,000 for the State by its passing. If that gets rid of our financial difficulties then we are in no financial difficulties. I am opposed to this Bill. It is an unfair Bill, and will serve no useful purpose in the way of solving the difficulties that confront the nation. I think the Ministry might have refrained from introducing a Bill of this kind. It is unfair, it is unjustifiable, and it is penalising a section of the community. If local government services are costing too much let us face up to that problem and see if we can get a more efficient service cheaper. But so long as we are leaving them there it means that we are merely content to lop off a slice of salary here and there. We think this Bill is not making any contribution whatever either in reducing the <Col N="1032" /> cost of local government or giving us a more efficient local service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing I would like to correct is the mistake I made in answering a question put by Deputy MacDermot before the discussion on the Bill started. I read the figures as given to me that there would be a saving of a sum of £35,000 to the Exchequer by this Bill. That is not so. A sum of £35,000 is the maximum sum that will be saved altogether. Part of it is going to the Exchequer and part of it to the local authority. As I started with that explanation to the House, perhaps I might say of Deputy MacDermot's contribution to the debate that it was a very unworthy contribution, bearing in mind his action on the measure introduced last year. As Deputy Norton said, he then sat on different benches. Evidently the change of place made a great change also in the views the Deputy has on the matter of economy.</P>

      <P>And, being a Farmers' Party, they are out, as far as local authorities are concerned, to pay the lowest wage possible. A certain type of farmer, anyway the type the Deputy is supposed to represent, is out for the payment of the lowest wage possible, both by the private individual and by the bodies in charge of the public purse. But in his new company, mixed as it is, he has had to have a change of heart and mind and outlook upon these matters. The Deputy has made great attempts to walk the tight rope; but I never saw a more unsuccessful effort in this House, and there have <Col N="1033" /> been many made. When some of his colleagues of the Front Bench charged this Government with hypocrisy, I think they would find a better example in their own consciousness, especially in regard to the Economy Bill now before the House.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins's speech was largely a type of speech that one might expect from a Blue Shirt platform at the crossroads rather than what one would expect from a man who rightly occupies a Front Bench position. That was where he spoke from. He made very little attempt, during his appeal for dispensary doctors, to deal with the Bill at all. In the course of his speech he made personal attacks upon our Front Bench here but his attacks had no reason in them. He said members of the Front Bench ought to set a good example and ought to feel the pinch before they start economising at the expense of public officials. I said, and I repeat, that members of the Front Bench made a sacrifice at the start and gave good example to the country by cutting down salaries appropriate to their positions here. That was not a five or a ten or a fifteen per cent. cut. In some cases it amounted to considerably more. That kind of talk and these personal attacks come very badly from Deputy O'Higgins. There is no man in this House that has his hand more deeply in the public purse for his personal benefit than Deputy O'Higgins has had.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my fault that he is not here. I made similar statements before about Deputy O'Higgins. I must wind up this debate as nobody else got up to talk. Deputy MacDermot and his friends on the opposite side of the House can send for Deputy O'Higgins if they wish to bring him in. I say that it comes very badly from Deputy O'Higgins, with his gratuities and his pensions, and, also, with what is probably not known to many, his Marconi directorship. Along with his position as <Col N="1034" /> county medical officer of health he was also appointed by the late Government a director of the Marconi Company representing this country, and that for that alone he is paid the sum of £500 a year. He is a man who is paid heavily out of the public purse and yet he makes these low, mean and improper attacks upon the Government here. I certainly will not allow an attack of that kind to pass no matter by whom it is made. It is unworthy and unjust and is not well founded. At any rate, the man who stands up to make an attack upon others in a matter of this kind ought not to be a man who lives in a glass house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins has got as much and more out of the public purse as any man, some would say for services rendered. He got a gratuity of several thousand pounds when he left the Free State Army. He got an Army pension of £180 approximately. He got a directorship of the Marconi Company and he has been made a County Medical Officer of Health. He ought to remember these things when he attacks people on this side for not making sacrifices. He talks about a political army and political police, and other political bodies recently brought into being. Anything done in that way was done for the purpose of keeping peace and order in this country; anything that was done was necessary. Again I would say to the gentlemen opposite&mdash;Deputy MacDermot was not in this&mdash;they filled every post they possibly could, numbering thousands of positions in the Free State, with their own friends, to the definite exclusion of every man who was a political opponent. They drafted a declaration deliberately for the purpose of keeping every man and woman out of positions who were their political opponents. People who talk about political armies and police had better bear that in mind. If anything of that kind was done to-day they set a very good example in their time. Not only did they do these things but they sent notices to every contractor employed by local authority warning them that preference must be given to the political supporters <Col N="1035" /> of the late Government. The Labour Party used to be found in the Lobbies most frequently with the late Government but even these Labour men were not given a fair opportunity for getting employment for people on these contracts. It was only those who were the political backers and subscribers to the late Government who were able to get employment for their friends. Charges of this kind come very badly from Deputies like Deputy O'Higgins and those sitting in his quarter of the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon cannot talk about anything except upon how successfully this Government fooled the people in 1932. If we did that we had a year in which to show them our policy in operation. People knew what we were doing. They knew what we were doing, that which Deputy O'Higgins describes as disastrous. But then we went before the country again, and we came back in increased numbers and with enhanced credit and I am quite sure that if we repeated the operation this year we would do the same.</P>

      <P>The Deputy would not be so delighted if we did go before the country again. He has had experience of being defeated before now, and, perhaps, he will have the same again. Deputy Dillon, of course, like Deputy MacDermot, believes in economy in public affairs. They were the apostles of economy a few years ago. They wanted this House to be ardent economists. As Deputy MacDermot said, it is strange how you can get general support in the country for economy, but when it comes to a particular case that suggests a definite economy you often find that people fail to back you up for some particular reason. They are not prepared to adopt it because it might hit some of their friends, or for political reasons of one kind or another. They find it more convenient not to economise in particular although they declare in public that they are always out for economy, still when it comes to a question of private economy they will not support it. There is a <Col N="1036" /> Bill here to enable public authorities to make economies. There is a minimum amount specified. For my part, I would not like to see some of the economies that farmer members of county councils and boards of health propose. I would not like to see them, because I think if they were carried out they would be unjust and unfair. If they came to me as Minister to sanction the exorbitant decreases in salaries which they have proposed, I should refuse them, because I think that public officials, whether officials of local authorities or civil servants, are entitled to an honest day's pay for an honest day's work. It may be that some of these farmers are feeling the pinch very hard, and that they want to pass on the pinch to somebody else, but in some cases which I have seen reported in the Press they have made exorbitant demands for decreases in salaries of some public officials that I would not stand for. Deputies on the Front Bench opposite tell us that the country is suffering, that the farming community are in a calamitous state. I do not believe they are in a calamitous state. Deputies opposite know how the farmers look. How calamitous they look in their own persons! They never looked more prosperous than they do now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure it is not. Deputies have to wear that funereal countenance and talk in the sepulchral tones which Deputy Dillon adopts. The tone in which they talk about the farmers would make a fortune for an undertaker. Deputy Dillon talking about the farmers is enough even to make an undertaker laugh. There is not as much money in the country as there was a few years ago, but the rate of decrease in the revenue and in trade was just as great for the two years before we came into office as it has been for the two years we have been in office. Deputies know that the fall in the price of all sorts of commodities that the farmers produce was just as rapid for the two years before we came into office as it has been for <Col N="1037" /> the two years we are in office. Of course, it did not pay them to wear the funereal face or talk in sepulchral tones. The opposition to this Bill is purely political. It is not that the Bill is not out for economy; it is on the face of it. It does make a minimum of economy. The local authorities may make more. What amount they will make remains to be seen and we shall have to decide that on the cases put up to us by the local authorities.</P>
      <P>I believe there is a case for economies. I believe that local officials should bear their share as well as the other officials who have already been asked to bear their share for the public good. I should like to repeat that I do not think that share ought to be too heavy or too great and the Minister is given power in the Bill to see that nothing of an exorbitant nature, that would be unfair to the officials as well as to the country, should be imposed. If we imposed unfair cuts I feel that, loyal as the officials are in, I am sure, practically every case in the cause of the country and its work, there would be a discontent that would have a very ill effect on the services of the country as a whole. For that reason, I think it is wise to leave in the hands of the Minister the power of discretion to see where extravagant proposals are made that they are brought within reasonable limits.</P>

      <P>The House may possibly remember that in a few brief moments and in the carefully imbriefed remarks which I made on the previous occasion. I tried to begin to open out the method of attack upon the case which had been put forward by our opponents. In so doing I was considerably influenced by the fact that not merely one Deputy but four Deputies on the other side had, in one form or another&mdash;and one in specific form&mdash;declared that there had not been one single word of answer from these benches to the speeches that had been delivered on this motion. Now I sincerely hope that everybody whose recollection does go back to the last occasion will acquit us of any intention to evade the speeches that were made by the Opposition in this matter, and I think that before I move the <Col N="1041" /> adjournment to-night&mdash;I think this unseemly ribaldry is gravely disrespectful to the House&mdash;the House will feel that we have given the greatest possible respect and the fullest possible attention to the speeches of Deputies opposite. Not merely have they complained of that, but a Deputy who was not speaking in the debate took another opportunity, another and a separate opportunity, to complain of the nature of the speeches delivered in this debate by us. He said that they had one Fianna Fáil Deputy speaking pathetically about the length of time the particular motion had been on the Order Paper. Now what is the complaint of that? I understand that Deputies opposite have begun to complain pathetically of how long this motion is on the Order Paper, complaining bitterly that it should be allowed to remain here. What is wrong with Deputy Kelly protesting in that way when from your official sources&mdash;I mean your official lachrymatory channels&mdash;you are pouring out your tears about the length of this debate, complaining when that Deputy asked for goodness' sake to get finished with it? Are not Deputies opposite asking that they should get finished with it? Are they not even telling us that if they knew what they were up against they would never have brought it in?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Deputy went on to speak of another Deputy of this House that had not been complaining of the length of the discussion, that he had &ldquo;given a long, boring exhibition of buffoonery,&rdquo; that &ldquo;he gave an exhibition of vulgar bad taste.&rdquo; What was the bad taste, and what was the vulgar exhibition of buffoonery given? An honest and kindly response to the invitation of the Deputies opposite that we should deal with their speeches. When we deal with their speeches they say we are not dealing with the motion, and when we deal with the motion they say we are not dealing with their speeches. What can we do? Nothing will satisfy them. That young man went on to speak of &ldquo;a comparatively wealthy man&mdash;I speak in no offensive terms&mdash;with a comparatively big salary exempt from income tax, <Col N="1042" /> slapping his pockets and calling on those who spoke for oppressed and depressed people of the country to give up being melancholy, to smile and be cheerful.&rdquo; The reference is Column 851, Volume No. 3. This is Deputy Dr. O'Higgins' speech on this motion, or his second speech on the motion, or the speech that he made on this motion after this motion. He was not satisfied with one. These are the people who think that this debate has been going on too long. One of the men who introduced it and spoke for over an hour, attacked another Deputy who delivered a speech on it.</P>

      <P>I quite agree, but he discussed the subject matter of this motion, a motion which Deputies are complaining is going on too long and is obstructing the original proposal which they want to put before the House. Now, who is this bright young man who speaks of a comparatively wealthy man with a comparatively good salary? He does not want to be offensive. I wonder what he is trying to be? Is it Deputy O'Higgins with £360 a year, or is it Dr. O'Higgins with a full-time job which enables him to spend the middle of the week in the Dáil and the week-end on the platform, with £1,000 a year and £200 a year expenses for doing it? Is that the man who is talking about other people being comparatively wealthy men, with comparatively large salaries? Or perhaps it is Colonel O'Higgins? It is not Deputy O'Higgins, and it is not Dr. O'Higgins. It is Colonel O'Higgins, with a nice little pension in reserve for the time when his constituents will have got rid of him and the work of a medical officer in this country, paid for by the State, will be so re-organised, that it will not be possible for a full-time State paid medical officer to spend the middle of the week in the Dáil and the week-end on a political platform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then he goes on to accuse us of being bourgeoise&mdash;this man who says this was an exhibition of buffoonery and vulgar bad taste. He says it reminds <Col N="1043" /> him of the burglar who stuck his gun into somebody and said, &ldquo;Smile, damn you, smile.&rdquo; This is what you call good taste&mdash;<i>arbiter elegantiarum,</i> Deputy Colonel Dr. O'Higgins. &ldquo;Smile, damn you, smile.&rdquo; Why do you not do it? He speaks of the depressed people of this country to whose head we are supposed to be putting a pistol, and in a Chesterfieldian spirit saying, &ldquo;Smile, damn you, smile.&rdquo; It reminds me of the time when there was another Government here, and they were putting to the head of the people of this country the pistol that has been described in the courts by the judges, and saying, &ldquo;Smile, damn you, smile.&rdquo; They smiled so hard that the particular Government which worked that particular piece of Chesterfieldianism departed at the next general election. He then went on to speak of the party of Government here as &ldquo;the President and Mr. Facing Both Ways.&rdquo; How about Mr. Facing Three Ways&mdash;Britain's D.C.M., Duffy, Cosgrave and MacDermot? Mr. Facing Three Ways! How about Mr. Facing Two Ways now?</P>

      <P>A Leas-Chinn Comhairle, will the Deputy deal with the motion? We are not here to be insulted by an Englishman imported into this country. Let him deal with the motion. It is too serious for a man who knows nothing about it.</P>

      <P>Lung power is the only power the Deputy possesses. In his own speech on this particular motion&mdash; this man who objects to vulgar exhibitions of buffoonery and bad taste&mdash; when he can misinterpret the speeches of a Minister and a Deputy so as to make them seem to conflict, he does not ask which of them is right. He asks which is the rogue. He asks us to have a little straightforwardness and less shiftiness. He speaks of the reckless breaking of promises, and the amount of treachery and shiftiness that is associated with the actions of this Government. It is unmanly, it is contemptible and really deplorable, it is evidence of a conspiracy to cod the ratepayers. This is Lord Chesterfield <Col N="1044" /> Deputy Colonel Dr. O'Higgins. Then he goes on. This is the first time he comes near the subject of discussion. &ldquo;The tragedy of the whole thing&rdquo;&mdash;of course, he has to use a Chesterfieldian expression&mdash;&ldquo;and the humbug of the whole thing is that the taxes imposed by Great Britain on Irish produce landed in Great Britain are paid by the Irish people, and the taxes imposed by the Government on British produce landed in Irish ports are again paid by the Irish people.&rdquo; Somebody told me that nobody could be a big enough fool to say that.</P>
      <P>Is it contended opposite by the experts in high economics that the whole of the taxes that are paid by the British on tariffed articles coming into them from Ireland are paid by the Irish? Is it contended that there is no increase of price due to those taxes? If it is not contended, then Deputy Chesterfield is entirely wrong in saying that the whole of the taxes imposed by Great Britain on Irish produce landed in Great Britain are paid by the Irish people, but he is perfectly correct in describing his own statement as humbug. If anyone will take the trouble to graph&mdash;I wish it became a habit in this House to graph something&mdash;the prices outside and the prices inside of any tariffed article going into England they will find that inevitably and invariably some proportion must be paid. How much has to be paid depends very largely on the political relations of the people, upon their bargaining power, and upon the question as to whether or not the operation of ordinary economic laws can be overset by action of that kind. Anyone who is going to put forward the amazingly foolish proposition of Deputy O'Higgins is certainly going to find himself dead up against the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He goes on to speak of the political shiftiness, the political trickiness, the buying of political support with public money. Then he goes on to say that to play politics at a time when the farming industry is going down, to withdraw finance from that industry&mdash; finance which could at the moment save it&mdash;in order to buy, say, tens of thousands of votes around the country <Col N="1045" /> is not playing the game straight. Well, this is not the only Government under which it has been alleged in this House that the farmers were grievously suffering. There was a speech delivered here by Deputy MacDermot's predecessor in the kingship of the evanescent farmers' party quite a number of years ago, in which he preached exactly the same Jeremiad that is being preached on the benches opposite, not merely here but at every chapel gate in the country. What did Deputy Cosgrave say to Deputy MacDermot's predecessor for saying that? He said he was bankrupt of intelligence, bankrupt of initiative, bankrupt of everything of use or value to Ireland. I say without any hesitation that Deputy MacDermot is in direct lineal succession. I want to get back to the man who told us we must not play politics when the country was suffering.</P>
    <P>At the present moment the whole trade of the country is disappearing. It is like one of the conjuring tricks for which in every way we get littler and littler, almost Hitler and Hitler, not quite. I am dealing with the charge. To play politics, when the farming industry is going down in order to buy hundreds and thousands of votes around the country is not playing the game straight. In 1929, the total exports were £48,870,000; in 1930, £45,745,000; in 1931, £37,070,000 and in 1932, £26,940,000. Who was playing politics in 1929, 1930 and 1931? Who was buying votes? Who, at the end of the General Election, said that he did not win the General Election because he did not bid high enough?</P>
    <P>It is the habit of the new economists opposite, in order to get at the revenue of the country, to add their expenses and their receipts together? It is an amazing proposition but it is done. What we do is we add our imports and our exports and say that we have lost £14,000,000. We had £7,000,000 and we got £7,000,000 and we say we lost £14,000,000. Let us see what the story is. The imports In 1929 were £61,300,000. In 1930, they had gone down from £61,300,000 to £56,776,000. Who was playing politics <Col N="1046" /> then? In 1931, they had gone down from £56,776,000 to £50,460,000 and in 1932, they had fallen to £42,574,000. I want the House to see what Deputy O'Higgins means when he says playing politics at a time when the farming industry is going down and withdrawing finances from that industry, finances that could at the moment save it. What were they doing with their finances then? Buying tens and thousands of votes around the country is not playing the game straight even though you did not bid high enough to buy the count.</P>
    <P>That is Deputy O'Higgins's contribution to this proposal. This is the man who is objecting to our exhibition of bad taste&mdash;the man who says that his own Government when it was doing that was dishonest. He is the man who when he wants really to get classical in the way of argument says that &ldquo;every brat in Denmark is crying &lsquo;Up de Valera.&rsquo;&rdquo; That is a nice way to talk about your international associates. &ldquo;Every brat in Denmark is crying &lsquo;Up de Valera&rsquo;.&rdquo; It is not the brats in Ireland who are calling &ldquo;Up Duffy.&rdquo; Mrs. Redmond, T.D. and Mr. Wall, T.D. also spoke. On the platform were Major-General Sir Guy Beatty, President of the Waterford Branch of the British Legion; the Marchioness of Waterford and Lady Anderson. It is not the brats who are crying &ldquo;Up Duffy&rdquo; in Ireland. It is the brats in Denmark who are crying &ldquo;Up de Valera&rdquo; and this is the person who speaks of a vulgar speech. Perhaps we had better leave him for a few minutes. We will come back to him again.</P>
    <P>There was a Deputy Brennan&mdash;I want to get the reference. It is columns 2194 and 2187. He is another high economist. He is one of the economists who are telling us that we ought to alter the system of finance we have to the extent of somewhere about £450,000. I only just want to give you a sample of the amount of intelligence which is behind those putting forward a proposition of this kind, people who attempt to fool about with finance. Here is what Deputy Brennan says:&mdash;&ldquo;There is absolutely no industry in this country <Col N="1047" /> at the present time living on the profits of its own undertaking.&rdquo;&mdash;That is in column 2194.&mdash;&ldquo;The position is that the country is living absolutely and entirely on its capital.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is Deputy Brennan's contribution to the debate. If that was true we would certainly be up against a position of considerable seriousness but we would also be up against a proposition which would be selfevident. The total income of this country is the total income of its industries, and therefore, if any industry in this country is living on its profits, and if we are living wholly and entirely upon capital, then there must have been withdrawn in the last year from the total visible capital values of this country an amount equal to the total income of the country. There is no getting out of that. There are various estimates of the income of this country. Some people think that it is not worth finding out. I think that it is. The most important figures of the estimate vary from £126,000,000 to £160,000,000. I will give you your choice. You can take whichever figure you like. This statement of Deputy Brennan is not made merely once in this document but four times. It is not being made without premeditation. It is a thought-out misstatement or it is true, one or the other. If Deputy Brennan's statement is true then at least £120,000,000 must have been visibly withdrawn from the resources of this country and where is the sign of it? Is there £120,000,000 drop in the deposits in the bank? There is not. The deposits in the bank this year are about £4,000,000 less than last year but they are about £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 more than in 1931. There is no sign of a fall. Where has it come from? Where have these mythical millions gone? It may be shown in the utter breakdown of the whole trading position of the country. Well, if it is it would be shown in the figure known as bank clearances.</P>
    <P>Now there ought to be a fall if the total capital value of £120,000,000 had disappeared in this year. According to the statement of Deputy Brennan <Col N="1048" /> there must have been an absolutely catastrophic fall in the bank clearances. They are down .19 of 1 per cent.; and that in a year in which there were only 52 weeks as against 53 weeks in the previous year. I know there are some people on the other side of the House who, though they do not know anything about economy, profess to know something about highbrow economics. I do not know how many people in the House know how the bank clearances are made up. I put it now to the few experts. It is perfectly clear and obvious that if there had been the same amount of trade done in the country, with a larger proportion of home trade, there would have been a considerable fall in the bank clearances. If the trade was completely an Irish trade, a completely home trade, and it was the same total trade as previously existed, under our present methods, the collected bank clearance figure&mdash;the fall in bank clearances&mdash;would be very marked. But they have not fallen, and, therefore, the evidence is that not merely has the total trade remained the same but the total trade must have been considerably increased. I am putting it now to the highbrow economists to check out upon that side. But there are other indications.</P>
    <P>We were told by Deputy Anthony that he cannot go home without finding a whole queue of people waiting outside his door for employment. We are told that the St. Vincent de Paul Society in Cork is bankrupt and that its bankruptcy is due to this cause, and to the distress that exists. What are the facts? Let us take St. Anthony to start with. I shall put another witness in the box&mdash;the Bishop of Cork. The Bishop of Cork, at a meeting of St. Vincent de Paul Society, said there is no case, in the present conditions, for a special appeal in Cork this year &mdash;that is, compared with last year. As far as unemployment is concerned, you all know we changed over to a different system of registering last year. A perfectly artificial rise in reference to the old method of numeration took place. I shall give one example. In Mayo, the registration rose from 300 to 11,000. But to make a long story <Col N="1049" /> short, for one reason or another, we drove up the figure last year and we settled down to improve. Some day I propose to put up a graph in the House showing what has been going on for two years. It is well that we should examine these things upon the facts.</P>
    <P>The numeration register rose last year but only hit the maximum on 12th December. It hit the maximum again on 12th December this year, and in every day and week and month from June on though there was less unemployment registered in this country this year than there was last year. I know what they have been doing at the chapel gates and men may have been ignorant enough to do it. I am prepared to admit that people can be ignorant enough of the actual cycle of unemployment to make the statements they made. But if they were ignorant enough to make them honestly then they were not fit to be in representative positions. Week after week, this ordinary cycle of unemployment took place. They said, look at the unemployment figure. It has risen to 4,000, from 2,000; the proposals of the Government to remove unemployment are being broken. Every week the figures are rising. They might just as well have said: &ldquo;This country would be suitable for wheat growing if the average temperature was 62 but now it has gone down to 45 in the middle of December.&rdquo; I repeat, that in every day of every week of every month from June on the unemployment register has been lower than it was in the previous year. Yet we have Deputy Anthony saying that the position is worse than it was 12 months ago.</P>
    <P>Is there any man who knows the kind of Christmas that there has been in Ireland this year who is prepared to say that? We know that, whatever the reason is, and that is a question which I think the best brains in this House might well be put to investigate. I do not know what the reason is. I cannot put it into definite words. We are making an investigation into it and I invite the co-operation of every right-minded man in order to find out what the reason for it is. But the fact is that this Christmas has been a happy and prosperous Christmas in Ireland <Col N="1050" /> relative to what it was before; and everyone knows it. We have not had from any side of the House, or from any section of the country, these demands which we have had the previous year. With much smaller resources we have been able to meet the demand. But that is not the only thing. Take the national securities. We had always been told &ldquo;look at the price of National Loan,&rdquo; but no one tells us to look at the price of the National Loan for the last two years. Yet it is staring us in the face. What has happened to the price of National Loan? I am not going to say now what I never said when I was in opposition that the position in regard to gilt-edged securities is the position of the country. But those people opposite did. Now they have been turning their back very carefully on the price of National Loan for the last two years. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; but they say, &ldquo;that wise, well-known economist, Hugo Flinn, expressed on various occasions such disrespectful opinions about gilt-edged securities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let us try some other securities about which no one has said a disrespectful word. I asked a stockbroker to get out for me a list of typical Irish securities &mdash; manufacturing securities and distributive securities. I did not ask him what they were. I have the list here and I shall give them to the House at any time the House wants them. I had nothing to do with the collection of them. I said to him &ldquo;For the last three years give me the index value of manufacturing industrial securities in Ireland.&rdquo; Here are the results: in January, 1932, 83; in January, 1933, 89; in January, 1934, 111. There is nothing in the intervening page to wreck the argument from those figures. But they will say, &ldquo;Yes, you have got your gilt-edged securities and your manufacturing securities but the shopkeepers and all those people are ruined.&rdquo; We have got hold of some distributive securities. In January, 1932, the index figure was 90; in January, 1933, the figure was 97; in January, 1934, the figure was 106&mdash;and the country going to the dogs completely! The index value of manufacturing <Col N="1051" /> securities has gone up from 83 to 111 and of distributive securities from 90 to 106. Yet Deputy Brennan says that there is not a single industry in the country that is making a profit and that every single industry is living on its capital. Now what do you think of Deputy Brennan? I think nobody ought to say because there are limits to Parliamentary language.</P>
    <P>Then Deputy MacEoin comes along and he said he would not pay because he could not and that it was due to Fianna Fáil. I shall leave that because it may not be as strictly orderly as I should like it to be. There are, however, some figures which we can take. This country is going to the dogs and, therefore, all the children must be going to the dogs. I am dealing with the statement that there is not a single industry in the country that is making a profit and that every single man, woman and child is living on capital. If that were so the children would be rather badly off. You might be getting back to Dean Swift's day. But there is a malnutrition figure for the schools. Inspectors go round and examine typical bodies of children all over the country, up to something like 20,000 or 30,000 children&mdash;I do not remember the figure. They try and make an honest test. What do they say? In a year the proportion of children suffering from malnutrition in this country that is going to the dogs has fallen from 12.5 per cent.&mdash;a legacy we received from Cumann na nGaedheal&mdash;to 5.4 per cent.</P>
    <P>What is happening to savings certificates, post office deposits, and other things of that kind? The post office deposits and the savings certificates I may say work astraddle. When one goes up the other goes down, due to the interest rates. Is anybody going to say that, taking savings certificates and post office deposits, there is any indication that there is not a solitary soul able to make a living? That is what Deputy Brennan says and he is the chairman of a county council. Amazing things happen in county councils. Then real wages have risen in this country in which everything is going to the dogs. During <Col N="1052" /> the last election I happened to be in a shop. I do not think I was canvassing on the occasion, but I was talking to somebody there, and I overheard the end of a conversation between the woman selling the goods and the woman buying them. This is what I heard the woman who was buying the goods say, &ldquo;Glory be to God, look at what I am getting in my basket for my money.&rdquo; Her basket was full. Her wages could buy something. Real wages have risen&mdash;does anybody deny it?&mdash;in this country which is going to the dogs.</P>
    <P>Then the country was going to be bankrupt; Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, June, July, August, September, 1932, 1933, 1934, it was going to be bankrupt. But the people even could not go bankrupt. There are fewer bankrupts in this country now than there were under the beneficent wing of the Cumann na nGaedheal predecessor of a Farmers' Party turned into a U.I.P., National Guard, Young Ireland, Fine Gael. Fine Gael! A nice kind of wind that is blowing in Ireland. There has been nothing like it since the big wind for doing destruction. When it disappears it will be remembered with just the same amount of gratitude. Fine Gael! Bankruptcy! The people even will not go bankrupt in a country in which there is not a single industry making a profit. I had better read the statement again. I can hardly believe it myself. I have to read Cumann na nGeadheal speeches three or four times to convince myself that they really were made. The statement is: &ldquo;The position is that the country is living absolutely and entirely on its capital.&rdquo; In case there might be any loophole in that he stops it by saying, &ldquo;There is absolutely no industry in this country which at the present time is living on the profits of its own undertaking.&rdquo; It cannot live on the profits of any other undertaking because there is no other undertaking making a profit. Then in this country in which no existing industry is making anything and in which all existing companies are dying out, behold other companies are actually forming themselves. There were no companies formed under <Col N="1053" /> Cumann na nGaedheal&mdash;they were not wanted. Activities of that kind were an outrage on the economic principles of &ldquo;Pope&rdquo; Hogan. But in this bankrupt country new companies are being formed. Does anybody deny any of these facts?</P>
    <P>Of course, all this stuff about increased employment is nonsense; it is one of those dishonest fakes worked off by a Government that buys votes. That is why the sale of unemployment stamps is rising. Is that the reason? Can you fit in this body of facts with Deputy Brennan's amazing story that there is not a single industry in this country that is making its living and that every man, woman and child in this country to the extent of an income of £120,000,000 to £160,000,000 has been, during the last year, living out of capital. What sort of witnesses have you got? Would you hang a yellow dog on the whole of the evidence? There is a jury of nearly twelve over there. Would they hang a yellow dog on the evidence of the whole of these people? I do not think they would.</P>
    <P>I hope that when Deputy Anthony reads his speeches again he will not say that he had not heard one word refuting the statements made by Deputies on the other side of the House. Will he still say that the position is infinitely worse than it was last year? Let me call a really respectable witness into the box, someone that Fine Gael, U.I.P., Cumann na nGaedheal, the Farmers' Party, or whatever you like to call them, will at any rate regard as not inclined to perjure himself for the benefit of Fianna Fáil. &ldquo;It is very reassuring to find that the things people were saying would happen did not happen and the indications are far more hopeful than many of us feared and some of us expected.&rdquo; That is not a Fianna Fáil Deputy at a chapel-gate meeting; it is not one of the brats in Denmark. It is a very respectable person. It is the director of a most respectable bank, the Bank of Ireland. I refer to Senator Sir John Keane. I am speaking of him in his capacity of a bank director. He is not speaking just of what he saw on the street; he is not speaking of what <Col N="1054" /> somebody told him; he is speaking with, behind him, the evidence of every bank account in the Bank of Ireland and he says that it is very reassuring.</P>
    <P>Now, I wonder if I will be considered hard-hearted, vulgar and unkind if I ask you to smile, to lift up the corners of your lips and be happy a little bit when Senator Sir John Keane says it is very reassuring to find that the things people were saying would happen did not happen, and the indications are far more hopeful than many of us feared and some of us expected. I am going so far as to say that the things people on the opposite side of this House have in this House solemnly said did happen have not happened. They know it, and they ought to have the honesty to admit it and not deliberately misrepresent the position, not deliberately try to weaken the morale of this country in the face of a test of this kind. Deputy Anthony is annoyed with us because we say that England intends very late in the day to develop her own agriculture, and as far as she can to send her people back to the land. Imagine Deputy Anthony minimising the ability and strength of mind of England. He says England never can make even a feeble attempt to feed one-fourth of her population. What you are up against is the fact that she is not going to make a feeble attempt to do it; she is going to make a strong attempt, and she has told you so.</P>
    <P>What did the Minister for Agriculture in England say in relation to the matter in December of last year? I want you to have a little background in this matter. You must remember there are a lot of scoundrels over here, people who purloined other people's money. We were called murderers, thieves, looters and embezzlers. I knew there was one nice respectable word, a word you would get 14 years for after being tried by a High Court Judge and jury. We were embezzlers, we were people who could not keep our word, and, as a result, we got into bother with some very respectable and nice people on the other side of the water. As a result of that, not for any reason of economics, not because they wanted to protect <Col N="1055" /> their industries, but merely to teach us to be good boys, they put on, at the direct instigation of the Party opposite, a tariff of 20 per cent. upon our cattle. When the promises that were held out to them by the Opposition that light and gentle expostulation of that character would have an immediate effect in an improvement of our conduct had proved not to be correct, they put on another 20 per cent., and then they put on some other percentages. They found we were very obstinate in our embezzling capacity. Our reaction to the Ten Commandments as preached by the Defender of the Faith was not particularly good and they gradually put on some other taxes. In fact, they put on so many taxes that people began to think they had gone as far as ever they could. And they did the whole of that, according to the gentleman opposite, for political purposes.</P>
    <P>They did it all to teach us the Ten Commandments, to make us Christian moralists, to make us keep our word. Brick by brick, stone by stone, storey by storey, they built an edifice of repression on the ground of politics, and they brought that up to a date in December. Then an amazing thing happened. Major Elliot, in the British House of Commons, a very good man for his own people, introduced a quota system. All the things that had been done up to that time were not sufficient; they were not effective; they had not starved us into surrender, if that was the purpose. He put on a quota reducing our exports of cattle to 50 per cent. After he had done his damnedest in the way of tariffs, after he had taken the advice of the people opposite to the very limit, he found it was not sufficient and he put on a quota system. Somebody in the House of Commons said: &ldquo;Are you not going a bit too far? It is not good enough to do this sort of thing for political purposes in Ireland.&rdquo; What did Major Elliot say? He said: &ldquo;There is not an ounce or scrap of politics in this; there is not any political purpose of any sort or kind in this.&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;This is a purely economic expedient to protect our own agriculture, to protect <Col N="1056" /> what we regard as the basis of our agriculture, the meat producing trade.&rdquo; He may know more about his own agriculture than I do, but that is what he said. He added: &ldquo;We have done our damnedest in the name of political repression, but we find it is not sufficient for the permanent purpose of our economic self-preservation.&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;This is not the end. Whatever else may be required for the purpose of economic self-preservation, we will do,&rdquo; and when the Ottawa Agreements come to be revised in June of this year they will be revised in the light of that declaration and that policy.</P>
    <P>Now where are we? What does it matter for what purpose you build the lower part of the house if the roof is put on for another purpose? What does it matter for what reason you put pounds and cwts. in the scale if, when it is not sufficient for another purpose, you put in and are prepared to put in tons? You say that we can get rid of all this trouble, that you can be businesslike, that you can be a businessman, that you can have a business atmosphere about it, that you can put your cards on the tables, that you can do all these strange and wonderful things that a man who never did a bit of business in his life thinks is business, and you think that by that means you can get rid of the tariffs and the self-protection and the quotas which the British have put on for the purpose of their self-protection. What price are you going to pay for it? There was a Party here whose organ said that every man has his price. What is your price? What are you going to offer him to take off the quota that he put on for purely economic purposes, that he put on purely to protect his own industry? What are you going to give him to prevent his doing all these and other things, whatever they may be, that are necessary? What are you going to do? What price are you going to pay him, so that he will give you a preference over Canada, South Africa and Australia and not apply to you the law of self-preservation which he is prepared to apply to himself? A settlement? Mr. Thomas at various times has said some things which were to <Col N="1057" /> help, assist, to bring succour and comfort to the people on the benches opposite, but God help you with Major Elliot. What is there left of your argument? The Minister for Agriculture in England says that everything Thomas did for political purposes he will continue, and what he has now done for non-political purposes he will continue. What are you going to say? We are asked to come down to brass tacks, to come down to facts. But Major Elliot has not any illusions about what he is going to do with you.</P>
    <P>Now we turn to another of those people, an artist in asseveration&mdash;I think that is the only note I have made about him&mdash;Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney. Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's objection is not to our economics at all; it is to our morality. He said our morality may vary, but it never agreed with the teaching of religion, and by that he means the Christian religion. Deputy Belton will now withdraw from the House for the rest of the session. We are not Christians! He does not like our religion, our morals! Well, I think after all, he had better go and have a talk with Deputy Dillon. Deputy Dillon the other day was talking about a sort of brass-hat Communist in England pinning the badge of Communism on the breast of Eamonn de Valera, but he did not always say that. He did not even recently say that. He said: &ldquo;Mr. de Valera and his colleagues, though I have no regard for them, are not Communists. They are good Christain gentlemen.&rdquo; Now, imagine that! Deputy Dillon says that the Party on this side led by Mr. de Valera are good Christain gentlemen, and Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney says that the one thing that he disagrees with is that we are Christians. We are neither Christians nor gentlemen! It must be very consoling to us, it almost moves me to emotion, almost overcomes me when I think of it.</P>
    <P>You know what it has been, some of you, to be through a very bad storm and suddenly to come into shelter. You know what it is to feel when you are in a hard and bitter world, and then suddenly to come into the protection and soft, safe lenity of affection and love. You know what it is to be <Col N="1058" /> sorrowful and to have your sorrows wiped away. Well, we have been accustomed, as I have reminded the House, to be called liars and thieves, looters, murderers, embezzlers, faith-breakers and the rest of it. Some of us, having regard to the fact that we thought it was quite possible that there might be some decent men among the Opposition, and having regard to the fact that these decent men had not protested against expressions of this kind, were examining our consciences lately and wondering what was going to happen to us, what was going to happen to us when Deputy Belton ceased to blow his own trumpet and the archangels blew theirs. Imagine us climbing slowly up the narrow way to the pearly gates, and some hardvisaged saint&mdash;there are such things&mdash; saying: &ldquo;Oh, yes, looters, murderers and embezzlers, faith-breakers, begone !&rdquo; And some wiser man saying: &ldquo;Oh, no, it is not so; these men have a certificate. These men have a certificate from one having authority. These men have a guarantee that cannot be challenged even here. They have the word of Deputy Dillon that they are good Christians.&rdquo; And you can imagine some junior executive officer sort of looking up the books and saying: &ldquo;Dillon! Dillon! where in hell is Dillon?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Yes, it is a roasted chestnut. At any rate, can anybody inform Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney that Deputy Dillon says we are Christians? I know that they do not agree here. For instance, Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney said that no member of the Party had ever told the people not to pay rates. They do not seem to agree even on that. Deputy Belton is reported as saying within the last two or three days in Dublin that if the farmers had any guts they would strike against paying rates. Is it not time that this Party got together and had a sort of pow-wow and explained to each other what they really wanted to say, had said, wanted to unsay, did mean and did not mean? Is it not time we got some agreement amongst them? I am only just pointing out one little example. I do not know by what authority Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney <Col N="1059" /> spoke as a Pope&mdash;as more than a Pope&mdash;and said that we are not good Christians, any more than I know what authority Deputy Dillon has to say that we are, or Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney to say that nobody says they must not pay rates. Of course, Deputy Belton would not say: &ldquo;Do not pay rates,&rdquo; but &ldquo;If you had any guts you would not pay them.&rdquo; In just the same way Deputy MacDermot, this strong leader of a great Party, would not say: &ldquo;Do not pay rates.&rdquo; Oh, no. He believes in the heroic method. He says that a really strong and righteous man, faced with the issue of paying rates or not, as a member of the county council would walk out and leave the rest to be mandamused. It is time they got together and told us what they did mean, and then some reputable person to go guarantee for the truth of what they say, because I am perfectly certain that in face of the contradictions and the blatant falsehoods in connection with this matter no one would accept their words or their oaths.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now there is Deputy Haslett. He is one of those loyalists whose interests, we were told in 1922, were abundantly safeguarded, and who are at this hour starving and proscribed. Does anybody know about those loyalists? What he objects to is not what we are doing in relation to England but that we are not doing enough of it. He says that our retaliation is very weak. Well, he will have an opportunity very shortly of voting to give to this Government the same power the British have taken and exercised in relation to us, the power of putting quotas on their goods. We will see whether he thinks we are too weak then. It is all very well to grumble, but he is getting an opportunity to do something. We will see whether he will do it. He said that we are losing a million a month, and he does that by adding together, as I told you before, the imports and the exports. The exports of a country&mdash;it is a horrible proposition but the sooner you grasp it the better&mdash;are what you pay out for the purpose of buying what you get in. Any man who is fool <Col N="1060" /> enough to add those two together and say that is his income is a lunatic. I will give you another form of lunacy. It is that of a man who regarded his turn-over as his income. Is there any fool in this House capable of endorsing that proposition? There is a fool in this House. I am quite serious. There is. He has identified himself&mdash;the man who said that in this country in the last year not one single business was making a profit, and that everybody in this country to the extent of £120,000,000 to £160,000,000 was living on capital in spite of the fact that he could not find one single penny of that reduction in capital either in the exchanges in the banks, the deposits in the banks, or in any other place. Deputy Haslett it was who did say that, and he did it by adding together his income and his expenditure and calling that his income.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with Deputy MacDermot in relation to some of his eccentricities. We had better take him on another. Another of the crimes which this country is committing, which makes it utterly impossible for it to pay rates, is that it is having a row in this matter, and the reason of that is that we cannot negotiate here because our reputation as negotiators is absolutely below contempt. Here is a description of us and I want the Deputies on the opposite side of the House to cheer it. I am going to give you a real opportunity to be cheerful. I am going to tell you something you will thoroughly agree with. Now do not hesitate to let yourselves go. &ldquo;The flat provocation in contempt of all good faith which is now offered by Mr. de Valera is only the sequel to the long and persistent course of insult and injury in which the British Government have acquiesced with or without protest.&rdquo; That is the cause of it, is it not? Come on. Do not hesitate. The <i>Morning Post</i> is talking for you. The <i>Irish Times</i> generally does. Do you agree with that? That is what is stopping the whole position? Does Deputy Minch agree? I will read it again. &ldquo;The flat provocation in contempt of all good faith.&rdquo; That is what Eamonn de Valera did. Do you know what they are alluding to? <Col N="1061" /> To three Bills that were passed through this House and the Seanad with one dissentient here and one dissentient in the Seanad, with the full approval and support of the whole of the honest men and upright gentlemen and good Christians opposite. Now, who the devil is going to negotiate? All you people who have been engaged in this flat provocation in contempt of all good faith, are you going to negotiate? Have we got to get an entirely new Dáil? Oh, but that would not help us. That would not help us a bit, because remember there are somewhere about 700,000 Catholic Irishmen behind this side of the House in this flat provocation in contempt of all good faith. There are 400,000 or 500,000, I believe, of good Catholic Irishmen behind the other side of the House in flat provocation in contempt of all good faith. We cannot get out of it by a new Seanad. We cannot get out of it by a new Dáil. We have got to get a new people. It seems to me to be very difficult. Can anybody suggest a way out of it? They say it is very simple. Thomas will not negotiate with anybody whose record is that of flat provocation in contempt of all good faith.</P>
    <P>There is no man in the Dáil, with the exception, I think, of Deputy Thrift, and there is no man in the Seanad with the exception of Senator Sir John Keane to negotiate and I think they would not accept either of those as speaking in the name and with the authority of the whole Irish people. Who then is to negotiate? It looks as if we had got to fight it out and if we have got to fight it out do you not think that it is time you took a hand in it on this side? Do you not think it is time you gave up stabbing us in the back? You do not know any way out of it. There is not a man on those benches who is going to be able to tell us how he is going to get the British to sacrifice their own agricultural industry to the interests of this country. There is not a man on the opposite benches who is in a position to say that he is a man of good faith within the will and judgment of the men with whom he is to negotiate.</P>
    <P>You cannot negotiate. You have got no way out of it yourselves. Is your <Col N="1062" /> policy then to go on stabbing us in the back in the hope that with some wild shift of public opinion at some election four or five years hence you will be put in a position to go over and say: &ldquo;Oh, please will you&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo; Well, honestly I do not know how you are to go any further than that. I think you have to stop there. You could go over and say: &ldquo;The scoundrels over here who were in these benches, and who were elected by the majority of the Irish people at two successive general elections, the men who have been given far and away the biggest popular support that ever has been given were prepared to steal from you the whole of the annuities they owe belonging to you. We are only prepared to steal half of the annuities. That is all we promised the people at the last election. We only promised to steal half and we will not give you this half of the annuities because we have not got them.&rdquo; I do not care in what sort of absurdity you put it, but I want you to tell me how you are to begin to negotiate. You say all right, &ldquo;Of course, Mr. Thomas we are liars and thieves ourselves. We cannot keep our own word. We have given you the provocation of contempt. In all good faith we have treated your Government with disrespect. We have treated our own nation with contumely.&rdquo; Perhaps you could go in in contempt&mdash;I believe there is such a phrase in law&mdash;you could go in in contempt and say: &ldquo;All right, Mr. Thomas, you can clean your boots on us and then can you not give the worm something?&rdquo; Can you put it in any other way? You said you were going to go in <i>forma pauperis.</i> You were to go and say: &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Thomas, we owe you this money and cannot pay you.&rdquo; But what are you going to do if he says: &ldquo;All right, I will forgive it to you for a time, you poor pauperised people, but when you become prosperous under the beneficent connection of the British Commonwealth of Nations you are to pay us then.&rdquo; Are you going to say: &ldquo;Because we were temporarily embarrassed, because the Fianna Fáil Government was in office for a few years we are to rob the whole debt even though the enormous <Col N="1063" /> prosperity which has come with the returned sanity has come to us.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to know is that the position or is it a miserecordia appeal to Mr. Thomas? Are you going to say: &ldquo;Have mercy on us, O Thomas, have mercy on us&rdquo;? Is that the sort of appeal? The one appeal that you will not put forward is on the ground of justice, because you said you will not. You are not prepared to go there and say: &ldquo;We have held this money because it is our money; we have held this money because you who claim it will not bear to go into open court and sue for it.&rdquo; You are not prepared to do that. Not in justicia, not in miscrecordia and even not in contempt. On what basis are you going to crawl to Westminster? As men or as worms? As paupers? There ought to be enough coloured coats on the other side after the changes they have gone through to find some coat to cover the court knee-breeches in which you will appeal before Thomas and say: &ldquo;Have mercy, O Thomas! Have pity, O Thomas!&rdquo; But never justice for this country, which they have oppressed by fire and sword, by the pitch-cap and gallows, by confiscation, by lawyers, and all sorts of devices for 30 generations. I had better read the motion on the Paper. I think I am the only man in this House who has spoken yet in this debate who has not read out for the Dáil that particular motion that is on the agenda. There is a series of motions down, on every one of which the Deputies will repeat the same parrot speeches which they have made on this motion. On every one of these motions they will fail to meet the definite challenges which they have got on this. I have seen those people in the days when they boasted of having the five worst tongues in Europe, when their late champions and captains in the Press made the boast about Hogan's ten minutes' barbed wire, when the Chair even used to warn us to &ldquo;take care when McGilligan gets going.&rdquo; I have seen them here, when they have had plenty of opportunities, when they had majorities behind them, when the Public Safety Acts were behind them and when everyone of them was guarded into the House. We <Col N="1064" /> have seen them when they would not hesitate to answer that question. They were not hesitating in giving replies. Now there is not one of them that has not learned the wisdom of a silent tongue. Oh, yes, they asked for interruptions. Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney professed there was not even a man here who would interject a figure. They have had the opportunity. Deputy Brennan, the latest captive of the magic circus, has had a full opportunity to tell us what he means by the wild, mad folly and misrepresentation &mdash;calculated manifestos of the position upon paper. Deputy Belton, that invariable interrupter&mdash;there is a whole volume of the Reports of this House to prove that Deputy Belton could not hold his tongue when anybody got up to speak&mdash;now when he has his opportunity is not here. There is no more dangerous expedient than an oratorical question, unless you have something behind it. It might be met with a perfect broadside. Deputies opposite have had every opportunity to destroy our case by intelligent interruption. They have had every opportunity yet they do not dare take one.</P>
    <P>Now I want the House for a moment to examine its conscience. I am always assuming the possession of that, both on the part of corporate and individual human entities. What do you think, 50 years hence, will be said of you if it is shown that for the first time Ireland has met its traditional enemy and pursuer upon ground which, if firmly taken by the whole people, could be held? What will you think of yourselves if at that time it is said the length of this struggle and the suffering of this struggle were made greater because you were looking for an opportunity to turn into Party capital the assets of the State? Now we have had time and time again examples of that. Time and again the opportunity was afforded for the Opposition or the Government to unite the people in this matter. They got the opportunity when an occasion arose in which it was to be decided whether Ireland was to be broken into two entities, which mutually and individually would be incapable of paying rates, or bound together in one entity which from its unity and strength would be capable of paying rates and <Col N="1065" /> taxes. Now I happen to know what happened at that time. Deputies opposite know. That opportunity was offered to them to complete the unity of the people, to make it strong and effective. You were given the opportunity at the time of the &ldquo;Cease Fire&rdquo; to break down the barriers, to damp down the fires, to put out the hates, and to unite the people again on that ground. You did not choose to do it because of Party purposes. At the time of the murder of Kevin O'Higgins you were offered the opportunity and you preferred insisting on coining his blood for votes and dragging his body on to political platforms in Ireland to make votes out of it. I have more respect for Kevin O'Higgins than you who trade in his blood.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall. You were given opportunity after opportunity to unite the people, to bring them together, fighting as one army for one cause, and on every single occasion you have turned down that opportunity and that duty. What I am putting to you now is that another great opportunity has arisen. Everybody makes mistakes&mdash; such things as the U. I. P.; that too exists. You have had two years to play the fool. You have had two years stabbing at the back of the Government, but in the name of the people of Ireland we fought the battle of the people of Ireland. Many of us have committed sins even for two years; the time, the opportunity is yours. I have no doubt a representative of West Cork is burning the midnight oil looking for some classical quotation in the back of some dictionary that later on, like the leader writer of the <i>Irish Times</i>, he will introduce as a quotation. I am expecting that. I shall expect the smell of the midnight oil when the time comes. But he must be careful lest his Party Whips protest that this debate is going on too long and closure it. I am putting it to you that another great opportunity has come here. You can ignore it or you can take it. On your own head and reputation lies the memory of Ireland&mdash;the reward or <Col N="1066" /> punishment of that act. Do not imagine, for one moment, that anything you say now or do for the next four or five years is going to alter the position as represented by the fact that a Government is in existence here which has direct orders from the Irish people to carry on and to proceed on a certain path. Get that into your minds completely. For four years from this date, or whatever is the period of the duration of Parliament, you must calculate that the policy which has been in existence for the last two years will not merely continue in existence but will be intensified. You have to calculate upon that, and calculating upon that I ask you to make up your minds what you are going to do. You may weaken us to the extent of preventing success being as great as it ought to be. You may weaken us to the extent of preventing success being as rapid as it ought to be, but you cannot weaken us to the extent of preventing us going on with our policy. What are you going to do for the next four years? Is this debate to go on until 1935? In 1936 are we to have a sample of this sort of criticism, the kind of stuff that we have had previously from the now absolutely vacant and empty Rotary Front Bench? Are we going to have it in 1938? Are we going to have it in 1939? I want you to realise that in every one of these years there will be 12 months and 365 days of the continuance and intensification of this policy, unless we win in the meantime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I may say the other motions are exactly the same, although phrased differently. The Deputies who will speak to them will make just the same speeches as they have made on this motion. The plain truth is that the country is in quite as good a position to pay rates as at any other time. If we were not being deliberately interfered with, we would have been now out of the mess; we would have won; we would have been on the pig's back, to use an agricultural illustration; we would have been well away with it by now and, if Deputies opposite did not try to stab us in the back, did not try to break the morale of the country, did not try to tell their enemy, day after day, &ldquo;Hang on, Thomas, they are breaking,&rdquo; there would not have been any necessity for this motion. I am entitled to say there is no necessity for this motion. I am entitled to point out the reasons why there is no necessity. Is there any man who knows the actual facts about unemployment, about banking statistics, who has any knowledge of what is going on in the counting houses and the workshops, who is prepared to say that this country is at present financially weak? Upon whom are <Col N="1073" /> they going to put the rates? Let them deal with that. That is a perfectly sound argument against doing what they propose to do. Upon whom are the rates to go&mdash;Dublin, Cork, Limerick, the urban districts?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, a damn good bank, a bank in which there was kept an account of which I am more proud than anything else I possess; an account in which hundreds of thousands of pounds were collected and given to the Irish fishermen by my father; an account I am proud of. I offered to lay that account upon the Table of this House and to compare it from the point of view of a good patriotic citizen doing service for his country with the cheque book of any other man in this country, and nobody has taken up that challenge. It is all very well to slide off a subject of that kind. It is quite easy to say Martin's Bank, and then refuse to face up to the fact that that account was known on every beach, and in every harbour, and to every fisherman in Ireland, north, south, east and west. The name upon that cheque book is a name that is honoured; it is a name of which men are proud; it is a name which I hear every day when I move amongst the west coast fishermen. I am proud of that account and everything in it. I am keeping that account in existence as one of the proudest possessions which I hope to hand on to another Hugh Flinn, hoping that he will do as good work for his country with that cheque book as his grandfather did.</P>

I feel it would be wrong to do so and, in case anyone thinks there is something I have not said that I ought to have said, if they feel there is any aspect of the question with which I should have dealt and with which I have not adequately dealt, then I solemnly promise them that on motions 18, 19, 20 and 21, very especially upon motions 19, 20 and 21, I will fill up any gaps which unfortunately I may have left in my respectful treatment of this motion.</P>

      <P>You cannot hear it? I am very sorry, but I assure you that interruptions are not going to upset me in the slightest degree, and the sooner you recognise that the better. Deputy Flinn's speech also reminded me of a saying of a very distinguished Frenchman, that nothing is more illusory than facts except figures. In the course of his speech, Deputy Flinn referred to the Twelve Apostles. May I remind him that amongst them there was a man named Judas, and that the aforesaid Judas was attached to the Finance Department of the Twelve Apostles? It was he who was in charge of the purse strings, and another one of the Apostles was a tax gatherer. I simply adduce that because Deputy Flinn referred to the Twelve Apostles as a defence, not of the fish buyers, because they were not fish buyers, but fisherman.</P>

A time there was when they might, but I have passed that stage now. Gradgrind, as I said, was described as a man of facts and figures. Deputy Flinn, is undoubtedly, a man of figures, but I am extremely doubtful about the facts. He is, no doubt, a great financier, and I am sure he knows <Col N="1076" /> a great deal more about figures than I ever can hope or pretend to know, but let it be remembered that there has been a very long and big contingent of financiers from the days of Judas, to go back again to him, down to Jabez Balfour and to many others.</P>

In the course of his speech, Deputy Flinn very properly referred more than once to a circus. It was a most appropriate allusion, because several of the expressions to which he gave utterance here were those that one generally associates with the circus clown. He referred&mdash;he had the audacity to refer&mdash; to General O'Duffy, who, whatever be his politics to-day, is a man who has rendered brilliant and distinguished service to Ireland, as &ldquo;Ringmaster MacDuffy.&rdquo; Would Deputy Hugo Flinn himself be pleased to be called a &ldquo;lingtaster.&rdquo;</P>

I do not believe he would. Yet he is the gentleman who comes forward to lecture the farmers of Ireland on what they ought do, and to tell them that they are suffering, not through any fault on the Government side, but through their own folly and through the iniquities and machinations on this side of the House. It was said of a famous English doctor:</P>

      <P>I understood quite well what the Ceann Comhairle stated at the beginning and I was present when the President suggested the Order of Business; but again I wish to submit, with all respect, that when a Deputy of this House quotes a Standing Order and asks for a direction on that from the Chair he is entitled to get such direction.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy desires to challenge the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle there is a method of doing so, and that is by a motion.</P>

      <P>In pressing my point of order, I am not reflecting in any way on the ruling of the Chair, but I do submit that this House was given no opportunity of resolving on this particular question, and I would submit also that if what the Chair states is correct I should like to know what was the reason for approaching us within the last few minutes to get us to agree to adjourn until next Wednesday.</P>

      <P>I desire to say with regard to this question which the Deputy said he would raise to-night that in reference to the person who was killed in that regrettable affair at Dunmanway an inquest was opened and adjourned. That inquest will be resumed on the 5th proximo, and I think the Deputy and the other Deputies in the House will understand that it would be most improper that there should be a debate here on a matter that should be considered sub judice.</P>
