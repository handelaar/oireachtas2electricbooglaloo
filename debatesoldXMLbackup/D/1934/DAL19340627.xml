      <P>I beg to move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4, to add at the end of Section 2 a sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  Where the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied, in respect of any house or building of which the annual value ascertained in accordance with Section 187 of the Income Tax Act, 1918, does not exceed five pounds, that&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  such house or building is <i>bona fide</i> let to a tenant, and</P>
      <P>(b)  the cost of the repairs, maintenance, and insurance of such house or building is borne by the landlord or immediate lessor, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1087" /> (c)  the annual income derived by the said landlord or immediate lessor from such house or building, taking one year with another, after making allowances for the cost to him of the said repairs, maintenance, and insurance is less than the annual value ascertained as aforesaid of such house or building,</P>
    <P>the Revenue Commissioners may grant such relief by repayment or otherwise, as in their opinion is just.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate on the Committee Stage, in reply to a speech made by Deputy Thrift, I said that I anticipated I should be able to introduce on Report an amendment which would meet the case of cottages which were let at what I might term uneconomic rents.  The amendment which is now before the House will, in my opinion, do that fully.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that I am very greatly disappointed with the amendment&mdash;not that it does not do what the Minister said.  I admit it does.  He only said he would deal with cottage property.  I felt sure, however, that when he came to look into the case he would see that the equity does not stop there.  There is no equity in asking a man to pay income tax if he can show that he has no income.  He ought not, in all fairness, be asked to pay income tax.  I felt confident that when the Minister came to consider the matter he would see that fair-play and equity demanded some such amendment as that which I suggested.  It was put up by him that the matter could be adjusted by revaluation, but I think the debate showed that there was no validity on that side of the case at all.  In the first place the appeal for revaluation could only come after expenditure had been incurred, after an actual loss on the property had occurred, and after a claim for income tax on that property had been put in and would have to be met.  It would be impossible to obtain a refund, although there might be no income to <Col N="1088" /> justify that income tax.  It is perfectly obvious in the case for which I am arguing where, instead of property producing income it produces an actual loss over a period of years, that no appeal for revaluation could reduce the property to the zero valuation, the only thing which would justify a zero tax.  If a loss occurs on property no revaluation will adjust that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a large expenditure on property has to be undertaken because of damage to the property, accidentally or otherwise, it is much more likely that an appeal for revaluation would lead to an increase instead of a diminution in the valuation.  When once the property has been restored to its original condition the claim for devaluation very largely disappears. Obviously there is no point at all in the Minister's suggestion that an appeal for revaluation will meet the case.  It will neither meet it partially nor wholly, and unless the Minister can see his way to extend the concession which he is allowing to the small cottages, I am afraid he is leaving himself open to the charge of doing a real injustice to those who own property on which they have to spend large sums in order to keep it in condition.  Under the new measure, they will be liable for a tax upon what is no income at all.  I suggest that is not fair to them.  Income tax is an income tax, and they merely claim to be asked to pay on the actual income and profits that they derive from the property.  I protest that this amendment does not meet the equities of the case.  I am not going to ask the House to reject it.  I am prepared to accept it; in so far as it goes, it does meet the case of the very small cottages and it gives their owners fair-play to a certain extent.  Even if the Minister will not admit the larger plea I make&mdash;and I contend it is a just plea&mdash;I will ask him to consider this proposition which he is making in at least three respects.  In the first place the limit suggested, £5, is exceedingly small.  It means a rent of 1/10 and if the rent actually charged were double that, the amendment would not meet the case of any <Col N="1089" /> cottage whose weekly rent was 3/8 or over.</P>
    <P>I suggest the Minister might at least change the £5 to £10.  That would bring in a fair number of the small cottages for which he claims to be dealing, and I suggest he should include in the terms of his amendment, along with repairs, maintenance, and insurance, the cost of management. It is a reasonable cost which in many cases has to be paid and it diminishes the income derived from the property. The justice of it was admitted in the Finance Act of 1932 in connection with business premises.  It is even more a thing to be recognised in places like small cottages where necessary charges for management are incurred and I think they should be included along with the other items of expenditure for which the Minister has made provision. Thirdly, I will suggest that he should allow an appeal to the Special Commissioners.  It may be quite right administratively not to confer any legal right in this matter, but rather to leave the matter to the instincts of fair play on the part of the Revenue Commissioners.  I am not protesting at all against that; that may be a much better way to proceed administratively. I think that there should be, in the interests of the public, an appeal possible to the Special Commissioner. I appeal as strongly as I can to the Minister, in the first place, in the interests of fair play, to widen his whole conception of this matter and not to press for income tax where no income accrues.  If that fails, I press the Minister as strongly as I can to make these three further concessions in the amendment that he has suggested: to extend the limit to £10 instead of the £5; to include the expenses of management; and to permit an appeal to the Special Commissioner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that I would find it impossible to go any further than I have done to meet Deputy Thrift in this matter.  On the larger issue which he raises, that of the person who finds himself compelled at the end of a period of years to spend a considerable sum in putting property <Col N="1090" /> in repair, I think that the complete and final answer is that that is most often the person's own fault.  In the majority of cases, if he happens to be a head landlord, there is generally a repairing covenant in the leases granted.  It is to his interest to see that that covenant is carried out, and if he fails to discharge his duty to himself in a case like that and permits another person to collect from the Revenue&mdash;for that is what it amounts to&mdash;a concession in respect of repairs which he does not carry out, then I think that it is he, the ground landlord or the head landlord, who will have to indemnify the Revenue against any losses that might be occasioned thereby.  It is only in cases of that sort, as a general rule, that this heavy expenditure upon repairs takes place.  It takes place, as the Deputy himself, I think, mentioned in the instance he put before the House, when a lease falls in and the property reverts to the ground landlord. If the Deputy is asking us to give consideration to the person who has property in his own right and has drawn the repairs allowance on account of that property over a period of years, or if he has allowed the Commissioner of Valuation to take into consideration, in fixing the valuation, an amount which would normally have to be expended upon the property in order to keep it in proper repair from year to year, and if on a basis of that valuation he has already got the repairs allowance, I do not think he has any cause of complaint if, owing to the fact that he has not maintained it in proper repair, he has to spend an abnormal amount in any one year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the particular amendment before the House concerning the valuation of cottage property, I am advised that the limit of £5 which we have fixed as governing the concession in this case allows an ample margin. In fact, from a review of any of the examples placed before us, we know that on the basis of those examples there is an ample margin. In view of that, and that it was to meet those hard cases that the concession was originally introduced, I do not think there is any good ground for raising the valuation to which this concession <Col N="1091" /> would apply.  On the question of management, there again I do not think we should take that into consideration. The management of such property is comparatively simple and if a person wants to claim an exemption, I think that at any rate we should not go any further than what is normally taken into consideration in fixing the valuation of property; that is, the usual thing about repairs, maintenance and insurance of such a building.  The element of management might be very greatly exaggerated in a case of this sort and I do not think it should be allowed to vitiate, from the point of view of the Revenue, the grounds upon which the concession might properly be made.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of appeal, there again, so far as any allowance was made prior to this amendment, it was made by way of concession under Rule 8, and from the concession allowed by the Revenue Commissioners in those cases no appeal lay. In view of the fact that the amendment has been introduced to put those concessions on a proper basis, I do not think it would be equitable to ask me to give now to the owners of this property a right which they formerly did not have.  Accordingly, on the question of permitting an appeal to the Special Commissioners, I am afraid that in that regard also I should have to say that I would not be prepared to consider it further.</P>
    <P>With regard to the general question of valuation, I think that Deputy Thrift is in error in stating that before a reduction in valuation can be secured it will be necessary to have expended the money on repairs and to have paid the income tax on the property.  I think that it is open to a person at any time to appeal against the existing valuation and to produce evidence that the amount which he has had to expend from year to year on the property has been actually in excess of that which has been allowed to him when first the valuation was struck or when the existing valuation was struck. If he is not able to produce that evidence, he can go at any rate to the Commissioner of Valuation and say: <Col N="1092" />&ldquo;Here is what is necessary to put this property into special repair&mdash;you can compute if you like on an annuity basis &mdash;here is what I should have had to pay over a considerable number of years in order to keep the property in repair.&rdquo; I feel that the Commissioner of Valuation would be satisfied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Alton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Minister is not taking into account the fact that there are exceptional repairs. The property which, I think, Deputy Thrift has in mind is property on which the usual sums were spent annually to keep it in repair, but exceptional repairs occur from time to time&mdash;a gable wall may crack, dry not may take place, a severe storm may occur and so on&mdash;and no provision can be made for these exceptional expenses.  I think that the Minister should take that into consideration.</P>

      <P>I undertook to consider the possibility of accepting the Deputy's amendments with respect to reference No. 22.  I am satisfied, as a <Col N="1093" /> result of the examination that we carried out, that it would be impossible to administer the Bill with the inclusion of the words &ldquo;and webbing cloths used in the manufacture of collars,&rdquo; as the definition would be too wide and loose.  It will be necessary, therefore, to continue to operate the licensing provisions as at present until we secure adequate production here.  That is as far as we can go in respect of webbing cloth.  If the difficulties of the definition could be got over I would be prepared to except them.  The Deputy can be satisfied that no collar manufacturer will be impeded in the importation of cloth or in the getting of a licence to import that cloth free of duty unless and until the home production is adequate to supply our requirements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a few remarks on a couple of items in the First Schedule.  In answer to some questions of mine on reference Nos. 5 and 6 the Minister stated as reported in column 756 of the Official Report:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;With reference to his remarks on reference No. 6, it is correct that the emergency duty no longer applies to these goods.  In so far as the general emergency duties on manufactures of steel are concerned they apply only to machinery.  It does not apply to any of the items enumerated in that reference.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I take it, then, that I am perfectly correct in assuming that in so far as items 5 and 6 are concerned, there are no emergency duties.  I wish also to make some further remarks with reference to item 6.  The Bill states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;cast-iron articles of any of the following descriptions, that is to say, (a) external water and soil pipes and gutters, and connections therefor.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not know that &ldquo;external&rdquo; was exactly what the people had in mind. At the same time it does give some idea of what is intended.  It is probably used in contradistinction to &ldquo;underground.&rdquo; I would like to ask the Minister if I am correct in assuming that neither Section 5 nor Section 6 applies to what is technically known as heavy underground cast-iron pipes.  I would also like to raise another matter on item 36&mdash;&ldquo;cordage, cables, ropes and twine of hemp or like materials.&rdquo;  I understand that some doubt has arisen as to whether cotton comes under &ldquo;like materials.&rdquo;  I would like to suggest to the Minister that cotton was never intended to come in under this section, and that if it had it would have been specifically named.  I would like at the same time if the Minister would clear up that point with the other couple of points that I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect to the emergency duty, I may have misled the Deputy in some particulars.  There are certain cast-iron articles subject to emergency duty still, and will continue <Col N="1095" /> to be so subject.  The great majority of the articles enumerated at references 5 and 6 are not subject to any duty except the duty imposed by this Bill. In fact, the only case where emergency duty applies that I can recollect at the moment is in respect to gutters. Channels are subject to emergency duty and gutters are held to be such, and so in the case of cast-iron gutters, emergency duties operate.  I do not know that that is true of any other articles.  The heavy cast-iron underground pipe is not subject to duty under this Bill.  I am afraid I did not get the point relating to cotton goods that the Deputy raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>On item 36, &ldquo;cordage, cables, ropes and twine of hemp or like materials,&rdquo;  I believe that the Minister's idea was that &ldquo;like materials&rdquo; meant hemp.  There is a question about cotton cordage, and whether it comes under the words &ldquo;like materials.&rdquo;  I suggest to the Minister that he never intended in this section in protecting local industries to put a duty on cotton twine.  That is a point that I am making.  I would like to say, in no sense of making a speech to answer what the Minister has said, that I am pleased to hear what he said about the heavy cast-iron underground pipes.  I really believe that they intended this word here &ldquo;external&rdquo; to be above ground.  Also with reference to the point that the Minister has raised about &ldquo;gutters,&rdquo; I think it has been a very old grievance of mine that there was an absurd rule that &ldquo;gutters&rdquo; came under the ruling that it was intended to meet&mdash;the question of rolled steel channels and gutters.  I <Col N="1096" /> quite admit that there is something in what the Minister says, but, at the same time, from the point of view of the experts in the trade, it is really absurd.  However, I am entirely satisfied with the Minister's announcement that the only items in references 5 and 6 which come under the emergency duties are gutters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to make some qualification of that.  So far as I have been able to ascertain that is so. It was intended that the position should be regularised in that respect, namely, that all these articles should be taken out of the categories subject to emergency duties, and be made the subject of specific duties imposed by a Finance Act.  With regard to reference 36, duty is not being charged on cotton twine.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister might have said a little more about it. The Dáil has given the Minister power to pay this money, but personally I think certain greater delay should have been allowed in the repayment, because I think it was only last week that the President explained with regard to the disputed payments to England that if the matter went to arbitration, and the courts decided against us, he would have, as another string to his bow, the inability of this country to pay.  We are now actually invited to vote £6,000 for the payment of moneys that were not due to be repaid under the existing circumstances, and I myself think it is a very bad course to embark on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am coming to.  The expenses in repaying this money are very much increased due to the fact that the Government has decided to disregard the original terms of the collection of this money. They are actually having to issue in <Col N="1099" /> America a number of forms.  The original loan stated that the bonds were not negotiable.  At the present moment they are circulating in America a series of forms&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In Section I, the definition section of the Act, the word &ldquo;subscriber&rdquo; is there defined as including any person claiming through or under any subscriber.  The Deputy has just made the point that the expenses have been increased by reason of the fact that the repayments are being made to persons other than the original subscribers.  That matter has already been decided in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am really referring to is the expenses included in the £6,000; for instance, a person who actually subscribed money and did not get a bond by straight, or by devious means gets a form which I have in front of me, which says: &ldquo;Every application under Section 4 of the Act for repayment of the amount of the external loan or loans shall be made on whichever of the forms set out in the schedule to these regulations is appropriate to the application, or in a form to the same effect.&rdquo;  It further says &ldquo;Form of application for repayment of Dáil Eireann External Loans 1920-21 to be used by original subscribers who have already filed a claim for repayment.&rdquo; The Minister claims that everybody has subscribed legally whether he did actually subscribe or whether by one way or another he succeeded in getting a person to hand over his bonds to him.  If that is so, I do not know why the forms have to distinguish between the people who actually subscribed and the people who merely got hold of the bond from the person who really gave the money.  I do not quite know how far I can pursue my argument, but as far as I can judge from what I hear from America &mdash;which I admit is only second-hand&mdash;<Col N="1100" /> an enormous amount of quite unnecessary expense has been involved in this.</P>
      <P>One must assume that if people advance money on the understanding that it was going to be returned to them they would be watchful of their own interests, and that once the statutory conditions in the way of publicity were fulfilled they would take the appropriate steps to get the money that was due to them.  As far as I can judge from the forms which I have seen, an enormous amount of extra expense is being involved, due to the fact that the Government is so extremely anxious that every step should be taken to see that the people who did not subscribe money, but who the Minister has told us are described as subscribers in the Act, should also get the money.  I think that the Act did not specify that this money must be repaid within a given time.  I am only speaking from memory.  I think that, all things considered, it would be much more to the point if the repayment of this money had been further deferred. Judging from what I have heard, there seems to be very great anxiety that the money should be got into the hands of those who got the subscribers to part with their bonds rather than to get the money into the hands of those who actually subscribed.  Personally I quite recognise that as the Dáil voted that this money should be repaid the Government has power to do so.  The Dáil cannot reverse what it decided last year.  Now we are called upon to vote £6,000 for the cost of repayment. Personally I do not think that was necessary.  As far as I remember, all the papers were gathered together and were in the hands of the official receivers, giving the names of those people who had subscribed.  I gather from the figure which is put down for the cost of repayment that there is an unnecessarily large organisation in America.  From what I hear, even from a Deputy of this House who was in America, some of the people employed over there make statements about Deputies of this House, who do not happen to support President de Valera, of a nature which, if they were made in this country, would certainly bring them before the courts.</P>

      <P>We are now asked to pay an additional £6,000 for putting up a big organisation in America, which I do not think is really going to benefit this country.  I admit that I have only heard particular reports from America, and have not heard about the whole working, but it is clear that all the material for the repayment of this money, the lists of subscribers and everything else, was available long before, and there was no need for any big organisation.  As far as I can judge, if all the papers in relation to this repayment had been brought over here to the Department of Finance, that Department would have been able to take the necessary steps without this big organisation in America, which is nominally for the repayment of this money, but, from what I have heard in regard to one case, is largely for the carrying on of a rather scurrilous propaganda against people in this country who dare to differ from President de Valera, and who dare venture to suggest that the repayment of this money is largely a matter of personal interest rather than of national interest.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £300,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1935, for an Advance to the Guarantee Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Vote is, as stated on the face of the Estimate, to enable a further payment to be made to local authorities on foot of the local taxation grants absorbed in the Guarantee <Col N="1102" /> Fund in meeting arrears of land purchase annuities which were funded under the provisions of the Land Act of 1933.  There has already been paid out of the Exchequer in respect of these funded arrears a sum of £1,616,000 which, with the sum of £300,000 that the Dáil is now being asked to vote, makes a total of £1,916,000.  It will be remembered that the Land Act of 1933 provided for the funding of arrears of annuities in respect of the period of three years ending with the May and June gales 1933.  Prior to the funding operations, these arrears had been made good at the expense of the local authorities by means of draws on the Guarantee Fund.  During the progress through the Oireachtas of the Land Bill of last year&mdash;the present Land Act of 1933&mdash; the Minister then in charge indicated that recoupments would be made to the local authorities from time to time.  No specific provision for such recoupment was made in the Act, but it has been our intention that payment would be made as and when the arrears were collected or, as in this case, when the finances of the local authorities appeared to require it and the Exchequer position permitted it.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise at this stage that the local authorities have no right to receive payment in advance or in anticipation of these annuities.  In the normal course they would only be credited with them when the people who were in default to the Land Commission, and in respect of whom the grants had been withheld, paid their debt to the Land Commission and so put the machinery of the Guarantee Fund in operation to release to the local authorities the amount which the defaulters had been responsible for withholding from the local authorities. It is common knowledge, however, that at the moment the finances of some of the county councils, the county councils in those counties in which a vigorous &ldquo;no-rate&rdquo; and &ldquo;no-annuity&rdquo; campaign has been proceeding for some time, are in an unhealthy condition, so that the local services are in jeopardy, due mainly, as I have already said, to the large volume of uncollected rates for 1933-34, or to the non-payment <Col N="1103" /> of annuities in those counties, which, of course, has involved the withholding of the local taxation grants from the Guarantee Fund in respect of the November-December gales of 1931.  In fact, the position has been so grave that some councils have only been able to maintain the local services by means of large scale overdrafts from their treasurers.  In these circumstances we have thought it advisable to come to the assistance of the local authorities and to make a payment to them on foot of the funded annuities, and it is with this in view that the Estimate for £300,000 is now being brought before the House.  That amount will be distributed by the Department of Local Government and Public Health to the local authorities, proportionate to the amount to the credit of each county in the total funded arrears, subject to any minor adjustment which may be found to be necessary.</P>
    <P>The position in 1933-34 in relation to the local taxation grants which passed through the Guarantee Fund has been worked out as follows: the unpaid annuities for the November-December, 1933, gales amounted to £470,749 against which fell to be credited payments amounting to £71,753 on foot of the arrears from the previous gales and certain miscellaneous items amounting to £25,405 odd.  The difference of £373,591 fell to be met from the Guarantee Fund, and as a result the loss to the counties was £295,000 from the Agricultural Grant, plus £78,189 from the Estate Duty Grant.</P>

This advance of £300,000 to the local authorities approximately makes that good and enables those local authorities, whose financial position had been seriously injured by reason of the malignant campaign to dislocate the local services to which I have already referred, to be put on a proper basis and to carry on during this year <Col N="1104" /> under the new administration which, I hope, will do their duty to the country and to the people as a whole.</P>

      <P>The Minister, I am sure, has not had to depend upon the reminders from this side of the House from time to time; he has, no doubt, not only seen himself in the Press, but has had conveyed to him from the members of his own Party, the very distressful state of affairs that exists in most counties and that has been referred to in such striking terms from time to time by various District Justices who have had to review the conditions and circumstances of men brought into their courts for the non-payment of rates.  Various District Justices have described the conditions of those men as showing a pitiable state of affairs.  Only recently one District Justice made up his mind not to hear any of those cases in his court again but to leave the matter entirely to the rate collector and let the rate collector bear his own statutory responsibility in the matter.  This District Justice consoled himself that the farmers, at any rate, would always have something for their families to eat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is not aware of the conditions in which many of the county councils find themselves.  I pointed out here a few nights ago that the Limerick County Council have already protested that there is a sum of £88,000 withheld from them as the result of the non-payment of Land Commission annuities extending over a period.  The Wexford County Council have been discussing whether or not they will increase the amount of money they are going to raise from the taxpayers by an amount equivalent to an additional rate of 7½d. in the £ by reason of the Minister withholding grants because of the non-payment of Land Commission annuities. The Minister has had his attention drawn to the cases of two particular counties, because of the attitude taken up by the Minister for Local Government.  In the case of Waterford and Kilkenny, the Minister has had pointed out the very striking difference in the amount paid last year by the ratepayers and the amount paid in Government grants.  It has been <Col N="1105" /> pointed out that in Kilkenny, which had the advantage of being presided over by a Fianna Fáil chairman, the ratepayers last year paid a sum, by the 31st March, that was only £3,800 less in rates than they paid the year before, but that the Government grants to Kilkenny had been £57,000 less than in the previous year.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands has been asked for particulars as to the amount withheld from various county councils because of the non-payment of land annuities.  The Minister is now making a contribution of £300,000 which he is allotting to overdrafts that these councils have, but the Minister will be forced very definitely during the year to come further to the assistance of county councils and to disgorge&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am telling the Minister what the Minister must know, that he cannot squeeze out of the farming community in Kilkenny this year the amount of money that was squeezed out of them last year, dissatisfied and all as he may be with the amounts he got last year.  He cannot do it, nor can he do it with the Waterford, Donegal, Limerick or any other county council that he may mention. If he thinks he is going to do it, he is living in a fool's paradise, and if his financial position for the year is based on the assumption that they will be able to pay, then his finances will be a bit top-heavy.  The Minister has been asked to say how much is being withheld from the various county councils by reason of the non-payment of Land Commission annuities in previous years.  I have suggested to the Minister for Local Government that the amount was £860,000 last year.  We have been unable to find out the amount.  Limerick has made a protest and Wexford is in the same position. This £300,000 may be wanted to wipe out the overdrafts arising out of the condition of affairs brought about in the country by the, to use the Minister's own words, malignant policy of the Government.  He will be looking for more money during the year and he had better look fairly and squarely at <Col N="1106" /> the position of the local authorities and ask himself how fair it is to withhold at this moment from the local authorities the amounts that are still outstanding and due to be paid to them by the Government in respect of the non-payment of land annuities in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the sum which the Minister was reputed to have in mind to give the county councils on the occasion of the introduction of last year's Land Bill.  In the course of the passage of that measure it transpired that a certain amount was being wiped off the slate for unpaid Land Commission annuity instalments.  The total amount outstanding was £660,000. Portion of that was wiped out.  As well as we can make out from the figures supplied in answer to questions, that sum would have been somewhere about £250,000.  That had been already withheld from county councils.  In consequence something like £400,000 must have been funded, on which the Minister is collecting 4½ per cent.  This sum of £300,000 does not fit either of the amounts.  If the Minister forgives a debt he has no right to forgive debts due to other people.  The mere wiping off of this sum by an Act of Parliament is no justification for leaving the county councils short of that much money. What the reason was for fixing £300,000 to meet a debt of £660,000 is hard to understand.  Is it proposed to retain the other portion of the debt, and is it proposed in addition to put the generosity which the Government exhibits on the backs of the county councils? If this sum were a sum to reimburse the county councils it should have been in the neighbourhood of £660,000.  At no time during the last 12 years did the county councils require it more than now.  Last year, I presume, some deduction was made in the agricultural grant which, in the ordinary course of events, should have gone to county councils.  That was reduced by £448,000 from the previous year and a still further reduction of that sum at a time when it is hard to collect money and when prices for agricultural produce are low, will have a serious reaction. The financial position of the county councils must be very serious.  If it were <Col N="1107" /> intended to put the county councils in the position that they were entitled to expect, this sum should have been £360,000 more than what it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We have listened to a typical statement from Deputy Cosgrave.  He presumed that last year there had been deducted from the Agricultural Grant some amounts which should have gone to the county councils.  There was nothing deducted from the Agricultural Grant last year except what was deducted through the operation of the Guarantee Loan.  That is the procedure which has been functioning here for the whole ten years Deputy Cosgrave was in office and under which there had been withheld from the local authorities sums of considerable magnitude, amounting, with certain of the deductions that were made in 1932, to a figure of about £700,000, every penny piece of which was withheld from the local authorities under Deputy Cosgrave's administration before we came into office, and was withheld, in the ordinary course, because people did not pay their land annuities.  It happened that this year there was a sum of something more than £300,000&mdash; about £360,000&mdash;worth of land annuities unpaid.  The Guarantee Fund, in accordance with the decision of the Oireachtas, operated in regard to those non-payments, and, of course, with consequent decrease in the amount of money which was released from the Agricultural Grant to the local authorities.  That deduction, however, was made in the ordinary course following the procedure that the Cumann na nGaedheal Government itself adopted when it continued, in the 1923 Act, the Guarantee Fund as a feature of land purchase legislation.  Of the arrears in respect of which these moneys are now being released to the local authorities in anticipation of their payment, over £600,000 was withheld, not by us, but by our predecessors, and we did not get the benefit of one penny piece of that money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to meet the situation which <Col N="1108" /> had been created, we funded these arrears, the greater part of which might be regarded as bad debts, and we have accepted the responsibility of collecting them over a period of 40 years.  In justice and in equity, if we were to deal with the local authorities as our predecessors dealt with them, the amount which those local authorities would receive in any one year would not be £300,000 but would be, approximately, one-thirtieth part of the total accumulated arrears which were funded by the Act of 1933-34.  We realise, however, that a large number of honest ratepayers and honest farmers in the country have found themselves, because they happen to reside within the jurisdiction of certain authorities which have not done their duty on the one hand, or on the other hand, are surrounded by neighbours who refuse to face their obligations to the State and to the local authority in respect of the land which they hold and the services which are provided for them.  We realise that when these people, suborned by public representatives who should have a greater sense of their responsibilities, have failed to meet their obligations to the Land Commission, the consequence is that the local authorities suffer through the operation of the Guarantee Fund, so that the net grants payable to them in any one year have been considerably reduced.  Frankly, we are not concerned with the position of the men who brought about this state of affairs, wilfully and deliberately brought it about in order, as they themselves have said, to dislocate the local services. We are concerned, however, with the position of the honest farmers and the honest ratepayers of this country who have met their obligations and who constitute the majority of the people of this country.  In some counties they represent more than 99 per cent. of the tenant purchasers.  In other counties&mdash;the wealthier counties &mdash;they have fallen considerably below that; but in every county they represent the majority of the tenant purchasers, and the majority, I am happy to say, has shown itself sensible of its obligations in this matter and has paid its annuities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1109" /> The position in which we find ourselves is this: that we are not going to allow these honest people to suffer individually because of the fault of their neighbours.  For that reason, instead of only providing them with one-thirtieth part of the arrears which are due; instead of distributing to the county councils only the arrears which have been collected this year; we are anticipating that collection to the extent of £300,000 and are providing it this year to enable the local authorities, whose finance have been injured by this non-payment campaign, to face the current year unhampered and unencumbered.  It is for that reason that the Vote is before the Dáil.  In the course of his speech, Deputy Cosgrave referred to the position of affairs in Kilkenny.  The council, as he said, had the advantage of being presided over by a gentleman whom I am proud to own as a member and as a colleague in the Fianna Fáil Party.  What evidence did that Deputy give at the inquiry which was held into the administration in County Kilkenny? The whole purport of his evidence was that many members of that county council encouraged ratepayers in the county not to pay their rates, that no real, earnest effort was made to get in the rates, but that, instead, every possible form of incitement was used to induce people not to pay their rates and their annuities.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance, apparently, goes on the principle that by sufficiently frequent repetition of any statement, no matter how extravagant that statement may be, he will get some of it to stick eventually. The Minister, during the speech he has just made and during his opening speech, continually talked about a conspiracy, a malignant campaign against the payment of rates, and so on, without producing a shred of evidence to substantiate his charges.  In the one case, in which the Government thought they had an opportunity of making the charge stick, they brought nine Waterford farmers on that charge before the Military Tribunal, having previously tried to prejudice their case by a speech of the President in Dundalk, where he talked about this campaign for the non-payment of rates, and, as I say, in that one case where they thought they had a shred of evidence of any such conspiracy, these men were brought before the Military Tribunal and found not guilty of that conspiracy.  The Minister hopes by continually repeating it that it will eventually stick.  Of course, it will stick in certain quarters, quarters where the total literature read ends with the <i>Irish Press,</i> which gives only one side of the story&mdash;the Minister's statement but not the denial.  The Minister is speaking, of course, for his followers, who only read the <i>Irish Press,</i> where they will have only one side of the case put before them and where they will not be reminded that on the one occasion in which it was brought before the court the court decided that no case had been made out.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1111" /> This State took over the Land Commission on the 1st April, 1923.  On the previous 31st January the amount of annuities outstanding was £640,000. There had been a very large addition in the previous year.  But as has been stated in this House already, there is a difference between Fianna Fáil propaganda and propaganda from this side.  This is the difference&mdash;one of the Ministers of State at the present moment, the Minister for Justice, issued a proclamation in December, 1922, threatening with the gun people who would pay annuities or income tax. The Minister is very pleasant in introducing what happened ten years ago but when he is reminded of the circumstances he looks to the Chair to know whether that is in order.  I say to the Minister: &ldquo;take your medicine.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>We can go back farther if you wish.  We can go back to 1921.  Everybody knows what year that was.  That was the year of the Black and Tan campaign.  There is a reference in the case of the lawyers who advised the Minister in connection with the land annuities, that owing to the Black and Tan war and other reasons the land annuities were a bad debt and could not be collected.  The total sum outstanding for land annuities in January, 1921, was £128,000.  We took over the Land Commission when the arrears had mounted up to £640,000.  That was on the 21st January, 1923.  I do not know what they were in April, 1923, but the figure had not fluctuated very much.  After the proclamation of Mr. Ruttledge, now Minister for Justice, and the Vice-President we wound up on the 31st January, 1932, with the position in which that sum had increased by only £20,000.  What had been collected during the ten years?  It was practically £40,000,000.</P>

      <P>In the course of the debate on an Estimate a few days ago the Minister for Finance and the Leader of the Opposition brought us back ten years.  Deputies are now attempting to do the same thing on this Estimate.  Sometimes in a debate on the Estimates it may be necessary for purposes of comparison to make a very brief reference to ten years ago but a detailed history and a going back to what happened in 1921 would not be in order on this Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That sum of £640,000 was reduced and there had been collected the current annuities.  Now, when a certain agitation started about this whole land annuity question it was to be expected that the arrears would mount up.  But it went up only £20,000 above what it was when we took over the Land Commission.  Not all of the ratepayers of the country are land annuitants.  Several of them are not and these are not reimbursed to the extent that they should, having regard to the manner in which these annuities had been dealt with.  In the normal course of events, it might have been expected if agriculture were in a prosperous state that a larger sum than one-fortieth each year plus interest would probably be unpaid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government alters that without consent or conference with the county councils.  They did more.  They wiped out certain sums; these sums had been paid by the people who were not land annuitants at all.  Something has to be said on behalf of these people. But from the fact that £360,000 was deducted last year from the Agricultural Grant, as has been already stated, a lower sum was paid for the Agricultural Grant last year than has been paid any year since 1931. In the year 1931-1932 the sum available for the Agricultural Grant was £50,000 short of £2,000,000.  Last year the sum available for the Agricultural Grant was a little short of £1,750,000. Out of that £1,750,000 there has been made a reduction of £360,000.  It is to be noted that this sum is to be reduced at the time when one Government is getting £4,500,000 on account of the land annuities and another <Col N="1113" /> Government is collecting £1,000,000 and adding £2,000,000 to the debt. When people talk of the agricultural position some advertence should be paid to the fact that if there is any attempt made to make the agriculturist dishonest, it is on the part of the Government.  Nothing is more conducive to making people dishonest than to make undue demands on them, nothing is more conducive to making people dishonest than by putting hardships on them and making it impossible for them to meet the demands made on them.</P>
    <P>References have been made to exhortations from these benches to make people refuse to pay.  No such exhortations have been made from these benches.  They are not necessary. The reason why the people are not paying is because they could not be expected to do it.  At the moment when one Government is getting £4,500,000 off them and the other Government is reducing the Agricultural Grant by half and proceeding to collect these annuities is it not clear that it is beyond the capacity of agriculture to meet these demands?</P>
    <P>That refers purely and simply to the annuitants, but there are others in a much worse position, the people who had bought out their land absolutely in the last 15 or 20 years.  They got no advantage out of halving the annuities. They have got none of the advantages of that.  Approximately £450,000 of the annuities were funded, that is practically wiped off.  £250,000 of these moneys were met by the county councils.  There is a contribution of £300,000 here.  It is not enough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is in the position that the further he goes the lamer his arguments become.  I am not questioning for a moment and I will not question for a moment the fact that when the Deputy took over, the arrears of land annuities were high.  I have not denied that the Cumann na nGaedheal Government succeeded in reducing the arrears by a considerable sum.  I agree with the Deputy that they did not bring them below the figure of £300,000, and they would never have brought them below that figure <Col N="1114" /> because those £300,000 were a bad debt which the county councils would never have collected, and which would have been wiped off.  What I did say was this: when we came into office we found that the total arrears due to the Land Commission were around £750,000.  Of that £750,000, a large part&mdash;£400,000&mdash;had been withheld by our predecessors from the local authorities.</P>

In this Estimate, we are anticipating the collection, and are releasing to the local authorities a sum of £300,000 of money which was not withheld from them by us but by our predecessors. That is the purpose of the Vote&mdash;to release that money and to make it good to them in order to relieve the position of the people to whom Deputy Cosgrave referred, who, first of all, have paid their annuities and all the other ratepayers from whom no annuities were due, but who have been placed at a serious disadvantage, and who themselves have been injured by the action of the people, from whom the annuities were due, in not paying them.</P>

Might I just interpose this remark, that, on balance, comparing the position on 1st April, 1923, with the position on 31st January, 1932, there were actually less moneys outstanding in respect of the 1903 Act on 31st January, 1932.  The Hogan Act was added in the meantime, and the <Col N="1115" /> arrears in connection with that were over £120,000&mdash;they might have been £150,000; it is some time since I saw the figures.  As between the arrears under the Hogan Act which had accrued during the period and the total sum, a lesser sum was left outstanding in respect of the 1903 and previous Acts than there was when we took over in 1923.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Commission Estimate for the financial year 1934-35 really stands by itself and is not strictly comparable with previous Estimates on account of the new situation created by the passing <Col N="1116" /> of the Land Act, 1933, and the changes in land purchase finance that have arisen in consequence of the provisions of that Act.  In previous years, the annual Estimate for the Land Commission used to average about £600,000, but this included an annual contribution to the British Government of £134,500 towards the charge for &ldquo;Excess Stock&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bonus&rdquo; created in the course of financing land purchase under the Land Acts prior to the Act of 1923, which contribution was discontinued in last year's Estimate. The original net Estimate for the year 1933-34 was, therefore, reduced £446,254 on a normal basis.  To this had to be added, by Supplementary Estimates, successive amounts of £800,000, £1,420,000 and £57,000, making a grand total for last year of £2,723,254.  The first two of these Supplementary Estimates were required mainly for the purpose of meeting deficiencies in the collection of annuities, due to the non-collection of the May-June gale of 1933; the third was necessary to cover certain unanticipated excesses of expenditure, particularly in regard to the improvement of estates.  The great bulk of the sums provided in the Second Supplementary Estimate did not make any ultimate demand on the Exchequer or on the taxpayer, being really in the nature of a book-keeping transaction involving the transfer of moneys to and from the Land Purchase Annuities Fund.  This item disappears from the Estimate for the current year, and represents the greater part of the total decrease as compared with last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of the sub-heads of the Estimate are for nominal or comparatively trifling amounts and I need not go into them all.  Taking the more important sub-heads as they occur, I may explain, as regards Sub-head A, that the increase of £30,000 odd for Salaries, Wages and Allowances is due mainly to the increase of staff provided for the operation of the Land Act, 1933 &mdash;an increase in number from 761 to 830, or 69 extra officials, of whom 63 are in the Acquisition and Resales and Inspectorate, for the purpose of speeding up the acquisition and division of untenanted land.  This increase is absolutely <Col N="1117" /> necessary if we are to show the results which we desire in this direction. The increase of £6,000 for traveling expenses etc. under Sub-head B reflects the increase in the number of outdoor staff and the greater amount of travelling generally which will follow upon the Department's extended operations.  Sub-heads C, D, E and G and H are much on the same lines as last year and do not call for any comment. As regards Sub-head F, the decrease of £15,500 is mainly due to the change of procedure for the recovery of arrears of Land Purchase annuities introduced by Section 28 of the Land Act, 1933, in consequence of which State Solicitors' costs will be largely cut out.  It is difficult to estimate, with any degree of accuracy, for items such as these, but the estimated figure is a reasonable anticipation.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head I, Improvement of Estates, the increase of £20,000 reflects the anticipated acceleration in regard to the division of untenanted land. It should be borne in mind that these improvement works provide employment for about 1,500 men in the summer months and about 2,000 in the winter months.  The Estimate under sub-head (J) shows a decrease of £10,000 as compared with last year.  It is particularly difficult to estimate ahead for this item, as it represents the balance between various outgoings and incomings, that is to say, the difference between the payments to be made in the financial year for interest on the Land Bonds representing the price of untenanted land acquired by the Land Commission, but not yet permanently disposed of, together with charges on this land, such as rates and herds' wages, totalling approximately £22,000, and on the other hand, such interest as may be derived from interest payable by allottees, grazing lettings, etc. which are estimated to produce £12,000.  The halving of last year's estimate under this sub-head is largely due to the fact that as estimated income from allottees is reduced by 50 to 55 per cent., in consequence of the provisions of Section 16 (3) (a) of the Land Act, 1933, a corresponding reduction has been made in the provision under this sub-head for the <Col N="1118" /> interest charge on Land Bonds issued in respect of the land concerned.  The balance of the interest charge on these bonds is provided under sub-head R.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head (K), the increase of £1,340 on last year's revised Estimate is due to the return to normal conditions in regard to the liability for interest on the land bonds issued in discharge of the liability assumed by the State in connection with the resale of Land Bank and &ldquo;committee&rdquo; lands.  Last year's original estimate of £18,800 was reduced by £3,000 owing to arrears of annuities in certain Land Bank cases being funded under the Land Act, 1933, instead of being charged to this sub-head.  While the amount of this saving was exceptional, the necessity is also avoided for making provision for arrears in the Land Bank cases likely to be closed during the year 1934-35, as such arrears have been funded or remitted under the Land Act, 1933, and this accounts for the estimate for the current year being as low as £17,140.  Sub-heads (L) and (M) represent merely nominal provision and do not call for comment.  A forecast under sub-head (N) is particularly difficult, except within wide limits.  The original estimate for last year was £2,500, but only £1,000 was required and the saving was taken into account in a Supplementary Estimate.  It is considered that £1,500 should be sufficient to meet charges arising under this sub-head during the current year. The estimate under sub-head (O) is also largely problematical.  Up to the present, no charge has actually been made under this head, but owing to the increasing number of estates in which the purchase moneys have been allocated and the difficulty which might be experienced in recovering the amount required to redeem Land Bonds in cases where there was an over-issue of bonds the estimate has been increased from last year's nominal figure of £100 to £1,000 for this year, to provide for cases in which recovery may prove to be impossible. The difficulties which have been referred to in estimating the provision under sub-head (N) apply also to sub-head (P), under which the original <Col N="1119" /> estimate of £2,000 for last year was found to be excessive by as much as £1,500.  As a matter of prudence, however, a sum of £2,000 is again put down to provide for any contingencies under this sub-head which may arise in the current year.  Sub-head (Q) represents merely a token estimate.</P>
    <P>Sub-heads A. to Q represent those items which are at all comparable with last year's Estimates.  In this year's Estimate a number of new sub-heads have had to be introduced mainly consequent on the provisions of the Land Act, 1933.  The new sub-head R represents by far the largest item in the Land Commission Estimate, and, roughly speaking, may be said to represent in itself the main difference between the Estimates ante and post the Land Act, 1933.  Deficiencies in the Land Bond Fund due to the revisions and reductions in land purchase annuities under the Land Act, 1933, must be provided for out of the Vote, and such provision will remain a permanent charge until the Land Bonds are ultimately redeemed.  I need hardly remind Deputies, however, that this charge on the State Exchequer in respect of the Land Bonds issued under the Land Acts, 1923 to 1933, is more than offset by the retention for the benefit of the State Exchequer of the land purchase annuities receivable under the Acts prior to the Land Act of 1923.  Deputies may be inclined to contrast the amount of £555,000 under this sub-head with the amount of £795,000 provided for a similar purpose in a supplementary estimate of last year.  I may explain that the big difference between these two sums is to be accounted for by the necessity to provide last year for the moratorium which was granted in respect of the full annuities payable on the first gale of the year 1933.</P>
    <P>The new sub-head S is required to provide for advances and bonus moneys remaining to be paid in the comparatively few transactions still pending under the old Acts of 1903 and 1909.  Such requirements have heretofore been provided from the Emergency Fund, but are to be financed in future from the <Col N="1120" /> Land Commission Vote.  The sum of £25,000 should be sufficient to meet the total commitments under the Land Acts of 1903 and 1909, and as soon as these are disposed of this sub-head will disappear. The new sub-head T follows on the provisions of Section 14 (4) of the Land Act, 1933, whereby the Land Commission have to pay to the persons entitled thereto any arrears of interest in lieu of rent remitted, and also the full interest in lieu of rent accruing after the first gale of 1933 instead of the 50 per cent. thereof which they collect from the tenants. These liabilities are estimated to amount to £4,000 during the current year.  The new sub-head U provides, pursuant to Section 17 (1) of the Land Act, 1933, for the payment by the Land Commission to the persons entitled to such ascertained arrears of rent and costs and expenses as are due from sub-tenants to their immediate landlords, of a sum equal to that part of the funded debt for which the subtenants are not entitled to credit under the terms of the Act.  The round figure of £1,000 is put down to cover contingencies under this head.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head (V) a nominal sum of £100 is put down to cover any deficiency in the Church Temporalities Fund by reason of the funding of revision of annual payments provided for by Section 18 of the Land Act, 1933. The amount of the actual deficiency will depend on the applications made by payers for revision of their annual payments and the orders made by the Land Commission thereon.  It is probable that such deficiency will be counterbalanced by the reduction in one of the Statutory Charges on the Church Temporalities Fund (that is, the annual contribution to the Teachers' Pension Fund) and, therefore, only a token vote is necessary. With regard to sub-head (W), the sum of £48,000 should be sufficient to cover the cost of such warrants as may have to be issued each half-year to the county registrar under the powers of Section 28 of the Land Act, 1933. Sub-head (X) provides for any deficiencies in the Land Bond Fund arising from the extinction of the annuities on submerged lands, under <Col N="1121" /> Section 37 of the Land Act, 1933, and the round figure of £1,000 is put down for the current year.</P>
    <P>As regards the Appropriations in Aid of the Vote, the total amount for the current year is expected to be less, by over £25,000, than last year's revised figure of £155,930&mdash;which itself was less than the amount originally put down for last year by £16,000.  The reductions occur mainly under the items Nos. 6 and 7, that is to say, excess annuities and the repayment of advances in respect of additional sums under Section 51 of the 1931 Act.  The decrease in the receipts under both of these heads is mainly due to the revision of annuities under the Land Act, 1933.  The excess annuities were reduced as from 1st May, 1933, so that the Estimate is 50 per cent. of what these annuities would realise in the current year at the full rates.  The repayments by tenant-purchasers of &ldquo;additional sums&rdquo; have been halved for the November, 1933, gale, and subsequent gales, and, as in most cases, the final instalment will fall due on the first gale of 1934, little more than one instalment will be received in the current year.  On the other hand it is estimated that about £8,000 will be received by way of repayments of sheriffs' fees paid in connection with proceedings under Section 28 of the Land Act, 1933, and this comes on as a new item under Appropriations-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>As regards the general work of the Land Commission, I may say that with respect to the division of untenanted land under the Land Acts, 1923-33, during the past year a total area of something like 35,000 acres has been divided among 3,000 allottees.  I have only approximate totals at present, as it takes some time to get in all the returns and to analyse and tabulate them in the office.  The area divided is practically the same as in the proceeding year, 1932-33, and represents the best the Land Commission could do in the conditions prevailing, and with the staff available.  During the last few months of the year 1933-34, since the new Land Bonds became available under the Land Bond Act, 1933, an additional area of 15,000 acres has <Col N="1122" /> been acquired for division.  The preliminary proceedings for acquiring untenanted land have also been pushed forward, and during the past year, ended 31st March last, an area of no less than 150,000 acres (on some 660 estates) has been inspected as to suitability for acquisition.  This compares with an average area inspected during the previous five years of 40,000 acres per annum.  This great increase is largely due to a new procedure adopted for speeding up the work generally.  Arrangements are made for a concentrated &ldquo;drive&rdquo; in particular counties which need special attention, and a &ldquo;flying squad&rdquo; of inspectors is mobilised to the number of a score or so and allocated to a particular area, under the control of a divisional inspector.  No effort will be spared by the Land Commission during the current year to acquire and divide the maximum area of land, consistent with the settled standards of justice to the owners, suitability of the allottees and efficiency in administration. The provisional figures I have received for the two months April and May are encouraging.  Some 37,000 acres have been inspected, some 10,000 acres acquired, and some 13,000 acres divided.</P>
    <P>As regards the other branches of the Land Commission, I need only say that the work is proceeding normally and efficiently.  The Purchase Branch, which deals with the estates vested in the Land Commission under the Land Act, 1931, is occupied with the inspection of holdings, and the clearing up of the various matters in regard to rent, boundaries, occupancy, rights, etc., which have to be disposed of before the holdings can be finally revested in the tenant purchasers.  The Collection Branch is in full swing again, dealing with the revised annuities now payable. The collection for the November-December gale was satisfactory in the circumstances.  The Registrar's and the Examiner's branches are busy with the clearing of titles and the distribution of the purchase moneys of the estates, and the Accounts Branch is gradually making up the mass of financial adjustments necessitated by the land legislation since 1931.  All the branches of <Col N="1123" /> the Land Commission have to deal with a very heavy correspondence, amounting in the whole to over 200,000 letters received annually, apart from about 450,000 receivable orders received and dispatched twice yearly.  Deputies, I think, understand the enormous volume of work that passes through the Land Commission.  Frequently, we have complaints regarding delay in our operations.  Land acquisition and division are, as Deputies know, difficult and tedious operations.  Our staff are working at top pressure, and every effort is being made to obviate delay and to push forward the all-important work on which we are engaged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Fionán Lynch Mr. Fionán Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fionán Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather a pity that the Minister for Finance did not remain in the House to hear the remarks of the Minister for Lands towards the close of his statement, where he referred to the collection of the November gale and said it was satisfactory in the circumstances.  That is a complete contradiction of something the Minister was trying to put across the House and the country when speaking on the last Vote, when he charged Deputies on this side of the House and people in the country with being engaged in a conspiracy no longer to pay rates and also annuities, when, in fact, from the Land Commission we get the statement that the collection for the last November gale was satisfactory. I have no doubt it was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some rather striking features about the Estimates this year &mdash;not so much those to which the Minister referred in his statement as some others.  He told us that under sub-head A there is an increase of £30,030 for salaries and £6,000 for travelling expenses.  Normally, one should not fall out with that, in view of the passage of an Act that would involve a considerably increased volume of work on the Department.  I am not going, at all, to adopt the line that used to be adopted here, very often by the present Ministerial Party when in Opposition, by setting myself out to criticise salaries as against the volume of work done by the Department. <Col N="1124" /> It is an almost impossible thing to do, anyhow, because the Estimate, on the face of it, does not show exactly the ramifications of the work of the Department, and does not show on its face the necessity for the staff.  But it is a striking thing that we should have an increased Estimate connected with travelling expenses and salaries and wages, amounting to £36,030 in all, while we have only an increase of £20,000 for the improvement of estates. I should say that that is the sub-head which should show, on the face of it, the work the Land Commission was doing, because improvement of estates would come in after the estates were taken over by the Land Commission and before they were allotted.  £250,000 was put down presumably for the whole year as the normal yearly expenditure for the improvement of estates.  That is a trivial increase upon what was the normal expenditure in the past.  Last year we had the sum of £191,000 which was augmented by a sum of £49,000 brought in as a Supplementary Estimate, making £240,000.</P>
    <P>One would imagine that if the Land Commission were operating full steam ahead, with the Land Act of 1923 in force, that that sub-head should have almost doubled itself, and should have reached something between £400,000 or £500,000 for the improvement of estates.  In view of the small increase in the expenditure for the improvement of estates it is very hard to understand the increase of £36,030 under sub-head A, for salaries and travelling expenses.  It is still more strange to find, as the Minister told us, that there were only 35,000 acres of untenanted land divided last year.  That is practically the same as the previous year, and is certainly no greater than in any of the former years.  If I remember rightly, the division of untenanted land used to be between 40,000 and 50,000 acres in years preceding last year.  The Minister told us that last year only 35,000 acres were divided.  I am afraid, therefore, that his flying squad is flying at a very low speed.  Inspection of estates, with a view to taking them over by the Land Commission, is really not the thing that counts.  There have always been in the Land Commission <Col N="1125" /> thousands and thousands of acres inspected, awaiting being taken over for sub-division.  The place where we would like to see the speed shown is in the division; not in the inspection branch.  That speed certainly has not been shown in the past year.  We hope that the new staff will show their form in flying during the coming year in that respect.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about sub-head F and talked of the decrease there being due to the fact, if I understood him rightly, that there was a cut in State Solicitors' fees, which reduced them from £21,500 to a sum of £6,000.  Of course, one must read that with sub-head W, where you have a sum of £48,000 set down in connection with proceedings under Section 28 of the Land Act of 1923.  There was £24,000 provided last year by a former Estimate. We take it that £48,000 therefore may be normally the whole of the expenditure under Section 28 of the Act of last year; but, while we are gaining by doing away with State. Solicitors' costs to the extent of £15,500 we are piling it on at the other end in sheriffs' fees to the tune of £48,000. It is to that sub-head especially, rather than any other sub-head of the Vote I would like to address myself.  I think it is right the Dáil should be given some information as to how that section is being operated.  Last year when the Land Bill was under discussion, and especially when that section was being discussed, as it was for several days, many Deputies from the Labour Benches gave it a half-hearted support.  They said they were satisfied that it would be used only very sparingly. I think that some of them had convinced themselves, being very easily convinced, because they wanted to be convinced, that there would be some type of adjudication in the Land Commission before the extraordinary power given under Section 28 of the 1933 Act would be brought into operation.  I remember Deputy Davin, in his innocence, in reply to some remarks of mine regarding that section, saying that the head of the Collection Branch of the Land Commission would act as a buffer between the sheriff and the <Col N="1126" /> annuitant.  He would not believe me when I told him that the job of the head of the Collection Branch of the Land Commission was not to act as a brake on the sheriff but, on the contrary, as an accelerator.  That is how it has turned out.  That is the job of that official.  We should like to find out how exactly that section is being operated.  Who sends out these warrants? On the face of it, it would appear that some junior clerk, sitting in a back room in the Land Commission, is sent up a list of persons in arrear and out go the warrants in sheaves to the sheriffs.  We should like to hear that that is not so, but that is how the section appears to be administered.</P>
    <P>This is a new power given to the Land Commission.  The ordinary procedure previously was that the State Solicitor was sent a list of annuitants in default, persons who, in spite of various warnings, had refused to pay. The State Solicitor then sent his own warning to the annuitants, stating that he was about to bring them before the court for the purpose of obtaining decrees.  Frequently, that had the result of making the annuitant pay. At any rate, the annuitant had an opportunity of going before the court and making whatever case he could. Last year, the Oireachtas took away that privilege from the annuitant. They removed the buffer between the Land Commission and the annuitant. who had an opportunity previously of putting his case before an impartial tribunal.  Now, the Land Commission is both creditor and judge at the same time.  They have, of course, the power, but Deputies of different Parties were, I think, led to believe last year that the use of this new power would be very rare, indeed, that it would only be resorted to in the most extreme cases.  So far as one can see, it is now a portion of ordinary Land Commission routine.  It is a daily occurrence now to have sheaves of these warrants sent out to the under-sheriffs or county registrars, as the case may be, in the various counties.  Immediately, a certain amount of costs&mdash;on some occasions a fairly heavy amount&mdash;is imposed on the annuitant.  I suggest <Col N="1127" /> that if the Land Commission do not cease the use of the power conferred on them by this section of the Act of 1933, they should, at least, resort to it only on very rare occasions.  Personally, I am of opinion that they should abolish the use of this power entirely. As was pointed out last year when we were opposing this section, county councils possess this power, as also the Revenue Commissioners.  I pointed out then that county councils never used their power in this connection. They always bring defaulting ratepayers before the court before they put in the sheriff.  So far as I know, the Revenue Commissioners have abandoned the power they had in that respect.  For some years before we left office, the Revenue Commissioners were accustomed to resort to the courts before putting in the sheriff.  It remained for this Government to extend that power to a Department which affects the lives of a great part of the population of the State.  There is a further reason why the use of that power should be suspended at least for a period.  It is well known to the Land Commission that the legality of their action in regard to this whole matter is sub judice.  It is known to the Land Commission that there is a case pending in the courts in which the annuitant is contesting the legality of Section 28 of the Act of 1933 and, indeed, of the whole Act.  I think that it is monstrous that the Land Commission, seeing that there is such a case pending in the courts, should continue gaily to issue these warrants to sheriffs and county registrars.  I know that many supporters of the Government are keenly disappointed and dissatisfied with the operation of this section. I remember reading a report of a meeting of Kerry County Council last year at which the most vocal in opposition to this procedure were supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party.  In fact, one member of the county council&mdash;a lady, who is vice-chairman and a very prominent Fianna Fáil supporter&mdash;tried to throw all the blame on the old die-hard members of the Land Commission.  The poor Minister, according to this lady, did not know anything at all about <Col N="1128" /> what was happening.  Fortunately, the debates on the Land Bill of 1933 are in existence.  The Minister stood out strongly for this section and refused to allow a free vote on it.  It is not the die-hard officials of the Land Commission who are responsible; it is the Fianna Fáil Government, who brought forward that section last year and insisted on pushing it through the Oireachtas.  There is grave dissatisfaction at this procedure and I am extremely sorry that Deputy Davin and other Deputies who spoke on this section last year are not here at present. It would be interesting to see whether their innocent eyes have not been opened by the operation of the section. In view of the fact that proceedings are pending, it is a scandalous thing for the Land Commission to continue to take advantage of the power conferred on them by that section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to review the work of a Department whose ramifications are so extensive. There are one or two matters which I want to mention by the way.  I get a number of complaints as regards applications in connection with the sub-division of estates.  I know that there is considerable difficulty about these matters.  I know, of course, that there are vested estates and non-vested estates, and that when people writing up from the country are making applications, they do not always distinguish between the two.  That causes considerable difficulty in the Land Commission. With regard to that particular branch of the work there are serious complaints about the delays that take place.  I feel myself that if the people gave more detailed particulars it would help to minimise the delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to have from the Minister particulars of the amounts collected as a result of seizures made by the sheriffs or the county registrars under the present procedure, and how these compare with the amounts collected under the old procedure.  Has the new procedure been found more efficient, and have the arrears come in more quickly?  When the Land Bill was going through the House I <Col N="1129" /> ventured to express the opinion that they would not come in more quickly under the new procedure.  However, I suppose it is difficult to test that because, so far, the new system has not got a fair trial.  Certainly the new system is putting people in a very difficult position.  They are now told, after the prescribed notice is sent out, that if the annuities are not paid within a limited period a seizure will be made. Notice to that effect is sent out by the sheriff or the county registrar.  When the Land Bill was going through I expressed strong objection to that.  I would like to know how it is working. Many cases of real hardship must occur. A bailiff, for example, may know that when he goes to make a siezure the occupier of the land may not have a penny.  He may meet with the case of a man with a wife and small family or a case, say, where the husband is dead and the widow is there with a small family.  In cases such as these a seizure is made.  Under the old procedure the State solicitor could take any sum that the person concerned could pay, as an instalment on the amount due.  I would like to know how this part of the Land Act of 1933 is being administered.  In my opinion it is going to cause endless trouble, and will inflict terrible hardship on many people.  Could the Minister say if the major portion of the money is given to the sheriff's bailiffs, or what amount of it is given?  Is the difficulty in recovering it steadily increasing?</P>
    <P>I would also like to have an explanation from the Minister of the statement he made to the effect that the collection, under the circumstances, was satisfactory.  I want to contrast that statement with a statement made a little earlier this evening by the Minister for Finance on another Vote.  He made a statement to this effect that the well-to-do people, members of the various county councils and others carried on a wilful and deliberate plan against the collection of land annuities and of rates, and thereby brought about a condition of affairs in the country where he, the Minister for Finance, had to come to the aid of the ratepayers in making an advance of £300,000 out of the Guarantee Fund <Col N="1130" /> for the current year.  These are two rather curious statements made within half-an-hour in this House by two Ministers, and I would like to have them reconciled.  My opinion is that, as far as my constituency is concerned, the collection is very good under the circumstances.  I believe that the payments under the various Land Acts have, under the circumstances, been excellent.  I did not hear of any serious default or any attempt at default either as regards the payment of rates or of land annuities.  I take this opportunity to refute the statement made here this afternoon by the Minister for Finance.  I think his statement was a gross libel on the people he was referring to.  It is quite easy to make a general statement of that sort, but the Minister made no attempt whatever to prove it.  Deputy Lynch drew attention to the fact that in the only case where steps were taken, that the court trying the men charged with that offence found them not guilty.</P>
    <P>If there was a campaign such as that referred to by the Minister for Finance, why was not the law put into force? In my opinion the law should be put into force against all law-breakers.  If it was not put into force, then the Minister for Finance and his colleagues are guilty for anything that took place, if there was any default in that particular direction.  I want to say that so far as I know there was no such campaign and that the people made as good an attempt last year under the difficult circumstances that existed&mdash;everybody knows what those circumstances were and there is no need for me to go into them now&mdash;to meet their obligations as in any previous period.  Recently, I was speaking to the Secretary of the Donegal County Council.  I asked him what was the amount of the collection in that county.  I cannot remember the exact figure he gave me, but he told me that the collection of the rates was practically as good as in any other year.  I take it that the same remark would apply with regard to the land annuities.  I think that it ill befits a Minister to use the privileges of this House to slander people in the way that the Minister for Finance did.  It is rather strange conduct.  It was only <Col N="1131" /> last week that I had to draw attention to a statement made here by the Minister for Industry and Commerce with regard to another matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands in his opening statement gave a number of figures. I was not able to follow all of them, but could the Minister state now the number of acres that the Land Commission had on hands a year ago as compared with the present time?  I understood the Minister to say that the Land Commission had acquired 35,000 acres of untenanted land last year, and had allocated it to 33,000 allottees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">

    </Speaker>

      <P>With regard to the improvement of estates, I think that much more could be done in that direction than has been done.  Things are in a very confused state now, because we have this position that a lot of the work hitherto done by the Land Commission is now being done by the Board of Works.  At the present time people find it very difficult to know whether, when making certain types of applications, they should write to the Land Commission or to the Board of Works.  Very much of this Land Commission work and kindred work is now being done by the Board of Works, and people are puzzled at times as to which Department they should approach.  I should also like to know what the arrears were at the end of the last financial year&mdash;that is of the amount payable under the Land Act of 1933.  With regard to work on bogs, all of which was done hitherto by the Land Commission except some relief work, I should like to know whether that is entirely transferred to the Board of Works and if the Land Commission have entirely divested themselves of work in connection with bogs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1132" /> There is another matter that is becoming very acute, and that is where turbary attached to holdings on certain estates is becoming exhausted. The Land Commission, having full power under the Land Act to take control of bogs, are providing turbary on bogs on adjoining estates.  Cases have arisen and are arising every day in connection with holdings transferred by will, say, to the son of another farmer.  That son may not be of age or may not be in a position to take up the holding given to him by the will. As I say, the bogs are being divided and allotted and, in some cases, the inspectors are refusing to allot portion of a bog to a holding on which there is no occupier at the moment.  If that policy was adopted it would, in my opinion, be very unfair.  Even assuming that the person to whom the holding has been bequeathed is going to sell it, if there are no turbary rights attached to it, it would be practically worthless. On the other hand, if he intended in two or three years' time to reside there, it would be a very great hardship to find that there was no turbary attached to it.  I do not know whether the Minister has yet considered that aspect of the question, but it has arisen in many cases and will become acute. The matter will require consideration at an early date, before all the bogs are divided up amongst those in occupation of holdings on which the right of turbary does not exist at present.</P>
    <P>There were also a number of estates, particularly in the County Donegal, in the hands of the Land Commission, which have certain fishery rights attaching to them.  One such estate was that through which the River Ownea passes.  I was informed there recently that the fishing rights on that river, which had been reserved, had been given up&mdash;that they had been deserted, as it were, by the Land Commission or the Government.  In fact, I think it was stated in this House that they had been voluntarily given up in pursuance of the decision given in the Erne Fishery case.  I do not know whether it was wise or proper to do that without having a decision in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that there is any Minister entitled to as much sympathy and consideration as the Minister for Lands.  Everyone of us knows that all over rural Ireland at present the one thing that really matters is land division.  Anyone who is in touch with his constituents, particularly in the area I represent, knows that that is so.  As the Minister has put up here, and as I think Deputy Lynch, to some extent, put up also, it is all right to say that so many acres have been inspected.  As Deputy Lynch stated, it is not really the inspection that matters but the division of the land and the speed at which it is divided.  I have found in my constituency that an amount of criticism takes place locally as to the type of individual who gets land.  There is quite a lot of adverse criticism.  When one remembers the three sections of the community who are interested in land division I admit that it is very difficult for the Minister and his officials to please everyone.  We know that the applicants for land include the landless men, the uneconomic holders, and another section of the community that, in my opinion, has been badly overlooked for a considerable time, that is, the evicted tenants.  I think there was a discussion about them on the Land Bill.  I would ask the Minister, when he is replying, to say something under that heading, more particularly in regard to the constituency of Leix-Offaly. Any Deputy acquainted with the trouble that went on during the land war knows what took place at Luggacurran.  People there still rightly call themselves the wounded soldiers of the land war.  There are some of these people or their descendants still without land.  They are still looking for land and, in many cases, apparently there does not seem to be much prospect of getting back the original holding or an alternative holding. These are people who are worthy of some consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lynch mentioned something about a discussion that took place in Kerry, and said that the statement was made by some Fianna Fáil supporters, that the blame for the warrants being sent out did not lie so much with the Minister, but that they emanated from <Col N="1134" /> the old die-hard type of officials down there.  I trust that that type of official does not exist to any great extent in the Land Commission at the present moment.  The people of this country have nothing in common with that type whose hearts, to my mind, are not in a lot of the work they do.  Any Deputy who goes down the country will hear complaints from the average constituent. No matter what attitude they adopt in politics, they all join in one thing, and that is condemnation of the delay in the division of land.  The Minister, I am sure, will admit that that is perfectly true, as he knows from the number of deputations and correspondence received.  While I have a certain amount of sympathy with officials, and would like to support them, I am afraid that in the past the Land Commission were not free from something which merited the condemnation of the average tenant in the country.  I do not want to give any quotation.  It would not serve any useful purpose.  Deputy Lynch mentioned this and tried, in some degree, to exonerate the old type of official I am referring to.  I cannot go as far as exonerating them altogether. I believe the old tradition and prejudice still lingers, though not to any very great extent.  I hope the time is rapidly approaching when they will not be there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>My reference was to one specific thing only&mdash;the administration of Section 28 of the Land Act of 1933. It was on that the discussion at the county council arose.  Surely the Deputy is not suggesting that it was due to any old official down there, when it was the Oireachtas that passed Section 28 in spite of our protests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, you mentioned the type of old die-hard officialdom that was in the Land Commission. If you like I will give you the quotation and it will, perhaps, bear out your argument much better than you can push it yourself.  I will show it to you afterwards.  As regards Deputy McMenamin's point about the collection of annuities, I am certain that the annuities were paid in Donegal and the rates also, just as in the case of Mayo. Deputy Cosgrave was not in the House <Col N="1135" /> the evening this matter was referred to, but I will again assert that there is a conspiracy and there is a plan, and people have been told not to pay their annuities or their rates.  I read a quotation from the papers of the speech made by Deputy Minch at Monasterevan, advising the farmers of County Kildare to pay neither rates nor annuities, and we know what happened in Naas; we know what happened as a result of advice of this kind.  That state of things does exist.  The speech is on the records of this House.  All Deputies have to do is to go down and read the Debates in the library. The Deputy tried to explain it away a day or two afterwards, but I do not think the explanation was very satisfactory.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will assure us that very much greater speed will be observed in the matter of land division. As regards Offaly, in the southern portion of that county&mdash;and I think the Minister knows it himself&mdash;there is at the moment a very serious situation existing, due to delay in the division of land.  That might lead to unpleasantness; later on it might lead to things that nobody wants.  If these delays can be avoided, they ought to be.  If there are not enough inspectors or officials, why not appoint more?  I think the division of land and the placing of the people on the land in an economic way is a question that transcends in importance any other question in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the speech which we have just heard there was contained the very extraordinary statement that persons have been told not to pay rates or annuities.  That is not a fact, so far as this side of the House is concerned.  Persons have not been told by any one connected with our Party not to pay rates or annuities.  On the contrary, people have been told officially&mdash;and it is the official view of the Party&mdash;that every one of them in a position to pay rates or annuities should take that course. I have said, however, on many occasions, and I say it here again, that as long as this economic war goes on the people should not be asked to pay <Col N="1136" /> rates or annuities.  At the present moment the farming community, and especially the smaller farmers, are tremendously impoverished.  Some of them have been plunged into actual ruin by this economic war.  We say the Government should alter evisting legislation to this extent, that during the continuance of the economic war neither rates nor annuities should be legally payable or legally demanded from the people.  That is our policy. As long as the law sets out that annuities are payable, as long as the law sets out that rates are payable, then so long shall the people pay their annuities and their rates.  The rates and annuities in those circumstances must be paid, but we do submit that legislation ought to be altered in common justice.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that people there are paying and they are really not in a position to pay; but I will explain the position further to the Deputy.  If a Mayo man has money in his pocket he will pay his debts.  It is the tradition of the county.  That is the Mayo tradition and it will take a great number of years of Fianna Fáil Government to stamp out that tradition.  I sincerely hope it will take many more years than ever Fianna Fáil will govern completely to demoralise the Mayo people and make them change their habits.  The Fianna Fáil Government are doing their best, as everybody is aware, to demoralise the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Donnelly talked about old types of officials, about people not doing their work.  I do not think that, without definite, clear facts, an attack should be made against officials. So far as I know the officials of the Land Commission, I have always been of the opinion that they have difficult work to do.  So far as my experience goes, I am aware that the officials of the Land Commission are endeavouring to do their best.  Nobody in the position of inspector in the Land Commission could give universal satisfaction. If he divides a single farm <Col N="1137" /> there will be 100 applicants and only ten can get land.  Then you will have ten men who are probably ungrateful and you will have 90 who are disappointed. That will happen to the end of all time and it is unfair to blame the officials.  On the question of speeding up divisions, I know some farms which have been acquired by the Land Commission in my constituency and a little more speed in the matter of their division would be desirable.  But at the same time I would not like to see land broken up at the speed of an express train, as it were.  Land division is a big thing. Great numbers of claims have to be considered and decisions have to be reached as to whether land will be given to persons in the immediate vicinity or whether persons will be brought a distance to get it.  If there is a mistake made in the division of a farm that mistake cannot be put right; once it is made, it is made for all time and, therefore, Land Commission officials should take a reasonable time.  Sometimes they take more than a reasonable time.</P>

      <P>They should certainly take a very reasonable time and not act with undue haste in the division of land.  There was another thing that Deputy Donnelly said, and it rather surprised me.  He said that the Minister had a very difficult job in connection with the division of land.  I sincerely hope the Minister does not personally intervene in the matter of the division of land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may be familiar with Madagascar, but I cannot say that I have ever been there.  Only one issue arises on this <Col N="1138" /> Land Commission Vote to which I wish to give special attention, and that is the way in which the annuities are now being collected.  There is power given to the Land Commission to collect annuities.  It has been tried and it is an absolute and entire failure.  I am not going to argue as to the legality or illegality of it.  That is a matter that is being tested in the courts and upon which a decision will be given.  But I think it a very strange thing that while this matter is pending, while this question is being argued in the courts, the sheriffs or the county registrars, as the case may be, are getting instructions to go on with their collections of annuities and their seizures.  That appears to me to be a very strange course for the Government to adopt&mdash;a very strange course indeed&mdash;because, remember, there is always an alternative. The correct course for the Government to adopt, in my opinion at any rate, while this matter is going on; while it is under discussion in the courts; while it is <i>sub judice,</i> is to go back to the old correct method of collecting debts&mdash;to go to the courts to collect them.  For the life of me I cannot see, whether this action was pending or not, why this wretched innovation, which is wrong in principle and which works out wrongly in practice, is still being hung on to by this Government.  It is their child, I admit, and they seem to love it, but in my opinion it is a horrible little brat, and I sincerely wish they would cease to have any affection for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have seen a great number of these notices myself.  Several persons have brought them to me.  I should say that I have seen at least five or six of them in which the notice was addressed to a person who is dead. Now, seizures will be made upon that. I know of one case, which may be of interest to the Minister, where proceedings were brought some years ago, and they were dismissed on the ground that the person whose name appeared in the civil bill was dead. Yet, in that very case, notice has been sent out in the name of that particular individual who was dead and a seizure will be made for the debt in that case.  It is an illegal seizure.  An <Col N="1139" /> action for illegal seizure will have to be brought.  There are other cases, where real hardship comes in, where the courts have got full power to put a stay upon execution if they are satisfied that the defendant cannot pay. They have full power to make the amount payable by instalments.  There are very harsh cases indeed, cases in which, inevitably, the courts or any court would exercise that power, and the Land Commission, whether they know the facts or not&mdash;and I suppose they cannot know them&mdash;are not exercising that power.</P>
    <P>I will give one example of a man who came to see me and asked me what on earth could be done in his case.  He was a man with a smallish piece of land.  It was not well stocked at any time.  He had, I think, five or six children and his wife had died a short time before.  In order to get the funeral expenses he had to sell the last cow that he possessed, and he had only two or three calves upon the little farm at the time.  That is a case in which any court would give time.  The Land Commission will not give time.  They simply come along; that man has got his notice, and the sheriff will be down upon him to seize whatever little stock he has on his land&mdash;two or three calves &mdash;and, I suppose, the furniture in his house.  The man cannot pay.  As I say, in order to pay his wife's funeral expenses he had to sell the last cow, and that man will not get a moment's time. Is that fair?  That is the way in which the machine is working and that is the way in which a machine must work. There is no way in which the Land Commission can test things of that nature.  I can assure the House that I have had the matter investigated, and the story that man told me is absolutely the truth.  What is to be done?  The only thing to do is simply to write to the sheriff and tell him the facts.  The sheriff will inform you that he has got instructions from the Land Commission and that the matter is not in his discretion at all, and there you are.  No matter in what difficulty a person is; no matter how poor he may be; no matter what calamities may befall him&mdash;and calamities may befall <Col N="1140" /> the hardest working member of the community&mdash;yet there is a relentless machine insisting on payment up to the moment, or else seizure, with the consequent expenses attached to seizure.</P>
    <P>Surely to goodness, experience should have shown the Government that Section 28 is hopelessly bad and that they should abandon collection under it and go back to the other old and certainly legal method.  I am not going, as I said, to discuss the legality or illegality of Section 28 now, but nobody can question the legality of collecting debts in the way in which they used to be collected&mdash;collecting them in the courts, where any individual who has got a grievance, such as that the wrong person has been sued, can come forward and say that he is being sued for somebody else's debt.  There is another case which is pending, as a matter of fact, in County Kildare.  I merely mention the fact because this case has become rather famous on account of other proceedings arising out of the seizure.  It is a case where a notice was sent to an uncle and his nephew's cattle were seized, the nephew never having received any notice at all.  If a thing like that happens and a civil bill is served, the real owner of the land has a right to come into court and say: &ldquo;This is not my debt.&rdquo;  Here, however, there is an automatic procedure and the defendant has no method of doing anything.  He has got simply to sit down and endure it.  He is completely at the mercy of a machine.</P>
    <P>I am not saying one word against the officials, and I hope that what I say cannot be construed in any way as being an attack on the officials of the Collection Branch of the Irish Land Commission.  I want to make that particularly plain.  I am certain that the officials in the Collection Branch of the Irish Land Commission are working this Section 28 as well as Section 28 can be worked; but neither the officials who are there now, nor any new officials, nor any other men that have ever been born, if put into the Collection Branch of the Land Commission, will be able to work Section 28 without inflicting tremendous injustice <Col N="1141" /> on a very considerable number of persons in this country.  Why the Government are sticking to it I must certainly say I am at a loss to know.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donnelly said that he would be interested to hear the Minister in reply on certain points, but I would be particularly interested to hear him in reply on what is the case that can be made on Section 28, and whether that Section 28 must be taken in every single instance, and that the old law, which is undoubtedly admitted law, and not doubtful law, is not to be invoked at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to reiterate fervently the appeal that Deputy Donnelly made for a speeding up of the division of lands.  We had been led to hope that under the new Bill of 1933 more speed would have shown itself in the division of land.  While I am prepared to admit that a good deal was done in County Tipperary, it only whets our appetite in County Limerick for the same speeding up there.  We have huge tracts of rich grass lands in County Limerick, held by persons with not less than 500 or 400 acres, giving very little employment, and with even that employment decreasing every day.  We have a growing population of people who are prepared to work the land and to make a living on it, and who, in the absence of that, have no alternative employment to turn to.  The agitation is getting intense, and, while people are not anxious to see the old methods of the past emulated, it is only natural to expect that if there is not more speed in the division of these lands you will have illegalities and illegal actions taking place.  I strenuously appeal to the Land Commission to concentrate on this matter of the division of land. If they have not enough officials, let them, as Deputy Donnelly suggested, get more officials.  There is no more urgent problem, in my opinion, before the country to-day than the breaking up into economic, fair-sized farms of these large ranches and the placing there of people in substitution for the grass ranchers who are not pulling their weight.  Deputy Lynch has been in great trouble about the attitude of the Labour Party.  I, too, regret that <Col N="1142" /> Deputy Davin is not present, but in view of what has happened since the passing of that Act, I am inclined to think that the Government were prophetic in taking the power of direct action to themselves in dealing with persons who failed to pay their land annuities.  The Deputies on these benches are in full sympathy with the annuitants, and not one of us would inflict hardship where it can be avoided, but we cannot afford to have a general slacking off in responsibility for the payment of these moneys.  The specious argument has been put forward from the Opposition Benches that they did not advise people not to pay the annuities.  We have that reported again and again by Deputies opposite. It is only the difference between tweedledum and tweedledee as to what they say; they said that if people were not able to pay, that is what Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney said&mdash;</P>

      <P>One would be inclined to believe that previous to this direct method there was never any hardship inflicted on annuitants.  I distinctly remember on one occasion when the courts were there to deal with these debts that 18 wagon loads of horses and cattle were taken off lands in Ennistymon. These lands were left as bare as the strand at Lahinch; the people who owned these cattle did not have a bob left.  That was done under the regime of the last Administration. I do not think that the officials of the Land Commission are such terribly hard-hearted people in contradistinction to the court officials that they would unduly harass those annuitants. These officials in the Land Commission have as much responsibility to determine the state of the country as the court officials.  I am not inclined to think that they would harass or that they are harassing any of those people. I am very glad that the Government has a weapon at its disposal to counteract what has been happening in the country, something that is aiming at the paralysis of the collection of these annuities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I repeat again that my one complaint is that sufficient speed has not yet been attained in the matter of the division of estates.  It is not inspection that is wanted; it is division of the estates. I have in mind the case of an estate of 400 acres offered by the landlord to the Land Commission at an agreed price.  That matter is still pending and we need not expect that there is any reasonable hope that it will be completed in the next five months.  I could understand the delay if there were difficulties about the price but here is a case where the landlord has offered his lands and the Land Commission has accepted the figure.  Still the landlord can get no reply as to when the estate will be taken up and divided.  That is happening at a time when there are all round that estate hundreds of people with hungry eyes waiting for a division of that land.  There are workers there who are anxious to work that land and earn a useful living from <Col N="1144" /> the soil that is going practically derelict at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexHaslett" hpid="Mr. Haslett Mr. Haslett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>I think possibly the records of the Land Commission will show that I have sent as many annuities to the Land Commission as any Deputy in the House both on my own behalf and in the course of my business, so that I want to show that I have no sympathy with the story that is being told as to the instructions or advice given to the people not to pay their annuities.  I want to give one or two instances of how the Act is worked. The Deputy who sat down has said that the Land Commission are just in as good a position as the courts to know what the condition of the annuitants is.  I do not want to be throwing bouquets at the officials of the Land Commission.  I know they have a difficult task to perform.  But how could a man attending to his business in an office in Dublin know anything about the condition of an annuitant down the country?  It would be impossible. The President said in this House that where an annuitant was not in a position to pay he ought to be given time or some sympathy should be shown him by the Land Commission. There is one annuitant whose case I want to mention to the House.  To begin with, this man is an applicant for a blind pension.  His annuity last December was £2 0s. 6d.  The bailiffs were sent on to the land to seize; for that £2 0s. 6d. they took an old cow and a calf.  This is the story of the expenses of the claim; 10/- for a car; 20/- for a lorry; 20/- for the bailiff. The cow and calf had to be kept for five days and nights before they were ultimately dealt with and the fees for the five days and nights were £1.  The total demand which that man was asked to meet was £7 0s. 6d. for a debt of £2 0s. 6d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a case which if it had been decided in the court or a decree sought in the court, I feel some time might be given, or the man might realise his position before these expenses were piled up.  There is another case of which I know, where the annuitant on account of the economic situation found that the land would not pay the annuity and the rates.  A neighbouring <Col N="1145" /> farmer was doing a kind act for this woman and her children.  While working the land for her his horses were seized for the woman's debt.  That was perfectly legal.  These are things in which direct action, such as we have under this Act, happens.  I feel if the matter had been dealt with in the old way these things would not have happened.  I do not want to throw stones, metaphorically speaking, at the officials of the Land Commission.  I agree with Deputy Donnelly that they have a good deal of difficult work to perform.  I know a little about the division of land.  Our county is not a very congested county, but I do know that there is a difficulty in getting things settled.  At the present time, it is not easy to select proper people, people who will be able to work the land economically.  I think some of the Deputies forget that it is not everyone who can be put on land.  If a person has not some little experience of the working of the land it is asking for trouble to hand him a tract of land and expect him to make good on it. Some of us who have been on the land all our lives cannot make headway on it at the moment, and it is not wise&mdash; and the Land Commission realise it&mdash;to take a townsman or some person who never had any experience, and put him on a piece of land and expect him to make good there.  To come back to the question with which a number of the Deputies have dealt, I think it would be just as well if some local investigation could be made before putting expense especially on small annuitants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister rises to conclude, I wish to put a few questions to him.  It is quite possible that he may not be able to answer them now, but he could send the answers to me afterwards.  He made no mention in his statement of these reclamation schemes in the Gaeltacht: the Cloosh Valley and the Maam Valley schemes, and there was one other.  He did not say whether these are being continued or whether there are any similar schemes being embarked upon.  I think there was also a scheme in the Belmullet area of a different type under which persons were given so much <Col N="1146" /> money for reclamation work carried out by themselves.  I should like to know what is the position with regard to these.  I also want to ask&mdash;and this is the type of question that the Minister may not be able to answer at the moment&mdash;if we can have the number of acres of land which the Land Commission have actually acquired, as distinct from land which has been inspected.  My third question is what is the approximate date on which this addition of staff, for which we are voting £20,000, was made.  If he has the figures, the Minister might also say what is the number of warrants actually issued to date by the Land Commission to under-sheriffs and county registrars, and whether any of these annuitants have made any representations to the Land Commission, before the actual issue of the warrants or subsequent to the issue of the warrants, and whether these representations have received any consideration and, finally, whether licences for the export of fat cattle to enable them to pay their annuities have been issued to any of these annuitants who have made the case of inability to sell beasts with a view to paying their annuities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two matters to which I would draw the attention of the Minister.  The first is with regard to building grants.  During the régime of the past Government very generous grants were given to certain individuals, while others on the same estates were passed over.  There was also a difference in the amount of grant given to particular individuals.  The same is true to-day, and there are cases where a particular allottee is given £200 to build a house, while another allottee received £160 or, perhaps, £150.  I think there should be a levelling up in this matter and a standard grant fixed.  It would obviate a considerable amount of the confusion and dissatisfaction that prevails if the grants were given on a standard basis. The other matter has to do with the acquisition of land.  I know that in County Galway, at any rate, a number of large holdings are held by people who are paying neither annuities nor rates.  This is a considerable hardship <Col N="1147" /> on the industrious, hard-working people who are penalised in their rates for the people who are paying neither one nor the other.  I think it would be well if returns were got from county councils all over the country with respect to persons in possession of holdings of that type, and if such holdings were to be the first to be acquired and taken over for division, leaving these people just as much as they would be able to pay for, whether it be one, three or five acres.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Cloosh Valley Scheme, I should like to remark that the people of Connemara and the Gaeltacht are 100 per cent. opposed to it.  I think it would be well if the Minister&mdash;I do not know whether he has the figures now&mdash;published the figures in connection with the cost of this scheme.  Everybody is against it, down there, anyway, and they regard it as throwing money literally into the bog.  While crops have been produced in the place, what the people down there want to know is what those crops have cost.  The general feeling is that when the Government subsidies are withdrawn, these people will no longer remain there.  They have been subsidised in various ways, one of the methods being the supplying of free lime.  There is any amount of lime available, and a very good lime kiln was built some years ago by the Land Commission at Oughterard.  It has been reserved entirely for the Cloosh Valley Scheme to the exclusion of all other people who want lime.  I would ask that where this lime was available, as it is in Oughterard, it should be made available to all smallholders.  It is very much required in places like Connemara.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall endeavour to cover the various points that have been raised by the different Deputies, and I think it would be advisable, as a preliminary, to indicate what was the actual position of the collection of the annuities at the last half year gale, which was the period I referred to in my statement.  The actual position at 25th April is that the amount collectable at that time was £1,219,513&mdash;<Col N="1148" /> that is the November-December, 1933, gale&mdash;and the amount collected up to 31st March was £855,561.  The arrears at 31st March were £363,952, being the equivalent of 27 per cent.  Since that time, notices have been sent out and the sheriffs have been active with regard to the collection of the arrears of these annuities.  There has been a great deal of talk and a great deal of complaint with regard to Section 28 of the Land Act.  I might content myself with simply pointing to the fact that it is the law, that it was embodied in the Act accepted by the Dáil and accordingly passed into legislation but there was every good reason and justification&mdash;and I think Deputy Lynch and Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney will agree when they come to consider it&mdash;for adopting this method.  I remember that in the first year in which we were in office, when returns from the Land Commission were being considered, one of the great hardships the Minister felt with regard to arrears and the position of the annuitants was the enormous percentage that had accumulated in respect of costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was felt that in many cases the costs far exceeded the amount of the annuity, or the arrears of annuities, and it was felt that the tenants or the annuitants had a very definite grievance in the way that these costs were accumulated.  I am satisfied that in the introduction of the system of having these collected by the sheriffs in this direct way there was no other purpose than the reduction and elimination of those costs.  Now, what is the position?  Prior to the passing of the Land Act, 1933, proceedings against defaulting tenant purchasers were taken by State solicitors by way of civil bills.  The solicitor's costs were measured according to the following statutory scale:&mdash;Under £2, the costs amounted to 11/-; between £2 and £5, the costs amounted to £1 3s.; between £5 and £10, the costs amounted to £1 11s. 6d.; between £10 and £15, the costs amounted to £1 19s. 6d.  In addition to the solicitor's costs, the defaulter was liable to the sheriff's costs, made up as follows: (a) A lodgment fee of 2/6 where the debt amounted to £2 or under; <Col N="1149" /> 4/- where the debt was over £2 and under £5; 6/- where the debt was over £5 and under £15; 7/- where the debt was over £15, and (b) poundage at the rate of 1/- in the £.  Where warrants are issued under Section 28 of the Land Act, 1923, the solicitor's costs are cut out, and the defaulter is liable to pay the following to the sheriff: (a) 1/- costs of issuing letter applying for payment; (b) lodgment fee; so that, if he gets in touch with the sheriff within 15 days, his total costs, irrespective of the amount of his annuity, will be 1/- plus the lodgment fee.  The lodgment fee is as follows:&mdash;2/6 where the debt is £2 or under; 4/- where the debt is over £2 and under £5; 6/- where the debt is over £5 and under £15; 7/- where the debt is over £15.  If the defaulter pays within 15 days of the date of the sheriff's letter he is liable for 1/- plus the lodgment fee.  After 15 days he is liable for 1/- in the £ as well.  The Land Commission must lodge with the sheriff with each warrant the appropriate lodgment fee. Where the sheriff succeeds, repayment is made to the Land Commission. Where he fails, the Land Commission lose the lodgment fee.  The number of warrants issued under Section 28 of the Land Act, 1933, amounts to 52,508, and the lodgment fees amount to £11,221.  Of this sum, the sheriffs have to date recovered £1,393, which has been paid to the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>That answers quite a number of the questions and the discussion that took place with regard to Section 28.  I think that if one does not adopt purely a lawyer's point of view&mdash;if one is looking at it from the point of view of economy, and from the point of view of the annuitant&mdash;one will realise that there is a very considerable saving.  I must confess that I was very much worried and humanly depressed over the amount of costs that did figure in the assessment of the arrears of annuities when we used to be considering them at the Executive Council.  I think a very considerable percentage of the arrears was built up with such costs as were worked out on the basis I have mentioned.  I think, in all the circumstances, Section 28 is a good section, <Col N="1150" /> and I do not think it inflicts any hardship. Arising out of Section 28 it may be argued, and it has been suggested here, that a man could go to the court and make his plea in court.  He could ask time for payment; he could ask the court to give him a reasonable time, pointing out that in a few months he might be in a better position to pay, and so on.  We have no evidence here that the sheriffs are not doing that.  As a matter of fact, we know that the sheriffs are quite willing to be lenient, and to make arrangements with any of the people who come and explain their position.  The Deputy knows, probably better than most of the Deputies in the House, how impossible it would be for the Minister to interfere with this matter of collection.  I do not want for a moment to introduce the arguments that have been made here, one Deputy stating that there is no such thing as a campaign against the payment of annuities, and another Deputy stating that there is.  I think there is.  I have always thought there is, and I do not see how anybody, unless he is utterly blind or prejudiced, could agree that there was not a campaign on in certain areas, but it is worthy of being pointed out here that those poor counties&mdash; Deputy McMenamin referred to the County Donegal and Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney referred to County Mayo&mdash;are the counties that have paid.  We find that the payments have been withheld in the very richest parts of the country, and in many cases by people who have benefited more from the Land Commission activities than the people in other parts.  The very individuals who are digging themselves in and refusing to pay are the people who really are in a position to pay.  However, as I say, I do not want to enter into that controversy at the moment.  I merely stress the fact that those poor counties have paid, and paid splendidly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lynch has referred&mdash;and quite reasonably referred &mdash;to the increase of £36,000 in salaries and travelling expenses, and he contrasts that with the increase of only £20,000 in the sub-head for the improvement of estates.  There was for last year a Supplementary Estimate, and this has got to be borne in mind under sub-head (J).  The increase in sub-head (J) as against last year's original Estimate amounts to £60,000, and I want to assure the Deputy and the House that I will not hesitate for a moment to come into this House if I want £100,000 for improvement in the division of land.  I think that is the job of the Land Commission, and that we cannot get it done too quickly.  We do think that the division of land is a serious business.  Our inspectors have got considerable difficulty, first of all, in selecting and inspecting the land, and then seeing that there is a proper scheme, so that the people who are put on the land are people who will work the land on the lines on which we want it worked, in other words, in the proper method of husbandry.  As regards the expenditure on improvement works, which would naturally follow on wider and wider distribution of land, the Deputy or any other Deputy need not worry about that, because if we need more money to get that done we will come in here and ask for a Supplementary Estimate. The position at the moment is that there is really a jump from £190,000 to £250,000 for that annual expenditure on improvements.  If the Supplementary Estimate which was introduced last year is kept in mind, it means an actual increase of £60,000. Deputy Lynch stated that it was division&mdash;that it was more than inspection and acquisition.  There is only one reason for inspection and acquisition, and that is to give us the land for division. The Deputy, I think, will admit that it is only after inspection and acquisition have taken place that we can proceed to divide.  Now that I have <Col N="1152" /> dealt with the sheriffs' position, I would like to make clear one point. Deputy Lynch is under a misapprehension when he said that there was a statement that the sheriffs' clause would only be used in the most exceptional cases.  So far as I know, there was no such statement made on the part of the Minister.  However, I have dealt with that, and pointed out why this method was adopted in preference to the old.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McMenamin raised various points.  He also referred to the delay in the sub-division branch.  We have to remember we only got the Land Act in October, 1933.  We also had some delay in getting the Land Bonds Act into operation, and these two factors held us up, to some extent, until later on in the year.  We feel we have now got the machine at our hand.  We have increased our staff during last year, and it is quite likely, and it is on the <i>tapis</i> at the moment, that we will still further increase our staff on the sub-division of land.  I realise perhaps more than most members of the House the acute pressure there is for the sub-division of land and, so far as I am concerned, I want to see that worked out to the maximum.  Various other points were mentioned by Deputy McMenamin.  I do not know whether I followed them accurately or not.  He spoke of the division of turbary and where turbary that had been attached to a freehold was exhausted. I cannot speak offhand, but if Deputy McMenamin will bring any particular case before us we will have it looked into.  Deputy McMenamin also referred to a matter of improvements. He does not seem to be quite clear as to whether these improvements were carried out by the Board of Works or by the Land Commission. Broadly speaking, if land is improved by a road or a bridge, and it is vested in the owner, the Land Commission. do not touch it.  Where the land is not vested the Land Commission deal with it themselves.  It is true that in a good many of the relief works carried out by the Board of Works, some work that may be of use to the land, and may save the Land Commission expenditure, takes place, but the <Col N="1153" /> Deputy will have no difficulty in informing himself which Department is responsible.  In the main the Land Commission, deliberately, avoids cutting in on relief works, and tries to confine its activities to its own work on estates.  I think that is good policy. It is good policy to have one Department looking after relief works and doing it properly.  The Deputy raised a question with regard to fishery rights.  I would like if he leaves that over for me to look into.  There is an important legal matter involved, I think, and I do not propose to reply to him at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no longer in your Department anyhow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but the Deputy referred to it in connection with certain holding of fishery rights in connection with land.  Deputy Donnelly referred to evicted tenants. That is always, of course, a burning issue in connection with the division of land.  The position we take up is this: where an evicted tenant has continued as an agriculturalist, whether as a farm labourer, or small holder, he is definitely in a category for consideration when land comes to be divided.  Since I came to the Land Commission I have had experience of other types of evicted tenants.  There is the type who is heir to an evicted tenant, whose father, or grandfather, had been evicted off the land.  He, perhaps, has drifted into city life, and such work as it offers.  He feels that on account of the eviction that took place in his grandfather's time he has a claim upon the land.  I may say quite frankly we do not consider such cases.  What, we suggest, is an evicted tenant worthy of consideration, is a tenant who, when put on the land is able to work the land and who has some prospect of making good on the land and has a definite claim as an evicted tenant or heir to an evicted tenant.  These people are quite high up in the category of potential allottees that are considered by the Commissioners.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney raised a question of speed in the division of land in Mayo.  I think we have at present some 12,000 acres in division in Mayo. <Col N="1154" /> We have had a drive, and we expect to complete that drive, and to have the scheme put forward as quickly as possible.  He, also, mentioned a case being decided in the court and suggested that we should suspend all operations in connection with the collection of annuities in the meantime. I would like Deputies, like Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, and others to realise the danger of making that suggestion in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt the Minister?  Surely he has misunderstood what Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney said.  What he stated was that the Minister should cease to proceed in this method of collection of annuities, and went on to refer to the old method and to the ordinary way of collecting the annuities through the courts.  He did not suggest abandoning that so long as the law is as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest the law stands as it is and Section 28 operates, and I think I have made a pretty good case under Section 28 on behalf of the annuitants themselves.  The Deputy referred to a case in the courts.  I do not want to discuss it; it is <i>sub judice.</i> That case and possibly one other are two cases that have emerged out of something like 450,000 cases of annuities to be collected each half year.  I think, whatever might be said, that is a reasonably small percentage in all the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Did not the Minister ever hear of a test case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I have heard of a test case.  There are certain difficulties at times in the Land Commission with regard to knowing exactly who is the registered owner and the proper person.  That is not due to any fault in the Land Commission.  It is entirely due to the fact that sometimes when a person dies and the estate passes on to somebody else&mdash;it may be a small estate&mdash;we would know nothing about probate, probate in that case not having arisen.  But the fault, in that case, does not lie with the Land Commission but with the other people concerned.  I mention that because Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney stressed the point that applications for annuities <Col N="1155" /> had been addressed to the wrong persons.</P>
      <P>Then, with regard to the Cloosh, Ballycroy and Donegal reclamation schemes, I do not know what to say exactly about these.  I have seen the scheme at Cloosh and analysed the position and it seems to be a reasonably good scheme to me.  I have raised recently certain points in connection with these schemes and I am having them examined by the Department of Agriculture.  The main question involved is that of the cost of fertilisers.  The big issue in the Cloosh scheme is that there is very definite hostility in that area and, whilst I have no desire to yield to any prejudice&mdash;if it is a prejudice&mdash;at the same time, I have no desire to run my head against a stone wall and try to force a whole community to work a reclamation scheme of which they do not want to get the benefit. That is the position.  The scheme at Ballycroy has not, I believe, been quite so successful as Cloosh but, strange as it may seem, it appears to have appealed to the people in that area.  At the moment, I am not in a position to say definitely what will be the ultimate fate of these schemes. Houses have been built at Cloosh and these houses are occupied.  In so far as that has gone, it will be completed, but the question arises whether we should pursue further activities by way of a wider extension of that scheme.  I should like to see that done and I should like to assure myself and be in a position to assure the people in that area, as well as Deputies, that the scheme was going to be a success.  I believe there is every indication of success at the moment.  I should like, however, to be still more satisfied with regard to the annual cost of fertilisers in order to arrive at a conclusion as to whether or not that scheme would be worth pursuing and expanding in that area. I shall be able at any time to let the Deputy know the latest information the Land Commission have on the matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Beegan raised the question of differentiation in respect of grants and amounts of grants for building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1156" /> These are not matters with which the Minister deals.  It must be remembered that in all these matters the Commissioners, sitting as a commission, make these decisions.  The Minister has the responsibility for indicating policy and for seeing that policy is carried out.  If any instance of this nature is brought to my attention by any Deputy, I shall have it investigated and see what can be done.  Deputy Keyes raised the question of division.  The main burden of the story to-day was an appeal for speeding up the division of land.  No Deputy is more anxious for rapid division than I am and I hope to have that division driven through as quickly as it can now be done.  Deputy Keyes referred to estates of 400 or 500 acres in Limerick.  I know that there are estates of that acreage, and bigger acreage, in a great many counties.  It is just such lands that we shall be going after, always provided that we think that division is essential, that there is congestion in the area and that the people holding the lands are not using them in the best interests of the people.  If we take the case of a stud farm or a huge grain cropping area, where a great deal of employment is given, if the owner of the land is working it to the limit in the interests of the people and in the interests of employment, then that is a case for consideration and all the economic factors will be considered. But where these lands are held by people who will not change their method of development or their use of the land, then, definitely, the Land Commission is going out after those lands and is going to get them.  That is the set policy.  I have, I think, dealt with most of the points raised. If there are any matters outstanding or any points which I have not made perfectly clear, I shall be glad to give a fuller explanation by letter or otherwise.</P>

      <P>In view of the number of warrants issued&mdash;52,508&mdash;I should like to know if the Land Commission made any enquiries from the sheriff or otherwise, before issuing the warrants, as to the ability of the annuitants to pay.  The number is so enormous that this seems to be taken as a matter of routine.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not do that and I do not know where the work of the Land Commission would stop if we started to make inquiries in the different districts.  I would be inundated with requests from Deputies to take into account the circumstances of defaulters.  In sheer self-defence and in defence of the whole organisation, I have had to say that I do not interfere with the Collection Branch.  The Deputy will realise what it would mean to have a letter from each one of 58,000 defaulters as well as letters from Deputies and others.  Even Deputies would not have as good&mdash;or as bad&mdash;a life as they have at present if this innovation were made.</P>

      <P>I omitted to mention a matter on which I should like to have some information.  I refer to the planting with grass of Dunfanaghy and Horn Head.  I wonder if any progress has been made in that connection.  The matter has been under consideration for over a year.  The sand is encroaching very rapidly and destroying the other land.  During the summer, I noticed an additional stretch of land which had been destroyed by the sand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy called my attention to that matter because I have been discussing it with the inspector of the Land Commission who is particularly interested and who is an expert on reclamation.  I am not in a position at the moment to say what his decision will be but I am hopeful that we will be able to plant these grasses, with the object of saving <Col N="1158" /> the area around Dunfanaghy.  I know the area well and I shall see what we can do.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £81,204 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1935, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Forestry, including a Grant-in-Aid for Acquisition of Land (9 and 10 Geo. 5, c. 58, and No. 34 of 1928).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total net Vote proposed for the current financial year is £121,804, which represents an increase over last year of £29,578.  Deputies are already aware that a considerable expansion in forestry operation is in contemplation and the increase in the Vote is, it is hoped, but the first step in that direction.  During the year which ended on 31st March last 10,617 acres were acquired for forestry purposes. This area added to what has already been acquired in previous years makes a total of 65,173 acres. The total area planted or replanted to date is 38,309 acres, of which 4,175 acres were planted during the past season.  Approximately about 9,000 acres in hands are unfit for planting, and 6,000 acres are covered by mature or immature plantations established by previous owners.  About 100 acres <Col N="1159" /> are occupied by nurseries, and 900 acres represent lands covered by scrub which has to be cleared for planting, lands let for grazing, etc.  Of the lands in respect of which negotiations for acquisition have been completed about 5,000 acres have not yet been taken over from the vendors.  As regards the area unfit for planting, experience indicates that, on an average for every 1,200 acres acquired about 1,000 acres of productive land is secured.</P>
    <P>The figures quoted will show what a small margin there is to meet the extended programme now in view, and the urgent importance of expediting the acquisition of lands on a greatly increased scale.  Even apart from the necessity of speeding up in this respect, acceleration of the rate of acquisition is also necessary in order that a very substantial reserve may be created, so that the work of planting may be co-ordinated with the nursery work.  On an average a plant requires three years' nursery treatment before removal to the forest and, therefore, a sufficient reserve should be available to allow for a programme of planting to be prepared three years in advance and for nursery operations to be adjusted to meet the requirements of such a programme.  This is the best way to ensure an adequate supply of plants and to prevent waste by having available each season in the Department's own nurseries plants of the ages and varieties necessary for the particular lands to be planted that season.</P>
    <P>The expanded programme and the increase in staff that will be necessary in consequence will be reflected in the various sub-heads of the Estimate which I shall now refer to in detail. Sub-head A.  Salaries, Wages and Allowances, £8,170.  This is an increase of £319 as compared with last year. The increase here may seem very small to meet the requirements of the extended operations of the Department, but the explanation is that the Estimate includes only the extra staff already approved when the Estimate was prepared and does not make any provision for the further additions <Col N="1160" /> which are under consideration and in respect of which it will be necessary to seek sanction by way of a Supplementary Estimate.  The proposals now under consideration provide for substantial increase in the inspectorate class, as well as a greatly augmented staff in the forester and foreman grades.</P>
    <P>Sub-head B, Travelling Expenses, £1,350.  The increase of £350 for travelling expenses and subsistence allowances it is anticipated will be necessary as a result of the increase in the outdoor staff.  Sub-head C 1. There is an increase of £15,000 under this sub-head for the acquisition of lands for forestry purposes.  The sum of £50,000 now sought, together with the balance of £27,601 brought over from last year will leave £77,601 available for acquisition proceedings this year.  The amount voted under this sub-head is by way of grant-in-aid and hence any unexpended money does not revert to the Exchequer but is carried forward either to meet the purchase price of lands in respect of which commitments have already been made or to form, with the additional moneys voted for the purpose in the following year, the fund available for acquisition transactions in that year.  The acceleration of the rate of acquisition should practically exhaust the entire sum now being made available.  As has already been stated, the area planted last season was 4,175 acres and the Departmental intention this year is to plant at least 6,000 acres.  I may mention that that figure is based on the Estimate as it was prepared. I will give additional information about that later.  It will probably arise when I am replying on the Vote.  This represents a substantial increase but it must be considered nevertheless merely an indication of what will have to be done in the immediate future if the expanded programme is to be realised within a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>Sub-head C 2.  The sum of £66,725 required under this head is to meet:&mdash; (1)  The wages of the permanent staff of foresters and foremen consisting of ten Grade I foresters, 20 Grade II foresters and ten foremen, all of whom <Col N="1161" /> have been trained by this Department. The wages of 34 caretakers are included also in this time.  Outlying forest properties of limited extent where planting work has been completed or is not necessary are generally placed in the charge of caretakers, who are paid small allowances varying with the importance of the area under their care. The estimated cost of this item is £5,875.  (2) Maintenance.  This represents the cost of the labour required for preliminary fencing of new areas and for the cleaning and other operations in connection with plantations already established.  It includes also £3,600 for the provision of necessary fencing materials and £1,000 for the upkeep of buildings on the forest properties.  The cost of maintenance is estimated at £15,850.  (3) Cultural Operations.  This item represents the cost of the workmen required for nursery work, preparation of ground for planting and the actual planting. The estimated cost is £41,250 for labour, £1,500 for purchase of seeds and plants and £2,250 for cartage, ploughing, purchase of manures etc.</P>
    <P>The number of labourers employed varies according to the nature of the seasonal operations, reaching its maximum during the planting season. The maximum was reached in March when 1,300 men were employed.  During part of the summer their number is reduced to about 500, but this is increased again during the summer clearing operations to about 600.  In addition, out of money made available from the Vote for the Relief of Unemployment and Distress about 250 men were employed during the winter and spring months on operations that could not otherwise have been undertaken.</P>
    <P>Included also in this sub-head C 2 is an item of £1,500 for the purchase of seeds and seedlings and transplants which may be wanted.  The Department purchased last year 3,240 lbs. of seed which was obtained from the Western States of United States of America (410 lbs.), Holland (500 lbs.), Germany (1,270 lbs.), Austria (200 lbs.), Denmark (20 lbs.), Corsica (50 lbs.), and so on.  The bulk of the transplants and seedlings used are now produced <Col N="1162" /> in our own nurseries, and a beginning has been made in extracting and collecting seed at home.  During last year a small seed-extracting plant was crected and subjected to a preliminary trial, resulting in about 150 lbs. of coniferous seed being extracted from home-collected cones.  In September last, stocks occupying about 135 acres and including 31,000,000 seedlings and approximately 19,000,000 transplants were in the nurseries.  These stocks provided 11,000,000 plants for planting. A good stock of oak, ash, elm sycamore, beech, and alder was raised and it is hoped that it will be possible not only to maintain but to increase the acreage of good hardwood in the country.</P>
    <P>Sub-head C 3, £1,504.  The Department has a sawmill at Dundrum and another, but smaller one, at Emo Forest, Portarlington.  This item is to cover the cost of these mills.  There is a considerable demand at Dundrum for the manufactured and partly manufactured products of the mill.</P>
    <P>Sub-head D, £450.  This sub-head is for the purpose of providing a sum to make grants to private persons and local bodies undertaking afforestation. Grants towards the establishment of new plantations are made at the rate of £4 per acre, payable in three instalments as follows:&mdash;£2 per acre as soon as the plantation has been laid down and properly fenced; £1 per acre in five years' time, provided the plantation has been properly maintained; £1 per acre after a further five years on a similar condition.</P>
    <P>Grants are made only in respect of a minimum area of five acres planted either by one holder or by two or more joint holders.  It may perhaps be felt by some that the minimum acreage should be reduced, but this aspect of the matter has already been considered, and the conclusion reached is that the inspection of smaller areas would not be justified by the results achieved.  Moreover, facilities already exist under the machinery of the county committees of agriculture for the provision of good plants at a cheap rate, and there is no reason why these facilities should not be availed of, particularly <Col N="1163" /> for the provision of small shelter belts.</P>
    <P>It is a pity more persons do not avail themselves of the grants provided under this sub-head, as the fund available has been only partly exhausted each year since the inauguration of the scheme in 1930-31.  This brings up a matter to which reference might be made here, that is the applications that are made to the Department to purchase small patches of land completely isolated from any existing forest centre.  It will be agreed that the acquisition of such small areas would be impracticable even for the most sympathetic department, but there should be nothing to prevent the owners of these lands making use of the facilities provided by the Department.  By doing so they will be helping on in a practical way the work of afforestation.  If the comparatively few who now avail of this fund were increased to some thousands every year the results in a few years would be very perceptible and would change the appearance of many districts now bleak and shelterless. It is hoped that those who have been making urgent representations to the Government will keep this aspect of the case before them and explore the possibility of carrying out useful work in this direction.</P>
    <P>Sub-head E, Forestry Education, £300.  This item is for the training of apprentices so that the Department may not only be in a position to obtain suitable forest foremen, but men whose training has been specially adapted to the requirements of this country.  It is proposed to hold an examination for 12 positions as trainees in July next under the auspices of the Civil Service Commission. This item also includes a short course of lectures for foresters and foremen in the Department's service. These courses have been given during the last few years and have been very beneficial to those participating.  The good results justify their continuance.</P>
    <P>Sub-head F, £10.  This sum is intended to cover any expense involved in connection with the provision of expert advice for local bodies and <Col N="1164" /> private owners.  Sub-head G, £195. This sub-head is to meet the expense of advertising the letting of shootings, grazings, sales of timber, etc., which is estimated at £50.  There is also under this sub-head the cost of telegrams, £10; telephone service, £20, and miscellaneous, £65.</P>
    <P>Sub-head H, Appropriations-in-Aid, £6,900.  This sum represents receipts from the sale of mature timber, receipts from the sale of the products of the saw-mill at Dundrum, rents from miscellaneous items such as grazings, cottages, turbary and shootings. An increased income is anticipated this year towards this sub-head of £2,450.  With the development and extension of the Department's forest properties, the income resulting from the operations in the forests should show a steady increase from year to year.</P>
    <P>There is an important matter to which reference should now be made. Under the provisions of the Forestry Act, 1928, it is laid down that before any tree can be felled the prescribed notice must be lodged with the local sergeant of the nearest Civic Guard station, and if after the expiration of 21 days from the lodgment of this notice no prohibition order has been served on the person lodging the notice, he is at liberty to fell the trees mentioned in the notice.  This, one would think, is a very simple matter, not inflicting any unreasonable inconvenience on any person, but merely requiring him to attend at a Civic Guard station, ask for the prescribed form, fill it up, and leave it with the Gárdí.  In spite of this, illegal felling still continues and, in many cases, the explanation given by the offenders is that they were unaware of the provisions of the Act, notwithstanding that it has been in operation since the 1st April, 1930, and that reports of prosecutions in respect of offences have frequently appeared in the public Press.  If these illegal fellings were permitted to continue unchecked the intentions of the Act, namely, the conservation of the timber resources of the country, would be entirely frustrated.  It must be clearly understood that offenders will no longer be <Col N="1165" /> allowed to do so with impunity, and it is the intention in future to see that the requirements of the Act are respected.  A good number of prosecutions were successfully undertaken during the year, and this policy will be maintained from this onward.</P>
    <P>I have confined my analysis to the programme that was in mind when these Estimates were prepared, but as I think most Deputies know, the whole policy of forestry expansion is being examined.  Certain decisions on the future programme have yet to be made, but I am hopeful that in the very near future I will be bringing definite proposals before the Dáil and seeking legislative authority for a much wider programme of forestry development than has yet been attempted in the Saorstát.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Estimate was before the House last year I complained that the then Minister for Agriculture, who was in charge of forestry, made a very vague and indefinite statement which conveyed very little information to Deputies.  I am very sorry to say that I have got exactly the same complaint to make on this occasion.  We have got from the Minister a very vague and a very indefinite statement.  For instance, we were told that 6,000 acres will be planted this year, but we were not told in what part of the country, or the class of timber that is going to be put on these 6,000 acres.  We were not told what is the ultimate object of planting.  I should explain that when you plant timber it is contemplated that ultimately it will have a market value, and that it will be cut down at a certain date.  When timber is planted, there is something in mind after a considerable number of years have passed.  It is planted with a particular object, that there will be a definite class of timber available. That is the sort of information we should like to get, which we are always asking for and which we can never get in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that 6,000 acres are going to be planted.  The Minister did say that some of that would be hard wood.  Where the hard wood is going <Col N="1166" /> to be planted or where the mixed plantations are going to be set up, we are not told.  The Minister talks about conifers.  We should like very much to know what class of conifer is now being planted by the Department. The Minister also says that a very large sum of money has been spent in importing seed from the United States, Holland and various other places. What seed?  After all, to say that we have imported tree seed means absolutely nothing and what I think the House would like to know, if we have got £400 of seed from the United States, what class of seed it was.  I presume it was silver spruce or something of that kind.  We should also like to know what seed was got from Austria and Holland.  That is quite simple information to give the House and it is the sort of information that anybody who wishes to understand the Forestry Estimate would like to have.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister if any experiments are being made with the more modern forms of timber or whether the more modern forms, as I would call them, are being solely planted by the Department because I would imagine that it would be extremely unlikely and certainly it would be extremely unwise for the Department to import any larch seed into this country.  I would imagine that of all the conifers, larch is the most suited to this country as well as being the most valuable.  It grows in every single part of the country.  It is in most parts of the country an extremely healthy and a very quick-growing tree.  The old larch is the tree which should be most planted by the Department.  I gather from what the Minister said that that is simply not the case.  I am simply speculating and drawing conclusions from the Minister's statement as I can do nothing else owing to the inadequate amount of information that has been given to us.  I am taking it that the Department import larch seed, but there is a great deal of disease amongst larch which has not reached this country yet, or, at any rate, has not reached any of the areas with which I am acquainted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1167" /> There is just one other matter to which I would like to bring the Minister's notice to ascertain if it has been at all considered.  In the quick production of timber there is nothing which can at all touch the modern hybrid poplar, which is rather popular at the moment.  It is a tree that matures in 19 or 20 years, and the enormous forest tree is dead of old age at 25 or 30 years or thereabouts.  I suppose the Minister is probably aware that Bryant and Mays have bought a very large area in Perthshire and have planted that area. What that very large firm is doing as a business experiment is just the type of thing that I would like the Department to consider.  I would like to know if the Department are working on similar lines.  That experiment of Bryant and Mays in Perthshire has attracted a very considerable amount of attention.  As far as I have been able to gather&mdash;naturally enough I am not an expert in forestry and I have not got expert information available&mdash; from the various articles I have read upon the subject, a great deal of that plantation of Bryant and Mays consists of these modern poplars with their enormously quick production of timber which is available for pulping when the trees are forest trees.  I should like to know if that class of plantation is in contemplation by the Department.</P>
    <P>There are various other matters which the House would like to know, but when the Minister simply tells us that 6,000 acres are going to be planted somewhere, we have not the remotest idea where these districts are and it is really giving this House no information. It is hardly fair to this House that we are treated as persons who are not worthy of consideration.  We are simply told: &ldquo;We are going to do this and you need not bother your heads about it.&rdquo;  That is not the way in which the House should be treated.  I want again to urge, as I have done before, that if a large scheme of planting is to be undertaken, it is not wise, nor do I think it fair, that that planting should be confined, as it has been confined, for all practical purposes to one county.  Wicklow is being fully planted but nowhere else that I can <Col N="1168" /> see.  Certainly I cannot see any new plantations in Connacht.  I would venutre to point out to the Minister that statements which I have heard made here before that timber cannot be successfully grown in the Mayo mountains are absolutely wrong.  Along the western seaboard, I have seen very excellent hard wood and some very excellent conifers.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is in the slightest doubt about that I would suggest that he should send an expert to see one of the most exposed places on the Mayo coast&mdash;Old Head&mdash;which lies between Westport and Louisburgh, on the south shore of Clew Bay.  He will find the district planted to a very considerable height, probably with hard wood but with some Scotch fir intermixed.  The plantations are in an extremely healthy condition.  If that could be done by private enterprise, probably 100 years ago, the same thing can be done all over the country to-day, and if there is going to be a large scheme it is essential that those poorer districts in the Mayo mountains, a great deal of which can be of no other use except to grow timber, should be considered. As far as I can gather no attention has so far been given to those districts.  Of course I know it is an ordinary thing for Deputies in this House to get up and put forward claims for their constituencies. That is a rather cheap method of getting publicity for the Deputy concerned, but it is not from a desire to get anything in the nature of publicity that I am putting these matters before the Minister.  I am putting forward the claim that this part of my constituency is a part of the country which can be profitably planted and it is a part of the country in which nothing has been done so far. If that is true of the mountains of Mayo, it would be equally true of the mountains of Donegal, Connemara and Kerry.  These areas seem to be entirely neglected as far as planting is concerned and yet they are areas in which large acreages of timber could be grown at a very small cost indeed. They are acres which were at one time covered with native timber and which could be again successfully planted with both hard wood and conifers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1169" /> There is another matter to which I would like to direct the Minister's notice.  Along the western seaboard generally very little timber is left. Most of the timber in these counties was in demesnes but for all practical purposes there are hardly any demesnes now left.  When the demesnes were broken up the timber was invariably cut down.</P>
    <P>I see, according to the evening papers, where a very handsome place in County Galway, called Pallas, owned by the late Lord Westmeath, is being sold to a timber merchant. That is what is happening.  Everywhere the timber is being cut down.  In a few years' time, as things are going on, if the ordinary small farmer wants the makings of a cart he will not be able to get a large tree. There will not be a large tree to be had in another 20 years because, as I am sure the Minister knows, a larch tree after 80 or 100 years ceases to be of very much use.  You will not be able to get a large tree to make a cart in County Mayo in a very few years' time.  The same thing will apply to Scotch fir, and spruce which is used for roofing; you will not be able to get them.  You will have to import every single bit of timber used in the particular areas.  It may be all right to go in for huge blocks here and there, running into thousands of acres.  At the same time, you will find that it will be quite economical to have your 40 or 50 acre plantation in places where there is other timber, because you will get a very good price for the trees when they are matured. Your first clearing, I suppose, will be in 20 years or thereabouts, but ultimately you will get a very good price for that timber, because people will not have the enormous carriage to pay which they will have to pay on imported timber.</P>
    <P>For instance, if you have a plantation and there is no other plantation within ten or 20 miles, as happens in certain areas now, the trees there will go very much more to local buyers than they will in areas where there are plantations of 3,000 or 4,000 acres and where they are sold in blocks.  It is also a very great convenience to <Col N="1170" /> people to be able to get native timber which they want for various purposes. If the local carpenter wants an ash to make harrows, or a larch to make a cart, or a sycamore or elm for other things, they will not be available and they will have to be brought from one part of Ireland to another where, if the Department set to work, they could be successfully grown.  I should like, if I possibly could, to lay the bogey which seems to have obsessed the Department of Forestry, that the West coast of Ireland cannot give timber.  It has given timber; it is, to a certain extent, giving timber at present; and it could give plenty of timber in the future if it is planted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to agree with Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney that the Minister's statement could have had rather more substance, could be more comprehensive both with regard to present and prospective operations in the Forestry Department.  I would remind the Deputy, however, that that has always been the case with regard to the Forestry Estimate.  In fact, it was very much more the case in the time of the former Government than it has been during the time of the present Government.  If there was any time when the former Minister for Agriculture was embarrassed or perturbed&mdash;if one could imagine such a Deputy being embarrassed or perturbed&mdash;it was when he was introducing the Estimate for Forestry.  If it were not written on his face it was implied in the first words he spoke, that he knew nothing about forestry and that he thought less about the subject.  I think it was a section of his work to which he never paid the least attention.  I am not speaking in considerable derogation of him and I am not going to dwell on the point&mdash;I am only speaking in reply to Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney.  At all events, the present Minister is showing considerably more interest in that Department than was shown previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like, however, to have a great deal more information on several points to which Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney referred.  For instance, one thing that he emphasised would be <Col N="1171" /> worth a good deal of inquiry on the part of the Minister&mdash;that is the tremendous difference between the experience of the ordinary man interested in the growing of trees and the dogmas of the Forestry Department.  In many parts of the country people will call your attention to the fact that the Forestry Department is quite sure that trees cannot be grown on bog or moorish ground and they will say, &ldquo;Come here and I will show you.&rdquo;  As late as last Sunday, I had that experience, and I have had it again and again.  I think it would be worth while for the Minister to inquire whether his scientific experts are altogether as reliable as they seem to think they are in what they lay down with regard to the growing of trees on more or less barren land, particularly bog.  In that respect, the former director of forestry, Mr. Forbes, was not so convinced as possibly the present staff are.  I remember very well interviewing him with regard to a piece of cut-away bog in which I was interested and he promised to have it examined and possibly an experiment carried out with regard to the growing of trees.  I know that nothing has been done since in connection with it. In view of the amount of land of that kind in the country, I am sure there should be a good deal of investigation done and perhaps a good deal of experiment.  Certainly, it is the belief of many people that land such as that, which is at present absolutely useless, could be utilised for the growing of trees.</P>
    <P>One of the principal things for which I rose was to ask the Minister if he could not be a little more generous with regard to the purchase of land for forestry purposes.  He is getting offers of hilly land at present and, owing to the bad circumstances of many farmers, the land is being offered at a very low price.  I put it to him, is it altogether fair to avail of the circumstances of people and to take such land from them at the price at which it is offered?  It does not look well for a Government Department to exploit the bad circumstances of people. While I know that there is no intention <Col N="1172" /> of doing so, that certainly is the result.  Unfortunate people, who are in very bad circumstances, and who have control over some hundreds of acres of hill, which is used for sheep grazing and so on, owing to want of cash are inclined to offer it to the Department for forestry purposes.  As far as I can learn, although I cannot speak with great certainty on the matter, the Forestry Department is availing of such offers to buy this land at a very low price.  I wonder if that is wise.  I know there is the other view, that the State should act the business man; that the State should not give more for anything it buys than the people who want to sell are prepared to take.  On the other hand, I think that Deputies in every part of the House would not like to see advantage taken of poor people to purchase land which has been in their hands for generations, which has been very valuable for sheep-grazing purposes, at a price that, in my opinion, and in the opinion of many other people who have spoken to me on the matter, is altogether below its value for sheep-grazing purposes.  I think the Minister might at least tell us what the attitude of his Department is on the question.</P>
    <P>In the same connection, I should like to know whether the Minister proposes to put into effect the compulsory powers that his Department enjoys at present with regard to the acquisition of land which is obviously suitable for tree planting and which is not being used, at least to any considerable extent, for sheep-grazing purposes. As far as I can learn, unless land is offered voluntarily, or unless the owner of the land is prepared to negotiate on voluntary terms, at present the Department leave it alone&mdash;they are not prepared to put their compulsory powers into operation.  In many places, it seems to me there would be every justification for putting the compulsory powers into operation.  The people are getting impatient in certain places where there are hills which, as I have said, are not being used for grazing purposes and are obviously extremely valuable for planting purposes.  People are impatient for the Department to <Col N="1173" /> put into effect the compulsory powers it has to acquire this land.  Having failed in its offer to buy the land, the Department is naturally faced with a deadlock unless it takes over compulsorily.</P>
    <P>As regards shelter belts, the Minister complained that there is not sufficient advantage being taken of the grants offered for the cultivation of such belts in different parts of the country. The reason is very obvious.  People have never heard of this offer.  It is not advertised or otherwise brought to their notice.  I am positive a great many farmers of the progressive type would avail of these grants, but the fact is that if they ever did hear of them they did not hear continuously of them and it does not occur to them to take advantage of the Government's offer.  I am sure if those people heard of the grants through the county councils, or through any other body, they would be only too glad to avail of them.  I suggest the remedy is largely in the hands of the Minister's officials.  They can keep reminding the public, either through local bodies or some other media, that these grants are available and in that way, I believe, they will find plenty of people anxious to take advantage of them.</P>
    <P>Another question to which I would like to advert has relation to the sales of timber that is being cut down by the Forestry Department.  I would like to know how far these sales are paying for the expense of rearing the trees.  I think it was the case two or three years ago that the timber cut on a Government plantation realised a very poor price; in fact, it represented a tremendous loss and it would not repay the expenses incurred by the Government in the production of that timber for more than a period of two or three years.  I would like to know whether there is a tendency for the revenue from that source to improve or whether the Minister has any method of improving the revenue. Up to recently, at all events, such timber was in competition with foreign timber being sold at dumped prices. I do not know if that is so at the moment.  I do not know if the Department have annually to face the <Col N="1174" /> problem of cutting down a certain number of trees that have matured and selling them at the ordinary market price.  It would be interesting to know how far that is being done, whether we may expect the acreage that matures to increase each year and consequently, whether the supply of native timber will increase, and how far it is being protected against foreign competition.  We would like to know whether the Forestry Department is taking any steps to secure its expenses from sales of the kind to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>If I were speaking entirely for my  praise for the Minister.  I would not venture even the very mild criticism that I have ventured.  So far as Wicklow is concerned, the Department of Forestry is in the position of a fairy godmother.  There are many parishes where people look to forestry as their main source of livelihood.  So much is it valued in that county, so much are the activities of the Forestry Department appreciated, that I consider that when the programme for the whole country is in operation you will have a very considerable population in an equally appreciative frame of mind towards the Government. Certainly, in Wicklow, the work seems to be greatly esteemed.  I do not think that it is merely for the sake of the work that it is esteemed.  The people seem to like the idea of being engaged in an industry that is genuinely leading to the production of wealth, and that is exceedingly useful in so far as increasing the assets of the country is concerned.</P>
    <P>I would like, however, to hear of the Minister's plans with regard to the country as a whole.  I do not expect that he will go on a haphazard plan and plant merely wherever suitable land is offered.  I expect that he will set about planting in areas such as Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has referred to, in areas where the need for planting seems particularly obvious, where there is a great scarcity of trees, where the country has been denuded of timber.  Speaking for a considerable amount of opinion on this subject, I am more than glad <Col N="1175" /> to hear the Minister's statement that the operations of the Forestry Department are going to be extended.  I believe there is no work on which the State could more usefully spend money.  It is a line in which they can spend money with great benefit to the country, particularly in the present world circumstances when there is such a scarcity of timber and almost the danger of a famine.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>The replanting of areas from which woods have been cut away is a matter of supreme importance.  Within recent years, during the Great War and when there was trouble in this country, large areas were denuded of trees.  There is nothing more important than to have these places, which have been eyesores for so long, replanted.  I do not mean to say that that should be more than a beginning.  There is nothing more necessary in some parts of the country than to have extensive schemes of tree-planting.  I have in mind, particularly the wind-swept areas where the land is of little value for other purposes, where it can be acquired cheaply and where plantations would give the best results from the point of view of shelter.  I would like to refer particularly to parts of County Cavan. There is a great shortage of timber and a great need for shelter.  The land generally would be very much improved by the shelter afforded by a plantation.  There is a great need for timber such as larch, which was referred to by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney. I think that would be very important and that it should form part of every plantation scheme, because the thinning of larch leaves room for other kinds of timber to grow.  In addition, larch can come into use in a very few years.  It is the most useful kind of timber at an early date. It is the only timber that comes into use at a very early date, and when larch is thinned away it leaves sufficient room for the other timber to develop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to impress on the Minister the necessity for planting large areas in County Cavan, where there are many small farms and where <Col N="1176" /> there is very inadequate shelter.  It is a thing that a small farmer cannot very well undertake, and for that reason I suggest that the Government should go on with its planting scheme in such counties where there are small farms and areas of inferior land that require shelter more than superior lands require it.  There is an area in West Cavan where an inspector from the Department had been for a number of years.  He tried various experiments and found that the land in that area was uneconomic for use for agricultural purposes, but he said that it was very suitable for planting trees and not really suitable for anything else.  I suggest that the Minister should try experiments in that area and take in very large belts for planting. I wish to stress particularly the necessity for planting larch because, as I said before, it will become useful at an early date, and every young plantation requires thinning after ten or twelve years, so that it would serve a double purpose.  I suggest also that areas that require shelter the most should get the preference.  That is all I have to say in regard to the matter, but I join with Deputy Moore and the others who have spoken in expressing the wish that these plantation schemes in the country should go on at a more rapid pace than they have been doing for some time.  The woods have been almost cleared in some parts of the country and there is no timber at all left.  I hope that the Minister will encourage planting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. F. Lynch Mr. F. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall only delay the House for a few minutes in this matter because, in fact, it is something about which I know very little. I am not in the happy position, unfortunately, that Deputy Moore is in. He, apparently, can go down to his constituency and see the signs of the Forestry Department's operations all over the place and can find different persons in his constituency blessing the work of the Department.  I suppose we ought to be thankful to Deputy Moore that he wound up his speech by wishing us well&mdash;those of us who represent the western constituencies&mdash;and hoping that the Forestry <Col N="1177" /> Department will extend its activities on the western seaboard.  As Deputy McGovern has pointed out, this country has been largely denuded of timber. Especially during the war years, when there were big prices for timber, many fine woods in various parts of the country&mdash;I know that it is true of Kerry, at any rate&mdash;very often were cut down without any planting being done to replace the trees that were taken away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to a scheme whereby, if I understood him rightly, individual farmers are encouraged to plant by getting a certain amount for a minimum of five acres&mdash;£2 on plantation, £1 after five years, and, I think, £1 after ten years.  The Minister said that it was impracticable to consider any lesser area than five acres. Speaking for the western seaboard as a whole, including Kerry&mdash;and I am speaking for more than Kerry; I am speaking of West Clare, Galway, Connemara, Western Mayo and Donegal&mdash; the holdings there are extremely small, as the Minister knows.  In some cases they would contain a considerable amount of bog land and mountain, perhaps, in addition to their arable land.  In any case, they are very small and five acres would be a very large amount, in the case of such holdings, to devote to timber, apart from the fact that it might be a rather big undertaking for an individual farmer. I think that the Minister ought to consider the possibility of getting some kind of a local committee of persons from adjoining small holdings.  If there were 30 or 40 of them combined from adjoining townlands, each of whom would agree to plant, say, one acre, I think that that would meet the Minister's point that it would not be worth while sending down for inspection and so on for anything less than five acres.  You would have then 30 or 40 acres in a confined area, which could be examined by an inspector in one trip.  I think that where the Minister could get a local organisation of small holders, each prepared to plant, say, one acre, he should make some grant, proportionate perhaps to the present grant, for planting in such a small acreage. <Col N="1178" /> I must say that I was extremely glad to hear Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney refer to an area actually on the sea-coast&mdash;the shore of Clew Bay&mdash;where you have a healthy wood.  Undoubtedly, the propaganda was spread about that where you had bogland, or where it was actually a bog sub-soil or where you had the Atlantic sea breeze, it was unsuitable for planting.  I did see some places which were planted by the old Congested Districts Board, and, undoubtedly, they did not appear to be very successful.  I should like to know if any further experiments have been made by the Department of Forestry, or by the Land Commission in any of their reclamation schemes, with regard to what trees would be suitable for those areas.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney referred to the types of trees that are growing on the shore of Clew Bay.  If they are growing there, they should be able to grow in Connemara, West Clare, Donegal or Kerry.  Certainly, I think that in those wilder areas, where shelter belts are very badly needed, the Department ought to extend its activities.  I did hear some months ago in Kerry&mdash;I think it was in January&mdash;that there was about to be some activity with regard to forestry in Kerry.  I have heard nothing about it since, but I know that at the time certain persons were encouraged in the belief that work was going to start there in the way of afforestation.  I should like to know whether anything has been done about it, and whether any of this land, for which we are providing the money here in connection with this proposal, is situated in Kerry, or how much is situated in the Gaeltacht as a whole, for instance; that is, between Kerry, West Cork, Clare, Mayo and Donegal. This is a type of Gaeltacht service which might have very good results; not immediate results, of course, because any benefits that may accrue will not accrue for a considerable number of years hence; but, at any rate, for the moment it would provide some little benefit, and might provide very great benefit in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>The issues in connection with this matter with which I am much concerned have been dealt <Col N="1179" /> with by Deputies Fitzgerald-Kenney and Lynch.  I never heard before about this five-acre scheme; it is new to me.  The same difficulties arose in my case as arose in the case of Deputy Lynch.  Five acres is too great for a small holding.  The suggestion made by Deputy Lynch is an excellent one and I would press that further.  I would suggest that a townland or two or three townlands might be formed into a co-operative society, and a list of names made up of the people who owned these townlands&mdash;people who would plant, say, an acre each.  An inspector could be sent down and the whole thing could be done together.  It would be as easy for the inspector to supervise the planting of the whole three townlands as the planting of one plot.  More attention should be given to this matter in the way of advertising, because the people do not know about this five-acre scheme.  It could also be further advertised by sending the circulars to the churches.  I have heard these circulars read out in the churches on Sundays.  It is an excellent way of bringing a matter to the notice of the people concerned.  I do not think the farmers of the country know anything about these five-acre schemes.  Money could be well spent on advertising them.  I know if the people were aware of these schemes many of them would avail of them.  In some places it happens that there are hundreds of acres of a mountain in the possession of one man.  A five-acre plot there would be very small.  These would be useful as shelter belts and as beauty places.  In addition there will be the value of the timber afterwards. The western counties are sadly in need of these shelter belts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On these grounds I have already urged the importance of these plantations but now there are additional grounds.  As far as we are concerned in Donegal the position with regard to the scarcity of timber has become a very serious question.  The transport from Dublin to Donegal makes the cost of timber in Donegal prohibitive. For all practical purposes there is no efficient sawmill in the county.  We are now adopting a huge plan of <Col N="1180" /> building in connection with the Local Government Department.  There is a Bill before the House with regard to the extension of housing and for making advances under the Housing Acts.  There are two schemes: one under the Local Government and the other under the Gaeltacht Housing.  If both schemes are taken up in a very big way there is no doubt that there will be an additional burden owing to the increased cost of timber.  I understand that the price of timber in Donegal is 30 per cent.  over what it is in Dublin and over what it is in the City of Derry.  On to-morrow or some day very soon we will have the Second Reading of a measure for Gaeltacht housing.  As a matter of fact, in order to encourage building in the Gaeltacht and through the country generally the advances are to be increased from 80 per cent. to 90 per cent. of the cost, that is to say, £10 more will be given in every £100.  That is all to the good.  It looks very good on paper but under the present conditions the major portion of that £10 would be swallowed up in the increased cost of timber.</P>
    <P>I am making these points in order to direct the Minister's attention to Donegal and to see what he can do in this direction for the county.  Deputy Moore has been in a very pleasant mood about the position in the County Wicklow.  Well might he be.  You can hardly put your foot down in Wicklow without watching yourself for fear of breaking down a young plant of two or three years old.  But nothing has been done in Donegal.  In a general way there is no county in the Free State in greater need of shelter belts for beautifying the landscape and providing timber for use afterwards than Donegal.  The county no doubt is beautiful in two respects.  One part of it is rugged, but in the finer scenery of the other part you are struck by the absence of growing timber.</P>
    <P>The question of the cutting down of demesnes to which Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney referred is an important one in this respect.  Some landlords have sold out and have no further interests in the place.  When selling the land they sold the timber on the demesne <Col N="1181" /> to some of those people who will buy anything to make money on it.  They slaughtered the timber, tore up the place and left nothing behind but shrubs.  Places have become desolate and derelict and an eyesore where previously lovely plantations gave the countryside a great attraction.</P>
    <P>We had repeated statements in the past here about bog land not being suitable for the growing of timber.  I think I could make a case and defend the bogs in that respect.  I do not know anything about the technical side of growing timber but I do know this and I would like an explanation given by those who presume to be experts. All the small houses built in the poorer parts of Donegal in the past&mdash;that is from the time when it was first occupied by human beings down to the present day&mdash;were roofed with timber raised out of the bog.  This timber taken out of the bog was also used for many other purposes.  In the Donegal cottages even yet one sees bedsteads that have been made of the bog timber as were many articles of furniture in these houses.  How was it that the county produced this timber? Perhaps the technical advisers on this matter would tell us?  There are thousands of tons of this timber lying yet in the bogs.  How did it get there? It must have grown there.  That timber, used for roofing in those houses, is still quite intact and in perfect condition.  It looks as hard as a bar of steel.  If the case is only made against us for the purpose of turning us down I am taking up the position that I refuse to be turned down until an answer is given to this question.</P>
    <P>There are thousands and thousands of acres of land in Donegal that could be used for the purpose of tree planting. I know that those who are scientifically concerned in the planting of timber will plant it where it is easiest to do so.  They will plant it down in the County Wicklow where there is shallow earthed mountains, with no trouble about draining these mountains.  All you have to do is to sling down the posts and wire the place.  But in other counties there are obstacles which must be overcome. <Col N="1182" /> I would like to know from the experts particulars as to the unsuitability of the County Donegal&mdash;taking the county generally&mdash;as to the prospect of development in the growing of timber.  Sometimes the excuse is put up that the land has to be drained and that sort of thing.</P>
    <P>I think the Government ought to look into this matter and find out for themselves.  It is not a question of planting the timber where it is easiest or most attractive; I appeal to the Minister to travel more rapidly in this matter of tree planting and remember that Wicklow is not the only county in Ireland.  There are other counties.  Wicklow is near Dublin and transport costs are at a minimum. Donegal is isolated and nobody's child and transport costs there are at the maximum.  They are a very serious burden on the poor people who require timber and who are now trying to rehouse themselves; trying to live like human beings under better housing conditions and endeavouring to eliminate the terrible scourge of tuberculosis in the county.  If timber is planted now in Donegal it will, when matured, be as urgently needed for building purposes there as it is to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been almost excited on listening to the general approval that has been accorded to forestry here this afternoon and particularly interested in the contribution from Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney.  One might, of course, be pardoned the thought that after all these years of the administration that preceded us in office so little attention was paid to forestry.  From my point of view, I think that nothing reflects so badly on the lack of understanding of economic conditions, of the possibilities of the future and of the needs of the country, as this almost complete neglect that took place with regard to forestry during the last ten or twelve years.  I was very interested in hearing the expressions of views of Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney and Deputy Lynch. Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney raised an issue which is all important and I will deal with it in a moment or two. First, I should like to get off my mind one or two pertinent questions which <Col N="1183" /> he asked.  In answer to his specific questions with regard to the planting of trees last year, the following are the proportions: Scots and other Pines, 39½ per cent. of the total; Sitka Spruce, 26 per cent.; Norway Spruce, 16 per cent.; Hardwoods, 2 per cent.; European Larch and Japanese Larch, 11½ per cent., and Douglas Fir, 2½ per cent.</P>
      <P>He also enquired definitely as to the type of seed the Department purchased and whence it was imported. We purchased from the western coast of America 370 lbs., which included Douglas Fir, Sitka Spruce, Lodgepole Pole Pine, etc.; from Alaska, 20 lb. of Sitka Spruce; from California, 20 lbs. of <i>Cupressus Macrocarpa</i> and <i>Pinus Radiata;</i> from Denmark, 20 lbs. of Mountain Pine; from Corsica, 50 lbs. of Corsican Pine; from Germany, 1,270 lbs., including Beech, Walnut, Oak, Spruce, etc.; from Holland, 500 lbs. of Oak; from England, 100 lbs. of Spanish Chestnut; from Japan, 160 lbs. of Japanese Larch; from Austria, 200 lbs. of Larch; from Switzerland, 175 lbs. of Larch; from Czecho-Slovakia, 25 lbs. of Larch, and from Scotland, 330 lbs. of Scotch Pine and Larch.  Those are the specific details of our purchases and also the percentages of timbers which we planted last year.  Several Deputies have stressed the need for larch, and I think most people will admit that larch is one of the most useful timbers the agricultural population of Ireland can use.  So far as I know, there has been no scarcity of larch.  I have not heard in any part of the country any complaint that there is either an absence or a scarcity of larch.  That does not, however, mean that we should not look to the future and provide adequately for the larch requirements of the future.  Larch is, undoubtedly, one of the most useful timbers a farmer can contemplate using, and for that reason, larch is being, and will be, attended to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not indicate in my opening remarks the wider policy of forestry development that the Government has in mind and I did not do so for the <Col N="1184" /> simple reason that I was dealing with a specific Estimate and that Estimate was planned on an expanded programme over last year's.  It does not, however, in any way, meet my views as regards what forestry developments are needed in this country.  I have already indicated through the Press and otherwise the position of this country with regard to forestry.  We have, as a matter of fact, only 1 per cent. of the land in this country under trees.  I have made public that fact and have indicated that we are practically the most-denuded-of-trees country in the world at the present time.  Britain, which has not paid any great attention until recent years to the timber problem, has something like 5½ per cent.; the United States has 25 per cent.; and Czecho-Slovakia has one-third of its land under timber and is proceeding to plant another 1,000,000 acres.  The one thing which does stand out above all others for those who are interested in the problem, either of forestry or timber needs, is that at present the world is consuming 50 per cent. more timber than it is producing and that fact has been my main stimulus in urging much wider activities even than are contained in the Estimate here.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, I have indicated that my belief is that we in this State should aim at securing the plantation of 500,000 acres over a 20-year period and should not be thinking in terms of spending £100,000 on forestry but should be contemplating up to £500,000 per annum in the development of forestry for two reasons.  One reason is that probably nothing gives so much employment for ordinary labour, and the second is that it is the best investment the State could possibly make in the way of a long-term investment for the future.  It is too soon yet to intimate exactly what we propose to do but I hope to introduce a Forestry Bill here, if possible before the recess, and have it under way before the Dáil adjourns so that the programme can be started this autumn. I think forestry ought to be approached as a big economic business, as an economic proposition, which should be dealt with independently of a Department, <Col N="1185" /> and for that reason my mind is running on the lines of the establishment of a Board which would have freedom to develop and to go on with a long-term policy.  The big danger in forestry is that if there is any break in the carrying on of the work, what has been spent prior to that break may very well be lost.  If there is not continuity with forestry above all things, the money primarily invested in it is wasted, and for that reason I can only see the one cure and that is to have a Forestry Board somewhat on the lines of the Electricity Supply Board which will be subject to a directorate, which will be guided in turn by the Minister and subject always to the Government in power.  For that reason, I do not think I require any urge in respect of forestry.</P>
    <P>My main interest, once the scheme is developed, once the main programme is accepted, is to get as much of that development as possible on the western seaboard.  I realise, as Deputy Lynch, no doubt, realises and as we all realise, the absolute necescity for providing work in the Gaeltacht and I have looked forward to the widest possible development of forestry in the Gaeltacht as one of the big means of relieving unemployment in those areas, and relieving it in a way that will be constructive and ultimately reproductive.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney raised the question of the western counties and I sincerely hope he is entirely right in all the arguments he has put forward. There is considerable difference of opinion from the point of view of scientific forestry as to whether or not trees can be grown on bad soils. There are people who will tell you that it cannot be done.  There are others who will tell you it can be done at great expense; in other words, that it may not be economic.  There are others who will point to the fact that trees did grow there, that trees are growing in the immediate neighbourhood, and so on.  All we can say is that we are determined to have the closest possible scientific examination of those soils, and of those areas where work is required.  In so far as it is possible, even at expenditure <Col N="1186" /> slightly above what is considered the economic standard of the moment, we will try to develop all those areas.  I shall be glad if Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney will give me particulars of the areas where he is certain that trees can be grown, if he will also give me particulars of the areas where he thinks trees can be grown, and if he will give me the areas which he thinks we ought to examine to see if, by increased expenditure, trees can be grown.  We must keep within certain limits for economic forestry, but I am satisfied that by drainage, reclamation work, and a certain amount of use of fertilisers, we can get results.</P>
    <P>There is, however, one obstacle from the practical forestry point of view, and that is the problem of the wind. It is true that you will get sheltered corners around the West, but it is also true that you will get many areas where it is very doubtful, indeed, whether or not forestry will be successful. Whilst willing to take every chance, and willing to expend money, perhaps a little beyond the margin which is looked upon as economic forestry, we do not want to have failures, because failures in this work will only dishearten other people who come after us.  I am satisfied that a great deal of the waste land can be used.  The Department is working to that end.  Now we come to one of the practical difficulties.  Deputy Lynch, Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney and other Deputies, will know that what we inherited was a very bare skeleton of a Department, where nothing had been done, practically speaking, in the way of the development of scientific forestry. Within the last two years we lost the former director.  Last year we lost the assistant director, who had been promoted to the position of director.  We have only a very limited staff of inspectors, and forestry inspectors cannot be raised overnight. However, when the Forestry Bill comes before the House there will be an opportunity of seeing what is in mind.  As I say at the moment we have only a skeleton organisation, which will have to be built up almost from the ground-floor, and that is being done at present.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1187" /> Various technical points were raised. Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney asked about new experiments, and whether we had learned about the quick production of poplars.  I think we are fully aware of the experiments that are going on, and are fully posted as regards what claims have been made for certain new varieties that have been introduced.  I have heard recently something which I cannot possibly believe, namely, that in America they have produced a walnut which will be mature in fifteen years. That seems to me inconceivable, but nevertheless the claim is made.  The points raised by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney and other Deputies will all be noted and covered.  I want to give the general policy that we hope to put through.  I should like to stress that in those Gaeltacht counties, and in counties like Donegal, Mayo and the rest, our whole anxiety is as to whether we will be able to get enough land that will produce timber, and on which we can turn the people on to the work of reafforestation.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney complained that I did not indicate in what part of the country we were growing timber, and so on.  Great stress has been laid on the position of County Wicklow.  I have not done any particular &ldquo;drive&rdquo; in Wicklow since I took over the Department, but Wicklow is a county which naturally lends itself to forestry development.  There is a great deal of land in Wicklow which is suitable for forestry, and which in many cases is suitable for nothing else, but I should like it to be understood that we have no particular gradh for Wicklow any more than any place else.  As a matter of fact, my feeling is that Wicklow has done very well in forestry, and I should like to see the poorer counties, where there are less opportunities for employment, doing equally well.  I do not mean to &ldquo;let down&rdquo; Wicklow, but I want equally good operations carried on particularly in the counties of the Gaeltacht and along the Western seaboard. We all know that the problem of providing employment in the Gaeltacht is an acute one, and I certainly am anxious to have the help that <Col N="1188" /> forestry will mean to us in those areas. The question of publicity has been mentioned.  There are a good many agricultural committees in the country; I think there are 20 county committees of agriculture all over the country, and I think all those are fully aware of what the Forestry Department is prepared to do.  Moreover, 20 of those committees themselves have a system for forestry development, and I would suggest that Deputies should put their people in touch with those county committees. I note, however, the suggestion that we perhaps might advertise more.  In so far as we can advertise we will do so, and try to push forward the forestry idea in the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore has raised the question as to whether we could be more generous with regard to the amounts we offer for land.  I do not think it is the desire of the Department to exploit any people, or to take advantage of any people.  I do admit, however, that in some cases the price offered for land for forestry purposes has been low, and is, on the whole, low, but the Director of Forestry and the forestry inspectors naturally are thinking in terms of making forestry an economic proposition. They realise the amount of labour that has to go into it.  They realise the first cost, and they want to see what the ultimate result is going to be. I may say, <i>á propos</i> of that, that every scheme is examined from the cold economic point of view, as regards what it will produce ultimately.</P>
    <P>I will go into the question with the directors and see what can be done with regard to price.  Everything depends on the quality of the land; everything depends on how that land can be used.  We are often offered land at £2 an acre which it would not pay us to take at any price.  Deputy Moore also raised a question as regards the receipts.  If he refers to the Appropriation Account he will find that a certain amount has been taken credit for.  The receipts from the following ten centres were as follows:&mdash;Monaghan, £1,083; Gort, £321; Rathdrum, £232; Dundrum, £193; Dundalk, £152; Camolin, £110; Emo,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1189" /> £100; Kilrush, £92; Killeshandra, £89; Durrow, £60.  Now we want to be clear about this, and we must realise that unless forestry is a developed business, or on the point of development, you cannot expect an economic return from your timber.  A great deal of the timber we have here is only scrap and rubbish; it is sold for firewood and is fit for nothing else.  The plan I would like to forward and which will have to be supported by authority is a plan definitely of production for the future, for the needs of the country, and in order to replace our present imports.  That covers a wide field. There are certain timbers that we must continue to import.  You are not going to grow mahogany and other select hardwoods for furniture.  The big need in timber in the future is pulp, and the big need will be of certain types for pulp that will clean the forests.  I figure in 20 years you will have enough clean forest land to supply practically all the pulp we need.  The other timber that will be wanted will be ash, oak and elm and hardwoods that will grow in this country.  But these hardwoods are very slow growing. There is a striking need in this country of timbers of that nature.  Ash is scarce; elm is also fairly scarce; larch is not so scarce.  There is a percentage of oak here, and probably 85 to 90 per cent. of conifers, or soft quick-growing timber, and 20 per cent. of hardwoods but, of course, they will not mature in our time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch raised other points with regard to Kerry.  I may say Kerry is one of the counties most active in this new development in forestry.  There is a very active committee at work which has gathered together materials and advise as to what land is available for forestry for the Department.  We have had something like 15,000 or 16,000 acres offered to us.  Of course in many cases people offer lands not fit for anything, not even for forestry, but all these lands will be carefully inspected by our inspectors.  It is said that we have no skeleton scheme under way.  We have about 1,304 acres in Muckross, and we hope to have a quite big development in Kerry.  Last year we planted in <Col N="1190" /> Muckross, in addition to 132 acres, four acres of nursery, and we hope this is only a start of what we will be able to do.</P>
    <P>Deputy McMenamin referred to the position in Donegal.  Well, it is true Donegal cannot import by sea enormous cargoes as can be imported in Dublin.  Still a great many cargoes can come into it by sea.  I think the Deputy is not fully aware of the timber business in Donegal.  The county committee have already a nursery at Ballybofey, for the supplying of plants and a forester is employed for the purpose of giving information to any people who want to do planting. Again, like Connemara, Kerry and various parts of the Gaeltacht in which I want to see forestry taken up, Donegal has to get land that will grow trees.  The question of wind and of sour peat water arises.  But I can assure Deputies that one of my main objects in trying to drive forestry forward is to get at the solution of the problem in the Gaeltacht.</P>

      <P>Go ndeontar suim ná raghaidh thar £73,780 chun slánuithe na suime is gá chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1935, chun Tuarastail agus Costaisí Oifig an Aire Tailte i dtaobh Seirbhísí na Gaeltachta, maraon le Deontaisí um Thógáil Tithe.</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £73,780 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1935, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Lands in connection with Gaeltacht Services, including Housing Grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Estimate is for a sum not exceeding £73,780 to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1935, for the salaries and expenses of <Col N="1191" /> the Gaeltacht Services Department, including housing grants.</P>
    <P>In this Vote is included, in addition to the provision for Gaeltacht Services, the salaries and expenses of the Minister and Parliamentary Secretary and their secretariat.  The corresponding Estimate for the previous year was for Fisheries and Gaeltacht Services.  The fisheries services were, on the 1st April last, transferred to the control of the Minister for Agriculture and the provision for those services for the current year appears under his Vote.</P>
    <P>As will be seen, the Estimate for 1934-35 shows that it is expected that a net sum of £113,780 will be required, as against a net sum of £145,608 for 1933-34&mdash;a decrease of £31,828.  The main reductions are: rural industries (approximately £15,000), marine products industries (approximately £23,000) and expenditure under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Act (£35,000); against which there is a set-off of £44,000 owing to a reduction in the amount estimated from appropriations-in-aid.</P>
    <P>I might point out that in going through the Estimates of previous years I find that whilst much larger amounts may have been estimated, the actual amounts expended did not quite justify the Estimates put forward. This will be readily appreciated from the following figures:&mdash;In the year 1931-32 the total Estimate for the Rural Industries was £53,550 but the actual amount expended was only £25,426.  In that year a sum of £5,000 was earmarked for the purchase of machines and plant but the actual expenditure was only £1,583.  For raw materials it was estimated that £40,000 would be required, whereas only £14,116 was spent under this heading. The Estimates for 1932-33 indicate a somewhat similar position.  £42,000 being estimated for Rural Industries, while the expenditure under this head amounted only to £26,479.  Last year (1933-34) a sum of £40,958 was provided for Rural Industries, but of this sum only £29,274 was expended.</P>
    <P>What I have now endeavoured to do <Col N="1192" /> is to put before you as close an approximate Estimate of what will be required for the various sections of the Department under existing conditions. There may be an inclination to criticise reductions in the Estimates but I suggest that what is of importance is the amount spent on Gaeltacht activities and not the amounts that figure on the Estimates and which, in effect, were somewhat wide of what was actually expended.</P>
    <P>In the case of rural industries, I have the whole position of these industries under consideration at present with a view to seeing how they can be placed upon a footing which will result in the giving of greater employment to persons in the Gaeltacht without undue cost on the public purse.  The Estimate is based on the actual position under existing conditions and may be looked upon as a temporary one and I shall be prepared to come to the House again for any further sums that may be required for developments beyond those at present in existence.</P>
    <P>It may interest Deputies to know the comparative figures of sales in tweeds and knitwear from the rural industries for the last three years:&mdash;In 1931-32 the sales amounted to £10,892; in 1932-33 the sales amounted to £22,969; in 1933-34 the sales amounted to £24,445.  The amounts actually paid to workers for these three years were: 1931-32, £6,250; 1932-33, £12,438; 1933-34, £10,020.  Whilst there has been an increase in the sales of the products from these rural industries it is obvious that these industries have not been and cannot be approached as commercial propositions.  The aim has been to preserve and extend handcraft industries in the Irish-speaking districts.  The conditions prevailing in machine productions and the competition arising therefrom make it increasingly difficult to secure that growth and development that we would all wish to achieve.</P>
    <P>To me the real test is the amount of wages which out of the Vote will find its way back to the workers in the Gaeltacht.  I am far from being satisfied that this amount is as large <Col N="1193" /> as it should be considering the expense to the State that is involved. For that reason the whole position with regard to these industries is at present under close examination to see how we can get the maximum result in wages to the workers with the minimum cost of administration.</P>
    <P>Regarding marine products, I regret to say that at the moment owing to international competition between the iodine-producing countries, the world price of iodine, which had stood at the same figure for a great many years, was recently cut to such an extent that the extraction of iodine from kelp is no longer economic.</P>
    <P>The sum for the payment to kelp makers is reduced from £25,000 to £10,000, due to a limitation of the quantity of kelp to be handled and to the reduction in price which is being brought about by the successive cuts made last year by the Chilean interests by which the price is controlled.</P>
    <P>While the present world price of iodine prevails it is only possible on any basis approaching the economic, to deal with the kelp produced from the sea rods washed up by the tides during the winter as this has the highest iodine content.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the Department will this year deal with a quantity of approximately 2,500 tons as against 4,500 tons handled last year.  Moreover, it is only in our effort to tide the industry over present difficulties that even this amount can be taken and the expenditure, in any sense, justified.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that in the Appropriation-in-Aid from the sales of kelp a token amount of only £100 has been estimated.  We are, however, anxious to preserve this existing industry in the hope that in future years something like the former economic price could be secured.  Since the Estimates were prepared there have been certain indications that some improvements in the kelp and iodine position may be expected but these are not yet sufficiently definite to warrant an estimate for substantial return on our kelp sales.</P>
    <P>In sub-head F4 there is a reduction of £5,900.  The amount estimated for <Col N="1194" /> payments to the gatherers of carrageen is based on our experience of last year. It was found that the quantity of this product brought to the Department did not warrant the amount estimated. The Department was in a position to take more carrageen than was offered and if more should be offered it will be bought.</P>
    <P>There is little change in sub-heads G1, G2, and G3.  Under sub-head H there is a reduction of £1,490.  A token sum of £10 only has been taken for loans for the purchase of machines and equipment for rural industries, it being found that the organising of industries by the Department has led to a fall in the number of applications from individual workers.  The sum provided for loans for the purchase of boats, carts and draught horses in connection with the marine products industries has been reduced from £1,000 to £100, it being found that the immediate necessities of the case have been largely met by the loans made during the last two or three years. The provision for loans for turf-boats has also been somewhat reduced for similar reasons.  The small difference in sub-head I is due to fluctuation in the rate of the cost of living bonus, which forms part of the wages of the domestic instructress.</P>
    <P>The provision under J1 for grants for the erection and improvement of houses and outbuildings in the Gaeltacht is reduced from £80,000 to £45,000 because the total sum available for the service under the Housing (Gaeltacht) (Amendment) Act, 1931, has been fully earmarked, and the sum taken in this Vote represents what it is anticipated will be spent in the erection of the houses sanctioned within this limit.  A further amending Bill increasing the total sum available by an additional £300,000 has already been introduced, and on its passage it will be possible by Supplementary Vote to make available such additional money as may be required during the year.</P>
    <P>The provision in J2 for the erection of teachers' residences stands at £1,500 as against £2,000 last year. The sum taken is for the erection of <Col N="1195" /> residences in four cases which it is anticipated will be ripe for carrying out during the year.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head K, Appropriations-in-Aid, there is a total reduction of £43,850, of which £27,900 occurs in the item No. (3) sales of kelp.</P>
    <P>At the time when this Estimate was framed, the future position in this industry was very uncertain owing to drastic reductions which had been made in the world price of iodine by the international interests by which that price is controlled, and the prospect of further reduction which has, in fact, since taken place.  As I have already said, there are signs of improvement, but these are not yet definite enough to justify more than the token amount.</P>
    <P>The figure under Section (1), sub-head K, shows an apparent reduction of £13,000.  The Estimate of £9,000, although set against the heading &ldquo;Sales of products of rural industries,&rdquo; in fact represents the <i>net sum</i> expected to be realised after deduction of some £11,000 for wages of operatives and certain other expenses. In other words, it is based on an Estimate of £20,000 gross sales.</P>
    <P>The actual total sales of goods during recent years have been, as already stated:&mdash;1930/1, £9,346; 1931/2, £10,892; 1932/3, £22,969; 1933/4, £24,245.  The sum provided is based on a turnover in the existing industries of about the same amount as last year.</P>
    <P>A sum of £5,000 is provided under item (4) for sales of carrageen, as against £8,000 last year.  The total amounts actually realised by sales in recent years have been:&mdash;1930/1, £985; 1931/2, £3,098; 1932/3, £6,827; 1933/4, £6,445.</P>
    <P>The market has somewhat improved since the present Estimate was framed and I anticipate that the receipts this year will, in fact, be somewhat higher than last year.</P>
    <P>There is no change in items (5) and (6).</P>
    <P>The Estimate does not provide for other or new developments in industrial <Col N="1196" /> activities during the current financial year.  This does not mean, however, that new efforts will not be made.  On the contrary, I am satisfied that very much wider activities must be launched in the Gaeltacht, but I am also satisfied that the present basis and methods of operation may have to be recast.  The whole problem has been under careful examination for some months and I hope before long to announce the result of these inquiries and to indicate the lines on which our efforts will be planned. Whilst there is no intention to close down any of the industrial activities that have been operated, except in such cases as clearly indicate that they are entirely wasteful, it is obvious that the present basis of organisation is far from satisfactory.</P>
    <P>What adjustments or changes may be necessary I am not yet in a position to state.  Every aspect of the situation is being examined and I have been in consultation with all those who are vitally interested in the problem.  Deputies realise the peculiar difficulties involved in the Gaeltacht and, whilst I may seem to criticise what was done by our predecessors in office, I am fully conscious of the almost insuperable difficulties that face any administration in regard to this Department.  The division of land; the relief of congestion; migration and the resultant readjustment of uneconomic holdings; the maximum development of the peat industry; reafforestation where possible&mdash;these are some of the lines on which I hope to secure results.</P>
    <P>It has often been argued that the abolition of the Congested Districts Board was a mistake.  I am not, at the moment, expressing any opinion on that but I may say that the possibility of establishing a new Gaeltacht Advisory Board, with an administrative board which would be representative of Agriculture, Land Commission, Industry and such other activities, is being carefully considered. The main consideration that I have in mind is to get the type of work and development which will be of permanent value and which will bring the maximum benefit in the form <Col N="1197" /> of wages or otherwise to the people of the Gaeltacht at the minimum of expense in administration.  To give an example of this, I may cite the recent experience with regard to peat development.  Some time ago I sought the co-operation of the peat development section and asked for a special drive in certain Gaeltacht areas.  The peat development staff co-operated at once.  A representative of the Land Commission, one from the Board of Works and one from the peat development section made a rapid survey of certain Gaeltacht areas.  Certain roads and drains were planned and £15,000 is being spent on what would ordinarily rank as relief works.  It is relief work but relief work of permanent value.  It is estimated that £59,570 worth of turf will be purchased from these areas this year.  The whole administrative cost of this is estimated at £1,620, and the purchase price of the peat will go almost entirely to the male labour engaged.  I merely give this as an example of the type of productive development that I wish to see attempted.  I am not unduly sanguine that we are going to be successful; we are certain to face difficulties but we have got to go on making every effort to overcome the difficulties that are inherent in the problem.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that, with the co-operation that I am at present receiving from all those who are interested in the Irish-speaking people of the Gaeltacht, I will be able to put forward some plans for the better organisation and development of the Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo; When speaking on the Fisheries Estimate a week or two ago I referred to the change that has taken place during the year in divorcing the fisheries from the Gaeltacht services. Those who are acquainted with the Gaeltacht problem know that these two services go hand in hand.  Seventy-five per cent. of their activities apply to the same people.  This was realised by the former Government, as indeed it was realised by the British Government when they formed the Congested <Col N="1198" /> Districts Board.  It is essential that there should be complete co-ordination between the activities of the Fisheries Department and the Gaeltacht Services Department in order to get anything like good results.  That co-ordination is made considerably more difficult by taking fisheries from this Department and placing it under another Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his opening statement said that he would express no opinion as to whether or not it was advisable to do away with the Congested Districts Board.  He referred to some advisory committee that it is contemplated to set up.  When we left office there was a committee in existence of the type that I think the Minister was referring to.  There was a body which used to meet fortnightly and, during certain periods, at intervals of a month.  That committee was formed from the principal officers and, in some cases, of the secretaries of the different Departments which carry out operations in the Gaeltacht.  These men met under the chairmanship of the then Minister.  Their advice was extremely useful.  For many of the developments that took place in the latter days of the Department I give full credit to that committee.  They were carried out on the advice the committee gave me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extremely difficult for anybody who has the slightest interest in the Gaeltacht to speak calmly on this Estimate, especially when one calls to mind the protestations of Fianna Fáil Deputies in the past&mdash;before they occupied the benches on the opposite side of the House.  The Estimates presented to the House by the Fianna Fáil Government since they came into office give us an insight into their real policy with regard to the Gaeltacht as distinct from their protestations.  I feel that of the very many extraordinary things that the Government have been responsible for since they came into office there is none so shameful as the contempt they have shown generally towards the Gaeltacht.  While money is being expended lavishly in various ways, very often in most unproductive ways, the Gaeltacht alone is selected for drastic cuts.  It makes one wonder <Col N="1199" /> where all the talk has gone about the remnant of the ancient Gaelic stock, and the rest of it, that we used to hear.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the marine industries, and made a very poor attempt, I thought, to explain away the amazing reductions that have taken place in the two Estimates prepared since the present Government came into office.  There is some excuse as regards one&mdash;kelp&mdash;to which I shall refer later.  The facts are that under the heading of marine industries, those dealing with kelp and carrageen, you have this position. Last year, the Estimate for kelp development was cut down from £40,000 to £30,000.  That is a decrease of £9,700 on the last Estimate prepared by us.  Last year, carrageen development was cut down from £19,500 to £11,250, a decrease of £8,250, making a total decrease in these two items alone of £17,950.  What a friendly gesture from the new Government towards the ancient Gaelic stock!  The process is continued this year.  Kelp development is reduced this year from £30,300 to £12,850, a decrease of £17,450, while carrageen development is cut down from £11,250 to £5,350 or a decrease of £5,900.  In other words, on top of last year's decrease of £17,950 for kelp and carrageen, we have this year a further decrease of £23,350, bringing the total decrease for these two items alone up to the astounding figure of £41,300 in the two years.  The money provided for the development of kelp and carrageen went to the very poorest people in the Gaeltacht.  It was not a dole; there was no taint of charity about it.  It was a payment to persons who were prepared to avail of their proximity to the sea to gather the weed and to save it for the market.  The money spent in that way I always felt was well spent.  There was no demoralisation about it.  It was money that was earned hard by persons who were not afraid of hard work if they could get any kind of fair return for their labour.</P>
    <P>I was hoping that we would hear a good deal of condemnation from <Col N="1200" /> Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party from Gaeltacht counties, with regard to what I call the monstrous reduction of £41,300, in the first two Estimates of Fianna Fáil for Marine Products Industries.  If there is not that condemnation I am afraid we will be forced to believe that there was very little sincerity behind their protestations in the past.  Let us look at these little rural industries scattered around the Gaeltacht, where knitting, weaving and embroidery are carried on.  There was a slight increase in the service last year, from £37,000 to £40,958, an increase of £3,958.  That gave some hope, even though kelp and carrageen gatherers were being hit, that, at any rate something was going to be done for their brothers and sisters who are engaged in these little industries. But if we had any such hopes last year they are rudely dashed aside this year, because the Estimate shows a decrease of £14,807, from £40,958 to £26,151, to make up for an increase of £3,098 last year.  Did they make a mistake last year?  At any rate they are showing very considerable signs of repentance when, to make up for the increase last year there is a reduction of three times that amount this year.</P>
    <P>The net decrease for rural industries over two years is £10,849.  If you add that to the figure I gave for the two years' reduction for kelp and carrageen you have a total reduction of £52,149 for industrial development in the Gaeltacht, as the first contribution from Fianna Fáil towards this problem in their first two years of office.  One would like to hear what Deputy Cleary, for instance, has to say about that.  I am sorry the Deputy is not in the House.  I should also like to hear what Deputies from Galway, Mayo and Donegal have to say.  In the past they were very vocal in their criticism of the Department, which they thought was not doing half enough; that the former Government was not providing anything like the amount of money that was necessary for these services.  I wonder if they are satisfied now with the manner in which the Government they <Col N="1201" /> are keeping in office by their votes is dealing with them.</P>
    <P>In Estimates of this kind Appropriations-in-Aid are frequently as illuminating as the Votes, because these services are in the peculiar position of being Government Departments engaged in commercial transactions. It is an extremely difficult position, as I realised, for a Government Department to be placed in.  But Appropriations-in-Aid, when read with the Vote, provide something in the nature of a balance-sheet.  There is a note dealing with the Appropriations-in-Aid, explaining that £9,000 was received from the sales of products of rural industries. This year the net sum does not include the estimated sum of £11,000 for wages.  I wonder why there is a departure from the old procedure and why the sum of £20,000 has not been put down as was always the case. Does it make the Estimate any more illuminating than it was in the past by having this segregation now? However, I am not complaining about that.  I take it that to compare the figures with last year, taking them as £20,000 as against £22,000 makes the account about line-ball.  Unfortunately it does not show continued development.  There is slight retrogression rather than development. What I would like to be told is, what is the position throughout these centres.  Are they working full time?  Are they being supplied with raw material to anything like the same extent as in the past?  How do the numbers engaged in these centres now compare with the numbers engaged in the past?  While I have nothing to substantiate the statement, I have been told that in many centres in Donegal there is nothing doing; that the centres might, for all practical purposes, be closed; that we continue to keep the centres open, but that there are no workers engaged.  If that is so, it is an extraordinary state of affairs.  It is very hard to understand it.  My recollection of the Department is, especially in Donegal, that these centres with little industries were extremely popular amongst the girls of the localities.  The girls were very anxious to avail of these centres to add <Col N="1202" /> to the family income.  When he is replying I would like to hear from the Minister what are the activities in these centres, or whether it is true that some are practically at a standstill, and that we are merely keeping them open and paying the salaries of manageresses and assistant manageresses purely as a face-saving business, so that we will not have the stigma of closing them.</P>
    <P>To a considerable extent I accept the Minister's statement with regard to kelp, and the extraordinary reduction from £28,000 which was estimated for sales last year in the Appropriations-in-Aid down to £100 this year.  I can understand that, because anyone conversant with the use we were making of kelp knows that it was subject to the market fluctuation of crude iodine.  We hoped some years ago to find some other outlet for kelp apart from the iodine production.  Experiments were under way with regard to the use of kelp, or the product of kelp as a cattle food.  There was also a question of a manure by-product.  I am wondering whether these experiments have been abandoned, or whether the Government have made up their minds that kelp is a thing of the past.  I must say that it looks rather like it from the Estimate.  If so, we may as well face the fact.  At the same time, I wondered why I was given such a vague reply to a question recently.  Unfortunately I was not here when the question dealing with this matter came on.  The reply I got was to the effect that there was no intention of departing from former activities with regard to kelp, and that we were to go on fostering the industry. We cannot have it both ways. If there is no future for kelp, either for iodine products, as a cattle food, or for manure purposes, the sooner the people who made something out of it are told, the better, so that they may turn their hands to something else.  It is an extremely difficult method of earning money, and even if we were able to pay a very high price, it could not be too high for the labour that has to be expended in collecting and preparing the weed for sale.</P>
    <P>Carrageen sales are down also, and <Col N="1203" /> the Vote, of course, is down by the sum to which I referred a few moments ago.  I cannot understand why that should be so.  There is the excuse of the world market in the case of kelp. There is no such excuse in the case of carrageen.  We had hoped undoubtedly to extend our carrageen markets very largely.  A great deal of money was spent in a preliminary campaign of advertising, both in this country and abroad, pointing out the value of carrageen as a food.  I believe that the results of that were just beginning to be shown at the time we left office. The carrageen was packed in a very attractive manner and it was reaching a market which it had never reached before, both in America and across Channel in Great Britain.  I think it requires some explanation as to why this year we expect a decrease of £3,000 in the sales of carrageen.</P>
    <P>We come to sub-head G 1 which is the sub-head dealing with grants under the Gaeltacht Housing Acts, 1929-31, and we have £45,000 voted as against £80,000 last year.  When speaking on the Estimate last year I pointed out, and it was not contradicted, that the £80,000 was old money, money which as to about 75 per cent. had been already sanctioned and allocated before the Fianna Fáil Government came into power at all.  The fact is that since Fianna Fáil came into office they have not provided one penny piece for housing in the Gaeltacht.  The Acts of 1929 and 1931 provided a total of £350,000 for these services.  This was almost allocated before we left office. As is well known, I urged, on the Estimate last year and in fact on the Estimate the year before, for the introduction of a Bill to make further provision for Gaeltacht housing.  At last, a day or two ago&mdash;last Thursday to be accurate&mdash;a Bill was introduced. We have now seen the Bill and it amazes me why it was held up so long. I was told at various times that the Bill was under consideration, that the parliamentary draftsman was looking it over and I expected to find a Bill with about 40 pages.  The Bill was circulated the day before yesterday.  It <Col N="1204" /> contains four clauses in all, including the title.  It reminds me of the groaning mountain that produced a mouse and was relieved of its labour.  I shall leave what I have to say about the Bill to the debate on the Second Reading to-morrow.</P>
    <P>This service has been starved for the past couple of years.  When I was speaking of it last year, and asking why it was that a further sum was not being made available, in order that an end should be put to the serious hold up there was in the issue of sanctions, the Minister for Finance intervened in the debate, in a debate which was closured, mind you, which everybody knew was going to be closured, and he occupied a large portion of the time of the House in trying to explain away why money was not being provided. His chief reason was this: that during my term of office I had proceeded too quickly, that I had expended the £350,000 too rapidly.  He added some further charge, that I had expended the money with an eye to my political supporters, that there was not a fair service given to all applicants for houses, that there was a selective scheme adopted by which our supporters were given the benefits of the Acts and supporters of the Party opposite were denied them.  The Minister when challenged was not able to substantiate either one charge or the other.  I did not deny the charge of rapidity but on that it would be interesting to quote what Deputies on the other side of the House and what Deputies on the Labour Benches said on the last occasion on which I was responsible for the Estimate.  It is the best answer to the Minister for Finance because the demand from the other side was that there should be more and more rapidity in dealing with the matter.  There was no suggestion at that time from Deputy MacEntee, as he then was, that we should go more slowly.</P>
    <P>The present Minister for Education, then Deputy Derrig, was the Shadow Minister at the time and during all the years, until the Party opposite came into power, he was my opposite number and used to criticise the Estimate.  On the last occasion on which I was in <Col N="1205" /> charge of the Estimate, I had pointed out that there was need for a certain amount of slow procedure because, with the amount of skilled labour available, it took a year or a year and a half to build a house.  Deputy Derrig, as he then was, said at that time, as reported in column 2514 of the Official Debates:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not agree with him that 12 or 18 months are necessary for the building of houses in the Gaeltacht or that the question of skilled labour should be such a problem....  I think, in fact, that the question of skilled labour can be easily settled and that the Minister really cannot put that up as a serious justification for not advancing more rapidly.  He has simply told us that the whole of the £250,000 will have been ear-marked in six months time.  Whether it is ear-marked or not does not matter.  What the House is interested in is the promise of the Minister that the £250,000 will be definitely expended and will definitely represent an asset to the nation in the form of new houses for the people of the Gaeltacht within three years and that the money will be expended within that time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, there was an urge, from the person responsible for criticising the Estimate at the time, to proceed more rapidly.  Deputy Tadhg Murphy from the Labour Benches went on in the same way and he was perfectly satisfied that there was no differentiation between one type of applicant and another.  Deputy Murphy, as reported in column 2520 of the Official Debates, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;What struck me most was that the officials concerned with the administration of the Act took an entirely new road in the way in which they carried out their work. They cut themselves absolutely adrift from the old, irritating routine with which we are all familiar adopted by the departmental inspectors in regard to other work.  I think there was a very earnest desire shown to give effect to the provisions of the Act as speedily as possible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1206" /> He goes on to wish for further and further speed and, if necessary, the provision of more staff.  An interesting contribution also was that of Deputy Proinnsias O Fathaigh as he then was who, as reported in column 2537, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I dtaobh tithe na Gaeltachta, iarraim ar an Aire feuchaint chuige go dtabharfar na deontaisí amach do na hiarrathóirí go luath agus go tapaidh.  Deirtear go bhfuiltear ag caitheamh bliain go leith ar thigh do thógáil fá láthair.  Iarfainn ar an Aire na daoine atá ag obair ar na tithe do bhrostú i dtreo go dtogfar an oiread tithe agus feidir sara dtiocfaidh an geimhreadh orainn arís.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy T.J. O'Connell, who was the then leader of the Labour Party, took up the speech of Deputy O Fathaigh and went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I agree with Deputy Fahy that the Minister's estimate of one and a half years for the building of a house is altogether too great.  It may be that that period would elapse from the making of the application until the house is built.  I complained on a former occasion about the rate at which these houses are being built.  I admit considerable progress has been made, but there are areas which have not yet been touched.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then we had Deputy Tubridy from the Fianna Fáil Benches also urging greater rapidity, all absolutely in contradiction of the argument of the Minister for Finance last year.  It was, of course, ridiculous to say that this money, which had been provided by the Oireachtas, had been spent too quickly, leaving nothing in the purse for the Fianna Fáil Ministry when they came in to make available for the service.  It would only have taken a two-clause Bill to provide further money if there was the will. This delay of two years which has taken place in providing money for Gaeltacht housing will take very considerable explaining away.  It might be said, of course, that the general Housing Act passed a few years ago was available for the Gaeltacht; but <Col N="1207" /> the people in the Gaeltacht preferred the terms of the Gaeltacht Housing Acts.  Facilities were provided under those Acts which are not available under the Acts administered by the Local Government Department.  The people wanted to get sanctions for building and repairing houses under those Acts, and the Department was held up for want of money for two years.</P>
    <P>At last, as I said, we have a Bill making up, to some extent, for lost time.  I hope that when it becomes law the thousands of sanctions that must have been held up for the last two years will be speedily dealt with. I hope those sanctions will be quickly reviewed beforehand, during the progress of the Bill through the Dáil, so that, once the Bill has become law and the money has been made available, there will be no further holding up of those people who have suffered such disappointment for the last couple of years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to suggest to the Government that the time has arrived, in connection with this Gaeltacht service, when they ought to face the facts and run this industry as a business proposition.  Of course nobody would suggest that that parallel should be carried too far and if running it as a company showed it was a few pounds on the wrong side that it should be cut down.  I do not suggest that for one moment, but the nearer that the Government get to the ideal of running this on business lines, the better for the country as a whole.  When one looks at the accounts it appears as if the industry has got too big to be run as a proposition in which grants are made from time to time and the Government are not prepared to face running it on industrial lines.  I would like to suggest that one of the steps the Government ought to take would be to present accounts for an industry such as this in a manner approaching to what would be shown if it were an ordinary industrial concern.  The Minister showed that the sums appearing in the Estimates provided for the year 1933-34 were evidently widely departed from.  That is apparent on the face of things.  I asked him questions this year and last year and I was told that the stock of machinery on the 31st March, 1933, amounted to £5,700.  I do not know what was the precise figure the Minister said was the actual expenditure for the year 1933-34, but if you add £4,000 provided in the Estimate that would bring the amount to £9,700.  The stock of machines on the 31st March, 1934, amounted to £5,549.  That indicates a difference of £4,200.  I did not quite catch the exact sum the Minister said was expended on the purchase of machinery during 1933-34.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I mention that the amount was £611?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>That would bring it to £6,300.  Then apparently £800 has been written off for depreciation.  On what principle are they depreciating <Col N="1210" /> the machinery?  I suppose it would not be quite 20 per cent.  I would like the Minister to deal with that matter when he is replying.  The next thing one notices is the way the sales are given for 1934-35.  The amount is £9,000, and the footnote says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This sum represents the balance of the receipts from sales after the deduction of wages estimated to amount to £11,000 in 1934-35 payable to industrial workers in the Gaeltacht and to certain other expenses in connection with the industry.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to split that £11,000 into wages for the industrial workers in the Gaeltacht and certain other expenses.  I asked a question as to what the stock was on the 31st March, 1933, and I was told it amounted to £23,000.  I asked what the stock was on the 31st March last, and I was told it amounted to £31,375. If one takes the sales as estimated for the year 1934-35, the expectation of sales would apparently amount to £20,000.  That is made up of £9,000 in sales and £11,000 deducted for wages and expenses.  There are to be materials provided during the year amounting to £15,000.  Taking the ordinary industrial analogy, it seems an extraordinary thing that the stock which, at the beginning of the year 1933, amounted to £23,000, at the end of that year, after sales to the extent of £22,000, amounted to £31,375.  The expectation of sales during the coming year is £20,000, so that, apparently, using the ordinary commercial analogy, the Government are carrying 18 months' stock.  They are starting the year with 18 months' stock, judged by their sales.  Is not that an extraordinary position for a concern that is run on business lines?  I should like to suggest to the Minister that he ought to look into the question of how the stock is valued and into its age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter that shows that the Government really are unable to make up their minds as to which course to pursue.  One would imagine that the course they ought to pursue would be to train the workers manually first of all, in the working of machines and so on, and give them some idea as <Col N="1211" /> to what class of goods could be sold in this country.  I would like to suggest to the Government that the best way to find out what class of goods could be sold in this country would be to market them through the ordinary channels.  If they do that, they would at least have to produce what was considered by experts to be saleable in this country, and they would be giving the workers a better chance of appreciating what could be sold by their own production.  Now, what is the position? The position is that the Government have a central depot, and I think they have some retail distributing centres. The Government, to my mind, either ought to make up their minds that they are going to distribute through retail channels themselves and that they are going absolutely to disregard the ordinary trade channels, or they ought to adopt the view that they are teaching workers to produce goods for this market and that the more they teach them what is going to be sold in this country the better for the Government and the better for themselves. I suggest to the Government that the way to do that would be by marketing goods through the ordinary trade channels.</P>
    <P>An examination of these accounts shows that it is not being run on industry lines.  As I have said, imagine a trading concern starting with 18 months of goods in hands.  I think there is a valuable lesson in that if the Government will only learn it.  They ought to try to approximate to industrial standards.  They ought to produce accounts which will show how they are doing.  I do not suggest for a moment that it is necessary that these industries should be run at a profit, but I do suggest to the Government that the more they publish their accounts the better those who are anxious to help them can come in and criticise their accounts and point out to them the defects in their administration and marketing which, I am sure, the Government are only too anxious to realise. I should like to appeal to the Minister to take a broad view of this situation; to regard these industries as approaching that of an industrial concern; and <Col N="1212" /> to try to market the goods through the ordinary trade channels as if they were genuine manufacturers.  I am sure that if the Minister does that he will give the workers in the country a far better idea of what the country needs.  It is no good producing goods that somebody thinks the country ought to use, if they are not going to use them.  In conclusion, I would ask the Minister to give me the details that I have asked for from him in these few remarks I have made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is certainly very refreshing to hear Deputy Dockrell from George's Street dealing with a Vote of this kind and to see the House practically empty, and particularly of the greater number of the Deputies from the Gaeltacht constituencies. Before I pass away from what the Deputy said, it reminds me of a certain thing that happened recently. The Deputy pointed out that the Department carries about 18 months' stock on hands.  While I am not questioning the accuracy of the Deputy's statement, I am wondering if that is true.  If it is true, it casts some light on what I heard recently.  A lady was down at Beggar's Bush where the Depot is, and she saw a number of patterns there.  After looking over those patterns she came to the conclusion that they were all out of date&mdash; that they were the patterns of last year or of the year before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputy Dockrell has done anything in his speech, he has done us a service by drawing our attention to this fact that would go to show that those stocks are carried there until they become useless.  We can go further than that. Take the case of home-made tweeds. Golfers and other people wear those sports tweeds.  Each year they come out in different patterns and in different shades.  Two or three colours will be bought by everybody while these colours are the fashionable shade.  The following year, however, nobody will look at them.  The very same thing applies to pull-overs.  I did not pay a lot of attention to this lady's story at the time, but there is no doubt about it because she is connected with a number of industrial matters and is well acquainted with such things.  I <Col N="1213" /> think it is a terrible commentary on things if stuff is allowed to lie down there for a year or 18 months until those patterns go out of date and the stuff is allowed to become useless.  I think that some steps should be taken to remedy this state of affairs.  There is no hope for any of us&mdash; and of course in this matter we are all united in trying to do something for these people&mdash; if this thing happens, that stock is kept until patterns go out of date and nobody will buy them and then they must be sold as scrap.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's statement there was one part that was tragic news to me.  That was the part where he referred to the kelp industry.  It is really tragic news for very many of my constituents.  There are some communities, complete communities in themselves, in various parts of my constituency who have to live by some effort at fishing.  They do a little bit of salmon fishing in the month of June, and then they do some lobster fishing and some white fishing.  The other part of their income comes solely from kelp.  For the last eight or nine years they had made very considerable sums from it.  I agree with Deputy Lynch that it is very hard to earn money in this way.  There is no portion of our community that pays such a price for extracting a livelihood from nature as those people do.  But if they got a reasonable reward for it, that is all they require.  To learn this evening from the Minister that this entire branch of the Gaeltacht services is closed down will be terribly tragic news to them, and really I do not know what the future is to be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very polite way of saying it.  If the kelp is to be sold and no price offered for it, is not that closing it down?  What is the meaning of that?  Any business for which there is not a market for the <Col N="1214" /> time being is closed down.  I am not blaming the Minister for it, but I say it is terribly tragic news for these people.  What I am thinking about is the future&mdash;what is to become of them. I was looking forward to one colony there that was making enough money out of the kelp industry to rehouse themselves.  But all hopes in that direction fade out now.  The whole thing is thrown back into the melting pot again. All hope of that is wiped out, and there is nothing for them but decay. There was no suggestion from the Minister in dealing with that as to any further use that could be made of kelp. We had some suggestion in this House quite recently, in a debate on some other matters, that considerable use could be made of kelp for animal food. I would appeal to the Minister to do everything in his power to make an opening for this material.  If it is not done these people are going to suffer great hardships.</P>
      <P>In that respect I think it is tragic also that what has been referred to by Deputy Lynch has taken place&mdash;that is, the dividing of the Fisheries from the Gaeltacht Services.  I look upon that as a first class blunder.  They are twin services.  They must stand or fall together.  One Department is dealing with one aspect of these peoples' activities and another Department is dealing with some other aspect of their activities.  I think it is stupid, to put it bluntly, that these two services were divided.  I think this or the next Government must go back and put the two in one Department again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to hear from the Minister that he was considering the formation of some body that would take the control and management of this whole question on itself, something in the nature of what was known as the Congested Districts Board.  I was glad to hear that suggestion, and I hope he will pursue it, and, having pursued it, that he will be convinced.  There is no hope of properly dealing with this question except through some channel of this kind.  It should be left to an independent body outside this House, subject to the Minister.  It should be left to a body that would be independent, capable, and would understand <Col N="1215" /> the question and have adequate funds to deal with any emergency that may arise in these areas.  I think when the Minister approaches this thing more closely and examines it and has this information before him, that he will arrive at that conclusion.  I think that is inevitable.</P>
    <P>With regard to housing, I must say that for the last 12 or 18 months we have been putting down questions in the House seeking information as to when this Bill was to come before the Dáil.  At the time this whole question of rehousing in the Gaeltacht, which is so very urgent, was being considered.  For various reasons that has been substantially held up for the last two years. I have cases here where work has been done since 1931 and the man who did the work has not his money yet sanctioned. I recently had a letter from a man who did repairs to his house in 1931.  That work has not yet been sanctioned, and, of course, he has not been paid.  In the letter he threatened not to pay his rates to the county council until he got his grant.  Of course, he did not see the effect of that.  To him all rates and taxes are the same; he mixes up the county council with the Government and the Government with the county council.  In order to soothe him down I wrote back and told him that the payment of his rates had nothing to do with that, and I mentioned that this Bill would be introduced and that in a short time he would get his money.</P>
    <P>Now, I see by the Bill that a miserable sum is being provided.  I take it that the Minister for Lands will be in charge of this measure when it comes before the House.  I will ask him to stretch his arm, because the sum mentioned is utterly useless for what he undertakes.  This sum will probably do for one and a half years.  Why not make some provision for a larger scheme than that?  We have only touched on the fringe of this question and we are only tinkering with it.  I was asked by the Minister for Finance when I gave some figures here where I got my information.  At the time I did not bother to answer.  I wish to tell the Minister now that I arrived at <Col N="1216" /> my figures from a memorandum I prepared some months ago for my Party. I asked the various dispensary doctors in the Gaeltacht areas to give me the number of houses in their areas that should be condemned, houses that were substantially unfit for human habitation.  If these figures given to me by these doctors are taken, it will be found that it will need approximately £2,000,000 to complete that job. I only mention this matter now to the Minister in order to induce him to approach this question on broader lines.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of kelp, that apparently is hopeless.  With regard to carrageen moss, I regret that the sales are not increasing more rapidly.  The material is well prepared, well packed and well advertised. I wonder is the restriction in the sales due to the fact that animosity has been aroused in England against the sale of the carrageen moss because it is produced here?  At all events, I was so informed and I was wondering was there any ground for that.  If so, it is unfortunate that this animosity should react in this way on the people of the Gaeitacht, more particularly now that the kelp industry has gone out of existence for the moment.</P>
    <P>With regard to home spinning and weaving, I understand that the practice is that the thread is bought from the spinners and sent to the weavers.  They have to weave it.  I quite agree that it was rather difficult to get the additional yarn spun by hand, and it was rather difficult afterwards by any process of treatment to put it into any decent appearance.  But I would suggest, in order to increase the wages and labour in these districts, that we should revert again to the spinning as well as to the weaving in these areas. The spinning gives a very large amount of employment.  There is the carding, the oiling and that sort of thing which give a great amount of work to the women of the house.  The men do the weaving and the women spin the wool into yarn.  Hence you have increased labour in the household, arising from the double occupation.  As a result of purchasing this yarn from the spinners the amount of what has been done in <Col N="1217" /> the house is greatly restricted.  Hence the amount of money spent in the area is greatly restricted.  I would like if the spinning as well as the weaving could be done so as to get as much of the money as we could out of this industry for the people of the district. But over and above this it is useless to do these things unless first there is clearness in the patterns, and secondly, that the designer will give good designs; that the type of design will be kept up to world designs, and that the designs required for each year will be forthcoming.  I would ask the Minister to be drastic in this matter. I take it that the person concerned is an official paid by the Government, and if he is not the man to do his job and to produce the very best and most up-to-date designs, cashier him immediately. Design is a condition precedent to success in this matter.  It is all right to talk of what happened when Fianna Fáil were in opposition, but I am not concerned with what happened in the past.  There is no time for me but to-day and to-morrow.  These people are concerned for their actual existence, and what I am anxious about is that the Minister will bring all his energy, vision and courage to bear on this matter, and that he will attend to the remaining branches of the industry. Apparently, now, those are confined to weaving and spinning.  For the last two years there have been undertakings given in this House to deal with two factories, one at Crolly and one at Annagry.  This matter was Deputy Dillon's particular baby, and I never interfered.  As he is not here to-day, I should like to know what happened to them.  Has anything been done there, and if anything has been done, how is it progressing?  I am utterly ignorant of the details; Deputy Dillon raised the matter in this House, and I consider that I have nothing to do with it. It was his particular concern, but I should like to know what happened in those places.</P>
    <P>I was also asked to mention the spinning industry, and to urge, if it could be done at all, that the people in the Gaeltacht areas should be given an opportunity again with regard to it.  I gave no <Col N="1218" /> promise whatever, because I had some doubts about their efficiency and about their capacity to produce yarn that would produce tweeds to meet present-day requirements.  Very likely there will be some trouble with regard to kelp, and some explanation will have to be given about it.  I should like to urge with regard to any kelp in the hands of burners at present, that his Department had better take it from them even at a price.  I quite appreciate the difficulty in regard to buying kelp and storing it when there is no market.  It is very unfortunate that there is no market for the kelp when these people have gone to the trouble of extracting the kelp from the sea, in the wildest winter weather, saving it and burning it, on the assumption that there would be a market for it.  They now find that there is no market at all.  Very likely these people incurred debts in the winter in providing clothes and boots for their children, and they find now that they have no money to pay for these goods, and I should like to know from the Minister whether or not he is going to purchase any more of this kelp.</P>

    <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to a very serious defect in the Gaeltacht Housing Act.  It is the necessity there is to get a certificate  <Col N="1219" /> from the Land Commission that an applicant's land will not be subject to rearrangement.  If he cannot get that certificate, he cannot get sanction or permission to build, and the result is that there are numbers of people held up who cannot avail themselves of the grant under the scheme as it is at present in force, and who are consequently forced to live in the bad houses they have at present.  I think that short of a scheme of migration that clause should be altered in the new Bill now being brought in, or that it should not be enforced too rigidly. The Land Commission is not speeding up the matter of rearrangement. Migration is a much larger problem and possibly will not take shape for a long time, and the people are in a cleft stick as a result, and cannot avail themselves of the grant.  I would ask the Minister to take serious notice of that in the Bill he is bringing in.  There are two ways of meeting the situation; one is to abolish the clause altogether, and the other to see that the Land Commission carries out the undertaking which they so often give in the letters they send to Deputies who have made inquiries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to call attention to this Vote in a general way.  I am not familiar at all with the details of the sub-heads, and I never was, but there are two or three big general points that start out from the Vote which should be attended to.  The Vote itself which we are discussing on the motion to refer back which is actually before the House divides itself into certain sums in relation to housing&mdash;and these I want to leave entirely out of my argument at the moment&mdash;and certain sums in relation to staff&mdash;and in regard to these again, if there is any work being done, there has to be a staff and they have to be paid and certain expenses are involved in the ordinary overheads of the business. There are then two other subsections or divisions of the Vote.  One is that section which has the heading &ldquo;Industrial Development&mdash;Rural Industries&rdquo; and as a second sub-head, &ldquo;Marine Products Industries.&rdquo; There <Col N="1220" /> is also a &ldquo;Central Marketing Depot&rdquo;, and there is a small sub-head for &ldquo;Loans for Industrial Purposes.&rdquo;  I am leaving out the &ldquo;Minor Schemes&rdquo; for the moment.  Let us concentrate on this matter of ameliorating conditions in the Gaeltacht through business, through the force of industrial development, or rather through industrial development which is fostered and favoured by Government help.  What is the actual situation, as revealed by the Estimate, and, in particular, how far does the situation, as revealed, indicate that there is any special hope of a successful result from this fostering and favouring that is going on? Some of it is very difficult to understand, as Deputy Dockrell has pointed out.  Dealing first with the rural industries side of the industrial development of the Gaeltacht, so far as the Estimate is concerned, it conveys this message to Deputies; that a sum of £22,000 had been allocated for the purchase of materials; that that sum this year has been reduced to £1,500; that a sum of £4,000 last year had been allocated for machines and plant, and that has been reduced to £1,000.  There is a considerable difference, it must be recognised, between the Estimate provided and the money spent.  I understand it is part of the explanation, that of this £4,000 for machines and plant something much less than £1,000 was actually put in, and that the £1,000 as an Estimate this year is in fact an increase on that expenditure of the year before.  To some extent apparently that applies also in relation to the materials, but that has got to be joined up with the figures at the end.  Sub-head K, Appropriations-in-Aid, on the last page of this Vote, shows that in 1933-4 the sum of £22,000 was the estimated receipt from the sale of products, and that the sales this year are estimated to bring in £9,000.  By an asterisk there is a small print reference to the latter sum: &ldquo;This sum represents the balance of the receipts from sales after deduction of wages, estimated to amount to £11,000 in 1934-5, payable to industrial workers in the Gaeltacht, and of certain other expenses in connection with the industries.&rdquo;  Those <Col N="1221" /> things are confused as between estimate and actuality.</P>
      <P>Again, it is a peculiar thing, and possibly something more than a mere coincidence, that if you take this £9,000 and £11,000 the £20,000 sum represents very nearly another sum of £22,000, which is set down here.  Is it a fact that these Estimates are rather blindly made, and that in fact what happens is that the moneys spent on materials are enlarged out to the maximum of what is the estimate, and reduced very much below it, according as to whether or not the sales are good in a particular year?  That would appear to be one business way of looking at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an amazing thing which Deputy Dockrell referred to, and which he brought out here by means of questions; coming into the year which has just passed, that is, at the end of March, 1933, there was £23,000 worth of stock on hands.  At the end of March, 1934, there is £31,000 worth of stock on hands.  The Department starts off with materials which include finished goods to the extent of £23,000, and they end up the year with stock to the extent of £31,000.  In that year, if one is to believe the Estimate, there was added to the £23,000 worth of stock, with which the Department came into the year, a sum of £22,000 to be spent on materials.  It obviously was not spent.  How much there was spent we have still to hear accurately. Supposing there was only £5,000 spent; you have £23,000 worth of stock on hands coming in, £5,000 spent on materials, with added value when they are worked up, so that the finished goods would be worth something higher than that, and we arrive at the £31,000 at the end of the year.  The receipts from sales in that year were supposed to be £22,000.  Is this all nonsense, or was there any sale of Gaeltacht products at all?  Was there anything more done than materials being bought and wages being paid to certain workers in the Gaeltacht to make up goods to put into stock, and let them&mdash;as Deputy McMenamin has said recently&mdash;get out of date?  If that is the position we will be faced one of these days with a sale at very much under the value not merely of the <Col N="1222" /> finished goods but possibly even of the material that was bought to start making those goods.  What is the likelihood of success in all this?  No ordinary business man could keep going at that rate.  No ordinary business man finding he had, after a certain number of years, as much as £23,000 worth of goods on his shelves, would ever put before, say, a general meeting of his company that he expected to spend £22,000 more in that year on materials to work up into finished articles.  He would not hope to live through another general meeting if he presented himself at the end of the year and said he had now £31,000 worth of goods on hands.</P>
    <P>That leads on to the further question as to what is the policy with regard to those rural industries.  I had always thought that the idea which, at one time, energised those who were working this Department, and an idea that had to be commended, was that it was foolish to attempt through the Gaeltacht to produce goods of an ordinary type that had to be sold in competition with mass production goods anywhere; that the only thing one could expect success from in working the Gaeltacht services was concentration on something that amounted either to luxury articles or articles which had something about them of specialised work, something that made them a bit unique and apart from what one would ordinarily buy in a shop as the product of a factory working under mass production conditions.  That was a good idea.  It was clearly a better idea to try to get the Gaeltacht workers to put artistry and design and everything that appertains to the skilled fingers of the skilled workman into a certain article, to be sold at a high price, than to have those people turning to merely machine products intended to sell in competition with the ordinary shop goods.</P>
    <P>That good idea, of course, might break down on one or two points.  The design might be bad.  The artistry and skill might not be there or might not be introduced soon enough.  There might be, at the beginning, too many trial and experimental designs and products, and it seems as if that has <Col N="1223" /> been the case.  Otherwise, how is one to account for this stock at the end of the period?  After all, we are not dealing with very big business.  There is not a whole lot of money in it.  I do not know if the Minister could give us an idea of the wages fund that has been created through the application of Government moneys and help in the Gaeltacht areas all round.  Certainly, coming back again to this relatively enormous stock on hands at the end of the year, seeing it increasing, and having the testimony of people whose constituents are around those areas that the goods are out of date, it does seem as if there had been a mixture of two ideas, namely, home produce of fashionable goods with the fashion changing and goods being left rather as job lots on the shelves; with possibly the other idea working concurrently with that&mdash;the idea of trying to produce a rather unique type of article, something that had skill, artistry and design about it, and that that has failed also for some other reason.</P>
    <P>Of course the business cannot go on if all that is happening is that the goods are being made, that some wages fund has been created, and that stock is being piled up.  If there is no outlet, and if the sales side is not being looked after as well as the production side, in the end there is going to be a considerable loss on the whole business.  That loss, of course, in the promotion years of any business might be overlooked if there were a secure prospect of success eventually.  It would be a different situation if the Minister were going to tell us that those were merely a sort of apprentice efforts on the part of certain people in particular areas, that skill was coming, that there was some better organisation in relation to sales, and that eventually, although some of the stocks might be left over, there was not going to be a recurrence of the piling up of those goods.  That would be another situation, but so far we have not heard that that is the position.</P>
    <P>The marine products side, to which attention has also been called, seems to have suffered and suffered badly.  In regard to carrageen development, if we <Col N="1224" /> are to judge purely by the Estimates, the hopes of sales resulting from it are poor this year&mdash;only half as good as they were before.  Again, that may be a completely wrong judgement, because it may be that that £11,000 was merely an Estimate, that there is no reality about it, and that that £5,350 is the reality.  I heard the explanation of this is that the Department previously provided an amount of money that they thought would be required in connection with carrageen development, that this year judging by last year's result they lowered the sum to £5,000, but that there would be an increase again, to the old figure, if there was stuff there to buy.  Is there any explanation why the hopes of last year were falsified, and of how they realised that the figure should be cut down by 50 per cent?  Is there anything to fortify their mind that while this year we have to provide an Estimate which is £5,000 reduced, an increase may be required later?  What was it that entered into the Estimate last year that made it up to £11,000, and that has it down so low this year?  Why is it that the mind of the Department no longer lingered upon the high figure and made them come to the opinion that the sum must be reduced by half?</P>
    <P>There is a different story with regard to kelp and while it must be admitted that the reason given is the only one that completely justifies the reduced estimate, and that it is no fault of the Department, it is useful, on this point, to remark that previously those who are now seeing the falsification of their hopes by this reduced amount, used to argue that foreign production need not be taken into account on this matter, and that if arrangements with certain groups in certain zones could be made &mdash;and it was asserted that they could be made&mdash;there would be no necessity to have the prices beaten down.  But it does appear in the direction that Chilian production has sent the price to a point that does not allow an economic production in this country. Why should there be hesitation to embark, in relation to iodine, on the bounty scheme embarked upon, so eagerly, in regard to everything else? I do not know that there is any big <Col N="1225" /> differentiation in price, as to the price at which it would be possible to sell iodine from here in France and Great Britain, compared with the world prices, and the prices at which we can grow wheat in comparison with the price at which we could import it.  If it is useful to subsidise, from payment derived from the taxpayers, the growth of wheat in this country, and if it is decided to make Britain eat our butter cheaply and at a price less than we pay for it here, in order to keep production up to a certain point in this country, why not in the case of iodine? If we decide, in relation to markets that we profess to believe are gone, but that we nevertheless subsidise in order to get there then, in relation to a small product like iodine which is important in the Gaeltacht, why should it not be subsidised as well as other products that are fed and subsidised by bounties when such an export as iodine would enable us to make the harvest in kelp an economic proposition in this country.  It is difficult to see why economic doctrines are changed, in relation to these subject matters.</P>
    <P>We have, at any rate, this gloomy picture presented to us by the Estimates for kelp, especially those of 1933-34, that the sum of £30,300 granted last year has suffered a decrease of £17,445.  I would like to know if there is anything more in this?  I ask if the statement with regard to the Chilian product is the sole and all-sufficient reason for what has happened here.  Is there anything else operating against the sale of any product produced from kelp?  Is there anything else in the way other than the low price, especially because of the operation of the Chilian group working in certain zones?  Again I would like an explanation as to why, on the plan the Government used, they cannot put into operation a plan by which a particular product can be put on the market at a low price so that people are able to continue to supply it at a low price.</P>
    <P>The Central Marketing depot keeps its position, as before, but loans for industrial purposes have gone down this year from a sum of £1,700 to a sum of £210.  In the case of loans for industrial <Col N="1226" /> purposes, so far as there is evidence of the types mentioned in the earlier parts, they have gone down by nearly £1,500, as though all industrial purposes for which loans used to be given are satisfied.  Have all offers to start enterprise with the provision of money on loan dried up?  The whole matter in relation to capital seems to be based on what occurred in the case of the Chilian group.  As to what has happened in connection with carrageen that is not explained.  But as far as these two things are concerned apparently there is no great hope for the Gaeltacht area.  With regard to industrial development, and rural industries proper, all we can discover is that while there is certain material, and while certain machinery is kept going, and certain sales are being estimated for, all that we have real evidence of is that stocks are being piled up.  It is quite right to keep a central marketing depot in full force as long as there is work to be done, and goods to be cleared.  Something may be accomplished by means of salesmanship if that is properly directed, and no one could object to this money being expended. But the question of the advisability of spending this money turns on the fact of whether what is being produced is being sold.  There is no very bright record of that.  I am not at all imputing blame to those in the Marketing depot for that.  It may be that the things produced are such that nobody can get them away.  There is another side to all this.  We are told with great vehemence that there was more money in the country last year than before and we are told that there is more than ever this year.  There was a promise of sums in advance of anything that was spent last year.  That presumes that there is so much purchasing power in the community.  If there is such a desire to aid home development, if there is any such sentimental affection for the Gaeltacht and if that has percolated, as we are told it has, up to Dublin even and shows itself in the buying of products manufactured in the Gaeltacht, how does it come that in spite of all that, in spite of the fact that there is a Marketing depot&mdash;I understand that a very skilled, <Col N="1227" /> efficient body of people are operating there&mdash;that we get back again to the figures, which are the bedrock of all this matter, that were brought out by Deputy Dockrell's question, and that the stocks instead of being reduced are going up?  I do not know how far the statement made by Deputy McMenamin with regard to particular products applies to the whole range.  Was the Deputy's statement typical of the lot: that it had been observed by those whom he described as being interested in the matter in Donegal that these articles were out of date?  Does that apply all round?  If the Deputy's statement has application not merely to Donegal but to other parts of the country, then I would like to know if anything is being done in the way of having an examination of the products, of the methods of working, the materials that are being purchased, the machines and those at them, to see whether a change is required and how far that change is going to be effected by methods of working and of sales through the medium of the Department.</P>
    <P>There are smaller matters that one might refer to.  Any one of them, taken by itself, would not be of any great substance, but I presume the decrease in production is caused by decreased sales.  Everything shows a downward tendency.  The travelling expenses and subsistence allowances for instructors and manageresses are down to a point half what it was last year, The sum for purchase of looms, knitting machines, equipment, etc., for industrial centres is down from £4,000 to £1,000.  The item for purchase of wool, yarn and other material for industrial centres, including cost of finishing&mdash;I take it that yarn would be the big item on the main Estimate that I have already spoken to&mdash;is down from <Col N="1228" /> £22,000 to £15,000.  Then, as regards exhibitions of Gaeltacht products at shows and fairs&mdash;the cost of exhibits at shows and fairs, including displays by commercial houses and leaving out the specialised item of the exhibition at Cork which had to be paid for in 1933 &mdash;the relatively small amount of £400 is cut down by £150, the provision for this year being £250.  The cost of advertising and publicity in connection with Gaeltacht products has been cut down from £2,000 to £1,500.  The amount spent on any one of these items would not have any very great effect on the mind of anybody when read alone, but when they are all taken together what clearly emerges from this Vote is that the Department has come to the conclusion that, so far as rural industry is concerned, the hopes are less and less, and that in so far as people had any belief that the Gaeltacht was going to become industrialised in the home-working sense and was going to be something brought in to aid these people with the rather insufficient incomes they are enabled to make from land or sea, that that belief is disappearing, and that the whole thing has a downward tendency.  Deputies should remember this.  We are not told that this situation up in the Gaeltacht is affected at all by the reactions of the Chilian business.  This has reference only to the ordinary goods peculiar to this country.  The position is much worse if one analyses it as Deputy Dockrell did.</P>
